In response, Garcia came up with \"Grateful Dead\" by opening a [[Funk & Wagnalls]] dictionary to an entry for \"[[Grateful dead (folklore)|Grateful dead]]\".<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/><ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> The definition for \"Grateful dead\" was \"a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial\".<ref>Stories about the \"Grateful Dead\" appear in many cultures.</ref> The band's first reaction was disapproval.<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia later explained the group's reaction: \"I didn't like it really, I just found it to be really powerful. [Bob] Weir didn't like it, [Bill] Kreutzmann didn't like it and nobody really wanted to hear about it.\"<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/> Despite their dislike of the name, it quickly spread by word of mouth, and soon became their official title.\n\n===Career with the Grateful Dead===\n[[File:Jerry Garcia 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jerry Garcia in 1969]]\nGarcia served as lead guitarist, as well as one of the principal vocalists and songwriters of the Grateful Dead for its entire career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/hole-notes-acoustic-stylings-late-jerry-garcia|title=The Acoustic Stylings of the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia|work=Guitar World|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-us}}</ref> Garcia composed such songs as \"[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]\",<ref name=\"agdl\">{{cite web|url=http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/agdl/|title=The Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics|accessdate=July 12, 2007|year=2007|author=Dodd, David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404063019/http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/|archive-date=April 4, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Franklin's Tower\",<ref name=\"agdl\"/> and \"[[Scarlet Begonias]]\",<ref name=\"agdl\"/> among many others.

His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/> Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that \"there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [Lesh's] innovative bass playing.

I still basically revolve around the melody and the way it's broken up into phrases as I perceive them.

Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to Garcia's drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/>\n\n[[File:Jerry-Mickey at Red Rocks taken 08-11-87.jpg|thumb|left|Garcia and Mickey Hart in 1987 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] \nGarcia's guitar-playing was eclectic. He melded elements from the various kinds of music that influenced him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/21259-electric-etudes-jerry-garcia|title=Electric Etudes: Jerry Garcia|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> Echoes of bluegrass playing (such as [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith|Arthur Smith]] and [[Doc Watson]]) could be heard. There was also early [[Rock and roll#Early North American rock and roll (1953-1963)|rock]] (like [[Lonnie Mack]], [[James Burton]], and Chuck Berry), contemporary [[Blues#History of modern blues|blues]] ([[Freddie King]] and [[Lowell Fulsom]]), [[country music|country and western]] ([[Roy Nichols]] and [[Don Rich]]), and [[jazz]] ([[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]) to be heard in Garcia's style. Don Rich was the sparkling country guitar player in [[Buck Owens]]'s \"[[the Buckaroos]]\" band of the 1960s, but besides Rich's style, both Garcia's [[pedal steel guitar]] playing (on Grateful Dead records and others) and his standard electric guitar work, were influenced by another of Owens's Buckaroos of that time, pedal steel player [[Tom Brumley]]. And as an improvisational soloist, John Coltrane was one of his greatest personal and musical influences.\n\nGarcia later described his playing style as having \"descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just 'cause that's where all my stuff comes from. It's like that blues instrumental stuff that was happening in the late Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King.\" Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called \"signatures\".  Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs \"Good Morning Little School Girl\", \"New Speedway Boogie\", \"Brokedown Palace\", \"Deal\", \"Loser\", \"[[Truckin']]\", \"That's It for the Other One\", \"U.S. Blues\", \"[[Sugaree]]\", and \"Don't Ease Me In\").\n\n===Side projects===\nIn addition to the Grateful Dead, Garcia had numerous side projects, the most notable being the [[Jerry Garcia Band]]. He was also involved with various acoustic projects such as [[Old & In the Way]] and other bluegrass bands, including collaborations with noted bluegrass mandolinist [[David Grisman]]. The documentary film ''[[Grateful Dawg]]'', co-produced by Gillian Grisman and former NBC producer Pamela Hamilton chronicles the deep, long-term friendship between Garcia and Grisman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265212|title=Grateful Dawg (2000)|author=Ali_Catterall|date=July 4, 2002|work=IMDb}}</ref> When Garcia and Grisman released Not For Kids Only, Hamilton produced their interview and concert for NBC. After several years of producing stories on the Grateful Dead and band members' side projects, Hamilton interviewed Bob Weir for a feature on Garcia's death marking the end of an era. \n\nOther groups of which Garcia was a member at one time or another include the Black Mountain Boys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |title=Black Mountain Boys |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022052842/http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |archivedate=October 22, 1999 }} photo at eyecandypromo.com.

Garcia was also a fan of jazz artists and [[Jazz#Improvisation|improvisation]]: he played with jazz keyboardists [[Merl Saunders]] and [[Howard Wales]] for many years in various groups and jam sessions, and he appeared on saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]]'s 1988 album, ''[[Primetime (musical ensemble)|Virgin Beauty]]''. His collaboration with Merl Saunders and [[Muruga Booker]] on the world music album ''Blues From the Rainforest'' launched the [[Rainforest Band]].\n\nGarcia also spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums, the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia's help included the likes of [[Jefferson Airplane]] (most notably ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'', Garcia being listed as their \"spiritual advisor\"). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he'd played the high lead on \"Today,\" played on \"Plastic Fantastic Lover\" and \"Comin' Back to Me\" on that album. Others include [[Tom Fogerty]], [[David Bromberg]], Robert Hunter (''Liberty'', on Relix Records), [[Paul Pena]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[Pete Sears]], [[Ken Nordine]], Ornette Coleman, [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[It's a Beautiful Day]], and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD ''[[Blue Incantation]]'' by guitarist [[Sanjay Mishra (musician)|Sanjay Mishra]], making it his last studio collaboration.\n\nThroughout the early 1970s, Garcia, Lesh, Grateful Dead drummer [[Mickey Hart]], and [[David Crosby]] collaborated intermittently with [[MIT]]-educated composer and biologist [[Ned Lagin]] on several projects in the realm of early [[ambient music]]; these include the album ''[[Seastones]]'' (released by the Ned Lagin on the [[Grateful Dead Records|Round Records]] subsidiary) and ''L'', an unfinished dance work composed by Ned Lagin. In 1970, Garcia participated in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.\n\nGarcia also played pedal steel guitar for fellow-San Francisco musicians [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]] from their initial dates in 1969 to October 1971, when increased commitments with the Dead forced him to opt out of the group. He appears as a band member on their debut album ''[[New Riders of the Purple Sage (album)|New Riders of the Purple Sage]]'', and produced ''Home, Home on the Road'', a 1974 live album by the band. He also contributed pedal steel guitar to the enduring hit \"Teach Your Children\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]]. Garcia also played steel guitar licks on [[Brewer & Shipley]]'s 1970 album ''[[Tarkio (album)|Tarkio]]''. Despite considering himself a novice on the pedal steel, Garcia routinely ranked high in player polls. After a long lapse from playing the pedal steel, he played it once more during several of the Dead's concerts with Bob Dylan in the summer of 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Garcia agreed to perform at several major benefits including the \"Soviet American Peace Walk\" concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, Pete Sears, who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, Mickey Hart and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a Grateful Dead show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with [[Nick Gravenites]] and Pete Sears at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist [[Brian Willson]], who lost both legs below the knee when he attempted to block a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador.\n\nHaving previously studied at the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career in the visual arts in the late 1980s. He created a number of drawings, [[etchings]], and [[water colors]]. Garcia's artistic endeavors were represented by the Weir Gallery<ref>{{harvnb|Higashi|2005|pp=176-177}}</ref> in [[Berkeley, California]] from 1989 to 1996. During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate Bob Weir) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on.<ref>S.F.Chronicle, December 9, 1992</ref> These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of [[digital art]] media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia.<ref name=\"garciaweirgallery.com\">{{cite web| title=Art of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Roberta Weir| url=http://www.garciaweirgallery.com/| publisher=Weir Gallery| accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref> Perhaps the most widely seen pieces of Jerry Garcia's art are the many editions of men's neckties produced by Stonehenge Ltd. Some began as etchings, other designs came from his drawings, paintings, and digital art. Years after Garcia's death, his estate granted the license to Mulberry Street which resulted in a lawsuit and settlement with the original manufacturer, and new styles and designs continue to be produced and sold.\n\n==Personal life==\nGarcia met his first wife, Sara Ruppenthal Garcia, in 1963.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> She was working at the coffee house in the back of Kepler's Books, where Garcia, Hunter, and Nelson regularly performed.

She died on September 28, 1970.\n\nIn the midst of a March 1973 Grateful Dead engagement at the [[Nassau Coliseum]] near New York City, Garcia met Deborah Koons, an aspiring filmmaker from a wealthy [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]-based family who would much later marry him and become his widow.<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|2000|p=259}}</ref><ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> After a brief correspondence, he began his relationship with her in mid-1974; this gradually strained his relationship with Adams and culminated in Garcia leaving Adams for Koons in late 1975. The end of his relationship with Koons in 1977 precipitated a brief reconciliation with Adams, including the reestablishment of their household; however, she did not agree with the guitarist's persistent use of narcotics and moved with the children to the [[Eugene, Oregon]] area (near Kesey) in 1978. Garcia had an affair with Amy Moore (a [[Kentucky]]-born member of the extended \"Grateful Dead family\" and the mistress of Texas oil heir Roy Cullen) circa 1980\u20131981, and their brief liaison inspired the Garcia-Hunter song \"Run for the Roses.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://insiderlouisville.com/lifestyle_culture/grateful-dead-manager-rock-scullys-louisville-years/ | title=Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully's Louisville years | first=David | last=Serchuk | work=Insider Louisville | date=December 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdams and Garcia were married (largely as a result of mutual tax exigencies) on December 31, 1981.

Approximately fifteen people were arrested on the spot, including many of the road crew, management, and nearly all of the Grateful Dead except for Garcia, who arrived later, outgoing keyboardist [[Tom Constanten]], who abstained from all drugs as a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], and McKernan, who eschewed illegal drugs in favor of alcohol.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAccording to Bill Kreutzmann, the band's use of [[cocaine]] accelerated throughout the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkavBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22cocaine%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNhMfr9IbPAhWB6iYKHbpCDWEQ6AEIPzAG#v=snippet&q=%22cocaine%22&f=false | title=Deal: My Three Decades of Drumming, Dreams, and Drugs with the Grateful Dead | first1=Bill | last1=Kreutzmann | first2=Benjy | last2=Eisen | date=2015 | publisher=Macmillan | accessdate=May 5, 2017 | via=Google Books}}</ref> After experimenting with heroin in a brothel in 1974 (likely on the band's second European tour), Garcia was introduced to a smokeable form of the drug (initially advertised as refined [[opium]]) colloquially known as \"Persian\" or \"Persian Base\" during the group's 1975 hiatus. Influenced by the stresses of creating and releasing ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' and the acrimonious collapse of the band's independent record labels over the next two years, Garcia became increasingly dependent upon both substances. These factors, combined with the alcohol and drug abuse of several other members of the Grateful Dead, resulted in a turbulent atmosphere. By 1978, the band's chemistry began \"cracking and crumbling\",<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> resulting in poor group cohesion. As a result, Keith and [[Donna Jean Godchaux]] left the band in February 1979.\n\nWith the addition of keyboardist/vocalist [[Brent Mydland]] that year amid the ongoing coalescence of the [[Deadhead]] subculture, the band reached new commercial heights as a touring group on the American arena circuit in the early 1980s, enabling them to forsake studio recording for several years. Nevertheless, this was offset by such factors as the band's atypically large payroll and Garcia's $700-a-day ({{Inflation|US|700|1982|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) drug addiction, resulting in the guitarist taking on a frenetic slate of solo touring outside of the Grateful Dead's rigorous schedule, including acoustic duo concerts with longtime Jerry Garcia Band bassist [[John Kahn]] that seldom extended beyond an hour and a half and were widely rumored to be a funding conduit for their respective addictions.\n\nThough things seemed to be getting better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's demeanor onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called \"endless tour\"\u2014the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions\u2014had taken its toll.\n\nGarcia's decade-long heroin addiction culminated in the rest of the band holding an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in January 1985.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Given the choice between the band or the drugs, Garcia agreed to check into a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California. A few days later in January, before the start of his program in Oakland, Garcia was arrested for [[drug possession]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]; he subsequently attended a drug diversion program. Throughout 1985, he tapered his drug use on tour and at home with the assistance of Nora Sage; by the spring of 1986, he was completely abstinent.\n\nPrecipitated by an unhealthy weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, and a recent relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/><ref name=\"jerrynews\"/> He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: \"Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of [[protoplasm]] that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off.\"<ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia's coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAfter Garcia's recovery, the band released a comeback album ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in 1987, which became their best-selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia's improved health, a successful album and the continuing emergence of Mydland as a third frontman, the band's energy and chemistry reached a new peak in the late 1980s.\n\nMydland died of a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]] overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists [[Vince Welnick]] and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's performances drove Garcia to new heights on stage. However, as the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a [[methadone]] clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAfter returning from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Manasha Garcia nursed Jerry back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included [[Acupuncture|acupuncturist]] Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, a licensed holistic doctor to treat him at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate.<ref>{{cite book | title=Aces Back to Back: The History of the Grateful Dead (1965\u20132013) | first=Scott W. | last=Allen | date=2014 | publisher=Outskirts Press, Inc. | isbn=978-1-4787-1943-4 | page=135}}</ref> Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight.

In March and April 1971 \u2013 the time period during which the Grateful Dead recorded its second live album, [[Grateful Dead (album)|''Grateful Dead'']] \u2013 Garcia played the \"Peanut,\" a guitar he had received from Rick Turner, who had custom built the guitar's body and incorporated the neck, pickups, and hardware from an early 60's Les Paul.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rickturnerblog.com/2017/12/05/garcias-turner-peanut-guitar/ |title=Garcia's Turner \"Peanut Guitar\" |last=Turner |first=Rick |date=December 17, 2017 |website=rickturnerblog.com |publisher= |access-date=August 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> In May, Garcia began using a 1957 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by [[Graham Nash]].

Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> It cost $1,500 ({{inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}), an extremely high price for the era.<ref name=\"wolf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/wolf/wolf.htm|title=The Wolf guitar|accessdate=July 17, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref>\n\nWolf was made with an [[ebony]] [[fingerboard]] and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the [[headstock]], [[ivory]] inlays, and fret marker dots made of [[sterling silver]]. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of [[purpleheart]]. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly [[single coil]]s, while the other accommodated [[humbucker]]s. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: \"Don't hold back.\"<ref name=\"wolf\"/>\n\nDuring the Grateful Dead's [[Dick's Picks Volume 7|1974 European tour]], Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock. Following filming of ''The Grateful Dead Movie'' (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several [[Travis Bean]] guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia.<ref name=\"wolf\"/> The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would \"see\" the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin).{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}}\n\nNearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar ([[Tiger (guitar)|Tiger]]) from Irwin in the summer of 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105051821/http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|url-status=dead|title=Garcia Guitar Directory - Tiger - Irwin|date=January 5, 2013|archivedate=January 5, 2013|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref> He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the [[Oakland Auditorium Arena]] on August 4, 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\"/> Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover.<ref name=\"tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/tiger/info.html|title=The Tiger guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was [[cocobolo]], with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and [[flame maple]], in that order.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil [[DiMarzio]] SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups every year or two.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate in the back of the guitar. Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed {{convert|13+1/2|lb|kg}}. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.\n\nIn the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars.  There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus Graphite neck.  He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the \"tree of life\" model. This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese [[luthier]] Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael.  As with most things Garcia, with his passing, the DY99 model is highly valued among collectors.\n\nIn 1990, Irwin completed Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar.<ref name=\"rosebud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=The Rosebud guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> It was similar to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording ''[[Without a Net]]''.<ref name=\"rosebud\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=Rosebud by Doug Irwin|publisher=}}</ref> Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to {{convert|11+1/2|lbs|kg}}. The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a [[rose]], covers a plate just below the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]]. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000 ({{inflation|US|11000|1990|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"rosebud\"/>\n\nIn 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe tried his hand at making an instrument for Garcia.<ref name=\"guithis\"/> After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay.<ref name=\"lightbolt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitar/Bolt.html|title=The Lightning Bolt guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, had been taken from a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to \"wing it.\"<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/>\n\nCripe later delivered the backup, which was known by the name Top Hat. Garcia bought it from him for $6,500, making it the first guitar that Cripe had ever sold.<ref name=\"lightbolt\"/> However, infatuated with Lightning Bolt, Garcia rarely used the backup.\n\nAfter Garcia's death, the ownership of his Wolf and Tiger came into question.

Around this time, the psychedelic drug [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: \"Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because I suddenly realized that my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn't going to work out. Luckily I wasn't far enough into it for it to be shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved.\"<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/>\n\nIn 1965, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions evolved into the Warlocks, with the addition of Phil Lesh on bass guitar and [[Bill Kreutzmann]] on [[Drum kit|percussion]]. However, the band discovered that another group (which would later become the [[Velvet Underground]]) had recently selected the same name. In response, Garcia came up with \"Grateful Dead\" by opening a [[Funk & Wagnalls]] dictionary to an entry for \"[[Grateful dead (folklore)|Grateful dead]]\".<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/><ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> The definition for \"Grateful dead\" was \"a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial\".<ref>Stories about the \"Grateful Dead\" appear in many cultures.</ref> The band's first reaction was disapproval.<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/><ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia later explained the group's reaction: \"I didn't like it really, I just found it to be really powerful. [Bob] Weir didn't like it, [Bill] Kreutzmann didn't like it and nobody really wanted to hear about it.\"<ref name=\"jginterview1972\"/> Despite their dislike of the name, it quickly spread by word of mouth, and soon became their official title.\n\n===Career with the Grateful Dead===\n[[File:Jerry Garcia 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jerry Garcia in 1969]]\nGarcia served as lead guitarist, as well as one of the principal vocalists and songwriters of the Grateful Dead for its entire career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/hole-notes-acoustic-stylings-late-jerry-garcia|title=The Acoustic Stylings of the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia|work=Guitar World|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-us}}</ref> Garcia composed such songs as \"[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]\",<ref name=\"agdl\">{{cite web|url=http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/agdl/|title=The Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics|accessdate=July 12, 2007|year=2007|author=Dodd, David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404063019/http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/|archive-date=April 4, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Franklin's Tower\",<ref name=\"agdl\"/> and \"[[Scarlet Begonias]]\",<ref name=\"agdl\"/> among many others.

His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/> Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that \"there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [Lesh's] innovative bass playing. Weir's ability to solve that sort of problem is extraordinary.

I still basically revolve around the melody and the way it's broken up into phrases as I perceive them. With most solos, I tend to play something that phrases the way the melody does; my phrases may be more dense or have different value, but they'll occur in the same places in the song.

Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to Garcia's drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/>\n\n[[File:Jerry-Mickey at Red Rocks taken 08-11-87.jpg|thumb|left|Garcia and Mickey Hart in 1987 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] \nGarcia's guitar-playing was eclectic. He melded elements from the various kinds of music that influenced him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/21259-electric-etudes-jerry-garcia|title=Electric Etudes: Jerry Garcia|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> Echoes of bluegrass playing (such as [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith|Arthur Smith]] and [[Doc Watson]]) could be heard. There was also early [[Rock and roll#Early North American rock and roll (1953-1963)|rock]] (like [[Lonnie Mack]], [[James Burton]], and Chuck Berry), contemporary [[Blues#History of modern blues|blues]] ([[Freddie King]] and [[Lowell Fulsom]]), [[country music|country and western]] ([[Roy Nichols]] and [[Don Rich]]), and [[jazz]] ([[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]) to be heard in Garcia's style. Don Rich was the sparkling country guitar player in [[Buck Owens]]'s \"[[the Buckaroos]]\" band of the 1960s, but besides Rich's style, both Garcia's [[pedal steel guitar]] playing (on Grateful Dead records and others) and his standard electric guitar work, were influenced by another of Owens's Buckaroos of that time, pedal steel player [[Tom Brumley]]. And as an improvisational soloist, John Coltrane was one of his greatest personal and musical influences.\n\nGarcia later described his playing style as having \"descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just 'cause that's where all my stuff comes from. It's like that blues instrumental stuff that was happening in the late Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King.\" Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called \"signatures\".  Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs \"Good Morning Little School Girl\", \"New Speedway Boogie\", \"Brokedown Palace\", \"Deal\", \"Loser\", \"[[Truckin']]\", \"That's It for the Other One\", \"U.S. Blues\", \"[[Sugaree]]\", and \"Don't Ease Me In\").\n\n===Side projects===\nIn addition to the Grateful Dead, Garcia had numerous side projects, the most notable being the [[Jerry Garcia Band]]. He was also involved with various acoustic projects such as [[Old & In the Way]] and other bluegrass bands, including collaborations with noted bluegrass mandolinist [[David Grisman]]. The documentary film ''[[Grateful Dawg]]'', co-produced by Gillian Grisman and former NBC producer Pamela Hamilton chronicles the deep, long-term friendship between Garcia and Grisman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265212|title=Grateful Dawg (2000)|author=Ali_Catterall|date=July 4, 2002|work=IMDb}}</ref> When Garcia and Grisman released Not For Kids Only, Hamilton produced their interview and concert for NBC. After several years of producing stories on the Grateful Dead and band members' side projects, Hamilton interviewed Bob Weir for a feature on Garcia's death marking the end of an era. \n\nOther groups of which Garcia was a member at one time or another include the Black Mountain Boys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |title=Black Mountain Boys |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022052842/http://www.eyecandypromo.com/SR/bmb64.html |archivedate=October 22, 1999 }} photo at eyecandypromo.com. Retrieved April 12, 2013.</ref> [[Legion of Mary (band)|Legion of Mary]], [[Reconstruction (band)|Reconstruction]], and the [[Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band]]. Garcia was also a fan of jazz artists and [[Jazz#Improvisation|improvisation]]: he played with jazz keyboardists [[Merl Saunders]] and [[Howard Wales]] for many years in various groups and jam sessions, and he appeared on saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]]'s 1988 album, ''[[Primetime (musical ensemble)|Virgin Beauty]]''. His collaboration with Merl Saunders and [[Muruga Booker]] on the world music album ''Blues From the Rainforest'' launched the [[Rainforest Band]].\n\nGarcia also spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums, the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia's help included the likes of [[Jefferson Airplane]] (most notably ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'', Garcia being listed as their \"spiritual advisor\"). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he'd played the high lead on \"Today,\" played on \"Plastic Fantastic Lover\" and \"Comin' Back to Me\" on that album. Others include [[Tom Fogerty]], [[David Bromberg]], Robert Hunter (''Liberty'', on Relix Records), [[Paul Pena]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[Pete Sears]], [[Ken Nordine]], Ornette Coleman, [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[It's a Beautiful Day]], and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD ''[[Blue Incantation]]'' by guitarist [[Sanjay Mishra (musician)|Sanjay Mishra]], making it his last studio collaboration.\n\nThroughout the early 1970s, Garcia, Lesh, Grateful Dead drummer [[Mickey Hart]], and [[David Crosby]] collaborated intermittently with [[MIT]]-educated composer and biologist [[Ned Lagin]] on several projects in the realm of early [[ambient music]]; these include the album ''[[Seastones]]'' (released by the Ned Lagin on the [[Grateful Dead Records|Round Records]] subsidiary) and ''L'', an unfinished dance work composed by Ned Lagin. In 1970, Garcia participated in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.\n\nGarcia also played pedal steel guitar for fellow-San Francisco musicians [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]] from their initial dates in 1969 to October 1971, when increased commitments with the Dead forced him to opt out of the group. He appears as a band member on their debut album ''[[New Riders of the Purple Sage (album)|New Riders of the Purple Sage]]'', and produced ''Home, Home on the Road'', a 1974 live album by the band. He also contributed pedal steel guitar to the enduring hit \"Teach Your Children\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]]. Garcia also played steel guitar licks on [[Brewer & Shipley]]'s 1970 album ''[[Tarkio (album)|Tarkio]]''. Despite considering himself a novice on the pedal steel, Garcia routinely ranked high in player polls. After a long lapse from playing the pedal steel, he played it once more during several of the Dead's concerts with Bob Dylan in the summer of 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Garcia agreed to perform at several major benefits including the \"Soviet American Peace Walk\" concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, Pete Sears, who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, Mickey Hart and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a Grateful Dead show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with [[Nick Gravenites]] and Pete Sears at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist [[Brian Willson]], who lost both legs below the knee when he attempted to block a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador.\n\nHaving previously studied at the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career in the visual arts in the late 1980s. He created a number of drawings, [[etchings]], and [[water colors]]. Garcia's artistic endeavors were represented by the Weir Gallery{{harvnb|Higashi|2005|pp=176-177}} in [[Berkeley, California]] from 1989 to 1996. During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate Bob Weir) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on.<ref>S.F.Chronicle, December 9, 1992</ref> These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of [[digital art]] media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia.<ref name=\"garciaweirgallery.com\">{{cite web| title=Art of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Roberta Weir| url=http://www.garciaweirgallery.com/| publisher=Weir Gallery| accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref> Perhaps the most widely seen pieces of Jerry Garcia's art are the many editions of men's neckties produced by Stonehenge Ltd. Some began as etchings, other designs came from his drawings, paintings, and digital art. Years after Garcia's death, his estate granted the license to Mulberry Street which resulted in a lawsuit and settlement with the original manufacturer, and new styles and designs continue to be produced and sold.\n\n==Personal life==\nGarcia met his first wife, Sara Ruppenthal Garcia, in 1963.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> She was working at the coffee house in the back of Kepler's Books, where Garcia, Hunter, and Nelson regularly performed.

She died on September 28, 1970.\n\nIn the midst of a March 1973 Grateful Dead engagement at the [[Nassau Coliseum]] near New York City, Garcia met Deborah Koons, an aspiring filmmaker from a wealthy [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]-based family who would much later marry him and become his widow.<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|2000|p=259}}</ref><ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> After a brief correspondence, he began his relationship with her in mid-1974; this gradually strained his relationship with Adams and culminated in Garcia leaving Adams for Koons in late 1975. The end of his relationship with Koons in 1977 precipitated a brief reconciliation with Adams, including the reestablishment of their household; however, she did not agree with the guitarist's persistent use of narcotics and moved with the children to the [[Eugene, Oregon]] area (near Kesey) in 1978. Garcia had an affair with Amy Moore (a [[Kentucky]]-born member of the extended \"Grateful Dead family\" and the mistress of Texas oil heir Roy Cullen) circa 1980\u20131981, and their brief liaison inspired the Garcia-Hunter song \"Run for the Roses.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://insiderlouisville.com/lifestyle_culture/grateful-dead-manager-rock-scullys-louisville-years/ | title=Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully's Louisville years | first=David | last=Serchuk | work=Insider Louisville | date=December 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdams and Garcia were married (largely as a result of mutual tax exigencies) on December 31, 1981.

Approximately fifteen people were arrested on the spot, including many of the road crew, management, and nearly all of the Grateful Dead except for Garcia, who arrived later, outgoing keyboardist [[Tom Constanten]], who abstained from all drugs as a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], and McKernan, who eschewed illegal drugs in favor of alcohol.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAccording to Bill Kreutzmann, the band's use of [[cocaine]] accelerated throughout the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkavBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22cocaine%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNhMfr9IbPAhWB6iYKHbpCDWEQ6AEIPzAG#v=snippet&q=%22cocaine%22&f=false | title=Deal: My Three Decades of Drumming, Dreams, and Drugs with the Grateful Dead | first1=Bill | last1=Kreutzmann | first2=Benjy | last2=Eisen | date=2015 | publisher=Macmillan | accessdate=May 5, 2017 | via=Google Books}}</ref> After experimenting with heroin in a brothel in 1974 (likely on the band's second European tour), Garcia was introduced to a smokeable form of the drug (initially advertised as refined [[opium]]) colloquially known as \"Persian\" or \"Persian Base\" during the group's 1975 hiatus. Influenced by the stresses of creating and releasing ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' and the acrimonious collapse of the band's independent record labels over the next two years, Garcia became increasingly dependent upon both substances. These factors, combined with the alcohol and drug abuse of several other members of the Grateful Dead, resulted in a turbulent atmosphere. By 1978, the band's chemistry began \"cracking and crumbling\",<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> resulting in poor group cohesion. As a result, Keith and [[Donna Jean Godchaux]] left the band in February 1979.\n\nWith the addition of keyboardist/vocalist [[Brent Mydland]] that year amid the ongoing coalescence of the [[Deadhead]] subculture, the band reached new commercial heights as a touring group on the American arena circuit in the early 1980s, enabling them to forsake studio recording for several years. Nevertheless, this was offset by such factors as the band's atypically large payroll and Garcia's $700-a-day ({{Inflation|US|700|1982|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) drug addiction, resulting in the guitarist taking on a frenetic slate of solo touring outside of the Grateful Dead's rigorous schedule, including acoustic duo concerts with longtime Jerry Garcia Band bassist [[John Kahn]] that seldom extended beyond an hour and a half and were widely rumored to be a funding conduit for their respective addictions.\n\nThough things seemed to be getting better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's demeanor onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called \"endless tour\"\u2014the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions\u2014had taken its toll.\n\nGarcia's decade-long heroin addiction culminated in the rest of the band holding an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in January 1985.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Given the choice between the band or the drugs, Garcia agreed to check into a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California. A few days later in January, before the start of his program in Oakland, Garcia was arrested for [[drug possession]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]; he subsequently attended a drug diversion program. Throughout 1985, he tapered his drug use on tour and at home with the assistance of Nora Sage; by the spring of 1986, he was completely abstinent.\n\nPrecipitated by an unhealthy weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, and a recent relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later.<ref name=\"rockandroll\"/><ref name=\"jerrynews\"/> He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: \"Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of [[protoplasm]] that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off.\"<ref name=\"motm\"/> Garcia's coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAfter Garcia's recovery, the band released a comeback album ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in 1987, which became their best-selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia's improved health, a successful album and the continuing emergence of Mydland as a third frontman, the band's energy and chemistry reached a new peak in the late 1980s.\n\nMydland died of a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]] overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists [[Vince Welnick]] and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's performances drove Garcia to new heights on stage. However, as the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a [[methadone]] clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/>\n\nAfter returning from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986.<ref name=\"searchingforthesound\"/> Manasha Garcia nursed Jerry back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included [[Acupuncture|acupuncturist]] Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, a licensed holistic doctor to treat him at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate.<ref>{{cite book | title=Aces Back to Back: The History of the Grateful Dead (1965\u20132013) | first=Scott W. | last=Allen | date=2014 | publisher=Outskirts Press, Inc. | isbn=978-1-4787-1943-4 | page=135}}</ref> Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight.

Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. \n\nIn light of his second drug relapse and current condition, Garcia checked himself into the [[Betty Ford Center]] during July 1995.

Although this was a double neck guitar, Garcia often would choose not to attach the last 5 pedal rods for the rear or \"[[Western swing]]\" neck.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Additionally, he was playing an Emmons D-10<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGdLAAAAYAAJ&q=emmons+d10+garcia&dq=emmons+d10+garcia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SaWpU7zeD4LcOYeQgNAF&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ|title=Beat Instrumental & International Recording|issue=117|page=52}}</ref> at the time of the Grateful Dead's and New Riders of the Purple Sage's final appearances at the Fillmore East in late April 1971.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn 1969, Garcia played pedal steel on three notable outside recordings: the track \"The Farm\" on the [[Jefferson Airplane]] album ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'', the track \"Oh Mommy\" by [[Brewer and Shipley]] and the [[hit single]] \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] from their album ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', released in 1970.

In March and April 1971 \u2013 the time period during which the Grateful Dead recorded its second live album, [[Grateful Dead (album)|''Grateful Dead'']] \u2013 Garcia played the \"Peanut,\" a guitar he had received from Rick Turner, who had custom built the guitar's body and incorporated the neck, pickups, and hardware from an early 60's Les Paul.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rickturnerblog.com/2017/12/05/garcias-turner-peanut-guitar/ |title=Garcia's Turner \"Peanut Guitar\" |last=Turner |first=Rick |date=December 17, 2017 |website=rickturnerblog.com |publisher= |access-date=August 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> In May, Garcia began using a 1957 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by [[Graham Nash]].

Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September.<ref name=\"jerrygarcia.com\"/> It cost $1,500 ({{inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}), an extremely high price for the era.<ref name=\"wolf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/wolf/wolf.htm|title=The Wolf guitar|accessdate=July 17, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref>\n\nWolf was made with an [[ebony]] [[fingerboard]] and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the [[headstock]], [[ivory]] inlays, and fret marker dots made of [[sterling silver]]. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of [[purpleheart]]. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly [[single coil]]s, while the other accommodated [[humbucker]]s. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: \"Don't hold back.\"<ref name=\"wolf\"/>\n\nDuring the Grateful Dead's [[Dick's Picks Volume 7|1974 European tour]], Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock. Following filming of ''The Grateful Dead Movie'' (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several [[Travis Bean]] guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia.<ref name=\"wolf\"/> The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would \"see\" the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin).{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}}\n\nNearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar ([[Tiger (guitar)|Tiger]]) from Irwin in the summer of 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105051821/http://www.wald-electronics.com/tiger.html|url-status=dead|title=Garcia Guitar Directory - Tiger - Irwin|date=January 5, 2013|archivedate=January 5, 2013|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref> He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the [[Oakland Auditorium Arena]] on August 4, 1979.<ref name=\"wald-electronics.com\"/> Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover.<ref name=\"tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/tiger/info.html|title=The Tiger guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was [[cocobolo]], with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and [[flame maple]], in that order.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil [[DiMarzio]] SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups every year or two.<ref name=\"tiger\"/> The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate in the back of the guitar. Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed {{convert|13+1/2|lb|kg}}. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.\n\nIn the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars.  There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus Graphite neck.  He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the \"tree of life\" model. This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese [[luthier]] Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael.  As with most things Garcia, with his passing, the DY99 model is highly valued among collectors.\n\nIn 1990, Irwin completed Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar.<ref name=\"rosebud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=The Rosebud guitar|accessdate=July 18, 2007|work=Dozin.com}}</ref> It was similar to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording ''[[Without a Net]]''.<ref name=\"rosebud\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dozin.com/jers/guitars/rosebud/rosebud.html|title=Rosebud by Doug Irwin|publisher=}}</ref> Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to {{convert|11+1/2|lbs|kg}}.

Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar.
