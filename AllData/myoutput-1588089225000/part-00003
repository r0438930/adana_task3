It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by [[Virgin Records]] ([[EMI|EMI France]]). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist [[Kelly Rowland]], who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by [[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]].\n\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album ''[[Here I Am (Kelly Rowland album)|Here I Am]]'' (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed the song]], focussing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Take Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to [[Coldplay]]'s 2002 hit single \"[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]].\"\n\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from ''One Love''. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest charting single on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, ''Billboard'' named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging [[electronic dance music]] trend in America at its time of release.\n\nIn the song's accompanying [[music video]], Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, [[NRJ Music Awards]] and the [[World Music Awards]]. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual [[Miss Universe 2009|Miss Universe]] competition. The single earned seven Platinum [[List of music recording certifications|certification]]s as well as five Gold certificates, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"MUNDO URBANO TV Magazine\">{{cite news|title=David Guetta \u2013 What I Did For Love ft Emeli Sand\u00e9|url=http://www.mundourbano.tv/david-guetta-what-i-did-for-love-ft-emeli-sande/|publisher=MUNDO URBANO TV Magazine|accessdate=March 16, 2015|date=March 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/features/official-charts-flashback-2009-cascada-evacuate-the-dancefloor-3267/<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->][https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=312921450&s=143441<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->] Sottraendo dal totale complessivo delle copie vendute con i singoli le vendite delle altre hits, si ottengono le copie vendute individualmente da ''When Love Takes Over''</ref> Additionally, it earned Guetta two [[52nd Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for \"[[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]]\" and \"[[Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical|Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording]]\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\".\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kelly Rowland 12, 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Kelly Rowland]] performing in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 2012.]]\nRowland has acknowledged on several occasions that although she loved [[dance music]], it was not really the type of music she would record.

She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo ([[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]]).<ref name=\"Blues & Soul\"/> However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his ''[[One Love (David Guetta album)|One Love]]'' album.<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/generating-hit-songs-on-the-double/story-fn6ck8la-1225976132620 |title=Generating hit songs on the double |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |work=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]] |last=Browne |first=Sarah |date=25 December 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref> After getting selected for the album, \"When Love Takes Over\" was given to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of the song.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/> However Riesterer decided to give the track to French [[Mix engineer|mixing engineer]] Veronica Ferraro, who would later go on to say that \"Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out.

Following this, she decided that she would focus primarily on Rowland's vocals. {{quote|\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had the right sounds on the drums and the keyboards, so I did not change very much. I just did some standard things, with [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]] and [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and things like that. After that my obsession was to get the vocals to sound as good as possible. When I'm mixing a track, I want something to happen, something that takes the listener somewhere. You want the right things in the right place, but it's not a technical issue. It's actually an artistic issue to have everything in the right place \u2013 the mixing has to be magic. It was not difficult in this case, because I knew the song would be a hit, but I did my best to make the vocal sound magical, like an angel singing, so that the hit quality of the song was immediately obvious. I wanted to make sure that the voice takes you from the beginning to the end and doesn't lose you.\"<ref name=\"Tingen\"/>}}\nFerraro told ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' that she did add a [[bass drum]] sample, as she felt that the kick was missing something. \"Rather than equalise it, I added a little bit of my sample to make the BD track sound bigger\". However she did alter the two piano elements of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, [[String section|strings]] and guitar samples.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/> She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which \"were extensively processed\", including [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[de-essing]]. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent \"When Love Takes Over\" to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio. Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format, [[24-bit]]/[[44,100 Hz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]]. He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song, particularly the bass drums and low [[synthesizer|synth]]s.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/>\n\n== Composition ==\n{{Listen |filename=David Guetta - When Love Takes Over (feat.

Other elements of the song such as the \"bed of synthistrings, a skippy beat, a breakdown, some riffing glassy electronics and a dramatic, cinematic bottom end drone\" were praised. McAlpine also praised Rowland's appearance on the track, commenting who she sounded \"entirely unlike herself, so that even SHE is all buffed up and shiny.\" He described the marriage of Rowland's vocals and Guetta's production by stating that \"[Rowland's] got a spiralling, sky-scraping melody to sing too.\"<ref name=\"McAlpine\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2009/06/david_guetta_kelly_rowland_whe.shtml |title=David Guetta feat.

It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by [[Virgin Records]] ([[EMI|EMI France]]). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist [[Kelly Rowland]], who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by [[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]].\n\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album ''[[Here I Am (Kelly Rowland album)|Here I Am]]'' (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed the song]], focussing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Take Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to [[Coldplay]]'s 2002 hit single \"[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]].\"\n\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from ''One Love''. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest charting single on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, ''Billboard'' named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging [[electronic dance music]] trend in America at its time of release.\n\nIn the song's accompanying [[music video]], Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, [[NRJ Music Awards]] and the [[World Music Awards]]. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual [[Miss Universe 2009|Miss Universe]] competition. The single earned seven Platinum [[List of music recording certifications|certification]]s as well as five Gold certificates, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"MUNDO URBANO TV Magazine\">{{cite news|title=David Guetta \u2013 What I Did For Love ft Emeli Sand\u00e9|url=http://www.mundourbano.tv/david-guetta-what-i-did-for-love-ft-emeli-sande/|publisher=MUNDO URBANO TV Magazine|accessdate=March 16, 2015|date=March 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/features/official-charts-flashback-2009-cascada-evacuate-the-dancefloor-3267/<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->][https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=312921450&s=143441<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->] Sottraendo dal totale complessivo delle copie vendute con i singoli le vendite delle altre hits, si ottengono le copie vendute individualmente da ''When Love Takes Over''</ref> Additionally, it earned Guetta two [[52nd Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for \"[[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]]\" and \"[[Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical|Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording]]\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\".\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kelly Rowland 12, 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Kelly Rowland]] performing in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 2012.]]\nRowland has acknowledged on several occasions that although she loved [[dance music]], it was not really the type of music she would record.

She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo ([[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]]).<ref name=\"Blues & Soul\"/> However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his ''[[One Love (David Guetta album)|One Love]]'' album.<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/generating-hit-songs-on-the-double/story-fn6ck8la-1225976132620 |title=Generating hit songs on the double |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |work=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]] |last=Browne |first=Sarah |date=25 December 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref> After getting selected for the album, \"When Love Takes Over\" was given to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of the song.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/> However Riesterer decided to give the track to French [[Mix engineer|mixing engineer]] Veronica Ferraro, who would later go on to say that \"Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out.

Following this, she decided that she would focus primarily on Rowland's vocals. {{quote|\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had the right sounds on the drums and the keyboards, so I did not change very much. I just did some standard things, with [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]] and [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and things like that. After that my obsession was to get the vocals to sound as good as possible. When I'm mixing a track, I want something to happen, something that takes the listener somewhere. You want the right things in the right place, but it's not a technical issue. It's actually an artistic issue to have everything in the right place \u2013 the mixing has to be magic. It was not difficult in this case, because I knew the song would be a hit, but I did my best to make the vocal sound magical, like an angel singing, so that the hit quality of the song was immediately obvious. I wanted to make sure that the voice takes you from the beginning to the end and doesn't lose you.\"<ref name=\"Tingen\"/>}}\nFerraro told ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' that she did add a [[bass drum]] sample, as she felt that the kick was missing something. \"Rather than equalise it, I added a little bit of my sample to make the BD track sound bigger\". However she did alter the two piano elements of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, [[String section|strings]] and guitar samples.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/> She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which \"were extensively processed\", including [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[de-essing]]. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent \"When Love Takes Over\" to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio. Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format, [[24-bit]]/[[44,100 Hz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]]. He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song, particularly the bass drums and low [[synthesizer|synth]]s.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/>\n\n== Composition ==\n{{Listen |filename=David Guetta - When Love Takes Over (feat.

Rowland relates: \"I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of Europeans DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' it was my first introduction to dance music [and] it was a whole other monster.

He co-produced a couple of the songs including the album's first single, \"[[Commander (song)|Commander]]\".<ref name=\"MTV Interview\"/>\n\nLater in 2013, Kerri Mason and Zel McCarthy compiled a list of the top-ten dance-pop collaborations of all time for ''Billboard'' magazine. In their article, the critics named \"When Love Takes Over\" at the top of the list, saying that the song \"repositioned Kelly Rowland as a solo vocalist with chops on her own.\"<ref name=\"no.1 dance-pop collab\"/> The duo also commented that subsequent collaborations between Guetta and Rowland were not as good as \"When Love Takes Over\", also adding that Rowland's vocal was firmly part of \"dance music history\" and were an indication of the growing [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) trend emerging in America at the time.<ref name=\"no.1 dance-pop collab\"/>\n\nIn a 2020 feature titled \"Should Have Been Bigger\" on the website ''[[Idolator]]'', Mike Wass was reflecting on the underperformance of Rowland's follow up dance song \"Commander\" and noted that \"When Love Take Over\" firmly established Rowland as the \"newly crowned Queen of Clubs in 2010\".<ref name=\"Idolator 2020-03-12\">{{cite web |url=https://www.idolator.com/7908006/should-have-been-bigger-kelly-rowlands-club-conquering-commander?chrome=1 |title=Should Have Been Bigger: Kelly Rowland\u2019s Club-Conquering \u201cCommander\u201d |website=[[Idolator]] |last=Wass |first=Mike |date=2020-03-12 |accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*;Digital download<ref name=\"UK Single Download\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B002BZHAQO/ |title=David Guetta feat.
