His father belonged to a noble Italian family of [[\u0160ibenik]] (Italian: Sebenico) in [[Croatia]], which fled after [[World War II]], together with most [[Dalmatian Italians]], after Tito's Communists took over the country.\n\nWorking as an intern for the UN [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) in [[Cyprus]] in the mid-1970s, he witnessed the death of a child, shot by a sniper. The child had wandered over the 'green line' dividing Cyprus and [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]. This experience was something he found profoundly shocking, but it also stirred up a sense of 'constructive outrage' as he has described it; a desire to study humanitarian emergency relief and dedicate his life to working for the peaceful resolution of conflict.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n==1970s\u20131990s==\nIn 1971 de Mistura started his career with the UN as a WFP Project Officer in Sudan. In 1973 he was an Emergency Relief Officer in Chad, there he led the first ever UN airdrop operation. By 1976, he was working as the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s Deputy [[Chef de Cabinet]], a post he remained in until 1985. In addition, he was given special humanitarian assignments to [[Dubrovnik]], [[Sarajevo]], Sudan, [[Ethiopia]], [[Vietnam]] and the [[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]].\n\nIn 1987 de Mistura returned to Sudan to become WFP Director of Operations. From 1988 to 1991, he acted as Director of Fund-Raising and External Relations of the United Nations Office of the Coordinator for Afghanistan. Moving on again, he was employed as Director of the Division of Public Affairs of the [[United Nations Children's Fund]], known as [[UNICEF]], and was also UNICEF representative for Somalia.\n\nIn 1992 de Mistura was in Nagorno-Karabakh with UN mission chief Francesco Vendrell [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXyUKoRXMM4].\n\nHe was briefly the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq. The job lasted from March through August 1997.\n\nIn 1999, de Mistura sat as a member of the Security Council Panel on Humanitarian Issues in Iraq. He was also briefly Special Adviser to the [[High Commissioner for Refugees]] in [[Kosovo]]; a job that lasted from April to June. He was then given the task of Regional Administrator for the [[Kosovska Mitrovica|Mitrovica]] Region in Kosovo.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://iseek.unon.un.org/webpgdept1331_13.html{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==2000\u2013present==\nIn June 2000, de Mistura was Special Rapporteur during the [[Fribourg]] ''Forum on Regional Cooperation and Coordination in Crisis Management for Europe and the Newly Independent States''.

His father belonged to a noble Italian family of [[\u0160ibenik]] (Italian: Sebenico) in [[Croatia]], which fled after [[World War II]], together with most [[Dalmatian Italians]], after Tito's Communists took over the country.\n\nWorking as an intern for the UN [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) in [[Cyprus]] in the mid-1970s, he witnessed the death of a child, shot by a sniper. The child had wandered over the 'green line' dividing Cyprus and [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]. This experience was something he found profoundly shocking, but it also stirred up a sense of 'constructive outrage' as he has described it; a desire to study humanitarian emergency relief and dedicate his life to working for the peaceful resolution of conflict.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n==1970s\u20131990s==\nIn 1971 de Mistura started his career with the UN as a WFP Project Officer in Sudan. In 1973 he was an Emergency Relief Officer in Chad, there he led the first ever UN airdrop operation. By 1976, he was working as the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s Deputy [[Chef de Cabinet]], a post he remained in until 1985. In addition, he was given special humanitarian assignments to [[Dubrovnik]], [[Sarajevo]], Sudan, [[Ethiopia]], [[Vietnam]] and the [[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]].\n\nIn 1987 de Mistura returned to Sudan to become WFP Director of Operations. From 1988 to 1991, he acted as Director of Fund-Raising and External Relations of the United Nations Office of the Coordinator for Afghanistan. Moving on again, he was employed as Director of the Division of Public Affairs of the [[United Nations Children's Fund]], known as [[UNICEF]], and was also UNICEF representative for Somalia.\n\nIn 1992 de Mistura was in Nagorno-Karabakh with UN mission chief Francesco Vendrell [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXyUKoRXMM4].\n\nHe was briefly the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq. The job lasted from March through August 1997.\n\nIn 1999, de Mistura sat as a member of the Security Council Panel on Humanitarian Issues in Iraq. He was also briefly Special Adviser to the [[High Commissioner for Refugees]] in [[Kosovo]]; a job that lasted from April to June. He was then given the task of Regional Administrator for the [[Kosovska Mitrovica|Mitrovica]] Region in Kosovo.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://iseek.unon.un.org/webpgdept1331_13.html{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==2000\u2013present==\nIn June 2000, de Mistura was Special Rapporteur during the [[Fribourg]] ''Forum on Regional Cooperation and Coordination in Crisis Management for Europe and the Newly Independent States''.
