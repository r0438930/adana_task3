Lee]] during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Clarkson's father found himself in financial difficulty and the house was sold at a sheriff's auction in 1846 to [[Thaddeus Stevens]]. Michael Clarkson and Stevens were close friends and Stevens wrote a letter to [[President Abraham Lincoln]] on February 9, 1863 recommending a commission for Thaddeus to a commission in the Regular Army; the commission was apparently never granted as Thaddeus remained an officer in the volunteer service.\n\n==Military career==\nOn April 16, 1861, Clarkson enlisted at Chicago as a private in Smith's Independent Illinois Light Artillery. He was promoted to corporal on May 2, 1861 and to sergeant on July 16, 1861; he mustered out with the battery on the same date.

Clarkson was then appointed to the staff of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[John Davidson (general)|John W. Davidson]]. He rose through the ranks and was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on December 14, 1863, the same day that he was mustered out of the regiment. The following day, he began service with the [[3rd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment (Union)|3rd Arkansas Cavalry]], a regiment he helped raise and commanded until the end of the war. He mustered out of the service on September 10, 1864.\n\n==Post-war==\nIn March 1866 Clarkson settled in [[Nebraska]] with his family and became [[postmaster]] in [[Omaha]]. He became active with the G.A.R., serving as Commander of the Department of Nebraska in 1890, Junior Vice Commander-in-Chief of the G.A.R. in 1892, and finally as Commander-in-Chief of the G.A.R., 1896-1897.
