It was first broadcast on [[Comedy Central]] on November 27, 2002, and was the last in a mini-[[story arc|arc]] depicting [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] being occasionally possessed by [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. The episode is centered on [[Liane Cartman]] and [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] attempting to exorcise Kenny's soul while Stan deals with trying to debunk self-proclaimed psychic [[John Edward]], whom the entire crew of South Park Studios agreed to be \"the biggest douche in the universe.\"<ref name=\"DVD\">Trey Parker and Matt Stone; ''The Biggest Douche in the Universe'' DVD commentary</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCartman is rushed to the hospital after again being possessed by Kenny, the first occurrence of which was in the episode \"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\" when he mistook Kenny's ashes for chocolate milk mix. The doctor tells his mother [[Liane Cartman|Liane]] that Cartman is 'running out of time'. Upon hearing of all this, [[Chef (South Park character)|Chef]] decides to take everyone to the ''Crossing Over'' TV show in [[New York City|New York]] and have [[John Edward]] talk to Kenny [[psychic|from beyond the grave]]. At the show, Edward merely makes uselessly vague statements about Kenny, and advises Kyle that his grandmother wants him to \"look for four white doves.\"\n\nDisappointed with Edward, Chef takes Cartman to [[Chef's Parents|his parents]] in [[Scotland]] and has them perform an [[exorcism]]. About to fly back to [[Colorado]], Kyle spots a poster advertising a [[school]] called [[Juilliard School|Jewleeard]], with four white birds as its logo. Convinced, he rushes off to enroll himself. Stan goes to Edward's house, and offends him by trying to get him to admit that what he does is not real, and calls him a \"[[douche]]\" and \"the biggest douche in the universe\". Before Stan leaves, he steals some of Edward's books, to learn more about [[cold reading]]. In an attempt to persuade Kyle that Edward is a fake, Stan demonstrates cold reading on some passersby as they stand in the street but the plan backfires when the crowd believes that Stan actually has psychic powers, and he is immediately given his own show. This prompts Edward to challenge Stan to a psychic showdown.\n\nMeanwhile, [[List of minor characters on South Park#Nellie and Thomas McElroy|Chef's parents]] successfully exorcise Kenny's spirit from Cartman, but since Chef has not brought a \"victim child\" into which to transfer the spirit, it flies around their house before occupying a [[pot roast (beef)|pot roast]]. Cartman returns to his normal self and Chef's parents give him the roast to take back to South Park. However, Chef, Cartman, and Liane end up forgetting to claim the pot roast at the baggage claim in the airport.\n\nAt the psychic showdown, Stan finally convinces Kyle and much of the audience that, although it may be comforting to think of their deceased relatives talking to them, such a fate isn't a particularly desirable one\u2014especially if it means that they have to talk to Edward. A large spacecraft suddenly crashes through the studio roof. The nomination committee for the annual \"Biggest Douche in the Universe\" award, made up of several different aliens, comes to take Edward to the award ceremony for they have accepted Stan's nomination he unintentionally made earlier. Once taken there, Edward wins the prize despite throughout the entire episode yelling \"I am not a douche!\"\u2014beating a variety of aliens including one that is literally a giant [[douche]].\n\nThroughout the episode, fictional trailers play for [[Rob Schneider]]'s latest comedy vehicles. Near the end of the episode a trailer is shown wherein Schneider finds the abandoned pot roast and eats it, thus allowing Kenny's spirit to possess him. The resulting movie shows him living out Kenny's former life until he is [[Weight Gain 4000|shot and impaled on a flag pole]].\n\n== Production ==\nAt the time of this episode's original broadcast, [[Rob Schneider]] was about to star in ''[[The Hot Chick]]'', and had already starred in ''[[The Animal]]''. The [[running gag]] is that all of the fictional trailers follow the same basic plot: a man is somehow transformed, whether it be into an animal, a woman, a stapler, or a carrot. This point is furthered in the episode with a trailer clearly showing a plot exactly the same as these, but with almost every word spoken in complete gibberish. The term ''derp'' that is used in one of the Rob Schneider trailers (and would later become a popular term on the Internet) was coined when ''South Park'' creators Trey Parker and [[Matt Stone]] were shooting the movie ''[[BASEketball]]''; a derp is \"a stupid joke that you could see a mile away,\" commenting on their criticism of Schneider's movies.
