She was the only known English woman soldier on the frontline during World War I. In her later book, Lawrence wrote she was a sapper with the [[Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers|179 Tunnelling Company]], 51st Division, [[Royal Engineers]],a specialist mine-laying company that operated within {{convert|400|yd|m}} of the front line. But later evidence and correspondence from the time after her discovery by British Army authorities, including from the files of [[Walter Kirke|Sir Walter Kirke]] of the BEF's secret service, suggest she actually was at liberty and working within the trenches. The toll of the job, and of hiding her true identity, soon gave her constant chills and [[rheumatism]], and latterly fainting fits. Concerned that if she needed medical attention her true gender would be discovered and the men who had befriended her would be in danger, after 10 days of service she presented herself to the commanding sergeant, who promptly placed her under military arrest. She was sent home under a strict agreement not to publish her experiences.<ref name=TimeSer>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/picture_gallery/archive/2003/11/20/Features+%28features%29/432132.Girl_who_fought_like_a_man/|title=Girl who fought like a man|author=Lawrence Marzouk|publisher=Times Series|date=20 November 2003|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref><ref> https://web.archive.org/web/20191012192555/http://writingwomenshistory.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/dorothy-lawrence-woman-who-fought-at.html?m=1</ref>\n\nWomen also volunteered and served in the military without disguising themselves; by the end of the war, 80,000 had enlisted.<ref>{{cite magazine|accessdate=2 June 2009|title=Woman combatants|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwone/women_combatants_01.shtml|magazine=BBC History}}</ref><ref>Robert, Krisztina. \"Gender, Class, and Patriotism: Women's Paramilitary Units in First World War Britain.\" ''International History Review'' 19#1 (1997): 52-65.</ref> They mostly served as nurses in the [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS), the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), founded in 1907, also known as the \u201cPrincess Royal\u2019s Volunteer Corps\u201d; the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD); and from 1917, in the Army when the [[Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps]] (WAAC), was founded.<ref name=waac>{{cite web|accessdate=3 June 2009|publisher=National Archives|title=Women's Auxiliary Army Corps|url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/waac.asp}}</ref> The WAAC was divided into four sections: cookery; mechanical; clerical and miscellaneous.

They were let go when the munitions industries downsized at the end of the war. They volunteered for the money, and for patriotism. The wages were doubled of what they had previously made. The women working in these munitions factories were called \"[[Munitionette]]s\"; another nickname for these women was the \"Canaries\" because of the yellow skin which came from working with toxic chemicals. The work which these women did was long, tiring and exhausting as well as dangerous and hazardous to their health.<ref>Abbott, Edith. \"The War and Women\u2019s Work in England\" ''Journal of Political Economy'' (July 1917) 25#7 pp: 656.

University of Alberta. Advances in Consumer Research. (1997): 322\u201326.</ref> The posters failed to represent an accurate account of reality by creating a satisfactory appeal for women who joined the workforce and did their part in the war. Designed for women to persuade their men to join the armed forces, one propaganda poster is a romantic setting as the women look out an open window into nature as the soldiers march off to war. The poster possesses a sentimental and romantic appeal when the reality of the situation was that many women endured extreme hardships when their husbands enlisted.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/>  It was this narrative of a false reality conveyed in the visual propaganda that aimed to motivate war effort.\nThe Edwardian social construction of gender was that women should be passive and emotional, and have moral virtue and domestic responsibility. Men on the other hand were expected to be active and intelligent, and to provide for their families. It was this idea of gender roles that poster propaganda aimed to reverse. In one war propaganda poster, titled \u201cThese Women Are Doing Their Bit\u201d, a woman is represented as making a sacrifice by joining the munitions industry while the men are at the front. The woman in this particular persuasive poster is depicted as cheerful and beautiful, ensuring that her patriotic duty will not reduce her femininity.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> These posters do not communicate the reality that munitions labour entails. There is no reference to highly explosive chemicals or illnesses due to harsh work environments. The persuasive images of idealized female figures and idyllic settings were designed to solicit female involvement in the war and greatly influenced the idea of appropriate feminine behavior in the wartime Britain. As a result, many women left their domestic lives to join munitions work as they were enticed by what they thought were better living conditions, patriotic duty and high pay.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> According to Hupfer, the female role in the social sphere was expanded as they joined previously male-dominated and hazardous occupations (325).<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> Hupfer remarks that attitudes regarding the capabilities of women through the war effort sank back into the previously idealized roles of women and men once the war was over. Women went back to their duty in the home as they lost their jobs to returning soldiers and female labour statistics decreased to pre-war levels. Not until 1939 would the expansion of the role of women once again occur.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/>\n\n===Jobs on the home front other than in munitions factories===\n{{main|Home front during World War I#Britain}}\nMany women volunteered on the home front as nurses, teachers, and workers in traditionally male jobs.<ref>Gail Braybon, ''Women Workers in the First World War'' (Routledge, 2012)</ref> Wealthy women set up an organization called the [[American Women\u2019s War Relief Fund|American Women's War Relief Fund]] in England in 1914 order to buy ambulances, support hospitals and provide economic opportunities to women during the war.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19595784/|title=Every American Woman in England Working to Help Victims of War|last=Church|first=Hayden|date=6 October 1914|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=2018-04-27|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19614489/|title=Women Found War Hospitals|last=|first=|date=21 June 1917|work=Harrisburg Telegraph|access-date=2018-04-27|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|title=Helping in Britain: The American Women's War Relief Fund.|last=|first=|date=2017-01-09|work=American Women in World War I|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927022703/https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|archive-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Australian women in World War I|Home front during World War I#Australia}}\nThe role of Australian women in World War I was focused mainly upon their involvement in the provision of [[Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps|nursing services]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/exhibitions/1918/medical/nurses.asp|title=1918: Australians in France&nbsp;\u2013 Nurses&nbsp;\u2013 \"The roses of No Man's Land\"|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> 2,139 Australian nurses served during World War I.

The chlorine gas that was used by the Germans caused injuries that treatment protocols had not yet been developed for. The only treatment that soothed the Canadian soldiers affected by the gas was the constant care they received from the nurses.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> Canadian nurses were especially well known for their kindness.<ref name=\"gamble\" />\n\nCanadians had expected that women would feel sympathetic to the war efforts, but the idea that they would contribute in such a physical way was absurd to most.<ref name=\"gossage\" /> Because of the support that women had shown from the beginning of the war, people began to see their value in the war. In May 1918, a meeting was held to discuss the possible creation of the Canadian Women\u2019s Corps. In September, the motion was approved, but the project was pushed aside because the war\u2019s end was in sight.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nOn the Canadian home front, there were many ways which women could participate in the war effort.

Because the days consisted of long monotonous work, many women made up parodies of popular songs to get through the day and boost morale.<ref name=\"Allan\" /> Depending on the area of Canada, some women were given a choice to sleep in either barracks or tents at the factory or farm that they were employed at.<ref name=\"Allan\" />\nAccording to a brochure that was issued by the [[Canadian Department of Public Works]], there were several areas in which it was appropriate for women to work. These were:\n# On fruit or vegetable farms.\n# In the camps to cook for workers.\n# On mixed and dairy farms.\n# In the farmhouse to help feed those who are raising the crops.\n# In canneries, to preserve the fruit and vegetables.\n# To take charge of milk routes.<ref name=\"public\">Canada, Department of Public Works, Women\u2019s Work on the Land, (Ontario, Tracks and Labour Branch) www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/firstworldwar/025005-2100.005.07-e.html</ref>\n\nIn addition, many women were involved in charitable organization such as the [[Ottawa Women\u2019s Canadian Club]], which helped provide the needs of soldiers, families of soldiers and the victims of war.<ref name=\"Allan\" /> Women were deemed \u2018soldiers on the home front\u2019, encouraged to use less of nearly everything, and to be frugal in order to save supplies for the war efforts.<ref name=\"Allan\" />\n\n==Finland==\nIn the 1918 [[Finnish Civil War]], more than 2,000 women fought in the [[Women's Red Guards of the Finnish Civil War|Women's Red Guards]] formed in early February with more than 15 female guard units. As the commanders of the Red Guard were reluctant to commit female guards to combat most of the female guards were held in reserve for much of the civil war, only seeing combat towards the end of the war, in battles such as the Battle of Tampere where the city hall was held by the last pockets of Red Guard resistance, legends tell of how the male defenders wanted to surrender while the Tampere Women's Red Guard insisted on fighting to the bitter end. At the end of the civil war over 755 Red Guard women had died, with only 70 to 130 of them killed on the battlefield, over 20% or 400 to 500 members would be executed by the anti-communist White Guard victors and 80 to 110 died in prison camps with 150 to 200 members AWOL.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lintunen|first=Tiina|date=2014|title=The Finnish Civil War 1918: History, Memory, Legacy|chapter=Women at War|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xCJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=fi&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill Publishers|pages=201\u2013229|isbn=978-900-42436-6-8}}</ref>\n\nAs such it is clear that women played a role in the Finnish war both during the first world war when the women's military divisions would be conceptualized with some women already serving in the military and towards the end during the civil war when it would be formed by the Red Guard in reality.\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\n[[File:Red Crescent staff at Hafir el Aujah.jpg|thumb|Ottoman Red Crescent and Red Cross staff at [[Hafir el Aujah]].]]\nWomen had limited front line roles being nurses and provided a subsidiary work force of emergency medical personnel in substitution for the lack of manpower available as the empire was battling multiple fronts of enemies forcing the conscription of most of its male population, this medical workforce of women was all possible through organizations created by the government and international organizations such as the Red Cross.<ref>Elif Mahir Metinsoy, ''Ottoman Women during World War I: Everyday Experiences, Politics, and Conflict'' (Cambridge UP, 2017).

Through the discrimination of non-Muslim populations with policies such as the deportation of non-Muslims in 1915 this opened up a lot more jobs for Ottoman women for entrepreneurial roles within the country's economy. When the Ottoman Empire outlawed the use of any language except for Turkish in March 1916 also granted new opportunities for Ottoman women that knew Turkish and other foreign languages with a specific focus given to women through organizations such as the Ottoman School of Commerce which specifically opened a branch for women. The IOEW also provided women with administrative jobs and served as an intermediary for the school to allocate women students as interns in commercial and financial institutions throughout the country.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=CONCLUSION|pages=249\u2013254|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300241495|doi=10.2307/j.ctt2250vxg.22|title=Utopian Feminism|year=1992}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war the British press circulated false stories that Ottoman women took sniper roles in combat.

Raising prices of both staple items and consumer goods also rendered many women unable to subsist during these harsh conditions. Many homes were also commandeered by the military for various purposing forcing people, mostly women, because the vast majority of men were off fighting the war to sleep under trees and generally outside. To make this all worst there were deserters and refugees roaming vast areas in the Ottoman Empire plundering and stealing large stocks of goods such as maize and hazelnuts that were stockpiled to last the war. Worst of all perhaps was that state officials through the military were pressuring many village women to provide grain for the army at little to no compensation, grain that was once meant for their own subsistence would instead be taken away to feed the army. These war time conditions did not affect just women but did affect women most of all over men due to the forced conscription nature of the Ottoman Empire and the fact that women were the ones left to take care of villages and homes dotted throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ak\u0131n|first=Yi\u011fit|title=War, Women, and the State: The Politics of Sacrifice in the Ottoman Empire During the First World War|url=https://www.academia.edu/8349770|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=26|issue=3|pages=12\u201335|issn=1527-2036|doi=10.1353/jowh.2014.0040|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother shocking look at the lives of Ottoman women during the war was the frequency of petitioners to underline the martyrdom (sehitlik) of their sons and husbands to show the contribution of their men to the war effort.

But later evidence and correspondence from the time after her discovery by British Army authorities, including from the files of [[Walter Kirke|Sir Walter Kirke]] of the BEF's secret service, suggest she actually was at liberty and working within the trenches. The toll of the job, and of hiding her true identity, soon gave her constant chills and [[rheumatism]], and latterly fainting fits. Concerned that if she needed medical attention her true gender would be discovered and the men who had befriended her would be in danger, after 10 days of service she presented herself to the commanding sergeant, who promptly placed her under military arrest. She was sent home under a strict agreement not to publish her experiences.<ref name=TimeSer>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/picture_gallery/archive/2003/11/20/Features+%28features%29/432132.Girl_who_fought_like_a_man/|title=Girl who fought like a man|author=Lawrence Marzouk|publisher=Times Series|date=20 November 2003|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref><ref> https://web.archive.org/web/20191012192555/http://writingwomenshistory.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/dorothy-lawrence-woman-who-fought-at.html?m=1</ref>\n\nWomen also volunteered and served in the military without disguising themselves; by the end of the war, 80,000 had enlisted.<ref>{{cite magazine|accessdate=2 June 2009|title=Woman combatants|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwone/women_combatants_01.shtml|magazine=BBC History}}</ref><ref>Robert, Krisztina. \"Gender, Class, and Patriotism: Women's Paramilitary Units in First World War Britain.\" ''International History Review'' 19#1 (1997): 52-65.</ref> They mostly served as nurses in the [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS), the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), founded in 1907, also known as the \u201cPrincess Royal\u2019s Volunteer Corps\u201d; the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD); and from 1917, in the Army when the [[Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps]] (WAAC), was founded.<ref name=waac>{{cite web|accessdate=3 June 2009|publisher=National Archives|title=Women's Auxiliary Army Corps|url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/waac.asp}}</ref> The WAAC was divided into four sections: cookery; mechanical; clerical and miscellaneous.

They were let go when the munitions industries downsized at the end of the war. They volunteered for the money, and for patriotism. The wages were doubled of what they had previously made. The women working in these munitions factories were called \"[[Munitionette]]s\"; another nickname for these women was the \"Canaries\" because of the yellow skin which came from working with toxic chemicals. The work which these women did was long, tiring and exhausting as well as dangerous and hazardous to their health.<ref>Abbott, Edith. \"The War and Women\u2019s Work in England\" ''Journal of Political Economy'' (July 1917) 25#7 pp: 656.

University of Alberta. Advances in Consumer Research. (1997): 322\u201326.</ref> The posters failed to represent an accurate account of reality by creating a satisfactory appeal for women who joined the workforce and did their part in the war. Designed for women to persuade their men to join the armed forces, one propaganda poster is a romantic setting as the women look out an open window into nature as the soldiers march off to war. The poster possesses a sentimental and romantic appeal when the reality of the situation was that many women endured extreme hardships when their husbands enlisted.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/>  It was this narrative of a false reality conveyed in the visual propaganda that aimed to motivate war effort.\nThe Edwardian social construction of gender was that women should be passive and emotional, and have moral virtue and domestic responsibility. Men on the other hand were expected to be active and intelligent, and to provide for their families. It was this idea of gender roles that poster propaganda aimed to reverse. In one war propaganda poster, titled \u201cThese Women Are Doing Their Bit\u201d, a woman is represented as making a sacrifice by joining the munitions industry while the men are at the front. The woman in this particular persuasive poster is depicted as cheerful and beautiful, ensuring that her patriotic duty will not reduce her femininity.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> These posters do not communicate the reality that munitions labour entails. There is no reference to highly explosive chemicals or illnesses due to harsh work environments. The persuasive images of idealized female figures and idyllic settings were designed to solicit female involvement in the war and greatly influenced the idea of appropriate feminine behavior in the wartime Britain. As a result, many women left their domestic lives to join munitions work as they were enticed by what they thought were better living conditions, patriotic duty and high pay.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> According to Hupfer, the female role in the social sphere was expanded as they joined previously male-dominated and hazardous occupations (325).<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> Hupfer remarks that attitudes regarding the capabilities of women through the war effort sank back into the previously idealized roles of women and men once the war was over. Women went back to their duty in the home as they lost their jobs to returning soldiers and female labour statistics decreased to pre-war levels. Not until 1939 would the expansion of the role of women once again occur.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/>\n\n===Jobs on the home front other than in munitions factories===\n{{main|Home front during World War I#Britain}}\nMany women volunteered on the home front as nurses, teachers, and workers in traditionally male jobs.<ref>Gail Braybon, ''Women Workers in the First World War'' (Routledge, 2012)</ref> Wealthy women set up an organization called the [[American Women\u2019s War Relief Fund|American Women's War Relief Fund]] in England in 1914 order to buy ambulances, support hospitals and provide economic opportunities to women during the war.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19595784/|title=Every American Woman in England Working to Help Victims of War|last=Church|first=Hayden|date=6 October 1914|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=2018-04-27|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19614489/|title=Women Found War Hospitals|last=|first=|date=21 June 1917|work=Harrisburg Telegraph|access-date=2018-04-27|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|title=Helping in Britain: The American Women's War Relief Fund.|last=|first=|date=2017-01-09|work=American Women in World War I|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927022703/https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|archive-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Australian women in World War I|Home front during World War I#Australia}}\nThe role of Australian women in World War I was focused mainly upon their involvement in the provision of [[Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps|nursing services]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/exhibitions/1918/medical/nurses.asp|title=1918: Australians in France&nbsp;\u2013 Nurses&nbsp;\u2013 \"The roses of No Man's Land\"|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> 2,139 Australian nurses served during World War I.

Although the Great War, had not officially been opened up to women, they did feel the pressures at home.

The chlorine gas that was used by the Germans caused injuries that treatment protocols had not yet been developed for. The only treatment that soothed the Canadian soldiers affected by the gas was the constant care they received from the nurses.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> Canadian nurses were especially well known for their kindness.<ref name=\"gamble\" />\n\nCanadians had expected that women would feel sympathetic to the war efforts, but the idea that they would contribute in such a physical way was absurd to most.<ref name=\"gossage\" /> Because of the support that women had shown from the beginning of the war, people began to see their value in the war. In May 1918, a meeting was held to discuss the possible creation of the Canadian Women\u2019s Corps. In September, the motion was approved, but the project was pushed aside because the war\u2019s end was in sight.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nOn the Canadian home front, there were many ways which women could participate in the war effort.

Because the days consisted of long monotonous work, many women made up parodies of popular songs to get through the day and boost morale.<ref name=\"Allan\" /> Depending on the area of Canada, some women were given a choice to sleep in either barracks or tents at the factory or farm that they were employed at.<ref name=\"Allan\" />\nAccording to a brochure that was issued by the [[Canadian Department of Public Works]], there were several areas in which it was appropriate for women to work. These were:\n# On fruit or vegetable farms.\n# In the camps to cook for workers.\n# On mixed and dairy farms.\n# In the farmhouse to help feed those who are raising the crops.\n# In canneries, to preserve the fruit and vegetables.\n# To take charge of milk routes.<ref name=\"public\">Canada, Department of Public Works, Women\u2019s Work on the Land, (Ontario, Tracks and Labour Branch) www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/firstworldwar/025005-2100.005.07-e.html</ref>\n\nIn addition, many women were involved in charitable organization such as the [[Ottawa Women\u2019s Canadian Club]], which helped provide the needs of soldiers, families of soldiers and the victims of war.<ref name=\"Allan\" /> Women were deemed \u2018soldiers on the home front\u2019, encouraged to use less of nearly everything, and to be frugal in order to save supplies for the war efforts.<ref name=\"Allan\" />\n\n==Finland==\nIn the 1918 [[Finnish Civil War]], more than 2,000 women fought in the [[Women's Red Guards of the Finnish Civil War|Women's Red Guards]] formed in early February with more than 15 female guard units. As the commanders of the Red Guard were reluctant to commit female guards to combat most of the female guards were held in reserve for much of the civil war, only seeing combat towards the end of the war, in battles such as the Battle of Tampere where the city hall was held by the last pockets of Red Guard resistance, legends tell of how the male defenders wanted to surrender while the Tampere Women's Red Guard insisted on fighting to the bitter end. At the end of the civil war over 755 Red Guard women had died, with only 70 to 130 of them killed on the battlefield, over 20% or 400 to 500 members would be executed by the anti-communist White Guard victors and 80 to 110 died in prison camps with 150 to 200 members AWOL.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lintunen|first=Tiina|date=2014|title=The Finnish Civil War 1918: History, Memory, Legacy|chapter=Women at War|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xCJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=fi&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill Publishers|pages=201\u2013229|isbn=978-900-42436-6-8}}</ref>\n\nAs such it is clear that women played a role in the Finnish war both during the first world war when the women's military divisions would be conceptualized with some women already serving in the military and towards the end during the civil war when it would be formed by the Red Guard in reality.\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\n[[File:Red Crescent staff at Hafir el Aujah.jpg|thumb|Ottoman Red Crescent and Red Cross staff at [[Hafir el Aujah]].]]\nWomen had limited front line roles being nurses and provided a subsidiary work force of emergency medical personnel in substitution for the lack of manpower available as the empire was battling multiple fronts of enemies forcing the conscription of most of its male population, this medical workforce of women was all possible through organizations created by the government and international organizations such as the Red Cross.<ref>Elif Mahir Metinsoy, ''Ottoman Women during World War I: Everyday Experiences, Politics, and Conflict'' (Cambridge UP, 2017).

Through the discrimination of non-Muslim populations with policies such as the deportation of non-Muslims in 1915 this opened up a lot more jobs for Ottoman women for entrepreneurial roles within the country's economy. When the Ottoman Empire outlawed the use of any language except for Turkish in March 1916 also granted new opportunities for Ottoman women that knew Turkish and other foreign languages with a specific focus given to women through organizations such as the Ottoman School of Commerce which specifically opened a branch for women. The IOEW also provided women with administrative jobs and served as an intermediary for the school to allocate women students as interns in commercial and financial institutions throughout the country.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=CONCLUSION|pages=249\u2013254|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300241495|doi=10.2307/j.ctt2250vxg.22|title=Utopian Feminism|year=1992}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war the British press circulated false stories that Ottoman women took sniper roles in combat.

Raising prices of both staple items and consumer goods also rendered many women unable to subsist during these harsh conditions. Many homes were also commandeered by the military for various purposing forcing people, mostly women, because the vast majority of men were off fighting the war to sleep under trees and generally outside. To make this all worst there were deserters and refugees roaming vast areas in the Ottoman Empire plundering and stealing large stocks of goods such as maize and hazelnuts that were stockpiled to last the war. Worst of all perhaps was that state officials through the military were pressuring many village women to provide grain for the army at little to no compensation, grain that was once meant for their own subsistence would instead be taken away to feed the army. These war time conditions did not affect just women but did affect women most of all over men due to the forced conscription nature of the Ottoman Empire and the fact that women were the ones left to take care of villages and homes dotted throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ak\u0131n|first=Yi\u011fit|title=War, Women, and the State: The Politics of Sacrifice in the Ottoman Empire During the First World War|url=https://www.academia.edu/8349770|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=26|issue=3|pages=12\u201335|issn=1527-2036|doi=10.1353/jowh.2014.0040|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother shocking look at the lives of Ottoman women during the war was the frequency of petitioners to underline the martyrdom (sehitlik) of their sons and husbands to show the contribution of their men to the war effort.
