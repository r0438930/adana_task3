The area is administered by [[Dublin City Council]]. It was best known for decades as the location of [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)|St Brendan's Hospital]], which was the main psychiatric hospital serving the greater Dublin region. The area is currently the subject of a major redevelopment plan under the aegis of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], including the new [[Technological University Dublin]] campus.\n\nGrangegorman is also a [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the historical [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/2977.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Grangegorman civil parish</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Grangegorman, as with other [[placenames]] containing the name \"gorman\" in the [[Leinster]] region, probably indicates that at one time this territory was held by the [[U\u00ed Bairrche]], an [[Irish clans|Irish clan]] based in Leinster. The two main representatives of this clan were U\u00ed Treasaig (Tracey) and Mac Gorm\u00e1in (MacGorman).

Situated on North Brunswick Street, it now forms part of the Dublin operations of the Court Service.]]\nGrangegorman has evolved over time to its current boundaries, which, like those of most Dublin suburbs, are imprecise, while for the purposes of redevelopment, an extended \"neighbourhood\" was defined.  A major historic feature was the Bradogue River, now culverted but still cutting right through the area on its way to the [[River Liffey]].\n\n===Modern suburb of Grangegorman===\nGrangegorman is located in the [[Dublin 7]] [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]], north of the [[River Liffey]] and about 1&nbsp;km from [[Dublin]] city centre, and its boundaries run, approximately, along Brunswick Street North, Prussia Street and Manor Street, the [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]] and Phibsborough Road and Constitution Hill. Grangegorman is surrounded to the south east by [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] to the west by [[Stoneybatter]], north by [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], to the north and east by [[Phibsborough]] / [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]].\n\nThe geographical definition of the north Dublin [[District Electoral Division|electoral division]] known as Arran Quay B, encompasses Grangegorman. The 2006 [[Census#Ireland|Census]] gives the population of Arran Quay B as 3,692. This represents a 19.5 per cent increase from the population of the area in 2002.<ref name=cso20065960>{{cite book|last=Central Statistics Office, Ireland|year=2007|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Amended%20census2006_%20Volume%201%20Pop%20Classified%20by%20Area.pdf|title=Census 2006 Volume I: Population Defined by Area|location=Dublin|pages=59\u201360}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Grangegorman Development Agency|title=GDA Draft Strategic Plan 2010: Environmental Report|date=2 November 2010|location=Dublin|page=8 (chapter 6), fig 6.3|url=http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/assets/strategic_plan/GG_Strategic_Plan_Corrected_Environmental_Report.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===The historical civil parish of Grangegorman===\nGrangegorman [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] consisted of five separate districts comprising Grangegorman North, South, East, West and Middle.

As shown, the original quadrangular building of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum (1815) was built beside the new premises of the North Dublin Union. The Richmond Asylum also purchased land and constructed buildings on the western side of Grangegorman Lane. A tunnel running underground across Grangegorman Lane connected the east and west half of the Richmond's facilities. The original section on the eastern half became known as the \"lower house\" which that on the western side became known as the \"upper house\" or \"male house\". Not shown are the Hardwicke Fever Hospital (1803) or the Whitworth Chronic Hospital (1814) and its Dispensary (1820). These medical buildings were situated on Brunswick Street North or off Morning Star Avenue. This avenue is shown on the map although it is not named. It is the avenue leading northward from Brunswick Street North towards the North Dublin Union. The House of Industry (1773) became the North Dublin Union following the passage of the Irish Poor Law (1838).</ref>]]\n\nIn the fourteenth-century Dublin was a small walled city with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. At this time Grangegorman functioned as one of three home farms, the others being [[Glasnevin]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]), which served to meet the expenditure of the [[Prior]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at The Church of the Holy Trinity. The [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of this priory served The Church of the Holy Trinity, which was the State Church until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the sixteenth-century when it was re-established as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69, 72}}</ref> The farm buildings at Grangegorman consisted of one large hall with some rooms attached and an enclosed farmyard around which there stood a barn, a malthouse, a workshop and a haggard (a farm enclosure for stacking grain or hay, etc.).

The lease of Grangegorman dated 1485 refers to its lands as \"the Orchard\". With the dissolution of the monasteries, [[King Henry VIII]] on 10 May 1541 by [[letters patent]] authorised the transformation of the Prior and Canons of Christ Church to a [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]. The lease granted that same year refers to \"the Great Orchard\" and in 1542 to \"an orchard belonging to the Dean situate beyond the town of Oxmantown Green\". In 1560 the lease simply referred to '''\"the Dean's Orchard\"'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThe possession of the Manor of Grangegorman passed into the hands of Rt. Hon. Francis Agard after the formation of Dean and Chapter for the management of Christ Church Cathedral. Following Agard's death in 1577, this possession passed to the control of his son-in-law, [[Henry Harington (d. 1613)|Sir Henry Harrington]]. In the period after the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]], the residential expanse of Grangegorman consisted of forty houses. The Manor House at this time was held by Sir [[John Stanley (died 1674)|Thomas Stanley]]. It is assumed that the domicile to which the now defunct Stanley Street once led was the manorial house.<ref>{{cite book |author=Old Dublin Society |year=1945 |title=Dublin Historical Record |volume=7\u20139 |publisher=The Old Dublin Society|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&dq=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IdecUvuEHYWS7Aal-IFI&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg 67]}}</ref> This site is currently occupied by the Stanhope Street Convent of the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]].

In 1704 Dublin's first [[House of Industry]] was established on St. James's Street south of the River Liffey, on the site currently occupied by [[St. James's Hospital]]. However, from 1729 this institution was converted into the rather notorious [[Foundling hospital#Ireland|Dublin Foundling Hospital]]. In 1771\u201372 a philanthropic body called \"The Corporation for the Relief of the Poor\" was instituted following the passage of permissive legislation and this entity was responsible for the opening in 1773 of Dublin's second House of Industry<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tutty|first=M.J.|year=1961|title=Dublin's oldest charity|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=16|issue=3|page=73}}</ref> which was situated at the site of the derelict malthouse on Channel Row on what is now North Brunswick Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|year=1992|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|page=5}}</ref> Channel Row at this time was considered to form part of the locality of Glassmanogue to which also belonged the area known as Broadstone. The establishment of this institution was to be the single most important factor in shaping the urban character of Grangegorman as a site increasingly predominated by the presence of a range of institutions meeting nineteenth-century expectations of philanthropy, care and social control.<ref>The minutes of the Corporation's first meeting on Monday 3 August 1772 describes its purpose as a body in the following terms: 'The Corporation instituted for the relief of the Poor and for punishing Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars in the County of the City of Dublin'. Quoted in, {{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|page=45}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to site the House of Industry in this part of the city no doubt reflected the fact that the local population in Grangegorman and the surrounding districts of the north west of Dublin were and are overwhelming proletarian in nature. Indeed, this reflects a long-standing east-west divide in the city, which continues into the present day. In the parishes of St. Paul's and St. Michan's, resting either side of Smithfield in the north west, between 76 per cent and 79 per cent of the population were considered working class in 1797. Conversely, in the parishes of St. Thomas and St. George in the north east of the city the percentage of the population which was working class was 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Tommy|year=1944|title=Whitelaw's 1798 Census of Dublin|journal=History Ireland|volume=2|issue=3|page=14}}</ref> A degree of elite distaste toward the behaviour of working class populations is revealed in the visitation report of an episcopalian archbishop to the region of Grangegorman-Glassmanogue in 1727 when he described the local population, who lacked a church at this point, as lewd and unruly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Canon E.J.|year=1940|title=St. Michan's Parish in the eighteenth century|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=3|issue=1|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787 the Governors of the House of Industry considered the need for new accommodation to provide facilities for some two thousand inmates. The old malt house was in a ruinous condition and by the 1790s was deemed in danger of collapse. In September 1791 work began on the New House of Industry at a plot adjoining and to the north of the original building. The site of this building, now demolished, was located at the end of Morning Star Avenue. In 1798 the Governors of the House of Industry petitioned the [[Irish House of Commons]] to build a proper infirmary. Work on this, the Hardwicke Fever Hospital, began in 1803. To cope with the increasing number of children in the workhouse, the Bedford Asylum for Industrious Children, named after the then Lord Lieutenant and the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and designed by the noted architect, [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] to accommodate one thousand children, was constructed in 1806 on a site on North Brunswick Street. To care for the 'ruptured poor', the [[Richmond Surgical Hospital]] was opened in 1810. The building used for this hospital had been a convent constructed in 1688 by the [[Benedictine Nuns]] in Channel Row, opposite Red Cow Lane. Subsequently, it passed into the possession of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Nuns]] who largely rebuilt the structure. The hospital was subsequently rebuilt in 1900 in distinctive red-brick. This building still stands and from 1996 to 2013 functioned as the Dublin Metropolitan Court before being purchased by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which after extensive renovations reopened the building on 20th April 2018 (117 years to the day since the building was originally opened) as an education and events centre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therichmond.ie/history|title=History|website=The Richmond Education and Event Centre|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>.

Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand. The government agreed to fund the construction of an asylum and at the cost of \u00a32,000 lands adjoining and to the east of the site of the House of Industry were purchased and an architect, Francis Johnston, was appointed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=20\u20131}} {{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Brian |last2=Falvey |first2=Jane|chapter=A history of the Richmond Asylum (St. Brendan's Hospital), Dublin|editor=Hugh Freeman |editor2=German E.

Thereafter it was renamed the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum and its catchment area was defined as the city and county of Dublin, the counties of [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Meath|Meath]], and the town of [[Drogheda]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=24, 46}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)]]\n* [[Richmond General Penitentiary]]\n* [[Grangegorman Development Agency]]\n* [[Grangegorman killings]]\n* [[Grangegorman Military Cemetery]] which is located beside the [[Phoenix Park]]\n* [[List of subdivisions of County Dublin]]\n* [[Charles Monck, 1st Viscount Monck]] whose ancestors were from Grangegorman.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[http://www.cso.ie/ Central Statistics Office], [http://www.cso.ie/census/census_1971_results/Volume1/A%20C%201%201971%20V1.pdf ''Census of Population of Ireland 1971 Volume I: Population of District Electoral Divisions, Towns and Larger Units of Area''] (Dublin, July 1972).\n*[http://www.cso.ie/ Central Statistics Office], [http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Amended%20census2006_%20Volume%201%20Pop%20Classified%20by%20Area.pdf ''Census 2006 Volume I: Population Defined by Area''] (Dublin, 2007).\n*Cromwell, Thomas, [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/thomas-cromwell/excursions-through-ireland-comprising-topographical-and-historical-delineations-ala/page-4-excursions-through-ireland-comprising-topographical-and-historical-delineations-ala.shtml ''Excursions through Ireland'']\n*McGregor, John James, [https://archive.org/details/newpictureofdubl00mcgr <!-- quote=grange. --> ''New Picture of Dublin''](Dublin, 1821).\n\n{{Dublin residential areas}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://dublin1798.com/dublin09b.htm Map of Grangegorman region 1798]\n* [http://www.grangegorman.ie/ Grangegorman Community Museum]\n* [http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/ Grangegorman Development Agency]\n* [http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2005/a2105.pdf Grangegorman Development Agency Act]\n* [http://www.ditsu.ie/grangegorman Video of planned development of DIT Campus on Grangegorman site] (Flash Video software or a web browser supporting H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is necessary to see the content).\n* [http://www.nwicn.ie/ North West Inner City Network]\n* [http://grangegorman.org/ Grangegorman Community Forum]\n* [http://fiveprime.org/hivemind/Tags/dit,grangegorman Contemporary photographs of St. Brendan's Mental Hospital, Grangegorman from Flickr Hive Mind]\n* [http://www.stbrendansgaa.org/?sec=static/history History of St. Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman: St. Brendan's G.A.A.

It was best known for decades as the location of [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)|St Brendan's Hospital]], which was the main psychiatric hospital serving the greater Dublin region. The area is currently the subject of a major redevelopment plan under the aegis of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], including the new [[Technological University Dublin]] campus.\n\nGrangegorman is also a [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the historical [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/2977.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Grangegorman civil parish</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Grangegorman, as with other [[placenames]] containing the name \"gorman\" in the [[Leinster]] region, probably indicates that at one time this territory was held by the [[U\u00ed Bairrche]], an [[Irish clans|Irish clan]] based in Leinster. The two main representatives of this clan were U\u00ed Treasaig (Tracey) and Mac Gorm\u00e1in (MacGorman).

A major historic feature was the Bradogue River, now culverted but still cutting right through the area on its way to the [[River Liffey]].\n\n===Modern suburb of Grangegorman===\nGrangegorman is located in the [[Dublin 7]] [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]], north of the [[River Liffey]] and about 1&nbsp;km from [[Dublin]] city centre, and its boundaries run, approximately, along Brunswick Street North, Prussia Street and Manor Street, the [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]] and Phibsborough Road and Constitution Hill. Grangegorman is surrounded to the south east by [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] to the west by [[Stoneybatter]], north by [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], to the north and east by [[Phibsborough]] / [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]].\n\nThe geographical definition of the north Dublin [[District Electoral Division|electoral division]] known as Arran Quay B, encompasses Grangegorman. The 2006 [[Census#Ireland|Census]] gives the population of Arran Quay B as 3,692.

As shown, the original quadrangular building of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum (1815) was built beside the new premises of the North Dublin Union. The Richmond Asylum also purchased land and constructed buildings on the western side of Grangegorman Lane. A tunnel running underground across Grangegorman Lane connected the east and west half of the Richmond's facilities. The original section on the eastern half became known as the \"lower house\" which that on the western side became known as the \"upper house\" or \"male house\". Not shown are the Hardwicke Fever Hospital (1803) or the Whitworth Chronic Hospital (1814) and its Dispensary (1820). These medical buildings were situated on Brunswick Street North or off Morning Star Avenue. This avenue is shown on the map although it is not named. It is the avenue leading northward from Brunswick Street North towards the North Dublin Union. The House of Industry (1773) became the North Dublin Union following the passage of the Irish Poor Law (1838).</ref>]]\n\nIn the fourteenth-century Dublin was a small walled city with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. At this time Grangegorman functioned as one of three home farms, the others being [[Glasnevin]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]), which served to meet the expenditure of the [[Prior]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at The Church of the Holy Trinity. The [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of this priory served The Church of the Holy Trinity, which was the State Church until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the sixteenth-century when it was re-established as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69, 72}}</ref> The farm buildings at Grangegorman consisted of one large hall with some rooms attached and an enclosed farmyard around which there stood a barn, a malthouse, a workshop and a haggard (a farm enclosure for stacking grain or hay, etc.).

The lease of Grangegorman dated 1485 refers to its lands as \"the Orchard\". With the dissolution of the monasteries, [[King Henry VIII]] on 10 May 1541 by [[letters patent]] authorised the transformation of the Prior and Canons of Christ Church to a [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]. The lease granted that same year refers to \"the Great Orchard\" and in 1542 to \"an orchard belonging to the Dean situate beyond the town of Oxmantown Green\". In 1560 the lease simply referred to '''\"the Dean's Orchard\"'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThe possession of the Manor of Grangegorman passed into the hands of Rt. Hon. Francis Agard after the formation of Dean and Chapter for the management of Christ Church Cathedral. Following Agard's death in 1577, this possession passed to the control of his son-in-law, [[Henry Harington (d. 1613)|Sir Henry Harrington]]. In the period after the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]], the residential expanse of Grangegorman consisted of forty houses. The Manor House at this time was held by Sir [[John Stanley (died 1674)|Thomas Stanley]]. It is assumed that the domicile to which the now defunct Stanley Street once led was the manorial house.<ref>{{cite book |author=Old Dublin Society |year=1945 |title=Dublin Historical Record |volume=7\u20139 |publisher=The Old Dublin Society|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&dq=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IdecUvuEHYWS7Aal-IFI&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg 67]}}</ref> This site is currently occupied by the Stanhope Street Convent of the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]].

In 1704 Dublin's first [[House of Industry]] was established on St. James's Street south of the River Liffey, on the site currently occupied by [[St. James's Hospital]]. However, from 1729 this institution was converted into the rather notorious [[Foundling hospital#Ireland|Dublin Foundling Hospital]]. In 1771\u201372 a philanthropic body called \"The Corporation for the Relief of the Poor\" was instituted following the passage of permissive legislation and this entity was responsible for the opening in 1773 of Dublin's second House of Industry<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tutty|first=M.J.|year=1961|title=Dublin's oldest charity|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=16|issue=3|page=73}}</ref> which was situated at the site of the derelict malthouse on Channel Row on what is now North Brunswick Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|year=1992|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|page=5}}</ref> Channel Row at this time was considered to form part of the locality of Glassmanogue to which also belonged the area known as Broadstone. The establishment of this institution was to be the single most important factor in shaping the urban character of Grangegorman as a site increasingly predominated by the presence of a range of institutions meeting nineteenth-century expectations of philanthropy, care and social control.<ref>The minutes of the Corporation's first meeting on Monday 3 August 1772 describes its purpose as a body in the following terms: 'The Corporation instituted for the relief of the Poor and for punishing Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars in the County of the City of Dublin'. Quoted in, {{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|page=45}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to site the House of Industry in this part of the city no doubt reflected the fact that the local population in Grangegorman and the surrounding districts of the north west of Dublin were and are overwhelming proletarian in nature. Indeed, this reflects a long-standing east-west divide in the city, which continues into the present day. In the parishes of St. Paul's and St. Michan's, resting either side of Smithfield in the north west, between 76 per cent and 79 per cent of the population were considered working class in 1797. Conversely, in the parishes of St. Thomas and St. George in the north east of the city the percentage of the population which was working class was 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Tommy|year=1944|title=Whitelaw's 1798 Census of Dublin|journal=History Ireland|volume=2|issue=3|page=14}}</ref> A degree of elite distaste toward the behaviour of working class populations is revealed in the visitation report of an episcopalian archbishop to the region of Grangegorman-Glassmanogue in 1727 when he described the local population, who lacked a church at this point, as lewd and unruly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Canon E.J.|year=1940|title=St. Michan's Parish in the eighteenth century|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=3|issue=1|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787 the Governors of the House of Industry considered the need for new accommodation to provide facilities for some two thousand inmates. The old malt house was in a ruinous condition and by the 1790s was deemed in danger of collapse. In September 1791 work began on the New House of Industry at a plot adjoining and to the north of the original building. The site of this building, now demolished, was located at the end of Morning Star Avenue. In 1798 the Governors of the House of Industry petitioned the [[Irish House of Commons]] to build a proper infirmary. Work on this, the Hardwicke Fever Hospital, began in 1803. To cope with the increasing number of children in the workhouse, the Bedford Asylum for Industrious Children, named after the then Lord Lieutenant and the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and designed by the noted architect, [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] to accommodate one thousand children, was constructed in 1806 on a site on North Brunswick Street. To care for the 'ruptured poor', the [[Richmond Surgical Hospital]] was opened in 1810. The building used for this hospital had been a convent constructed in 1688 by the [[Benedictine Nuns]] in Channel Row, opposite Red Cow Lane. Subsequently, it passed into the possession of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Nuns]] who largely rebuilt the structure. The hospital was subsequently rebuilt in 1900 in distinctive red-brick. This building still stands and currently functions as the Dublin Metropolitan Court. In 1814 the [[Whitworth Hospital]] for chronic patients was built on a site just to the south of the new House of Industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and sturdy beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|pages=66\u20139}}</ref> On 24 April 1820, the Talbot dispensary was opened and attached to the Richmond Surgical Hospital to afford relief to those among the sick poor who were not considered suitable for hospital accommodation and were resident in the north west district of Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thom|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Thom (almanac editor)|year=1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=518NAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA715|title=Thom's Directory of Ireland|location=Dublin|page=715}}</ref>\n\n===Richmond General Penitentiary===\n[[File:Richmond Penitentiary Architectural Drawing Francis Johnson 1811.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural drawing of the Richmond General Penitentiary by Francis Johnston (1811)]]\n{{Main|Richmond General Penitentiary}}\n\nIn 1810, the Governors of the House Industry were instructed by the Lord Lieutenant to purchase land for the construction of a penitentiary. They obtained a three half acre site from Lord Monck in Grangegorman which was at that time planted with apple and pear trees.  They were assigned the task of overseeing the building of the institution that would be known as the Richmond General Penitentiary.

Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand.

It was named after Charles Lennox who was the Duke of Richmond and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1807\u20131813).
