His first printed work was a translation of [[Horace]]'s epistle to [[Maecenas]], published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.\n\nHis family tutor was [[Semyon Raich]], a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of [[Moscow University]]. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count [[Ostermann-Tolstoy]], to [[Munich]] to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.\n\nIn Munich he fell in love with [[Amalie Adlerberg|Amalie von Lerchenfeld]], the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem ''Tears'' or ''Slyozy'' (''Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...'') coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Am\u00e9lie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are ''K. N.'', and ''Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe\u2026'' Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822\u20131826), giving details of his [[frustration|frustrated]] love affair for Am\u00e9lie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron [[Alexander von Kr\u00fcdener]]), in January 1825. Am\u00e9lie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Kr\u00fcdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title ''K.B.'' (''Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe''), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Am\u00e9lie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer.<ref>Nikolayev, A.A., 'Zagaka \"K.B.\"', ''Neva'', 1988, No. 2, pp. 190-196.</ref> Tyutchev's last meeting with Am\u00e9lie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: \n<blockquote>\nYesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Kr\u00fcdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.<ref>F.I. Tyutchev, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniy i pis'ma'', 6 vols., Moscow, 2002-2005. VI, p. 416.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], n\u00e9e Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von D\u00f6rnberg]], n\u00e9e von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. \n[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]\n\nIn 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).\n\nIn 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.\n\nTyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.\n\nAs a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.\n\nIn 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.\n\n==Political views==\n[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffel family|von Pfeffel]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]\nTyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.\n\nOn domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.\n\nHis fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: \n{{Quotation|\n:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?\n:For her no yardstick was created:\n:Her soul is of a special kind,\n:By faith alone appreciated.\n:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}\n\n== Poetry ==\n\nTyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.\n\nThe 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].\n\n== Sample of verse ==\n\n''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} \n[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]\n:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal\n:the way you dream, the things you feel.\n:Deep in your spirit let them rise\n:akin to stars in crystal skies\n:that set before the night is blurred:\n:delight in them and speak no word.\n\n:How can a heart expression find?\n:How should another know your mind?\n:Will he discern what quickens you?\n:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.\n:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:\n:drink at the source and speak no word.\n\n:Live in your inner self alone\n:within your soul a world has grown,\n:the magic of veiled thoughts that might\n:be blinded by the outer light,\n:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...\n:take in their song and speak no word. \n:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])\n\nIncidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Bj\u00f6rk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem \u201cNous avons pu tous deux\u2026\u201d by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afanasy Fet]]\n* [[List of 19th-century Russian Slavophiles]]\n\n==References==\n*{{note|nasledstvo}} Literaturnoe nasledstvo.

He was to remain abroad for 22 years.\n\nIn Munich he fell in love with [[Amalie Adlerberg|Amalie von Lerchenfeld]], the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem ''Tears'' or ''Slyozy'' (''Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...'') coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Am\u00e9lie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are ''K. N.'', and ''Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe\u2026'' Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822\u20131826), giving details of his [[frustration|frustrated]] love affair for Am\u00e9lie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron [[Alexander von Kr\u00fcdener]]), in January 1825. Am\u00e9lie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Kr\u00fcdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title ''K.B.'' (''Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe''), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Am\u00e9lie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer.<ref>Nikolayev, A.A., 'Zagaka \"K.B.\"', ''Neva'', 1988, No. 2, pp. 190-196.</ref> Tyutchev's last meeting with Am\u00e9lie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: \n<blockquote>\nYesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Kr\u00fcdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.<ref>F.I. Tyutchev, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniy i pis'ma'', 6 vols., Moscow, 2002-2005. VI, p. 416.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], n\u00e9e Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von D\u00f6rnberg]], n\u00e9e von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. \n[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]\n\nIn 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).\n\nIn 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.\n\nTyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.\n\nAs a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.\n\nIn 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.\n\n==Political views==\n[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffer family|von Pfeffer]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]\nTyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.\n\nOn domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.\n\nHis fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: \n{{Quotation|\n:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?\n:For her no yardstick was created:\n:Her soul is of a special kind,\n:By faith alone appreciated.\n:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}\n\n== Poetry ==\n\nTyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.\n\nThe 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].\n\n== Sample of verse ==\n\n''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} \n[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]\n:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal\n:the way you dream, the things you feel.\n:Deep in your spirit let them rise\n:akin to stars in crystal skies\n:that set before the night is blurred:\n:delight in them and speak no word.\n\n:How can a heart expression find?\n:How should another know your mind?\n:Will he discern what quickens you?\n:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.\n:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:\n:drink at the source and speak no word.\n\n:Live in your inner self alone\n:within your soul a world has grown,\n:the magic of veiled thoughts that might\n:be blinded by the outer light,\n:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...\n:take in their song and speak no word. \n:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])\n\nIncidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Bj\u00f6rk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem \u201cNous avons pu tous deux\u2026\u201d by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afanasy Fet]]\n* [[List of 19th-century Russian Slavophiles]]\n\n==References==\n*{{note|nasledstvo}} Literaturnoe nasledstvo.
