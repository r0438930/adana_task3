Because of this, they came to be considered an untouchable caste.  M. Srinivasa Aiyangar finds this etymology unsatisfactory, arguing that beating of drums could not have been an occupation of many people. Some other writers, such as [[Gustav Solomon Oppert]], derive the name from ''poraian'', the name of a regional subdivision mentioned by ancient Tamil grammarians.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=2-3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-British period ===\nThe [[Sangam literature]] ({{circa}} 300 BCE\u2013300 CE) contains references to the caste system of Tamil culture, which contained a number of \"low-born\" groups referred to variously as ''Pulaiyar'' and ''Kinaiyar''. They were believed to be associated with magical power and kept at a distance, made to live in separate hamlets outside villages. However, their magical power was believed to sustain the king, who had the ability to transform it into auspicious power. [[George L. Hart]] believes that one of the drums called ''ki\u1e47ai'' later came to be called ''pa\u1e5fai'' and the people that played the drum were ''pa\u1e5faiyar'' (plural of ''pa\u1e5faiyan'').<ref>{{cite book |last=Hart |first=George L. |authorlink=George L.

He was probably the same as the modern ''Pa\u1e5faiyan''.}}\n</ref>{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|pp=36-37}} Thus the ''pulaiyar'' performed a ritual function by composing and singing songs in the king's favour and beating drums. They were divided into subgroups based on the instruments they played.\n\nThe Sangam literature also quotes the Paraiyars as being farmers and rulers. They were referred to as ''Eiyinars'' .The word \"''Eiyinar''\" refers to those who built ''Eiyils'' (fortresses). As the Paraiyas were experts in the art of building fortifications, they may well have earned this name. It is also mentioned that the Paraiyars had their own priests, carpenters, shoe-makers, weavers, washer men, and hair dressers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tamil Studies|last=Iyengar|first=M.Srinivasa|date=1998|publisher=Madras : Guardian press|isbn= 8120600290|location=|pages=81|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest extant reference to the term Paraiyar (as an occupational term for drummers) occurs in a poem by the Sangam poet Mangudi Kilar (2nd century CE). But the earliest mention of the term as a caste does not occur until the reign of [[Rajaraja Chola]] (11th century CE).{{sfnp|Basu|2011|p=3}} From this period onwards, the word occurs in different contexts in the various pre-British sources:\n* Inscriptions, especially those from the [[Thanjavur district]], mention ''paraicceri''s, which were separate hamlets of the Paraiyars.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}} Also living in separate hamlets were the artisans such as goldsmiths and cobblers, who were also accorded low status in the Sangam literature.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=38}}\n* In a few inscriptions (all of them from outside Thanjavur district), Paraiyars are described as temple patrons.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}}\n* There are also references to \"Paraiya chieftainships\" in the 8th and 10th centuries, but it is not known what these were and how they were integrated into the Chola political system.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=38}}\n* According to the [[Later Cholas|Later Chola]] inscriptions, someone who breaks the terms of an endowment is to be considered as degraded as a man who gives his wife to a Paraiyar.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}}\n\n[[Burton Stein]] describes an essentially continuous process of expansion of the nuclear areas of the caste society into forest and upland areas of tribal and warrior people, and their integration into the caste society at the lowest levels. Many of the forest groups were incorporated as Paraiyar either by association with the ''parai'' drum or by integration into the low-status labouring groups who were generically called Paraiyar. Thus, it is thought that Paraiyar came to have many subcastes.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=41}}\n\nDuring the [[Bhakti movement]] ({{circa}} 7th\u20139th centuries CE), the saints - [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] [[Nayanars]] and the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] [[Alvars]] - contained one saint each from the untouchable communities. The Nayanar saint [[Nandanar]] was born, according to ''[[Periya Puranam]]'', in a \"threshold of the huts covered with strips of leather\", with mango trees from whose branches were hung drums. \"In this abode of the people of the lowest caste (''kadainar''), there arose a man with a feeling of true devotion to the feet of [[Shiva|Siva]].\" Nandanar was described as a temple servant and leather worker, who supplied straps for drums and gut-string for stringed instruments used in the [[Chidambaram]] temple, but he was himself not allowed to enter the temple.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|pp=38-39}} The Paraiyar regard Nandanar as one of their own caste.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vincentnathan |first=Lynn |title=Nandanar: Untouchable Saint and Caste Hindu Anomaly |journal=Ethos |volume=21 |number=2 |date=June 1993 |pages=154\u2013179 |jstor=640372  |doi=10.1525/eth.1993.21.2.02a00020}}</ref> Paraiyars wear the [[sacred thread]] under rituals such as marriage and funeral.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Caste System in Tamil Nadu|last=Kolappa Pillay|first=Kanakasabhapathi|date=1977|publisher=University of Madras|isbn=|location=|pages=33|language=en}}</ref>\n\nScholars such as Burchett and Moffatt state that the Bhakti devotationalism did not undermine Brahmin ritual dominance.

Some of them also practised native medicine and [[astrology]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Early Settlements in Jaffna: An Archaeological Survey|last=Ragupathy|first=Ponnampalam|date=1987|publisher=University of Jaffna: Thillimalar Ragupathy|isbn=|location=|pages=210|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== British colonial era ===\nBy the early 19th century, the Paraiyars had a degraded status in the Tamil society.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|p=16}} [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Francis Buchanan]]'s report on socio-economic condition of South Indians described them (\"Pariar\") as inferior caste slaves, who cultivated the lands held by [[Brahmin]]s. This report largely shaped the perceptions of the British officials about contemporary society. They regarded Pariyars as an outcaste, untouchable community.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=2}} In the second half of the 19th century, there were frequent descriptions of the Paraiyars in official documents and reformist tracts as being \"disinherited sons of the earth\".{{sfnp|Irschick|1994|pp=153\u2013190}}{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=68}} The first reference to the idea may be that written by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] in 1818, where he writes that the Paraiyars \"affect to consider themselves as the real proprietors of the soil\". In 1894, William Goudie, a [[Wesleyanism|Weslyan]] missionary, said that the Paraiyars were self-evidently the \"disinherited children of the soil\".{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=68}} English officials such as Ellis believed that the Paraiyars were [[serf]]s toiling under a system of bonded labour that resembled the European [[villeinage]].{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=9-11}} However, scholars such as Burton Stein argue that the agricultural bondage in Tamil society was different from the contemporary British ideas of [[slavery]].{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=4}}\n\nHistorians such as David Washbrook have argued that the socio-economic status of the Paraiyars rose greatly in the 18th century during the [[Company rule in India]]; Washbrook calls it the \"Golden Age of the Pariah\".{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=33-34}} Raj Sekhar Basu disagrees with this narrative, although he agrees that there were \"certain important economic developments\".{{sfnp|Basu|2011|p=39}}\n\nThe [[Church Mission Society]] converted many Paraiyars to Christianity by the early 19th century.{{sfnp|Kanjamala|2014|p=127}} During the British Raj, the missionary schools and colleges admitted Paraiyar students amid opposition from the upper-caste students. In 1893, the colonial government sanctioned an additional stipend for the Paraiyar students.{{sfnp|Kanjamala|2014|p=66}} The colonial officials, scholars, and missionaries attempted to rewrite the history of the Paraiyars, characterising them as a community that enjoyed a high status in the past. [[Edgar Thurston]] (1855-1935), for example, claimed that their status was nearly equal to that of the Brahmins in the past.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=24-26}} H. A. Stuart, in his Census Report of 1891, claimed that [[Valluvar|Valluvans]] were a priestly class among the Paraiyars, and served as priests during [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] reign. Robert Caldwell, [[J. H. A. Tremenheere]] and Edward Jewitt Robinson claimed that the ancient poet-philosopher [[Thiruvalluvar]] was a Paraiyar.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=19-21}}\n\n=== Buddhist advocacy by Iyothee Thass ===\n[[Iyothee Thass]], a [[Siddha medicine|Siddha doctor]] by occupation, belonged to a Paraiyar elite. In 1892, he demanded access for Paraiyars to Hindu temples, but faced resistance from upper-caste [[Brahmin]]s and [[Vellalar]]s. This experience led him to believe that it was impossible to emancipate the community within the Hindu fold. In 1893, he also rejected [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] as the alternatives to Hinduism, because caste differences had [[Caste system among Indian Christians|persisted among Indian Christians]], while the backwardness of contemporary local Muslims made Islam unappealing.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=70}}\n\nThass subsequently attempted a Buddhist reconstruction of the Tamil religious history. He argued that the Paraiyars were originally followers of [[Buddhism in India|Buddhism]] and constituted the original population of India. According to him, the Brahmanical invaders from [[Persia]] defeated them and destroyed Buddhism in southern India; as a result, the Paraiyars lost their culture, religion, wealth and status in the society and become destitute. In 1898, Thass and many of his followers converted to Buddhism and founded the Sakya Buddha Society (''c\u0101kkaiya putta ca\u1e45kam'') with the influential mediation of [[Henry Steel Olcott]] of the [[Theosophical Society]]. Olcott subsequently and greatly supported the Tamil Paraiyar Buddhists.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|pp=67-71}}\n\n=== Controversy over the community's name ===\nIyothee Thass felt that ''Paraiyar'' was a [[pejorative|slur]], and campaigned against its usage. During the 1881 [[Census of India prior to independence|census of India]], he requested the government to record the community members under the name ''Aboriginal Tamils''. He later suggested ''Dravidian'' as an alternative term, and formed the Dhraavidar Mahajana Sabhai (Dravidian [[Mahajana]] Assembly) in 1891. Another Paraiyar leader, [[Rettamalai Srinivasan]], however, advocated using the term ''Paraiyar'' with pride. In 1892, he formed the Parayar Mahajana Sabha (Paraiyar Mahajana Assembly), and also started a news publication titled ''Paraiyan''.{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}}\n\nThass continued his campaign against the term, and petitioned the government to discontinue its usage, demanding punishment for those who used the term. He incorrectly claimed that the term ''Paraiyar'' was not found in any ancient records (it has been, in fact, found in the 10th century [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] stone inscriptions from [[Kolar district]]).{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}} Thass subsequently advocated the term ''[[Adi Dravida]]'' (''Original Dravidians'') to describe the community. In 1892, he used the term ''Adidravida Jana Sabhai'' to describe an organisation, which was probably Srinivasan's Parayar Mahajana Sabha. In 1895, he established the People\u2019s Assembly of Urdravidians (Adidravida Jana Sabha), which probably split off from Srinivasan's organisation. According to Michael Bergunder, Thass was thus the first person to introduce the concept of ''Adi Dravida'' into political discussion.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=69}}\n\nAnother Paraiyar leader, M. C. Rajah&nbsp;\u2014 a [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] councillor&nbsp;\u2014 made successful efforts for adoption of the term ''Adi-Dravidar'' in the government records.{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}} In 1914, the [[Madras Legislative Council]] passed a resolution that officially censured the usage of the term ''Paraiyar'' to refer to a specific community, and recommended ''Adi Dravidar'' as an alternative.{{sfnp|Bergunder|Frese|Schr\u00f6der|2011|p=260}} In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] ensured the wider dissemination of the term ''Adi Dravida''.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=69}}\n\n== Right-hand caste faction ==\nParaiyars belong to the ''[[Valangai]]'' (\"Right-hand caste faction\"). Some of them assume the title ''Valangamattan'' (\"people of the right-hand division\"). The ''Valangai''  comprised castes with an agricultural basis while the ''[[Idangai]]'' consisted of castes involved in manufacturing.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Epigraphy/epig_tambarammore.htm|title=More inscriptions from the Tambaram area |accessdate=21 September 2008|first=Gift |last=Siromoney|journal=Madras Christian College Magazine |volume=44 |year=1975}}</ref> ''Valangai'', which was better organised politically.<ref>{{cite book |title=Caste Ideology and Interaction |volume=9 |series=Cambridge Papers in Social Anthropology |editor-first=Dennis B. |editor-last=McGilvray |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-52124-145-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/casteideologyint0000unse/page/105 105] |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n-88AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA105 |first=Stephen C. |last=Levinson |chapter=Caste rank and verbal interaction in western Tamilnadu |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/casteideologyint0000unse }}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n=== Religious and spiritual leaders ===\n*[[Poykayil Yohannan]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mylapore Institute for Indigenous Studies|author2=I.S.P.C.K.

Because of this, they came to be considered an untouchable caste.  M. Srinivasa Aiyangar finds this etymology unsatisfactory, arguing that beating of drums could not have been an occupation of many people. Some other writers, such as [[Gustav Solomon Oppert]], derive the name from ''poraian'', the name of a regional subdivision mentioned by ancient Tamil grammarians.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=2-3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-British period ===\nThe [[Sangam literature]] ({{circa}} 300 BCE\u2013300 CE) contains references to the caste system of Tamil culture, which contained a number of \"low-born\" groups referred to variously as ''Pulaiyar'' and ''Kinaiyar''. They were believed to be associated with magical power and kept at a distance, made to live in separate hamlets outside villages. However, their magical power was believed to sustain the king, who had the ability to transform it into auspicious power. [[George L. Hart]] believes that one of the drums called ''ki\u1e47ai'' later came to be called ''pa\u1e5fai'' and the people that played the drum were ''pa\u1e5faiyar'' (plural of ''pa\u1e5faiyan'').<ref>{{cite book |last=Hart |first=George L. |authorlink=George L.

They were divided into subgroups based on the instruments they played.\n\nThe Sangam literature also quotes the Paraiyars as being farmers and rulers. They were referred to as ''Eiyinars'' .The word \"''Eiyinar''\" refers to those who built ''Eiyils'' (fortresses). As the Paraiyas were experts in the art of building fortifications, they may well have earned this name. It is also mentioned that the Paraiyars had their own priests, carpenters, shoe-makers, weavers, washer men, and hair dressers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tamil Studies|last=Iyengar|first=M.Srinivasa|date=1998|publisher=Madras : Guardian press|isbn= 8120600290|location=|pages=81|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest extant reference to the term Paraiyar (as an occupational term for drummers) occurs in a poem by the Sangam poet Mangudi Kilar (2nd century CE). But the earliest mention of the term as a caste does not occur until the reign of [[Rajaraja Chola]] (11th century CE).{{sfnp|Basu|2011|p=3}} From this period onwards, the word occurs in different contexts in the various pre-British sources:\n* Inscriptions, especially those from the [[Thanjavur district]], mention ''paraicceri''s, which were separate hamlets of the Paraiyars.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}} Also living in separate hamlets were the artisans such as goldsmiths and cobblers, who were also accorded low status in the Sangam literature.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=38}}\n* In a few inscriptions (all of them from outside Thanjavur district), Paraiyars are described as temple patrons.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}}\n* There are also references to \"Paraiya chieftainships\" in the 8th and 10th centuries, but it is not known what these were and how they were integrated into the Chola political system.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=38}}\n* According to the [[Later Cholas|Later Chola]] inscriptions, someone who breaks the terms of an endowment is to be considered as degraded as a man who gives his wife to a Paraiyar.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}}\n\n[[Burton Stein]] describes an essentially continuous process of expansion of the nuclear areas of the caste society into forest and upland areas of tribal and warrior people, and their integration into the caste society at the lowest levels. Many of the forest groups were incorporated as Paraiyar either by association with the ''parai'' drum or by integration into the low-status labouring groups who were generically called Paraiyar. Thus, it is thought that Paraiyar came to have many subcastes.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=41}}\n\nDuring the [[Bhakti movement]] ({{circa}} 7th\u20139th centuries CE), the saints - [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] [[Nayanars]] and the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] [[Alvars]] - contained one saint each from the untouchable communities. The Nayanar saint [[Nandanar]] was born, according to ''[[Periya Puranam]]'', in a \"threshold of the huts covered with strips of leather\", with mango trees from whose branches were hung drums. \"In this abode of the people of the lowest caste (''kadainar''), there arose a man with a feeling of true devotion to the feet of [[Shiva|Siva]].\" Nandanar was described as a temple servant and leather worker, who supplied straps for drums and gut-string for stringed instruments used in the [[Chidambaram]] temple, but he was himself not allowed to enter the temple.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|pp=38-39}} The Paraiyar regard Nandanar as one of their own caste.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vincentnathan |first=Lynn |title=Nandanar: Untouchable Saint and Caste Hindu Anomaly |journal=Ethos |volume=21 |number=2 |date=June 1993 |pages=154\u2013179 |jstor=640372  |doi=10.1525/eth.1993.21.2.02a00020}}</ref> Paraiyars wear the [[sacred thread]] under rituals such as marriage and funeral.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Caste System in Tamil Nadu|last=Kolappa Pillay|first=Kanakasabhapathi|date=1977|publisher=University of Madras|isbn=|location=|pages=33|language=en}}</ref>\n\nScholars such as Burchett and Moffatt state that the Bhakti devotationalism did not undermine Brahmin ritual dominance.

This report largely shaped the perceptions of the British officials about contemporary society. They regarded Pariyars as an outcaste, untouchable community.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=2}} In the second half of the 19th century, there were frequent descriptions of the Paraiyars in official documents and reformist tracts as being \"disinherited sons of the earth\".{{sfnp|Irschick|1994|pp=153\u2013190}}{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=68}} The first reference to the idea may be that written by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] in 1818, where he writes that the Paraiyars \"affect to consider themselves as the real proprietors of the soil\". In 1894, William Goudie, a [[Wesleyanism|Weslyan]] missionary, said that the Paraiyars were self-evidently the \"disinherited children of the soil\".{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=68}} English officials such as Ellis believed that the Paraiyars were [[serf]]s toiling under a system of bonded labour that resembled the European [[villeinage]].{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=9-11}} However, scholars such as Burton Stein argue that the agricultural bondage in Tamil society was different from the contemporary British ideas of [[slavery]].{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=4}}\n\nHistorians such as David Washbrook have argued that the socio-economic status of the Paraiyars rose greatly in the 18th century during the [[Company rule in India]]; Washbrook calls it the \"Golden Age of the Pariah\".{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=33-34}} Raj Sekhar Basu disagrees with this narrative, although he agrees that there were \"certain important economic developments\".{{sfnp|Basu|2011|p=39}}\n\nThe [[Church Mission Society]] converted many Paraiyars to Christianity by the early 19th century.{{sfnp|Kanjamala|2014|p=127}} During the British Raj, the missionary schools and colleges admitted Paraiyar students amid opposition from the upper-caste students. In 1893, the colonial government sanctioned an additional stipend for the Paraiyar students.{{sfnp|Kanjamala|2014|p=66}} The colonial officials, scholars, and missionaries attempted to rewrite the history of the Paraiyars, characterising them as a community that enjoyed a high status in the past. [[Edgar Thurston]] (1855-1935), for example, claimed that their status was nearly equal to that of the Brahmins in the past.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=24-26}} H. A. Stuart, in his Census Report of 1891, claimed that [[Valluvar|Valluvans]] were a priestly class among the Paraiyars, and served as priests during [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] reign. Robert Caldwell, [[J. H. A. Tremenheere]] and Edward Jewitt Robinson claimed that the ancient poet-philosopher [[Thiruvalluvar]] was a Paraiyar.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=19-21}}\n\n=== Buddhist advocacy by Iyothee Thass ===\n[[Iyothee Thass]], a [[Siddha medicine|Siddha doctor]] by occupation, belonged to a Paraiyar elite. In 1892, he demanded access for Paraiyars to Hindu temples, but faced resistance from upper-caste [[Brahmin]]s and [[Vellalar]]s. This experience led him to believe that it was impossible to emancipate the community within the Hindu fold. In 1893, he also rejected [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] as the alternatives to Hinduism, because caste differences had [[Caste system among Indian Christians|persisted among Indian Christians]], while the backwardness of contemporary local Muslims made Islam unappealing.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=70}}\n\nThass subsequently attempted a Buddhist reconstruction of the Tamil religious history. He argued that the Paraiyars were originally followers of [[Buddhism in India|Buddhism]] and constituted the original population of India. According to him, the Brahmanical invaders from [[Persia]] defeated them and destroyed Buddhism in southern India; as a result, the Paraiyars lost their culture, religion, wealth and status in the society and become destitute. In 1898, Thass and many of his followers converted to Buddhism and founded the Sakya Buddha Society (''c\u0101kkaiya putta ca\u1e45kam'') with the influential mediation of [[Henry Steel Olcott]] of the [[Theosophical Society]]. Olcott subsequently and greatly supported the Tamil Paraiyar Buddhists.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|pp=67-71}}\n\n=== Controversy over the community's name ===\nIyothee Thass felt that ''Paraiyar'' was a [[pejorative|slur]], and campaigned against its usage. During the 1881 [[Census of India prior to independence|census of India]], he requested the government to record the community members under the name ''Aboriginal Tamils''. He later suggested ''Dravidian'' as an alternative term, and formed the Dhraavidar Mahajana Sabhai (Dravidian [[Mahajana]] Assembly) in 1891. Another Paraiyar leader, [[Rettamalai Srinivasan]], however, advocated using the term ''Paraiyar'' with pride. In 1892, he formed the Parayar Mahajana Sabha (Paraiyar Mahajana Assembly), and also started a news publication titled ''Paraiyan''.{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}}\n\nThass continued his campaign against the term, and petitioned the government to discontinue its usage, demanding punishment for those who used the term. He incorrectly claimed that the term ''Paraiyar'' was not found in any ancient records (it has been, in fact, found in the 10th century [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] stone inscriptions from [[Kolar district]]).{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}} Thass subsequently advocated the term ''[[Adi Dravida]]'' (''Original Dravidians'') to describe the community. In 1892, he used the term ''Adidravida Jana Sabhai'' to describe an organisation, which was probably Srinivasan's Parayar Mahajana Sabha. In 1895, he established the People\u2019s Assembly of Urdravidians (Adidravida Jana Sabha), which probably split off from Srinivasan's organisation. According to Michael Bergunder, Thass was thus the first person to introduce the concept of ''Adi Dravida'' into political discussion.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=69}}\n\nAnother Paraiyar leader, M. C. Rajah&nbsp;\u2014 a [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] councillor&nbsp;\u2014 made successful efforts for adoption of the term ''Adi-Dravidar'' in the government records.{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}} In 1914, the [[Madras Legislative Council]] passed a resolution that officially censured the usage of the term ''Paraiyar'' to refer to a specific community, and recommended ''Adi Dravidar'' as an alternative.{{sfnp|Bergunder|Frese|Schr\u00f6der|2011|p=260}} In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] ensured the wider dissemination of the term ''Adi Dravida''.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=69}}\n\n== Right-hand caste faction ==\nParaiyars belong to the ''[[Valangai]]'' (\"Right-hand caste faction\"). Some of them assume the title ''Valangamattan'' (\"people of the right-hand division\"). The ''Valangai''  comprised castes with an agricultural basis while the ''[[Idangai]]'' consisted of castes involved in manufacturing.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Epigraphy/epig_tambarammore.htm|title=More inscriptions from the Tambaram area |accessdate=21 September 2008|first=Gift |last=Siromoney|journal=Madras Christian College Magazine |volume=44 |year=1975}}</ref> ''Valangai'', which was better organised politically.<ref>{{cite book |title=Caste Ideology and Interaction |volume=9 |series=Cambridge Papers in Social Anthropology |editor-first=Dennis B. |editor-last=McGilvray |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-52124-145-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/casteideologyint0000unse/page/105 105] |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n-88AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA105 |first=Stephen C. |last=Levinson |chapter=Caste rank and verbal interaction in western Tamilnadu |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/casteideologyint0000unse }}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n=== Religious and spiritual leaders ===\n*[[Poykayil Yohannan]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mylapore Institute for Indigenous Studies|author2=I.S.P.C.K.
