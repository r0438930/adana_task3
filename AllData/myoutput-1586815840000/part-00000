At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington\u2013Arlington\u2013Alexandria, DC\u2013VA\u2013MD\u2013WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.\n\nGaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.\n\nThe [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg.

The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites.

Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.\n\nGaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.\n\nThe [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg.

The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites.
