In the opener, [[Michael Westen]] (Jeffrey Donovan) finds himself cut off from his contacts and his cash, so he agrees to help a man clear his name in a high-priced [[art theft]]. Along the way he gets help from his ex-girlfriend and a retired Navy SEAL, and grief from his mother, who is unaware of his career.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile on assignment in [[Nigeria]], covert operative [[Michael Westen]] learns that he's been \"[[Burn notice (document)|burned]]\". For a spy, it is the equivalent of being fired. A burned spy is blacklisted from all government agencies and resources; his bank accounts are frozen and his credit is trashed. Michael barely escapes Nigeria and wakes up, battered, in a motel in [[Miami, Florida]]. In order to survive and fund his own personal investigation, Michael enlists the help of the only two \"friends\" he has: [[Fiona Glenanne]], an ex-[[List of organisations known as the Irish Republican Army|IRA]] operative who also happens to be an ex-girlfriend, and [[Sam Axe]], a [[List of Burn Notice episodes#Prequel|washed-out military intelligence]] contact who has been under surveillance by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). He is also forced to deal with the family he went halfway around the world to get away from\u2014particularly his mother, [[Madeline Westen]], who could not be happier to have her son back in town.\n\nThrough former spy-turned-security consultant Lucy Chen\u2014whom Michael helped learn the trade\u2014he gets a lead on a small investigation job: a caretaker of an estate, Javier ([[David Zayas]]), has been accused of stealing valuable art from his employer, Graham Pyne ([[Ray Wise]]). All evidence points to it being an inside job and Javier, with very little money to offer, has nowhere else to turn. When Michael begins to dig around, he quickly discovers that it was in fact an inside job: Pyne orchestrated the robbery and framed Javier in order to collect insurance.\n\nMichael confronts Pyne with the incriminating evidence. When Pyne and his bodyguard come after Javier and his son, Michael is already a step ahead of them and has set up a trap at Javier's house. After the smoke clears, Pyne has accidentally shot his bodyguard, and Michael has enough evidence to send both of them to jail for conspiracy to commit kidnapping. With the mounting evidence hanging over his head, Pyne agrees to clear Javier's name and provide financial support to Javier and his son.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael keeps trying to get in touch with his old government handler, Dan Siebels ([[Dan Martin (actor)|Dan Martin]]), who will not accept his calls. Deciding to get creative, Michael resorts to mailing Siebels a fake bomb in order to get his attention. The ploy works, and Michael finally gets to confront Siebels about the burn notice. Siebels believes Michael has probably been framed and there is nothing he can do to help him, but that he still has allies within the Agency. He tells Michael not to leave Miami, unless he wants a FBI manhunt after him. To top it all off, Michael returns home to find his door open and the floor covered with surveillance photos. It is not the FBI, but whoever it is, they have been tracking his every move. And they have left a message: \"Welcome to Miami.\"\n\n==Production==\nThe pilot was originally produced to be shown as a two-hour movie or as two one-hour episodes.
