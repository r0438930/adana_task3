Camps are run on broadly [[anarchist]] principles - free to attend, supported by donations and with input from everyone in the community for the day-to-day operation of the camp. Initiated in the [[UK]], camps have taken place in [[England]] at [[Drax power station]], [[Heathrow Airport]], [[Kingsnorth power station]] in [[Kent]], the [[City of London]] and [[The Royal Bank of Scotland]] Headquarters, near [[Edinburgh]]. During 2009 camps also took place in [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands]]/[[Belgium]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Australia]].\n\nThe Camp for Climate Action, first came into being in 2006, after activists at the [[31st G8 summit#Activism|2005 G8 conference]] in Stirling in Scotland mooted the idea.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zee |first1=Bibi van der |title=Climate Camp disbanded |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/02/climate-camp-disbanded |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=2 March 2011 |language=en |quote=One activist remembers: \"We built a camp up in Scotland, and had about 4,000-5,000 people there, and after we pulled that off, we realised that actually, now we had the infrastructure to try something like this.
