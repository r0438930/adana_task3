These are ''branco'' (white), ''preto'' (black), ''pardo'' (brown, or multi-racial), ''amarelo'' (yellow, or Asian), and ''ind\u00edgena'' (indigenous). Because there was never a legal genetic definition for these categories, throughout history, each of these racial groups has been defined in different ways. Racial classification in Brazilian society is often inconsistent and influenced by a myriad of factors including: class, status, education, location and [[phenotype]].<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, a light-skinned multiracial person who held an important, well-paying position in society may be considered ''branco'' while someone else with the same [[Ethnogenesis|ethnogenetic]] make up who had darker skin or was of a lower class may be considered ''pardo'' or even ''preto''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Slavery and Abolition ===\n{{Main|Slavery in Brazil}}\n\nSoon after the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] began to settle in Brazil in the year 1500, they began to enslave the indigenous population in order to sustain their growing sugar economy. However, European induced wars and disease quickly began to deplete the indigenous populations and Portuguese colonizers soon looked to Africa to satisfy their labor demands.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton Univ.

Calls for the end of slavery in Brazil began in the early 19th century. In 1825, [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrada|Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio Andrada e Silva]], who was a prominent figure in leading Brazil to independence from Portugal, was in high favor of gradual emancipation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-3/slavery-and-aboliton/|title=Slavery and Abolition in the 19th Century {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Britain also contributed to the push for abolition in Brazil, by abolishing the slave trade. This was a significant move due to the fact that the British was Brazil's main trade partner. A small amount of legislation also helped lead up to the official abolition of slavery in 1888. First, in 1871 the [[Rio Branco Law|Law of the Free Womb]] declared that all the children of slaves that were born after the law was passed were to be freed; followed by the 1885 Sexagenarian Law, which freed slaves over sixty years of age.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lei \u00c1urea (Golden Law).tif|thumb|The Golden Law. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\nA large contributor to the lengthy abolition process in Brazil was in part due to the dynamics of the royal family.

During her brief time as regent, she took small measures to abolish slavery. Due to the obstacles she faced, she had to appoint an entirely new cabinet in order to completely abolish slavery. She succeeded, and the abolition of slavery was referred to as the [[Lei \u00c1urea|Golden Law]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Post Emancipation Brazil (1888- Early 1900s) ===\nThe abolition of slavery in Brazil meant the end of legal [[Racial segregation|segregation]] between blacks and whites. However, racism did not die with the institution of slavery. The racial hierarchies put in place by slavery stood strong after abolition. There was no period of \u201c[[Reconstruction (United States)|reconstruction]]\u201d such as that which was instituted in the United States.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Elizabeth|date=February 2017|title=The 'Africanization' of Salvador: Race, Work, and Politics in Post-Emancipation Salvador Da Bahia, Brazil|journal=Latin American and Caribbean Ethnic Studies|volume=12|issue=3|pages=227\u2013249|doi=10.1080/17442222.2017.1365429}}</ref> Rather, newly freed black Brazilians were left to create a life for themselves out of nothing\u2014no land, money, or education. This disadvantaged state left the country with massive amounts of inequality between whites and non-whites. Because of this, the conversation about race in Brazil became closely intertwined with conversations about poverty and class.\n\nThough there were no laws directly targeting those of African descent on the basis of race, there were laws that put in place that created inequality between whites and blacks. For example, when Brazil first became a republic in 1889, voting was restricted to only literate men, which barred the majority of the black population from voting since there were large inequities in education after the abolition of slavery.<ref name=\":3\" /> In addition to this, there was a redefining of crime that criminalized many aspects of African culture.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== [[Eugenics]] ====\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fear began to spur among the elite classes about how Brazil's early history of [[miscegenation]] would affect its development.<ref name=\":1\" /> This fear in combination with the growing popularity of using [[pseudoscience]] to explain racial differences led to the growth of eugenics in Brazil.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sebasti\u00e3o de Souza|first=Vanderlei|date=December 2016|title=Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-59702016000900093&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en|journal=Hist.

One anthropologist who adopted eugenic thought, Raimundo Nina Rodgrigues, began to become concerned with the racial mixing occurring in Brazil. He conducted a \u2018study\u2019 on people of African origin in Brazil and found that the ethnic group was \u201cunequivocally inferior.\u201d<ref name=\":5\" /> He advocated for separate criminal laws by race and that blacks be subject to separate laws because they were not free to choose crime because of their diminished capacities. However, Rodrigues himself was mixed race and expressed confusion about the status of mixed race individuals in the racial hierarchy. To counter this, he proposed the creation of several categories to express the spectrum of mixed people going from superior to ordinary, to degenerate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27}}</ref>\n\nIn the end, eugenics in Brazil never took on as strong as it did in Europe or North America. Some attribute the pseudoscience's limited success to the fact that Brazil already had a very large mixed-race population. Nina Rodrigues\u2019 confusion about how racial superiority works outside of a racial binary demonstrates this thought. Even at the time slavery was abolished in 1888, 6 percent of all marriages were interracial.<ref name=\":7\" /> This means that, at some level, racial barriers had already been broken down, making it difficult to institute hardline eugenics policies like [[Racial segregation|segregation]] or racial [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]]. Others argue that the large presence of [[Catholic Church in Brazil|Catholicism]] in Brazil may have saved the country from harsher racial policies.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>''\u201cThe broad influence of Catholicism in Brazil and the rest of Latin America constrained eugenicists\u2019 interventions in discussions on marriage restrictions and human reproduction.

The policy lasted until 1910 and because of it the percentage of whites in Brazil jumped from 34 percent in 1870 to 64 percent in 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref>\n\n== Shifting Views on Race ==\n\n=== 1910-1920s ===\nThe end of European immigration in 1910 meant the resurfacing of fears among Brazil elite about the \u201cblackening\u201d of the Brazilian population.<ref name=\":3\" /> Suggestions about increasing immigration of Afro- North Americans sparked contentious debates inside and outside of the eugenics community.<ref name=\":8\" /> One such person who was troubled by this idea was eugenicist Renato Khel. Khel was influenced by aggressive eugenics policies that were being used in Germany and advocated for similar policies in Brazil, such as the sterilization of degenerates and criminals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref> However, the majority of the Brazilian population, including those within the eugenics community, were beginning to see miscegenation as a path to racial harmony.\n\n=== 1930s to 1980s: Brazil as a \u201cRacial Democracy\u201d ===\n{{Main|Racial democracy|l1=Racial Democracy}}\n\nAs Brazilian society drew farther and farther away from ideas of racial purity, [[Gilberto Freyre|Gilberto Freye]] popularized the idea of Brazil as a racial democracy in his book ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala|The Masters and the Slaves]]''. Freye's book transformed the idea of miscegenation into a positive part of Brazilian culture and national identity and it became widely accepted that Brazil's history of intermixing between races had rendered the country a post-racial society, as it would come to be hailed for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blackness Without Ethnicity: constructing race in BRazil|last=Sansone|first=Livio|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=2}}</ref> Importantly, the idea of racial democracy became central dogma to the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military governments of 1964-1985]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=40}}</ref> While it was in power, the military preferred to think of race as a non-issue and pushed the idea of a unified identity among all Brazilians in order to quell resistance.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nDuring military rule, racial democracy became a consensus among almost all Brazilians.

Under the racial democracy thesis, it was assumed that any disparity in wealth between white and non-white Brazilians was due to the legacy of slavery and broader issues of inequality and lack of economic mobility in the country. The general consensus was that the problem would fix itself given enough time. This hypothesis was examined in 1982 by sociologist Jos\u00e9 Pastore in his book ''Social Mobility in Brazil''. In his book, Pastore examines the 1973 household survey and compares the income and occupations of father-son pairs. Based on his findings, he concluded that the level of economic mobility in Brazil should have been enough to overcome inequality left from slavery had opportunities been available equally.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Mobility in Brazil|last=Pastore|first=Jose|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nRacial inequality is seen primarily through lower levels of education and income for non-whites than whites.<ref name=\":2\" /> Economic inequality is most dramatically seen in the near absence of non-whites from the upper levels of Brazil's income bracket. According to sociologist Edward Telles, whites are five times more likely to be earning in the highest income bracket (more than $2,000/month).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the consequences of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=110}}</ref> Overall, The salary of Whites in [[Brazil]] are, on average, 46% over the salary of Blacks.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAdditionally, racial discrimination in education is a well documented phenomenon in Brazil.

The statistics were obtained by the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]]. The explanatory variables the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]] looked at for potential causes of racialized killings were, [[race (classification of humans)|race]]/[[skin color]], [[gender]] and [[education]]. In the discussion section, the findings of the study suggested that anti-gun legislation in Brazil has yielded different outcomes among Brazil's population due to race or color.

These are ''branco'' (white), ''preto'' (black), ''pardo'' (brown, or multi-racial), ''amarelo'' (yellow, or Asian), and ''ind\u00edgena'' (indigenous). Because there was never a legal genetic definition for these categories, throughout history, each of these racial groups has been defined in different ways. Racial classification in Brazilian society is often inconsistent and influenced by a myriad of factors including: class, status, education, location and [[phenotype]].<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, a light-skinned multiracial person who held an important, well-paying position in society may be considered ''branco'' while someone else with the same [[Ethnogenesis|ethnogenetic]] make up who had darker skin or was of a lower class may be considered ''pardo'' or even ''preto''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Slavery and Abolition ===\n{{Main|Slavery in Brazil}}\n\nSoon after the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] began to settle in Brazil in the year 1500, they began to enslave the indigenous population in order to sustain their growing sugar economy. However, European induced wars and disease quickly began to deplete the indigenous populations and Portuguese colonizers soon looked to Africa to satisfy their labor demands.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton Univ.

Calls for the end of slavery in Brazil began in the early 19th century. In 1825, [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrada|Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio Andrada e Silva]], who was a prominent figure in leading Brazil to independence from Portugal, was in high favor of gradual emancipation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-3/slavery-and-aboliton/|title=Slavery and Abolition in the 19th Century {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Britain also contributed to the push for abolition in Brazil, by abolishing the slave trade. This was a significant move due to the fact that the British was Brazil's main trade partner. A small amount of legislation also helped lead up to the official abolition of slavery in 1888. First, in 1871 the [[Rio Branco Law|Law of the Free Womb]] declared that all the children of slaves that were born after the law was passed were to be freed; followed by the 1885 Sexagenarian Law, which freed slaves over sixty years of age.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lei \u00c1urea (Golden Law).tif|thumb|The Golden Law.

During her brief time as regent, she took small measures to abolish slavery. Due to the obstacles she faced, she had to appoint an entirely new cabinet in order to completely abolish slavery. She succeeded, and the abolition of slavery was referred to as the [[Lei \u00c1urea|Golden Law]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Post Emancipation Brazil (1888- Early 1900s) ===\nThe abolition of slavery in Brazil meant the end of legal [[Racial segregation|segregation]] between blacks and whites. However, racism did not die with the institution of slavery. The racial hierarchies put in place by slavery stood strong after abolition.

This disadvantaged state left the country with massive amounts of inequality between whites and non-whites. Because of this, the conversation about race in Brazil became closely intertwined with conversations about poverty and class.\n\nThough there were no laws directly targeting those of African descent on the basis of race, there were laws that put in place that created inequality between whites and blacks. For example, when Brazil first became a republic in 1889, voting was restricted to only literate men, which barred the majority of the black population from voting since there were large inequities in education after the abolition of slavery.<ref name=\":3\" /> In addition to this, there was a redefining of crime that criminalized many aspects of African culture.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== [[Eugenics]] ====\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fear began to spur among the elite classes about how Brazil's early history of [[miscegenation]] would affect its development.<ref name=\":1\" /> This fear in combination with the growing popularity of using [[pseudoscience]] to explain racial differences led to the growth of eugenics in Brazil.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sebasti\u00e3o de Souza|first=Vanderlei|date=December 2016|title=Brazilian Eugenics and Its International Connections: an Analysis Based on the Controversies between Renato Kehl and Edgard Roquette-Pinto, 1920-1930|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-59702016000900093&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en|journal=Hist.

One anthropologist who adopted eugenic thought, Raimundo Nina Rodgrigues, began to become concerned with the racial mixing occurring in Brazil. He conducted a \u2018study\u2019 on people of African origin in Brazil and found that the ethnic group was \u201cunequivocally inferior.\u201d<ref name=\":5\" /> He advocated for separate criminal laws by race and that blacks be subject to separate laws because they were not free to choose crime because of their diminished capacities. However, Rodrigues himself was mixed race and expressed confusion about the status of mixed race individuals in the racial hierarchy. To counter this, he proposed the creation of several categories to express the spectrum of mixed people going from superior to ordinary, to degenerate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27}}</ref>\n\nIn the end, eugenics in Brazil never took on as strong as it did in Europe or North America. Some attribute the pseudoscience's limited success to the fact that Brazil already had a very large mixed-race population. Nina Rodrigues\u2019 confusion about how racial superiority works outside of a racial binary demonstrates this thought. Even at the time slavery was abolished in 1888, 6 percent of all marriages were interracial.<ref name=\":7\" /> This means that, at some level, racial barriers had already been broken down, making it difficult to institute hardline eugenics policies like [[Racial segregation|segregation]] or racial [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]]. Others argue that the large presence of [[Catholic Church in Brazil|Catholicism]] in Brazil may have saved the country from harsher racial policies.<ref name=\":4\" /><blockquote>''\u201cThe broad influence of Catholicism in Brazil and the rest of Latin America constrained eugenicists\u2019 interventions in discussions on marriage restrictions and human reproduction.

The policy lasted until 1910 and because of it the percentage of whites in Brazil jumped from 34 percent in 1870 to 64 percent in 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America the Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref>\n\n== Shifting Views on Race ==\n\n=== 1910-1920s ===\nThe end of European immigration in 1910 meant the resurfacing of fears among Brazil elite about the \u201cblackening\u201d of the Brazilian population.<ref name=\":3\" /> Suggestions about increasing immigration of Afro- North Americans sparked contentious debates inside and outside of the eugenics community.<ref name=\":8\" /> One such person who was troubled by this idea was eugenicist Renato Khel. Khel was influenced by aggressive eugenics policies that were being used in Germany and advocated for similar policies in Brazil, such as the sterilization of degenerates and criminals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of race and color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=32}}</ref> However, the majority of the Brazilian population, including those within the eugenics community, were beginning to see miscegenation as a path to racial harmony.\n\n=== 1930s to 1980s: Brazil as a \u201cRacial Democracy\u201d ===\n{{Main|Racial democracy|l1=Racial Democracy}}\n\nAs Brazilian society drew farther and farther away from ideas of racial purity, [[Gilberto Freyre|Gilberto Freye]] popularized the idea of Brazil as a racial democracy in his book ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala|The Masters and the Slaves]]''. Freye's book transformed the idea of miscegenation into a positive part of Brazilian culture and national identity and it became widely accepted that Brazil's history of intermixing between races had rendered the country a post-racial society, as it would come to be hailed for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blackness Without Ethnicity: constructing race in BRazil|last=Sansone|first=Livio|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=2}}</ref> Importantly, the idea of racial democracy became central dogma to the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military governments of 1964-1985]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|last=Telles|first=Edward E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=40}}</ref> While it was in power, the military preferred to think of race as a non-issue and pushed the idea of a unified identity among all Brazilians in order to quell resistance.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nDuring military rule, racial democracy became a consensus among almost all Brazilians.

Under the racial democracy thesis, it was assumed that any disparity in wealth between white and non-white Brazilians was due to the legacy of slavery and broader issues of inequality and lack of economic mobility in the country. The general consensus was that the problem would fix itself given enough time. This hypothesis was examined in 1982 by sociologist Jos\u00e9 Pastore in his book ''Social Mobility in Brazil''. In his book, Pastore examines the 1973 household survey and compares the income and occupations of father-son pairs. Based on his findings, he concluded that the level of economic mobility in Brazil should have been enough to overcome inequality left from slavery had opportunities been available equally.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Mobility in Brazil|last=Pastore|first=Jose|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nRacial inequality is seen primarily through lower levels of education and income for non-whites than whites.<ref name=\":2\" /> Economic inequality is most dramatically seen in the near absence of non-whites from the upper levels of Brazil's income bracket.
