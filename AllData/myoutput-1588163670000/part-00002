The manga was serialized in ''[[Hana to Yume]]'' from 1987 to 1991 and published in English by [[Viz Media]]. It has been adapted into a six-episode [[anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] and a live-action television series.\n\nThe anime episodes refer directly (through narration giving the volume number) to events in the [[manga]]. The manga storyline is somewhat self-referential, as several asides show that the characters are fully aware that they exist in a manga. Yukie Nasu appears frequently as herself, usually with a capital \"N\" on her head, to explain away certain loose plot threads.  For example, in a story featuring a [[baseball]] game taking place in late autumn, one of the characters asked why they weren't playing soccer; Nasu's character appeared and explained that she didn't know the rules for soccer.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter suffering from a series of mishaps, Kazuya Hasekawa has finally entered Ryokuto Academy. He is there to get away from his brother and his wife (whom Kazuya had a crush on). Unfortunately, he is assigned to live in the dorm known as Greenwood, a former insane asylum, where the weird students live. His roommate, Shun Kisaragi, looks just like a girl, and Kazuya initially thought he was until he saw Shun in the boys' bathroom. Also there are his next-door roommates, the dorm president Mitsuru Ikeda and his best friend, Shinobu Tezuka. The manga follows the everyday events and antics of Greenwood.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n*{{Nihongo|'''Kazuya Hasukawa'''|\u84ee\u5ddd \u4e00\u4e5f}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Nozomu Sasaki]]|[[Ted Lewis (voice actor)|Ted Lewis]] (TAJ dub), [[Johnny Yong Bosch|Kevin Hatcher]] (Bang Zoom! dub)}}\n: Kazuya was raised by his older brother, Kazuhiro, after the death of their parents when they were younger. Kazuya had applied to enter to Ryokuto Academy so he could be just like Kazuhiro. Kazuya had fallen in love with Sumire, his tutor and was heartbroken when she fell in love with Kazuhiro and subsequently married him. Kazuya had lost respect for his brother since then and moved into the dorm to get away from them. Unfortunately, Kazuya suffered injuries due to a car accident, an ulcer and other mishaps that had delayed him from entering the academy. Much to his dismay, he has to deal with the craziness in the Greenwood dorm and the fact that Kazuhiro is the school nurse. Eventually, he gets used to living in the dorm and is voted president of the dorm by Mitsuru. He later falls in love with a delinquent girl, Miya Igarashi, and dates her in the end of the manga and anime.\n: Portrayed by Yuki Izawa in the Live action.\n\n*{{Nihongo|'''Shun Kisaragi'''|\u5982\u6708 \u77ac}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Chika Sakamoto]]|Heather Quick (TAJ dub), [[Julie Ann Taylor]] (Bang Zoom! dub)}}\n: Shun is Kazuya's easygoing roommate. Although Kisaragi resembles a cute, tomboyish girl, he's actually a guy. Shun is the oldest son of the Kisaragi family, who run a chain of traditional Japanese inns. The females in the Kisaragi family inherit the company, but it has no connection with Shun's girlish figure. Surprisingly, Shun is heterosexual and dated a girl in junior high. Shun is very self-confident and proud of his beautiful long hair, and he knows he is so cute. Because he thinks it is the best way to be cool, he does not hesitate to dress like a girl. He can makes sound decisions and is a man of action, and no character believes that Shun is actually feminine. Shun has a younger brother named Reina and an infant sister named Yui.\n: Portrayed by [[Hiroki Suzuki (born 1985)|Hiroki Suzuki]] in the Live Action.\n\n*{{Nihongo|'''Mitsuru Ikeda'''|\u6c60\u7530 \u5149\u6d41}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mitsuo Iwata]]|Dan Olk (TAJ dub), Jim Taggert (Bang Zoom! dub)}}\n: The President of Greenwood dormitory, and best friend of Shinobu Tezuka.

Mitsuru is roommates with Shinobu and lives next door to Kazuya and Shun, creating an interesting foursome. He also has an unusual ability: His face is able to heal any cut or bruise in under a minute. All that rough treatment on Kazuya, however, is merely his way of toughening up Kazuya so he can take Mitsuru's place as Residence Hall President. Also, he tries his best to stay away from his adopted family. Since he was a child, he knew he was adopted, and he knew he didn't really belong, so he tries to distance himself from his adopted family.\n: Portrayed by [[Riki Miura]] in the Live Action.\n\n*{{Nihongo|'''Shinobu Tezuka'''|\u624b\u585a \u5fcd}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Toshihiko Seki]]|Charles Roth (TAJ dub), [[Dave Wittenberg|Dave Leyland]] (Bang Zoom! dub)}}\n: The smartest student living in Greenwood dormitory, and best friend of Mitsuru Ikeda.
