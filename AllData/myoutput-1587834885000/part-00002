Various ways of [[pickling]] were used to preserve food for winter. Soups are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with [[Northern Europe]], Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northern countries. \nLonglasting agricultural and foraging traditions along with a variety of influences during the country's history formed Lithuanian cuisine.\n\nGerman traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (''kugelis'' or [[kugel]]) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (''v\u0117darai''), as well as the baroque tree cake known as ''[[\u0160akotis]]''.

Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.\n\n[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''baland\u0117liai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior. [[Sorrel]] is grown in the gardens for soup and salad.\n\nLithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back again after restitution of the independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.\n\nPickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.\n\n[[Linseed oil]] was moderately popular.\n\n==Berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants. Foraging==\n\nOne of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.\n\nMushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dz\u016bkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:\n* ''Baravykas'' \u2013 [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];\n* ''Voverait\u0117'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepe\u0161ka'' (in [[Dz\u016bkija]] region) \u2013 [[chanterelle]];\n* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vi\u0161tel\u0117'' \u2013 [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].\n\n''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voverait\u0117'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voverait\u0117'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lep\u0161\u0117'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonvir\u0161is'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''\u0161ilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.\n\nWild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''m\u0117lyn\u0117s'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''brukn\u0117s'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguol\u0117s'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[\u010cepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''\u017eemuog\u0117s'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Foraging\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Boletus edulis EtgHollande 041031 091.jpg|Boletus, the \"King of Mushrooms\"\nFile:Chanterelle Cantharellus cibarius.jpg|[[Chanterelle]]s are popular mushrooms in Lithuania\nFile:Vaccinium vitis-idaea 20060824 003.jpg|Lingonberry\nFile:\u010cu\u010doriedky.jpg|Bilberry\nFile:Suillus brevipes 78.jpg|Butter-mushroom\nFile:Fragaria_vesca_2.jpg|Strawberry\nFile:Glyceria fluitans \u2014 Flora Batava \u2014 Volume v8.jpg|''[[Glyceria fluitans]]'' (''paprastoji mona\u017eol\u0117'').

There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.\n\n==Fish==\n\nFreshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]].

Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.\n\nFarmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.\n\n===Midus===\n\n''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey.

Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.\n*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.\n*''Degtin\u0117 (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].\n*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gili\u0173 kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee.

It is also used as traditional medicine. ''Trejos devynerios'' (\"999\"), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.\n* ''Vynas'' ([[wine]]) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania - wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe.

The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.\n*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Jonin\u0117s]]), June 23.\n*Christmas Eve ([[K\u016b\u010dios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.\n*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[\u0161akotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.\n*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.\n*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.\n\n==Contemporary cuisine and restaurants==\n[[File:Benediktas food market, Vilnius, Lithuania, June 2018.jpg|thumb|Modern food market ''Benediktas'' in Vilnius]]\n\nCurrently, Lithuania is affected by modern cuisine trends - fusion, new Nordic, craft beer, craft food.

These schools led to spreading of similar recipes throughout the country.\n\nDuring the past years, restaurants in Lithuania emerged which specialize in historic Lithuanian cuisine, culinary heritage and its interpretations.\n\n<gallery heights=\"170\" widths=\"160\" class=\"center\">\nFile:1539-Samogethia-and-Lituania.jpg|Part of Olaus Magnus' map depicting Lithuania: Lithuanian type of crop trade ships ''(naves frumentarie)'' - [[vytin\u0117]] is seen close to Vilnius, also beehives protection from the bears(on the right side)\nFile:Royal Palace of Lithuania in Vilnius.jpg|[[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] in Vilnius.

Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Bread baking was considered an important ritual.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lithuanian traditional foods.

Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.\n\n[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''baland\u0117liai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior. [[Sorrel]] is grown in the gardens for soup and salad.\n\nLithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back again after restitution of the independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.\n\nPickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.\n\n[[Linseed oil]] was moderately popular.\n\n==Berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants. Foraging==\n\nOne of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.\n\nMushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dz\u016bkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:\n* ''Baravykas'' \u2013 [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];\n* ''Voverait\u0117'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepe\u0161ka'' (in [[Dz\u016bkija]] region) \u2013 [[chanterelle]];\n* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vi\u0161tel\u0117'' \u2013 [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].\n\n''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voverait\u0117'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voverait\u0117'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lep\u0161\u0117'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonvir\u0161is'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''\u0161ilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.\n\nWild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''m\u0117lyn\u0117s'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''brukn\u0117s'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguol\u0117s'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[\u010cepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''\u017eemuog\u0117s'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Foraging\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Boletus edulis EtgHollande 041031 091.jpg|Boletus, the \"King of Mushrooms\"\nFile:Chanterelle Cantharellus cibarius.jpg|[[Chanterelle]]s are popular mushrooms in Lithuania\nFile:Vaccinium vitis-idaea 20060824 003.jpg|Lingonberry\nFile:\u010cu\u010doriedky.jpg|Bilberry\nFile:Suillus brevipes 78.jpg|Butter-mushroom\nFile:Fragaria_vesca_2.jpg|Strawberry\nFile:Glyceria fluitans \u2014 Flora Batava \u2014 Volume v8.jpg|''[[Glyceria fluitans]]'' (''paprastoji mona\u017eol\u0117'').

During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century. [[Hippophae|Sea buckthorn]] is used for juice and as a garnish.\n\n==Meat==\n[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''la\u0161iniai'' with an onion]]\n[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic.

There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.\n\n==Fish==\n\nFreshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]]. Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, [[Stavanger]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grin\u010dinaitis |first1=Sigitas |title=Kaip j\u016bros sidabras - silk\u0117s - atkeliavo \u012f Lietuv\u0105? |url=http://www.silutesnaujienos.lt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16082:kaip-jros-sidabras-silks-atkeliavo-lietuv&catid=57:istorija&Itemid=102 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> [[Salmon]] is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice.

Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called ''s\u016breliai'' are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though some people still prefer making their own soured milk. A Milk road route was created which leads through important objects of milk producsing in Lithuania.\n\n===Milk and milk derivatives===\n\nVariety of milk is large - milk, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir, cream, yougurt.

Lithuanian coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') serve a variety of tortes and pastries to attract evening strollers.\n\nDesserts include:\n*''\u017dagar\u0117liai'' (also known as krustai or chrustai) - Twisted, thin deep-fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar; identical to Scandinavian [[Klejner]] cookies, similar to Mexican [[bu\u00f1uelo]].\n*''K\u016b\u010diukai'' or ''\u0161li\u017eikai'' - very small rolls are baked and served with [[opium poppy|poppy]]seed milk; this is a traditional [[K\u016b\u010dios|K\u016b\u010dios']] ([[Christmas Eve]]) dish.\n*''Ledai'' - [[ice cream]] is served everywhere in the summer.\n*''[[Doughnut|Spurgos]]'' - a Lithuanian variant of doughnuts, sometimes filled with preserves. The main difference from doughnuts or berliners is that the Lithuanian version uses curd as a basis. Therefore, they often called ''var\u0161k\u0117s spurgos'' - ''curd doughnuts''.\n*''[[\u0160akotis]]'' (also called ''raguotis'') - is essentially a pound cake grilled layer by layer, with a very distinctive branching form. It is a Lithuanian variant of a spit cake which is a distant cousin of the German [[Baumkuchen]], the French [[g\u00e2teau \u00e0 la broche]], the Swedish [[Spettekaka|sp\u00e4ttekaka]]. Some sources attribute its invention to [[Yotvingians]] - ancient, now extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polish Food 101 \u2012 S\u0119kacz |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/polish-food-101-sekacz |accessdate=22 April 2019 |quote=It's possible that Lithuanians, who allegedly ate s\u0119kacz on their way to Grunwald before the great battle of 1410, got the idea from the Germans.

Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus \u2013 apeiginis balt\u0173 g\u0117rimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''R\u016bgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.\n\nFarmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.\n\n===Midus===\n\n''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey. [[Baltic people]] were making ''midus'' for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kublickas |first1=Rimantas |title=Traditional Foods |pages=339\u2013343 |chapter=Midus: A Traditional Lithuanian Mead |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7648-2_27 |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4899-7646-8 }}</ref>\nOldest recipe of Lithuanian ''midus'' was recorded in a book by [[Olaus Magnus]] ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'', published in Rome in 1555.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lau\u017eikas R. |author2=Astrauskas A. |title=How the Future King of England Ate Peacock in Vilnius: the Shared Cultural, Political and Culinary History of Britain and Lithuania |date=2018 |publisher=Lietuvos kult\u016bros institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=9786098015652 |pages=135}}</ref>  ''Midus'' was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry.

Industrial production of fruit and berry wines was started by Balys Karazija in 1926 in [[Anyk\u0161\u010diai]]. His wines have won international awards in 1938. Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.\n\n===Other===\n*''Arbata ([[tea]])'' - [[chamomile]], [[rosehip]], [[thyme]] and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.\n*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.\n*''Degtin\u0117 (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].\n*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gili\u0173 kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117-\u0160lekien\u0117 |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavin\u0117s istoriniuose \u0161altiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. \n*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.\n*''[[Bitters|Trauktin\u0117]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties. It is also used as traditional medicine. ''Trejos devynerios'' (\"999\"), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.\n* ''Vynas'' ([[wine]]) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania - wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe. Lithuania historically is a wine importer, since its climate isn't very friendly for growing grapevines.\n\n==Special occasions==\n[[File:K\u016b\u010dios.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''K\u016b\u010dios'' ''(Christmas Eve)'' table]]\nEaster and Christmas (Christmas Eve) are festives which have their own table presentations and type of dishes in Lithuania.

The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.\n*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Jonin\u0117s]]), June 23.\n*Christmas Eve ([[K\u016b\u010dios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.\n*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[\u0161akotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.\n*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.\n*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.\n\n==Contemporary cuisine and restaurants==\n[[File:Benediktas food market, Vilnius, Lithuania, June 2018.jpg|thumb|Modern food market ''Benediktas'' in Vilnius]]\n\nCurrently, Lithuania is affected by modern cuisine trends - fusion, new Nordic, craft beer, craft food.
