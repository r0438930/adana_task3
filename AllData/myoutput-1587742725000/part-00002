De Wolfe Music was established by Meyer de Wolfe in 1909 and began its recorded library in 1927 with the advent of '[[Talkies]]'.<ref>De Wolfe Music Compact Disk Catalogue, 1988, [[The Abrose Press]], 01-518 6638</ref>\n\nMusic from the library has been used in a number of well-known productions, including; ''[[Monty Python]]'', ''[[Emmanuelle]]'', ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'', ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'', ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', '' [[EastEnders]]'', ''[[Kavanagh QC]]'', ''[[The Royle Family]]'', ''[[Spitting Image]]'', ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

Artists who have recorded there in recent years include [[Adele]], [[Snow Patrol]], [[Cee Lo Green]], [[Labrinth]], [[George Fenton]] (BAFTA and EMMY winner for his scores to the BBC's ''[[The Blue Planet]]'' and ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]''), [[Ian Brown]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]], [[Doves (band)|Doves]], [[The Feeling]], and [[Kaiser Chiefs]].<ref>http://www.angelstudios.co.uk/news</ref> Its specially composed department is called Inter Angel.<ref>http://www.interangel.co.uk/work/</ref> De Wolfe is still a family-run company.\n\n==History==\n\nDe Wolfe LTD was founded in London by Dutch musician Meyer de Wolfe in 1909. In early cinema the soundtrack to movies was provided by musicians playing live in the theatres. Meyer de Wolfe offered a [[sheet music]] library of original compositions to accompany [[silent films]], often produced in collaboration with other musicians from the orchestras of London. These collaborators included conductor [[Sir Landon Ronald]], violinist and conductor [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Sir Eugene Goossens]], composers [[Giuseppe Becce]] and [[Ivor Novello]], and violinist [[Mantovani]].\n\nBy the late 1920s de Wolfe Music began recording with the '[[sound-on-disc]]' technique and '[[sound-on-film]]', on the 35mm [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]]. This film was explosive if improperly stored, which proved to be the cause of an explosion in the basement of the company's [[Wardour Street]] office. Examples of compositions from this time include ''Keep Your Face To The Sunshine'' (1926), ''Odiele'', performed by Ivor Novello, from the film ''[[The Rat (1925 film)|The Rat]]'' (1925), and ''Policeman's Holiday'' (1931) by Montague Ewing.\n\nIn the 1930s de Wolfe created soundtracks for [[newsreels]], working with [[Path\u00e9 News]], [[British Movietone News]], and [[Gaumont-British|British Gaumont Cinemas]]. This work continued throughout the Second World War and on in to the 1960s. The company was still providing music for film, including ''[[Fame Is the Spur (film)|Fame Is the Spur]]'' (with a soundtrack composed by [[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]] pilot [[John Wooldridge]]) and ''[[Edward, My Son]]'' (1948).\n\nAfter the Second World War, de Wolfe expanded in to North America through a partnership with Corelli and Jacobs,  two film editors from Paramount Pictures. In 1955 the company provided the music for the first televised commercial in the U.K. for Gibbs Toothpaste.\n\nIn 1962 de Wolfe began distributing 10\" vinyl records, with cover designs by Rolf Webster and [[Nick Bantock]]. These LPs are now widely sought after by record collectors. At this time de Wolfe provided the theme to ''[[The Power Game]]'' (earning de Wolfe and Wayne Hill an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Instrumental Composition of the Year),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1960-1969/the-ivors-1967/|title=The Ivors 1967|author=DigitalMovement|date=2018|website=theivors.com|accessdate=17 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307064611/http://theivors.com/archive/1960-1969/the-ivors-1967/|archive-date=7 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and for a number of episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.\n\nIn 1973 a [[Jack Trombey]] composition was used as the theme for the detective series ''[[Van Der Valk]]''. ''[[Eye Level]]'' became a million-selling number one single, topping the U.K charts for six weeks. Around this time de Wolfe music could be heard in Kung Fu movies by the [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], British Comedies ''[[Zeta One]]'' and ''[[Adventures of a Taxi Driver]]'', and the [[Monty Python]] films. The 1970s was a period of further expansion for the company, with the addition of the Rouge catalogue in 1975 and the establishing of Angel Recording Studios in 1979.\n\nDigital technology bought changes to the [[music industry]] in the 1980s, particularly with the evolution of CDs. In 1985 de Wolfe launched its DWCD collection of 6 CDs, becoming the world's first digital production music library. De Wolfe ultimately ended the production of its vinyl series in 1988, and the end of the production of CDs would come in 2014 as de Wolfe shifted focus to online delivery.\n\nDe Wolfe LTD celebrated its centenary year in 2009, with the company at that time boasting offices and agents in 40 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dewolfemusic.com/page/nitrate_to_bitrate|title=Nitrate to Bitrate|author=de Wolfe Music|date=27 April 2015|website=dewolfemusic.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Labels==\nDe Wolfe LTD produces audio for a variety of genres and usage, which are organised in to a number of labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dewolfemusic.com/page/production_music|title=Production Music|author=de Wolfe Music|date=17 May 2017|website=dewolfemusic.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===De Wolfe Music (DWCD)===\n\nDe Wolfe's primary label, and where a majority of the new releases are housed.
