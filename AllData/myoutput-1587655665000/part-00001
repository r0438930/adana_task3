The regiment was based in [[Visby]] as part of the [[Gotland]] Garrison.\n\n==History==\nThe regiment origins from the Artillery Conscripts of the [[Gotland National Conscription]] (''Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4rings artilleribev\u00e4ring''), which were organized in 1811 as a result of the [[Russian occupation of Gotland 1808|Russian occupation of Gotland]] in 1808 and by a convention adopted by the islanders in December 1810, which was ratified by King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] on 5 February 1811. It consisted then of two [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]] and a fortification company with a squad of 100 men, located in Visby.<ref name=\"Westrin (1909), p. 29\">{{harvnb|Westrin|1909|p=29}}</ref> The unit was reorganized in 1861 into Gotland National Conscription Artillery Corps (''Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4rings artillerik\u00e5r'') and was given the designation No&nbsp;4. In 1887 the corps changed its name to Gotland Artillery Corps (No&nbsp;4). The Gotland Artillery Corps was redesignated No&nbsp;7 in 1892 so that the planned [[Norrland Artillery Regiment]] could become  No&nbsp;4. In 1914 the name was changed to A&nbsp;7. In conjunction with the so called OLLI reform, which was carried out by the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] in 1973 and in 1975, A units and B units were created. The A units were regiments responsible for a [[List of Swedish defence districts|defence district]], and the B units were training regiments. In Gotland's case, it distinguished itself from the allotment on the mainland. This when the VII. Military Area was reorganized into [[Gotland Military Command]] (MKG) in 1966. The military command constituted a special [[command and control]] organization within the [[Milo \u00d6|Eastern Military District]], but did not have the overall responsibility for the administration of the island. Furthermore, the professional mobilization was led on a unit level. Through the reform, the full mobilization and material responsibility within the military command was added, regardless of [[military branch]]. This meant that the Gotland Artillery Corps which was included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG) came to be a B unit (training regiment). By the reform, the corps adopted the new name Gotland Artillery Regiment on 1 July 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/D114F167-1E69-4197-A928-3E9207651E85 |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Kungl, Maj:ts proposition 1974:135 |format=PDF |date=25 October 1974 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the Defence Act of 1977 and 1982, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was exempted from the investigation carried out by the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management (''F\u00f6rsvarets rationaliseringsinstitut''). In the Defence Act of 1977, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was exempted because of regional political conditions. Instead the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management believed that the [[Sm\u00e5land Artillery Regiment]] (A 6) with the Artillery Cadet and Aspirant School (''Artilleriets kadett- och aspirantskola'', ArtKAS) as well as the ''Miloverkstaden'' in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping]] would be disbanded. The [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] and the [[Chief of Army (Sweden)|Chief of the Army]], however, believed that no artillery regiment would be disbanded. However, the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management suggested in their investigation to give the Supreme Commander the task of examining the further development of the OLLI organization. In a further development, it wanted to merge [[Gotland Regiment]] (P 18), Gotland Artillery Regiment (A 7) and [[Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps|Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion]] (Lv 2) into an army regiment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/E5003EE2-AF3E-400B-B02E-F4F28CA92D2C |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1977/78:65 |format=PDF |date=17 December 1977 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Prior to the Defence Act of 1982, the [[Norrland Artillery Battalion|Boden Artillery Regiment]], Gotland Artillery Regiment, Norrland Artillery Regiment, [[Wendes Artillery Regiment]] and the [[Bergslagen Artillery Regiment]] were exempted from the review of finding a cost reduction within the artillery. The Gotland Artillery Regiment were exempted from the investigation of disbandment, partly because of regional policy considerations but also demands for the war organization's preparedness and mobilization. The merger proposed by the [[Government of Sweden|government]] to the ''[[Riksdag]]'' in the previous act had not been implemented. This meant that the government once again proposed to the ''Riksdag'' to merge the staffs of the Gotland Regiment, Gotland Artillery Regiment and the Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion with the staff of the Gotland Military Command, and form an authority from 1 July 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/5C408A58-F445-495E-B182-A1AC549CD246 |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1981/82:102 |format=PDF |date=24 February 1982 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bjurstr\u00f6m||pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThrough the Defence Act of 1992, the Gotland Military Command was separated from the Gotland Regiment, Gotland Artillery Regiment and the [[Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps]], and formed independent units from 1 July 1994. The military command came to only lead all operations on Gotland, which on the mainland were solved by the defense area staffs, division staffs and naval command staffs. Prior to the [[Defence Act of 2000 (Sweden)|Defence Act of 2000]], the government proposed in its Bill 1999/2000:30 that only one artillery regiment would remain in the basic organization. The regiments which the government wanted to disband included Gotland Artillery Regiment. This in the light that the government considered it unsuitable to centralize the artillery training to Gotland, not least due to the investment needs and the limited opportunities for long-term manpower. Remaining in the artillery of the new basic organization was the Bergslagen Artillery Regiment, this because the government considered that to be the regiment which had the best conditions for long-term training and practice of artillery units. On 30 June 2000, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/proposition/det-nya-forsvaret_GN0330/html |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1999/2000:30 |date=18 November 1999 |access-date=10 July 2016 |format=PDF |language=Swedish}}</ref> On 1 July 2000, the Bergslagen Artillery Regiment took the new name, the [[Artillery Regiment (2000)|Artillery Regiment]].\n\n==Operations==\nIn 1901 the corps was reorganized, and was increased so that it amounted to three batteries and a position company with a strength of 21 officers, 14 non-commissioned officers, four civilian servicemen and 156 male permanent workers.<ref name=\"Westrin (1909), p. 29\"/> In the 1990s, the regiment was responsible for training of divisions artillery staff and battalions and brigade artillery battalions and armored artillery battalion included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG).

The regiment was based in [[Visby]] as part of the [[Gotland]] Garrison.\n\n==History==\nThe regiment origins from the Artillery Conscripts of the [[Gotland National Conscription]] (''Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4rings artilleribev\u00e4ring''), which were organized in 1811 as a result of the [[Russian occupation of Gotland 1808|Russian occupation of Gotland]] in 1808 and by a convention adopted by the islanders in December 1810, which was ratified by King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] on 5 February 1811. It consisted then of two [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]] and a fortification company with a squad of 100 men, located in Visby.<ref name=\"Westrin (1909), p. 29\">{{harvnb|Westrin|1909|p=29}}</ref> The unit was reorganized in 1861 into Gotland National Conscription Artillery Corps (''Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4rings artillerik\u00e5r'') and was given the designation No&nbsp;4. In 1887 the corps changed its name to Gotland Artillery Corps (No&nbsp;4). The Gotland Artillery Corps was redesignated No&nbsp;7 in 1892 so that the planned [[Norrland Artillery Regiment]] could become  No&nbsp;4. In 1914 the name was changed to A&nbsp;7. In conjunction with the so called OLLI reform, which was carried out by the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] in 1973 and in 1975, A units and B units were created. The A units were regiments responsible for a [[List of Swedish defence districts|defence district]], and the B units were training regiments. In Gotland's case, it distinguished itself from the allotment on the mainland. This when the VII. Military Area was reorganized into [[Gotland Military Command]] (MKG) in 1966. The military command constituted a special [[command and control]] organization within the [[Milo \u00d6|Eastern Military District]], but did not have the overall responsibility for the administration of the island. Furthermore, the professional mobilization was led on a unit level. Through the reform, the full mobilization and material responsibility within the military command was added, regardless of [[military branch]]. This meant that the Gotland Artillery Corps which was included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG) came to be a B unit (training regiment). By the reform, the corps adopted the new name Gotland Artillery Regiment on 1 July 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/D114F167-1E69-4197-A928-3E9207651E85 |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Kungl, Maj:ts proposition 1974:135 |format=PDF |date=25 October 1974 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the Defence Act of 1977 and 1982, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was exempted from the investigation carried out by the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management (''F\u00f6rsvarets rationaliseringsinstitut''). In the Defence Act of 1977, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was exempted because of regional political conditions. Instead the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management believed that the [[Sm\u00e5land Artillery Regiment]] (A 6) with the Artillery Cadet and Aspirant School (''Artilleriets kadett- och aspirantskola'', ArtKAS) as well as the ''Miloverkstaden'' in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping]] would be disbanded. The [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] and the [[Chief of Army (Sweden)|Chief of the Army]], however, believed that no artillery regiment would be disbanded. However, the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management suggested in their investigation to give the Supreme Commander the task of examining the further development of the OLLI organization. In a further development, it wanted to merge [[Gotland Regiment]] (P 18), Gotland Artillery Regiment (A 7) and [[Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps|Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion]] (Lv 2) into an army regiment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/E5003EE2-AF3E-400B-B02E-F4F28CA92D2C |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1977/78:65 |format=PDF |date=17 December 1977 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Prior to the Defence Act of 1982, the [[Norrland Artillery Battalion|Boden Artillery Regiment]], Gotland Artillery Regiment, Norrland Artillery Regiment, [[Wendes Artillery Regiment]] and the [[Bergslagen Artillery Regiment]] were exempted from the review of finding a cost reduction within the artillery. The Gotland Artillery Regiment were exempted from the investigation of disbandment, partly because of regional policy considerations but also demands for the war organization's preparedness and mobilization. The merger proposed by the [[Government of Sweden|government]] to the ''[[Riksdag]]'' in the previous act had not been implemented. This meant that the government once again proposed to the ''Riksdag'' to merge the staffs of the Gotland Regiment, Gotland Artillery Regiment and the Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion with the staff of the Gotland Military Command, and form an authority from 1 July 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/5C408A58-F445-495E-B182-A1AC549CD246 |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1981/82:102 |format=PDF |date=24 February 1982 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bjurstr\u00f6m||pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThrough the Defence Act of 1992, the Gotland Military Command was separated from the Gotland Regiment, Gotland Artillery Regiment and the [[Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps]], and formed independent units from 1 July 1994. The military command came to only lead all operations on Gotland, which on the mainland were solved by the defense area staffs, division staffs and naval command staffs. Prior to the [[Defence Act of 2000 (Sweden)|Defence Act of 2000]], the government proposed in its Bill 1999/2000:30 that only one artillery regiment would remain in the basic organization. The regiments which the government wanted to disband included Gotland Artillery Regiment. This in the light that the government considered it unsuitable to centralize the artillery training to Gotland, not least due to the investment needs and the limited opportunities for long-term manpower. Remaining in the artillery of the new basic organization was the Bergslagen Artillery Regiment, this because the government considered that to be the regiment which had the best conditions for long-term training and practice of artillery units. On 30 June 2000, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/proposition/det-nya-forsvaret_GN0330/html |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1999/2000:30 |date=18 November 1999 |access-date=10 July 2016 |format=PDF |language=Swedish}}</ref> On 1 July 2000, the Bergslagen Artillery Regiment took the new name, the [[Artillery Regiment (2000)|Artillery Regiment]].\n\n==Operations==\nIn 1901 the corps was reorganized, and was increased so that it amounted to three batteries and a position company with a strength of 21 officers, 14 non-commissioned officers, four civilian servicemen and 156 male permanent workers.<ref name=\"Westrin (1909), p. 29\"/> In the 1990s, the regiment was responsible for training of divisions artillery staff and battalions and brigade artillery battalions and armored artillery battalion included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG).
