As a young journalist, Hemingway had to focus his newspaper reports on immediate events, with very little context or interpretation. When he became a writer of short stories, he retained this [[Minimalism|minimalistic]] style, focusing on surface elements without explicitly discussing underlying themes. Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, but should shine through implicitly.\n\n== Background ==\nLike other American writers such as [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Willa Cather]], Hemingway worked as a journalist before becoming a novelist. After graduating from high school he went to work as a cub reporter for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'',<ref name=\"Meyers p23\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=23}}</ref> where he quickly learned that truth often lurks below the surface of a story.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1998 17\">{{Harvnb|Reynolds|1998|p=17}}</ref> He learned about corruption in city politics, and that in hospital emergency rooms and police stations a mask of cynicism was worn \"like armour to shield whatever vulnerabilities remained\".<ref name=\"Reynolds 1998 17\"/> In his pieces he wrote about relevant events, excluding the background. As foreign correspondent for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', while living in Paris in the early 1920s,  he covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in more than a dozen articles. As his biographer Jeffrey Meyers explains, \"he objectively reported only the immediate events in order to achieve a concentration and intensity of focus\u2014a spotlight rather than a stage\".<ref name=\"Meyers pp98-99\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=98\u201399}}</ref> From the Greco-Turkish War he gained valuable writing experience that he translated to the writing of fiction. He believed fiction could be based on reality, but that if an experience were to be distilled, as he explained,  then \"what he made up was truer than what he remembered\".<ref name=\"Meyers pp98-99\"/>\n\n== Definition ==\n{{quotebox|If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them.

In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', his posthumously published memoirs about his years as a young writer in Paris, he explains: \"I omitted the real end [of \"Out of Season\"] which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything&nbsp;... and the omitted part would strengthen the story.\"<ref name=\"Smith\"/>  In chapter sixteen of ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' he compares his theory about writing to an iceberg.<!-- expand and add quotation here --><ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nHemingway's biographer [[Carlos Baker]] believed that as a writer of short stories Hemingway learned \"how to get the most from the least, how to prune language and avoid waste motion, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\"<ref name =\"Baker p117\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p= 117}}</ref> Baker also notes that the writing style of the \"iceberg theory\" suggests that a story's narrative and nuanced complexities, complete with symbolism, operate under the surface of the story itself.<ref name =\"Baker p117\"/>\n\nFor example, Hemingway believed a writer could describe an action, such as Nick Adams fishing in \"[[Big Two-Hearted River]],\" while conveying a ''different'' message about the action itself\u2014Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about the unpleasantness of his war experience.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=321\u2013322}}</ref>  In his essay \"The Art of the Short Story\", Hemingway is clear about his method: \"A few things I have found to be true.

For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with \"what if\" scenarios: \"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\" By separating himself from the characters he created, Hemingway strengthens the drama.

However, in \"Indian Camp\" the use of descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound build a sense of veracity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetlow|pp=53\u201355}}</ref>\nIn other words, a story can communicate by [[subtext]]; for instance, Hemingway's \"[[Hills Like White Elephants]]\" does not mention the word \"abortion\", although in the story the male character seems to be attempting to convince his girlfriend to have an abortion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=348}}</ref> \"Big Two-Hearted River\", Hemingway explains, \"is about a boy ... coming home from the war ...

Moreover, the story \"[[A Clean Well Lighted Place]]\" which on the surface is about nothing more than men drinking in a cafe late at night, is in fact about that which brings the men to the cafe to drink, and the reasons they seek light in the night\u2014none of which is available in the surface of the plot, but lurks in the iceberg below.<ref name=\"Baker 1972 123\u2013125\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=123\u2013125}}</ref> Hemingway's story \"Big Two-Hearted River\" is ostensibly about nothing, as is \"A Clean Well Lighted Place\", but within nothing lies the crux of the story.<ref name=\"Baker 1972 123\u2013125\"/>\n\n== Novels ==\nHemingway scholar Jackson Benson further believes that the omission Hemingway applies functions as a sort of buffer between himself as the creator of a character and the character. He explains that as an author creates a \"distance\" between himself and the character he \"becomes more practiced, it would seem.\" Benson says in Hemingway's fiction the distance is necessary, and successful in early fiction such as in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]],'' but if he as \"the author does not deliberately create such distance the fiction fails,\" as in the later works such as ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]''.<ref name =\"Benson\"/>\n\nBaker calls Hemingway's ''Across the River and into the Trees'' a \"lyric-poetical novel\" in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].<ref name= \"Baker1972 pp274-255\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=274\u2013275}}</ref> According to Meyers an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major \"shock\"\u2014the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home\u2014to which Hemingway alludes only briefly.<ref name= \"Meyers1985 p445\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985|p=445}}</ref> Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections. As Stoltzfus remarks: \"Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he must cross alone without the narrator's help.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus|2003}}</ref>\n\nHemingway believed that if context or background had been written about by another, and written about well, then it could be left out of his writing. Of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' he explains: \"In writing you are limited to by what has already been done satisfactorily. So I have tried to do something else. First I have tried to eliminate everything unnecessary to conveying experience to the reader so that after he has read something it will become part of his experience and seem actually to have happened.\"<ref name=\"Smith\">qtd in {{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}</ref> Paul Smith, author of ''Hemingway's Early Manuscript: The Theory and Practice of Omission'', believes Hemingway applied the theory of omission in effort to \"strengthen [the] iceberg\".<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn October 1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He jokingly told the press he believed [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Isak Dinesen]] deserved the prize more than he, but that the prize money would be welcome.<ref name=\"Baker p338\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}</ref> The prize was awarded to Hemingway \"for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |year=1954 |work= Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> A few days after the announcement, Hemingway spoke with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent, while on his boat fishing off the coast of Cuba. When asked about the use of symbolism in his work, and particularly in the most recently published ''Old Man and the Sea'', he explained:\n\n<blockquote>No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in ... That kind of symbol sticks out like raisins in raisin bread. Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935439-5,00.html|title= An American Storyteller |date=13 December 1954 |work= Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abductive reasoning]]\n*[[Case-based reasoning]]\n*[[Casuistry]]\n*[[Concision]]\n*[[Gonzo journalism]]\n*[[I know it when I see it]]\n*[[Purposeful omission]]\n*[[Show, don't tell]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Carlos|authorlink= Carlos Baker |title=Hemingway: The Writer as Artist|url=https://archive.org/details/hemingwaywritera00bake|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1972|edition=4th|isbn=0-691-01305-5|ref = CITEREFBaker1972}}\n*{{cite book |title=New Critical Approaches to the Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway |editor-first=Jackson |editor-last=Benson |chapter=The Art of the Short Story |author=Ernest Hemingway|year= 1990|publisher=Duke University Press  |isbn= 978-0-8223-1067-9|ref=CITEREFHemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Benson |first1=Jackson |year=1989 |title= Ernest Hemingway: The Life as Fiction and the Fiction as Life|journal=American Literature |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=345\u2013358 |doi= 10.2307/2926824|ref = CITEREFBenson1989 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Ernest Hemingway A to Z: The Essential Reference to the Life and Work |last=Oliver |first=Charles M. |year=1999 |publisher=Checkmark |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-3467-2 |ref=CITEREFOliver1999 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ernesthemingwayt0000oliv }}\n*{{cite book |title= Hemingway: A Life Without Consequences|last=Mellow |first=James R. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-395-37777-3 |ref = CITEREFMellow1992}}\n*{{cite book |title= Hemingway: A Biography|last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-42126-4 |ref = CITEREFMeyers1985}}\n*{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway| title=Ernest Hemingway, The Art of Fiction No. 21| work=The Paris Review| date=Spring 1958| author=George Plimpton| ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=The Young Hemingway |last=Reynolds|first=Michael S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-31776-5|oclc= |ref = CITEREFReynolds1998}}\n*{{cite book |title=Hemingway's In our time: lyrical dimensions |url=https://archive.org/details/hemingwaysinourt0000tetl |url-access=registration |last=Tetlow |first=Wendolyn |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |edition = |publisher=Associated University Presses |location= Cranbury NJ |isbn=0-8387-5219-5 |ref=CITEREFTetlow}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Smith, Paul. |year=1983 |title=Hemingway's Early Manuscripts: The Theory and Practice of Omission |journal=Journal of Modern Literature |publisher=Indiana University Press |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages= 268\u2013288|jstor=3831126 |ref=CITEREFSmith1983 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Ben |year=2003 |title= The Stones of Venice, Time and Remembrance: Calculus and Proust in ''Across the River and into the Trees''|journal=The Hemingway Review|volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=20\u201329 |ref=CITEREFStoltzfus2003}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Trodd |first1=Zoe |year=2007 |title= Hemingway's camera eye: The problems of language and an interwar politics of form|journal=The Hemingway Review |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201321 |doi=10.1353/hem.2007.0012|ref=CITEREFTrodd2007}}\n\n\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:American literature]]\n[[Category:Ernest Hemingway]]\n[[Category:Literary theory]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:ErnestHemingway.jpg|thumb|Ernest Hemingway as photographed for the 1940 edition of ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'']]\nThe '''iceberg theory''' or '''theory of omission''' is a [[writing]] technique coined by American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]].

As Stoltzfus remarks: \"Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he must cross alone without the narrator's help.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus|2003}}</ref>\n\nHemingway believed that if context or background had been written about by another, and written about well, then it could be left out of his writing. Of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' he explains: \"In writing you are limited to by what has already been done satisfactorily. So I have tried to do something else. First I have tried to eliminate everything unnecessary to conveying experience to the reader so that after he has read something it will become part of his experience and seem actually to have happened.\"<ref name=\"Smith\">qtd in {{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}</ref> Paul Smith, author of ''Hemingway's Early Manuscript: The Theory and Practice of Omission'', believes Hemingway applied the theory of omission in effort to \"strengthen [the] iceberg\".<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn October 1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He jokingly told the press he believed [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Isak Dinesen]] deserved the prize more than he, but that the prize money would be welcome.<ref name=\"Baker p338\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}</ref> The prize was awarded to Hemingway \"for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |year=1954 |work= Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> A few days after the announcement, Hemingway spoke with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent, while on his boat fishing off the coast of Cuba. When asked about the use of symbolism in his work, and particularly in the most recently published ''Old Man and the Sea'', he explained:\n\n<blockquote>No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in ... That kind of symbol sticks out like raisins in raisin bread. Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935439-5,00.html|title= An American Storyteller |date=13 December 1954 |work= Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abductive reasoning]]\n*[[Case-based reasoning]]\n*[[Casuistry]]\n*[[Concision]]\n*[[Gonzo journalism]]\n*[[I know it when I see it]]\n*[[Purposeful omission]]\n*[[Show, don't tell]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Carlos|authorlink= Carlos Baker |title=Hemingway: The Writer as Artist|url=https://archive.org/details/hemingwaywritera00bake|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1972|edition=4th|isbn=0-691-01305-5|ref = CITEREFBaker1972}}\n*{{cite book |title=New Critical Approaches to the Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway |editor-first=Jackson |editor-last=Benson |chapter=The Art of the Short Story |author=Ernest Hemingway|year= 1990|publisher=Duke University Press  |isbn= 978-0-8223-1067-9|ref=CITEREFHemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Benson |first1=Jackson |year=1989 |title= Ernest Hemingway: The Life as Fiction and the Fiction as Life|journal=American Literature |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=345\u2013358 |doi= 10.2307/2926824|ref = CITEREFBenson1989 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Ernest Hemingway A to Z: The Essential Reference to the Life and Work |last=Oliver |first=Charles M. |year=1999 |publisher=Checkmark |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-3467-2 |ref=CITEREFOliver1999 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ernesthemingwayt0000oliv }}\n*{{cite book |title= Hemingway: A Life Without Consequences|last=Mellow |first=James R. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-395-37777-3 |ref = CITEREFMellow1992}}\n*{{cite book |title= Hemingway: A Biography|last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-42126-4 |ref = CITEREFMeyers1985}}\n*{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway| title=Ernest Hemingway, The Art of Fiction No. 21| work=The Paris Review| date=Spring 1958| author=George Plimpton| ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=The Young Hemingway |last=Reynolds|first=Michael S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-31776-5|oclc= |ref = CITEREFReynolds1998}}\n*{{cite book |title=Hemingway's In our time: lyrical dimensions |url=https://archive.org/details/hemingwaysinourt0000tetl |url-access=registration |last=Tetlow |first=Wendolyn |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |edition = |publisher=Associated University Presses |location= Cranbury NJ |isbn=0-8387-5219-5 |ref=CITEREFTetlow}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Smith, Paul. |year=1983 |title=Hemingway's Early Manuscripts: The Theory and Practice of Omission |journal=Journal of Modern Literature |publisher=Indiana University Press |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages= 268\u2013288|jstor=3831126 |ref=CITEREFSmith1983 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Ben |year=2003 |title= The Stones of Venice, Time and Remembrance: Calculus and Proust in ''Across the River and into the Trees''|journal=The Hemingway Review|volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=20\u201329 |ref=CITEREFStoltzfus2003}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Trodd |first1=Zoe |year=2007 |title= Hemingway's camera eye: The problems of language and an interwar politics of form|journal=The Hemingway Review |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201321 |doi=10.1353/hem.2007.0012|ref=CITEREFTrodd2007}}\n\n\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:American literature]]\n[[Category:Ernest Hemingway]]\n[[Category:Literary theory]]\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNovels", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_theory"}
