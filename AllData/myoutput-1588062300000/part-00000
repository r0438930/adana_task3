The [[Ministry of Defence Police]] is a civilian force that provides policing services on military bases, and as such has a CID much like a territorial police force. The RMP SIB has regular sections, and one [[Army Reserve(United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] section. To join the reserve section, a reservist must either have a regular army SIB or civilian CID background.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fraud Squad (UK)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.met.police.uk/history/cid.htm CID page on Metropolitan Police website]\n* [http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/ministry/home/mpf/special.htm CID Myanmar Police Force]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101207004143/http://nottinghamshire.police.uk/about/history/ the history of Nottingham police]\n{{Specialist units of the United Kingdom police}}\n\n[[Category:Types of police unit of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Criminal investigation]]\n[[Category:Criminology organizations]]\n[[category:History of the Metropolitan Police]]\n", "name_user": "GunnisonMarmot", "label": "safe", "comment": "commas", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation_department"}
