Jargon is one of the oldest and most prestigious small presses in the United States and has published seminal works of the American literary avant-garde, including books by [[Charles Olson]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Paul Metcalf]], [[James Broughton]], and Williams himself, as well as ''[[sui generis]]'' books of folk art such as ''White Trash Cooking''.\n\nThough most of Jargon's writers are either cult figures or genuine obscurities, the books themselves are often intricately designed deluxe editions. [[Guy Davenport]] described the Jargon Society as \"a paradoxical fusion of fine printing and ''[[samizdat]]'' diffusion.\"\n\n== History ==\nThe Jargon Society was founded in 1951 by Jonathan Williams and [[David Ruff]] in a [[San Francisco]] Chinese restaurant. ''Jargon 1'' was the first work to be published by the small press, consisting of Williams' poem \"Garbage Litters the Iron face of the Sun\u2019s Child\" and an etching by Ruff, made into a folded pamphlet. Only 150 copies were produced. ''Jargon 2'', published in the same year, was called \"The Dancer,\" and contained a poem by [[Joel Oppenheimer]] and a drawing by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Williams continued publishing works from fellow students and teachers while attending [[Black Mountain College]] in [[Black Mountain, North Carolina]]. Williams enjoyed publishing writers and artists that were considered \"underdogs,\" often encouraging collaboration between them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jargonbooks.com/|title=The Jargon Society|website=jargonbooks.com|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010175108/http://www.jargonbooks.com/|archive-date=2018-10-10|url-status=live}}</ref> His predilection to champion outsiders in art and literature earned Williams the epithet \"custodian of snowflakes\" from literary critic Hugh Kenner.\n\nThe press has published many influential works of the literary avant-garde, including ''The Maximus Poems'' by Charles Olson and ''The Neugents'' by David M. Spear. Jargon passed down the opportunity to publish the now Beat Generation classic, ''[[Howl]]'', by [[Allen Ginsberg]].\n\nOne of the most well-known titles published by Jargon was ''White Trash Cooking'' by [[Ernest Matthew Mickler]]. This cookbook, which has been rejected by publishers in the Northeast before its publication by Jargon, was such a success that the small press could not keep up with orders. After a month, unable to keep up with demand, Jargon sold the rights to Ten Speed Press for $90,000 and a 15% royalties clause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bittersoutherner.com/the-short-and-brilliant-life-of-ernest-matthew-mickler|title=The Short and Brilliant Life of Ernest Matthew Mickler|website=THE BITTER SOUTHERNER|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190802194455/https://bittersoutherner.com/the-short-and-brilliant-life-of-ernest-matthew-mickler|archive-date=2019-08-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nJargon has also sponsored many programs in literature and the arts, providing support for poets, photographers, and others \"who are deserving but not recognized.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblio.com/publisher/jargon-society|title=Jargon Society - First Edition Identification and Publisher Information|website=www.biblio.com|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425021323/https://www.biblio.com/publisher/jargon-society|archive-date=2019-04-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Jargon Society's inventory and rights were given to the [[Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center]] soon after Williams' passing in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jargonbooks.com/|title=The Jargon Society|website=jargonbooks.com|access-date=2019-08-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010175108/http://www.jargonbooks.com/|archive-date=2018-10-10|url-status=live}}</ref> The museum has continued publication under the imprint.
