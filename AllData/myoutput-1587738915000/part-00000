The [[World Health Organization]] says that jurisdictions should aim to test every suspected case of COVID-19<ref name=\"auto1\"> {{Cite web| url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331509/WHO-COVID-19-lab_testing-2020.1-eng.pdf| title=Laboratory testing strategy recommendations for COVID-19, Interim Guidance 21 March 2020}}</ref>. Before beginning to reopen the economy, researchers have advised the United States to aim for ''at least'' 152 tests per 100,000 people each day <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html| first=Keith |last=Collins |title=Coronavirus Testing Needs to Triple Before the U.S. Can Reopen, Experts Say| newspaper=The New York Times | date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>. In late April, Ontario was testing just under 10,000 people per day, equal to a testing rate of about 70 tests per 100,000 people per day.\n \n=== Types of tests ===\n==== Virus-RNA tests ====\nAs of April 2020, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in Ontario is conducted using a method called [[RT-PCR]]. A carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres across Ontario. At the centres, highly-skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test mixes the sample with a test kit containing chemicals designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between two temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nIn early April, Ontario has contracted Spartan Bioscience Inc. from Ottawa to supply it with virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/13/ontario-orders-close-to-one-million-spartan-bioscience-portable-covid-19-test-kits.html|title=Ontario orders close to one million Spartan Bioscience portable COVID-19 test kits|date=April 13, 2020}} </ref>. The contract was for 900,000 swab test kits, whereas the number of machines has not been disclosed. While these machines cannot process many samples in total, they have the advantage of being small and easy to use. Thus, they can be used to provide rapid results at the point-of-care. They are expected to be useful at border crossings, isolated communities, prisons, and care homes.\n\n==== Serology tests ====\nOntario is performing experiments testing the performance of blood tests that look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref> {{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/20/covid-19-community-spread-in-ontario-has-likely-reached-its-peak-new-modelling-shows/|title=COVID-19 community spread in Ontario has likely reached its peak, new modelling shows|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>. Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection. However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.\n\n=== Testing facilities ===\n\nPublic Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent. The main laboratory is the top four floors of the MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto <ref> {{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/canada/2020/04/10/a-virtual-tour-of-a-public-health-ontario-lab-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing.html?fbclid=IwAR09umcjbDihhlDeBgrtnnU9lD5ts73VIcN0N6_55XSC4Cwv5M6Nb0QAREU| title=A virtual tour of a Public Health Ontario lab ramping up its COVID-19 testing}} </ref>.

In addition to the six public health labs, this includes 10 hospital networks and three private lab networks, including Dynacare and LifeLabs <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/04/how-ontario-turned-the-tide-on-a-huge-backlog-of-covid-19-tests.html|title=How Ontario turned the tide on a huge backlog of COVID-19 tests|date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>.\n\n=== Testing access ===\nAccess to testing is set by Public Health Ontario who publishes a guidance document that defines the conditions for an individual to be tested <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_covid_testing_guidance.pdf|title=Ontario Public Health 2019 COVID testing guidance}}</ref>. Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.  The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw| title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada |first=Emily |last=Chung |date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>. Starting in March, the public health units across the province have opened over 70 assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional ([https://www.ontariohealthcoalition.ca/index.php/resources-list-of-ontario-covid-19-assessment-centres-their-individual-criteria List of Ontario COVID-19 Assessment Centres & Their Individual Criteria]). These range from mobile units, to walk-up locations, to drive-through locations. This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices.  If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing. Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at longterm care homes.\n\nSince many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be a factor of 20 to 100 higher \n<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stay-home-covid-19-spreading-in-community-100s-could-be-infected-says-ottawas-medical-officer-of-health/|title=STAY HOME: COVID-19 spreading in the community, 100s could be infected, says Ottawa's medical officer of health}}</ref>.

This 10% limit was exceeded on multiple days in early April. Since a relatively limited number of cases are tested, the actual number of cases will be much higher than the test-confirmed numbers.\n\nIn late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crawley |first1=Mike |title=Wait list for COVID-19 test results balloons to 11,000 in Ontario |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-test-ontario-waiting-lab-results-coronavirus-1.5510644 |website=CBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw|title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada|work=CBC|first=Emily |last=Chung}} </ref> but had high testing numbers compared to most western countries (see [[Template:COVID-19 testing by country subdivision]]).\n\nOn April 15, polling firms, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research, released results of a survey conducted on April 11 and 12 about COVID-19 prevalence and testing.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/one-fifth-of-ontario-households-have-one-or-more-symptoms-of-covid-19/ |title= COVID-19 Symptom Study - Ontario}}</ref> Of the 5,045 respondents, 19% of households contained someone who had at least one symptom and in 8% of households someone had a key symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n=== Testing capacity ===\nSince January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR. Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of [[reagent]] chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs. To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted. In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.  New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly. Returning tests results to individuals is automated with an online portal <ref> {{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6773258/coronavirus-ontario-online-test-results-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus: Ontario announces online portal to check COVID-19 test results}}</ref>.\n\n==== Testing capacity projections ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[World Health Organization]] says that jurisdictions should aim to test every suspected case of COVID-19<ref name=\"auto1\"> {{Cite web| url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331509/WHO-COVID-19-lab_testing-2020.1-eng.pdf| title=Laboratory testing strategy recommendations for COVID-19, Interim Guidance 21 March 2020}}</ref>. Before beginning to reopen the economy, researchers have advised the United States to aim for ''at least'' 152 tests per 100,000 people each day <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html| first=Keith |last=Collins |title=Coronavirus Testing Needs to Triple Before the U.S. Can Reopen, Experts Say| newspaper=The New York Times | date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>. In late April, Ontario was testing just under 10,000 people per day, equal to a testing rate of about 70 tests per 100,000 people per day.\n \n=== Types of tests ===\n==== Virus-RNA tests ====\nAs of April 2020, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in Ontario is conducted using a method called [[RT-PCR]]. A carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres across Ontario. At the centres, highly-skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test mixes the sample with a test kit containing chemicals designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between two temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nIn early April, Ontario has contracted Spartan Bioscience Inc. from Ottawa to supply it with virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/13/ontario-orders-close-to-one-million-spartan-bioscience-portable-covid-19-test-kits.html|title=Ontario orders close to one million Spartan Bioscience portable COVID-19 test kits|date=April 13, 2020}} </ref>. The contract was for 900,000 swab test kits, whereas the number of machines has not been disclosed. While these machines cannot process many samples in total, they have the advantage of being small and easy to use. Thus, they can be used to provide rapid results at the point-of-care. They are expected to be useful at border crossings, isolated communities, prisons, and care homes.\n\n==== Serology tests ====\nOntario is performing experiments testing the performance of blood tests that look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref> {{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/20/covid-19-community-spread-in-ontario-has-likely-reached-its-peak-new-modelling-shows/|title=COVID-19 community spread in Ontario has likely reached its peak, new modelling shows|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>. Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection. However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.\n\n=== Testing facilities ===\n\nPublic Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent. The main laboratory is the top four floors of the MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto <ref> {{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/canada/2020/04/10/a-virtual-tour-of-a-public-health-ontario-lab-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing.html?fbclid=IwAR09umcjbDihhlDeBgrtnnU9lD5ts73VIcN0N6_55XSC4Cwv5M6Nb0QAREU| title=A virtual tour of a Public Health Ontario lab ramping up its COVID-19 testing}} </ref>.

Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.  The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw| title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada |first=Emily |last=Chung |date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>. Starting in March, the public health units across the province have opened over 70 assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional ([https://www.ontariohealthcoalition.ca/index.php/resources-list-of-ontario-covid-19-assessment-centres-their-individual-criteria List of Ontario COVID-19 Assessment Centres & Their Individual Criteria]). These range from mobile units, to walk-up locations, to drive-through locations. This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices.  If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing. Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at longterm care homes.\n\nSince many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be a factor of 20 to 100 higher \n<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stay-home-covid-19-spreading-in-community-100s-could-be-infected-says-ottawas-medical-officer-of-health/|title=STAY HOME: COVID-19 spreading in the community, 100s could be infected, says Ottawa's medical officer of health}}</ref>.

Since a relatively limited number of cases are tested, the actual number of cases will be much higher than the test-confirmed numbers.\n\nIn late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crawley |first1=Mike |title=Wait list for COVID-19 test results balloons to 11,000 in Ontario |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-test-ontario-waiting-lab-results-coronavirus-1.5510644 |website=CBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw|title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada|work=CBC|first=Emily |last=Chung}} </ref> but had high testing numbers compared to most western countries (see [[Template:COVID-19 testing by country subdivision]]).\n\nOn April 15, polling firms, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research, released results of a survey conducted on April 11 and 12 about COVID-19 prevalence and testing.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/one-fifth-of-ontario-households-have-one-or-more-symptoms-of-covid-19/ |title= COVID-19 Symptom Study - Ontario}}</ref> Of the 5,045 respondents, 19% of households contained someone who had at least one symptom and in 8% of households someone had a key symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n=== Testing capacity ===\nSince January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR. Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of [[reagent]] chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs. To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted. In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.  New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly. Returning tests results to individuals is automated with an online portal <ref> {{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6773258/coronavirus-ontario-online-test-results-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus: Ontario announces online portal to check COVID-19 test results}}</ref>.\n\n==== Testing capacity projections ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
