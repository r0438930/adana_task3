It was released on September 9, 2015 by [[SM Entertainment]] and distributed by [[KT Music]], marking their second proper release in 2015 following the debut [[extended play]] [[Ice Cream Cake (EP)|''Ice Cream Cake'']] in March 2015. The album focuses solely on the group's \"Red\" image stemming from [[Red Velvet (group)#Artistry|the group's name and concept]], showing the group's vivid and bold image with mainly [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] incorporation. [[LDN Noise]], [[Ryan S. Jhun]], [[Denzil 'DR' Remedios|Denzil \"DR\" Remedios]], [[Dsign Music]], [[Kenzie (songwriter)|Kenzie]], [[Daniel \"Obi\" Klein, Charlie Taft|Deekay]], [[Charli Taft]], Jinbo, [[Dem Jointz]], as well as others, handled production of the album, with S.M. founder [[Lee Soo-man]] serving as the executive producer of the album. A similar conceptual follow-up to the album called ''[[The Velvet]]'' was later released in the first half of 2016, which was composed of mostly [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] tracks and ballads showcasing the \"Velvet\" half with a more mature and sophisticated side of the girl group.\n\nUpon its release, ''The Red'' received positive reviews from critics for its musical diversity while showing the \"quirkiness\" of Red Velvet. The album was a commercial success, becoming Red Velvet's second chart-topper on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] in South Korea. It also attained international success, becoming the group's first number one title on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' World Album Chart, while peaking at number twenty-four on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums chart]]. It was later included as ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s 10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015.\n\nPromotion for the album was preceded by the release of the lead single \"[[Dumb Dumb]]\" on the same release day, along with live performances on weekly music shows for both \"Dumb Dumb\" and the album track \"Huff 'n' Puff\". The lead single was a commercial success, peaking at number two on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]] and number three on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' World Digital Songs chart while becoming one of the group's signature \"Red\" singles.\n\n==Background and release==\nFollowing the group's first major release ''Ice Cream Cake'' in March 2015, S.M. Entertainment announced that Red Velvet would be returning with their first [[Studio album|full album]] in early September. On September 3, a series of image teasers were revealed on the group's official [[Instagram]] account, along with the album's tracklist.

Heavily influenced by [[funk]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] elements, the song is composed by producer [[Ryan S. Jhun]] and [[British people|British]] [[production team]] [[LDN Noise]], the latter whom have previously written and produced songs for fellow [[S.M.

It is followed by \"Huff 'n' Puff\", an [[Electropop|electro-pop]] song that features  a [[dubstep]]-like breakdown that sings about waking up from a dream and coming back to reality, like [[Alice in Wonderland|Alice]] falling down the rabbit hole.<ref>{{Cite episode |accessdate=October 5, 2015 |series=Gayo Plaza |author=Kim Chang-ryul |network=[[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] |station=SBS Power FM |location=Seoul |date=September 24, 2015 |language=Korean}}</ref> The third track \"Campfire\" is described as an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] pop song that has an ear-catching rhythmical guitar intro. The fourth track \"Red Dress\" is a dominant dance-pop track with lots of synth element running through the song, clapping-like [[Snare drum|snare]] and [[Marching band|marching]]-influenced [[drumline]] which tells a story in which a girl wears a red dress and clumsily but slyly tempts a man who treats her only as a child. The soulful, R&B-flavored \"Oh Boy\" showcases the singing ability and highlights harmonization of the girlgroup, while being the next three songs which are produced by LDN Noise. Ryan S. Jhun co-produced the former two tracks, with additional production by [[Denzil \"DR\" Remedios]] on \"Campfire\" and Dsign Music on \"Red Dress\". \n\nThe latter half of ''The Red'' starts with the sixth track \"Lady's Room\", an uptempo R&B, [[synth-pop]] song that sings about the sisterhood between girls and the happy moments they share. It was one of three tracks produced by [[Deekay|Daniel \"Obi\" Klein]] along with the next track \"Time Slip\", which is a 90s-influenced [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-based R&B song with lyrics that describes the laziness and listlessness that one feels while going back and forth between dream and reality in the morning. \"Time Slip\" also sees the participation of British songwriter Charli Taft, whom had previously co-written and produced \"[[Automatic (Red Velvet song)|Automatic]]\" along with Daniel Klein, while marking the first collaboration from South Korean music producer Jinbo for the girl group. The eighth track \"Don't U Wait No More\" highlights the group's harmonization over a heavy synth production with a harmonized \"Don't you wait no more\" [[Hook (music)|hook]], with the lyrics revolve around a girl trying to get closer to her hesitant boyfriend, followed by the [[bossa nova]]-influenced [[midtempo]] pop-rock track \"Day 1\", which describes the feeling of new love by combining the electric, funky guitar sound and the melodic piano with the vocals of the members. The album ends with \"Cool World\", a [[synth-pop]] uptempo song with hopeful lyrics about embracing and living as themselves. \n\n==Promotion==\nPromoting activities for the album started with a \"[[Comeback (K-pop)|comeback showcase]]\" by Red Velvet where they performed \"Dumb Dumb.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&aid=0000755959&lfrom=twitter|title=\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3 \uc774\ubc88 \ucef4\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uccab \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ub4e4|author=Kim Ye-na|date=September 4, 2015|website=TV Report|language=Korean|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> They also appeared on a 5-episode live broadcast through the [[Naver]] V-Live [[Mobile app|app]] called ''\uc624\ubc29\ub9cc\uc871!

It was released on September 9, 2015 by [[SM Entertainment]] and distributed by [[KT Music]], marking their second proper release in 2015 following the debut [[extended play]] [[Ice Cream Cake (EP)|''Ice Cream Cake'']] in March 2015. The album focuses solely on the group's \"Red\" image stemming from [[Red Velvet (group)#Artistry|the group's name and concept]], showing the group's vivid and bold image with mainly [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] incorporation. [[LDN Noise]], [[Ryan S. Jhun]], [[Denzil 'DR' Remedios|Denzil \"DR\" Remedios]], [[Dsign Music]], [[Kenzie (songwriter)|Kenzie]], [[Daniel \"Obi\" Klein, Charlie Taft|Deekay]], [[Charli Taft]], Jinbo, [[Dem Jointz]], as well as others, handled production of the album, with S.M. founder [[Lee Soo-man]] serving as the executive producer of the album. A similar conceptual follow-up to the album called ''[[The Velvet]]'' was later released in the first half of 2016, which was composed of mostly [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] tracks and ballads showcasing the \"Velvet\" half with a more mature and sophisticated side of the girl group.\n\nUpon its release, ''The Red'' received positive reviews from critics for its musical diversity while showing the \"quirkiness\" of Red Velvet. The album was a commercial success, becoming Red Velvet's second chart-topper on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] in South Korea. It also attained international success, becoming the group's first number one title on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' World Albums Chart for the first time, while peaking at number twenty-four on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums chart]]. It was later included as ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s 10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015.\n\nPromotion for the album was preceded by the release of the lead single \"[[Dumb Dumb]]\" on the same release day, along with live performances on weekly music shows for both \"Dumb Dumb\" and the album track \"Huff 'n' Puff\". The lead single was a commercial success, peaking at number two on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]] and number three on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' World Digital Songs chart while becoming one of the group's signature \"Red\" singles.\n\n==Background and release==\nFollowing the group's first major release ''Ice Cream Cake'' in March 2015, S.M. Entertainment announced that Red Velvet would be returning with their first [[Studio album|full album]] in early September. On September 3, a series of image teasers were revealed on the group's official [[Instagram]] account, along with the album's tracklist. On September 4, the company announced that the full album would be released at midnight on September 9, with \"Dumb Dumb\" serving as the lead single (aka title track).<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Velvet Reveals Track List for Their First Album \"Red\" Through Fun Instagram Surprise |website=Soompi |url=http://www.soompi.com/2015/09/03/red-velvet-reveals-track-list-for-their-first-album-red-through-fun-instagram-surprise/ |accessdate=September 4, 2015 |date=September 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stoo.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?sec=enter99&idxno=2015090410011291722 |accessdate=September 4, 2015 |author=Lee So-dam |website=Sports Today |date=September 4, 2015|title=\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3 9\uc6d49\uc77c \ucef4\ubc31 \ud655\uc815\u2026SM \ud558\ubc18\uae30 \uccab\uc8fc\uc790 [\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20\ud22c\ub370\uc774]|language=Korean}}</ref> A series of video teasers was released since September 4, including song previews for \"Huff 'n' Puff\", \"Don't U Wait No More\", \"Time Slip\", \"Dumb Dumb\" and \"Red Dress\".

Heavily influenced by [[funk]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] elements, the song is composed by producer [[Ryan S. Jhun]] and [[British people|British]] [[production team]] [[LDN Noise]], the latter whom have previously written and produced songs for fellow [[S.M.

It is followed by \"Huff 'n' Puff\", an [[Electropop|electro-pop]] song that features  a [[dubstep]]-like breakdown that sings about waking up from a dream and coming back to reality, like [[Alice in Wonderland|Alice]] falling down the rabbit hole.<ref>{{Cite episode |accessdate=October 5, 2015 |series=Gayo Plaza |author=Kim Chang-ryul |network=[[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] |station=SBS Power FM |location=Seoul |date=September 24, 2015 |language=Korean}}</ref> The third track \"Campfire\" is described as an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] pop song that has an ear-catching rhythmical guitar intro. The fourth track \"Red Dress\" is a dominant dance-pop track with lots of synth element running through the song, clapping-like [[Snare drum|snare]] and [[Marching band|marching]]-influenced [[drumline]] which tells a story in which a girl wears a red dress and clumsily but slyly tempts a man who treats her only as a child. The soulful, R&B-flavored \"Oh Boy\" showcases the singing ability and highlights harmonization of the girlgroup, while being the next three songs which are produced by LDN Noise. Ryan S. Jhun co-produced the former two tracks, with additional production by [[Denzil \"DR\" Remedios]] on \"Campfire\" and Dsign Music on \"Red Dress\". \n\nThe latter half of ''The Red'' starts with the sixth track \"Lady's Room\", an uptempo R&B, [[synth-pop]] song that sings about the sisterhood between girls and the happy moments they share. It was one of three tracks produced by [[Deekay|Daniel \"Obi\" Klein]] along with the next track \"Time Slip\", which is a 90s-influenced [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-based R&B song with lyrics that describes the laziness and listlessness that one feels while going back and forth between dream and reality in the morning. \"Time Slip\" also sees the participation of British songwriter Charli Taft, whom had previously co-written and produced \"[[Automatic (Red Velvet song)|Automatic]]\" along with Daniel Klein, while marking the first collaboration from South Korean music producer Jinbo for the girl group. The eighth track \"Don't U Wait No More\" highlights the group's harmonization over a heavy synth production with a harmonized \"Don't you wait no more\" [[Hook (music)|hook]], with the lyrics revolve around a girl trying to get closer to her hesitant boyfriend, followed by the [[bossa nova]]-influenced [[midtempo]] pop-rock track \"Day 1\", which describes the feeling of new love by combining the electric, funky guitar sound and the melodic piano with the vocals of the members. The album ends with \"Cool World\", a [[synth-pop]] uptempo song with hopeful lyrics about embracing and living as themselves. \n\n==Promotion==\nPromoting activities for the album started with a \"[[Comeback (K-pop)|comeback showcase]]\" by Red Velvet where they performed \"Dumb Dumb.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&aid=0000755959&lfrom=twitter|title=\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3 \uc774\ubc88 \ucef4\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uccab \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ub4e4|author=Kim Ye-na|date=September 4, 2015|website=TV Report|language=Korean|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> They also appeared on a 5-episode live broadcast through the [[Naver]] V-Live [[Mobile app|app]] called ''\uc624\ubc29\ub9cc\uc871!
