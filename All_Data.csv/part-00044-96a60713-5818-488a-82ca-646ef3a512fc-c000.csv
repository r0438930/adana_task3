The '''Army of Glory''' ({{lang-ar|جيش العزة|'''Jaysh al-Izza'''}}), formerly the '''Union of Glory''' ({{lang-ar|تجمع العزة|Tajamu‘ al-‘Izza|links=no}}), is a [[Syrian rebel]] group affiliated with the [[Free Syrian Army]] active in northwestern [[Syria]], mainly in the [[al-Ghab Plain]] in northern [[Hama Governorate|Hama]] and its surroundings. [[Turkey]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United States]] have supplied the group with [[anti-tank missile]]s<ref name=reuters2015/> including [[9K111 Fagot]]s and [[BGM-71 TOW]]s.<ref name=janes>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/59374/us-arms-shipment-to-syrian-rebels-detailed|title=US arms shipment to Syrian rebels detailed|work=IHS Jane's 360|date=8 April 2016|access-date=9 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205081205/http://www.janes.com/article/59374/us-arms-shipment-to-syrian-rebels-detailed|archive-date=5 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The group has also expressed its disapproval of international efforts such as the Astana and Sochi agreements for de-escalating the war in Syria, and has opposed Russia's involvement in the war. Jaysh al-Izza also made efforts to join the Turkish-backed [[National Front for Liberation]] which includes other prominent Syrian opposition groups in Idlib such as [[Ahrar al-Sham]] and the [[Sham Legion]], but did not do so out of complications with the integration about which Jaysh al-Izza's leadership did not elaborate.<ref>https://syriadirect.org/news/the-syrian-national-army-for-the-syrian-revolution-or-against-the-kurds-1/</ref>

On 30 September 2015, the first day of the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War]], 2 Russian bombs with 8-10 [[submunition]]s struck the group's headquarters and arms depots in a cave in the village of [[Al-Lataminah]] in northern Hama.<ref name=reuters2015/><ref name=alaraby>{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2015/10/1/russia-says-is-not-the-only-target-in-syria|title=Russia says IS not the only target in Syria|work=The New Arab|date=2015-10-01}}</ref>

During the [[2016 Hama offensive]] in September 2016, Jaysh al-Izza used a BGM-71 TOW missile to blow up a low-flying  [[Aérospatiale Gazelle]] helicopter, which they alleged to be Russian.<ref name=reuters2016>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-helicopter-idUSKCN11829T|title=Syrian rebels destroy helicopter in Hama offensive-monitor, rebels|work=Reuters|date=2 September 2016}}</ref>

In September 2018, Jaysh al-Izza originally accepted the [[2018 Idlib demilitarization]] brokered by [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]], with the group's leadership extending their gratitude to the Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdoğan]] for coordinating the agreement. The group later became hostile to the agreement, however, after it was revealed that Syrian Government and other pro-Assad forces would not be required to withdraw from the DMZ and would instead be responsible for governing the opposition-held areas.<ref name=france24>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20180929-syria-rebel-faction-rejects-idlib-deal|title=Syria rebel faction rejects Idlib deal|date=2019-08-29|work=France24}}</ref>

In 1969, the VIPs evolved into what became known as El Chicano. For forty years Espinosa was a force in the group. He also produced and wrote some of their material.

'''''On the Town''''' is a 1949 [[Technicolor]] [[musical film]] with music by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Roger Edens]] and book and [[lyrics]] by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]]. It is an adaptation of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage [[On the Town (musical)|musical of the same name]] produced in 1944 (which itself is an adaptation of the [[Jerome Robbins]] ballet entitled ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'' which was also produced in 1944),<ref name=\"Turner Classic Movies\">{{cite web|url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/355/On-the-Town/notes.html |title=Turner Classic Movies |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220231053/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/355/On-the-Town/notes.html |archive-date=2018-12-20 }}</ref> although many changes in script and score were made from the original stage version; for instance, most of Bernstein's score was dropped in favor of new songs by Edens, who disliked the majority of  Bernstein's music for being too complex and too operatic for movie audiences.  This caused Bernstein to boycott the film.

The film was directed by [[Gene Kelly]], who also choreographed, and [[Stanley Donen]] in their [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], and stars Kelly, [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Betty Garrett]], and [[Ann Miller]], and features [[Jules Munshin]] and [[Vera-Ellen]]. It was a product of the [[Arthur Freed]] unit at [[MGM]], and is notable for its combination of studio and location filming, as a result of Gene Kelly's insistence that some scenes be shot in [[New York City]], including at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and [[Rockefeller Center]].

The film was an immediate success and won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music—Scoring of a Musical Picture]], and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Cinematography (Color). Screenwriters Comden and Green won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Written American Musical.

In 2006, the film ranked No. 19 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|list of Best Musicals]]. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/675384976/jurassic-park-the-shining-and-23-other-movies-added-to-national-film-registry</ref>

==Plot==
Three sailors&nbsp;&ndash; Gabey, Chip, and Ozzie&nbsp;&ndash; begin their shore leave, excited for their 24 hours in New York (\"[[New York, New York (On the Town)|New York, New York]]\"). Riding the subway, Gabey falls in love with the picture of \"Miss Turnstiles\", who is actually called Ivy Smith, and fantasizes about what she's like in real life (\"Miss Turnstiles\").  The sailors race around New York attempting to find her in the brief period they have.

They are assisted by, and become romantically involved with, two women, and pair up: Ozzie with Claire, an anthropologist; and Chip with Hildy Esterhazy, an aggressively amorous taxi driver.  Claire claims that she's found her passionate \"Prehistoric Man\" in Ozzie at the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Anthropological History]]. Hildy invites Chip to \"Come Up to My Place\". Finally finding Ivy, Gabey takes her on an imaginary date down his home town \"Main Street\" in a studio in [[Carnegie Hall|Symphonic Hall]] - not realising that she is also from the same town.  Later, Chip sincerely falls for Hildy telling her \"You're Awful\"&nbsp;– that is, awful nice to be with. That evening, all the couples meet at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] to celebrate a night \"On the Town\".

But when an ashamed Ivy walks out on Gabey to get to her late night work as a [[Burlesque|cooch dancer]], the friends tell a despondent Gabey, \"You Can Count on Me\", joined by Hildy's annoying, but well-meaning roommate, Lucy Schmeeler. They have a number of adventures before reuniting with Ivy at [[Coney Island]] just as their 24-hour leave ends and they must return to their ship to head off to sea. Although their future is uncertain, the boys and girls share one last kiss on the pier as a new batch of sailors heads out into the city for their leave (\"New York, New York\" reprise).

\"'''Bagman'''\" is the eighth episode of the [[Better Call Saul (season 5)|fifth season]] of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', the spinoff series of ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. The episode aired on April 6, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.

== Plot ==
[[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|The Cousins]] arrive at a cartel site in Mexico to pick up Lalo's bail money. As they depart, an informant inside the building makes a telephone call to report their presence.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\" />

Lalo gives Jimmy directions to a remote desert pickup site. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to go, but asks for $100,000, which Lalo promises to pay. Kim begs Jimmy not to go, saying he is an attorney and not a \"[[bagman]]\" for drug dealers, but he says he will do it because it will be easy and no one will suspect him of being the courier.

The next morning, the Cousins deliver two duffel bags of cash to Jimmy at the pickup site and immediately depart. Jimmy starts his return trip but several trucks soon cut him off. Numerous gunmen exit the vehicles, take the money, and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked by an unknown shooter. All but one are killed and their vehicles are disabled. The surviving gunman escapes in the only truck that is still drivable.

The unseen shooter was Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. He finds his truck was also disabled in the shootout, so he places a still-shaken Jimmy and the money in Jimmy's car and begins driving back to Albuquerque. Jimmy's car soon breaks down. With no cell phone coverage and no vehicle, they push the car over the edge of the road and walk cross-country with the money in order to avoid the surviving gunman. As they camp overnight, Jimmy tells Mike that Kim knows of his work for Lalo, and Mike warns Jimmy that if she knows details about the Salamancas, Kim is now \"in the game\". Jimmy and Mike resume their trek the following morning.

When Jimmy fails to return, Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney, tells him she is Jimmy's wife and asks him for Jimmy's location so she can search. Lalo refuses and tells her Jimmy will be fine because he is a survivor.

A dehydrated and sunburned Jimmy reaches his limit, and Mike fails to inspire him. Mike spots the surviving gunman. Rather than hiding as Mike intends, Jimmy regains his motivation and runs to the road to attract the gunman's attention. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots, killing him and causing his vehicle to flip. Mike and Jimmy resume walking, this time on the road.

'''Arthur Durham (David) Divine''', CBE, DSM, (1905–1987) was a prolific South African writer of books on a variety of subjects but will be chiefly remembered for two controversial books on defence issues, ''The Blunted Sword'' (1964) and ''The Broken Wing'' (1966). Divine had been a war correspondent and after the Second World War became the defence correspondent of the British [[Sunday Times]], a post he held until 1975.

== Early career ==

Born in [[Cape Town]] on 27 July 1904, the son of Arthur Henry Divine and his wife, Mabel Frances Durham, he was educated at [[Rondebosch Boys' High School]] and [[Kingswood College, Grahamstown]].<ref>Information supplied by family members.</ref>

He was employed as a journalist on the [[Cape Times]] between 1922–1926 and again between 1931–1935.

In 1930 he commenced his career as an author of adventure stories, thrillers, military politics and history books.<ref>[Mr David Divine, Obituary, Times, 2 May 1987, p.72.]</ref> Some were written under the pen name 'David Rame'. His first novel as Rame was ''Wine of Good Hope'' (1939).

== World War II ==

=== Dunkirk ===

During the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from [[Dunkirk]] in 1940 ([[Operation Dynamo]]), Divine crossed the English Channel three times in a 35-foot boat to rescue trapped British soldiers. During the last of these he received a stomach wound. For his efforts, Divine was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]] (DSM).<ref>Obituary, p.72.</ref> The following year he published a novel based on his experience at Dunkirk, ''The Sun Shall Greet Them: A novel based on the Author's experience of the English evacuation at Dunkirk, WW II'' (1941). Divine would write the screenplay for the feature film ''Dunkirk'' (1958) and was the likely inspiration for central character Charles Foreman ([[Bernard Lee]]), skipper of the motorboat ''Vanity''. Like Divine, he is wounded during the operation but Foreman dies from his wounds. ''Nine Days at Dunkirk'' was a factual account of the operation first published in 1945. In this he exposed the legend that the evacuation was carried out by the spontaneous and uncoordinated actions of the little ships when in fact they had been carried out as 'part of a highly organised movement' by the Admiralty. He was also highly critical of General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]]'s (later Lord Alanbrooke) actions preceding the operation but very sympathetic to [[Lord Gort]], commander of the BEF.<ref>\"In Which They Served.\" Times [London, England] 16 April 1959: 15.

=== Other theatres ===

As one of only three war correspondents allowed to travel with the Royal Navy, Divine reported on the war situation in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic. To be selected as a correspondent aboard a British warship at this time was a considerable achievement in itself as the Royal Navy was suspicious of journalists and refused to allow any aboard at the beginning of the war.<ref>P Knightley, The First Casualty is Truth: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo (Prion Books, 2001), p.244.</ref> Many of his observations were incorporated into ''Destroyers’ War: A Million Miles by the Eighth Flotilla'' (1943). He was also present during ''[[Operation Torch]]'' – the American landings in North Africa in 1943, and travelled over the [[Atlas Mountains]] with the first US troops to fight the German army in the Second World War.  At [[D-Day]] (''[[Operation Overlord]]'') he accompanied the first flotilla of tank landing craft. The final phase of the war was spent with the American Pacific Fleet in the last battles against Japan. Despite his work as a correspondent he still found time to write ''The Sun Shall Greet Them,'' (1941), ''Tunnel from Calais'' (1943), and ''Road to Tunis,'' (1944). After the war, he received the Order of the British Empire ([[OBE]]) in recognition of his service during the conflict.<ref>Obituary, p.72</ref>

== Criticism of British defence ==
Working for the ''Sunday Times'' foreign news service under former naval intelligence officer (and later creator of [[James Bond]]), [[Ian Fleming]], Divine travelled widely. He claimed to be the only journalist to charge expenses for an aeroplane and a camel on the same claim form. As newspapers published longer articles and features, Divine made his reputation as the ''Sunday Times'' defence correspondent, where he wrote extensively about Britain's defences in the age of the nuclear missile.<ref>Obituary, p.72</ref> He subjected  Britain's defence establishment to withering fire in ''The Blunted Sword'' (1964) for a lack of imagination and for missing countless opportunities since the Royal Navy began its transition from sail to steam. He was particularly critical of the services' \"fortress mentality\" in fiercely defending their individual vested interests. Divine recommended maximum decentralisation to the commands and a return of the function of weapons production to industry, to competitive development and to new ideas untrammelled by bureaucracy and tradition. This was contrary to the government's efforts to push British aircraft firms and other defence industries into a succession of mergers that would finally become [[British Aerospace plc]] and to create a unified [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD). The MOD, he argued, would not resolve the problems of inter-service rivalry as they would merely \"fight in different ways for their separate powers\".<ref>Divine, ''The Blunted Sword'' (Hutchinson, 1964), cover synopsis.</ref> A naval reviewer acknowledged Divine's painstaking factual accuracy but accused him of seeing only one side of the question and failing to properly appreciate the difficulties faced in the past.<ref>RH, \"Review of The Blunted Sword\", ''The Naval Review'', Vol. LII No- 3, 31 July 1964.</ref> Criticism of Divine on the grounds of his lack of objectivity would be unfair, claimed a ''Times'' reviewer, pointing out that his preface made clear it was an attack upon the service administration rather than the services themselves. It was not the sort of book to draw much praise from scholarly historians but was nevertheless \"effective\" with \"something of value to say about Britain's power to influence the policies of the west\".<ref>\"Warriors in Whitehall\", ''Times'', 19 March 1964, p.17.</ref>

Divine produced a wider ranging attack on the air force establishment from World War I up to the mid-1960s in ''The Broken Wing'' (1966). He claimed that all three of the British armed services were slow to appreciate the missile's potential despite the damage inflicted to Britain by Germany's [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] cruise missiles and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rockets toward the end of the Second World War. He criticized the RAF for clinging to the manned bomber when the United States was relegating the [[United States Air Force]]'s (USAF) [[Strategic Air Command]]'s (SAC) bomber force to a subsidiary role.<ref>Divine, ''The Broken Wing: A Study in the British Exercise of Air Power'' (Hutchinson, 1966), pp. 9–15.</ref> This was because the Soviet air defences had demonstrated their effectiveness against manned aircraft by shooting down the high-altitude [[Lockheed U-2]] spy-plane piloted by [[Gary Powers]] with a surface-to-air guided missile.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', p.325</ref> The US then unintentionally frustrated the British bomber lobby's plans by cancelling its [[GAM-87 Skybolt]] project–a planned stand-off missile that had just been ordered for the V bomber fleet. The US then concentrated on the development of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles ([[ICBM]]s).<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 342–343.</ref> Improvements in Soviet Intermediate Range ([[IRBM]]) and stand-off missiles also indicated that Britain was defenceless against a missile strike during the mid-1960s, because a potential counter-strike against the [[Soviet Union]] with sub-sonic [[V bombers]] seemed doomed to failure given the improvements to the Soviet air defences and the fact that the V bomber bases were themselves vulnerable to IRBM's and stand-off missilery.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 317–318</ref> The attempt to prolong the life of the V bomber force by converting the aircraft from high level to low level attack and using a stop-gap stand-off missile was also seen as futile owing to the advances made in the field of Soviet non-radar low-level air defence and the inherent limitations of British equipment originally designed for use at high altitudes. \"Britain stood naked in a missile-armed world\", he wrote.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 347, 375–76.</ref>

==Other writings==
But Divine also wrote on a wide array of subjects. ''The North-West Frontier of Rome'' re-told the story of Hadrian's Wall and a children's book ''The Three Red Flares'' (1970) may have been the first book produced that used computer technology for mass-publishing.<ref>Obituary, p.72.</ref> ''Boy on a Dolphin'' (1955), set in Greece would become a major [[20th Century Fox]] film starring [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. The book tells the romantic story of Phaedra, an island sponge-diver who discovers an ancient statue of a boy riding upon a dolphin. The statue then becomes the object of a struggle between an archaeologist (Ladd) who wants Phaedra (Loren) to sell it to the Greek authorities and a millionaire who desires it for his private collection.<ref>OUR CORRESPONDENT. \"American Film Made in Greece.\" Times [London, England] 27 November 1956: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 April 2014.</ref> By coincidence, two years after the novel was released, a 16\" bronze statuette of the goddess [[Artemis]] removing an arrow from her quiver was found near [[Delos]], Divine's original setting.

== Legacy ==

Divine wrote over 21 books. His writing on defence issues was a notable influence on Wing Cmdr Hubert Allen's controversial books and articles on British airpower, especially ''Who Won the Battle of Britain'' and ''The Legacy of [[Lord Trenchard]]''. Allen claimed that Divine was the 'notable exception' to the Fleet Street defence correspondents, who 'almost to a man' swallowed the notion of the V bomber's low-level capability.<ref>H R Allen, The Legacy of Lord Trenchard (Cassell, 1972), p.191.</ref> He died on 30 April 1987.

'''Arthur Durham (David) Divine''', CBE, DSM, (1905–1987) was a prolific South African writer of books on a variety of subjects but will be chiefly remembered for two controversial books on defence issues, ''The Blunted Sword'' (1964) and ''The Broken Wing'' (1966). Divine had been a war correspondent and after the Second World War became the defence correspondent of the British [[Sunday Times]], a post he held until 1975.

== Early career ==

Born in [[Cape Town]] on 27 July 1904, the son of Arthur Henry Divine and his wife, Mabel Frances Durham, he was educated at [[Rondebosch Boys' High School]] and [[Kingswood College, Grahamstown]].<ref>Information supplied by family members.</ref>

He was employed as a journalist on the [[Cape Times]] between 1922–1926 and again between 1931–1935.

In 1930 he commenced his career as an author of adventure stories, thrillers, military politics and history books.<ref>[Mr David Divine, Obituary, Times, 2 May 1987, p.72.]</ref> Some were written under the pen name 'David Rame'. His first novel as Rame was ''Wine of Good Hope'' (1939).

== World War II ==

=== Dunkirk ===

During the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from [[Dunkirk]] in 1940 ([[Operation Dynamo]]), Divine crossed the English Channel three times in a 35-foot boat to rescue trapped British soldiers. During the last of these he received a stomach wound. For his efforts, Divine was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]] (DSM).<ref>Obituary, p.72.</ref> The following year he published a novel based on his experience at Dunkirk, ''The Sun Shall Greet Them: A novel based on the Author's experience of the English evacuation at Dunkirk, WW II'' (1941). Divine would write the screenplay for the feature film ''Dunkirk'' (1958) and was the likely inspiration for central character Charles Foreman ([[Bernard Lee]]), skipper of the motorboat ''Vanity''. Like Divine, he is wounded during the operation but Foreman dies from his wounds. ''Nine Days at Dunkirk'' was a factual account of the operation first published in 1945. In this he exposed the legend that the evacuation was carried out by the spontaneous and uncoordinated actions of the little ships when in fact they had been carried out as 'part of a highly organised movement' by the Admiralty.

'''''Handsome Nell''''' was the first song written by [[Robert Burns]],<ref name=\"ml\"/> often treated as a poem, that was first published in the last volume of [[James Johnson]]'s [[Scots Musical Museum]] in [[1803 in literature|1803]] (No.551) with an untitled tune. Burns recorded it in [[Holograph|holograph]] on page three of his [[Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|first Commonplace Book]] that he wrote the song in autumn 1774<ref name=\"FY\"/> at the age of only fifteen years old whilst living at Mount Oliphant Farm,<ref name=\"PS\">{{Cite book|last=Hogg|first=Patrick|year=2008|title=Robert Burns.

==The identity of Handsome Nell==
Burns himself did not identify her by her surname and the first name he gave, Nelly or Nellie, is used as a nickname for \"Helen.\" Some significant doubts exist about the actual identity of Burns's first romantic love. It was thought at first to be [[Nelly Blair]] and an unsigned letter to ''The Scotsman'' in 1828 testified to this.<ref name=\"pl\"/> Burns's youngest sister, [[Isabella Burns|Isobel]], however gave the name [[Nelly Kilpatrick]] to Robert Chambers in her eightieth year and this information must at best have been second hand,<ref name=\"K\" /><ref>[http://www.worldburnsclub.com/expert/the_lassies_who_inspired_burns.htm World Burns Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217072915/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/expert/the_lassies_who_inspired_burns.htm |date=17 December 2011 }} retrieved : 2012-04-03</ref> for [[Isabella Burns|Isobel]] was only three years old in 1775<ref name=\"pl\">{{Cite book|last=Purdie|first=David|year=2013|title=The Burns Encyclopaedia|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=9780709091943|page=182}}</ref> and serious doubt must be cast on her recollections from this stage in her life. 

Isobel stated that Nelly Kilpatrick was the daughter of the blacksmith of Perclewan Mill. Nelly would only have been only a few weeks younger than Robert Burns, however he had stated that his Nell was a year younger than himself.<ref name=\"JMA\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns. A Biography of Robert Burns|publisher=Alloway Publishing|isbn=|page=51}}</ref> It was not until Robert Chambers's edition of 1851 that Nelly Kilpatrick was substituted for Nelly Blair.<ref name=\"JMA\"/>

==The background to the song==
[[File:William_Kilpatrick%27s_Headstone.JPG|250px|thumb|left|The gravestone of Nelly Kilpatrick's parents at Low Coylton churchyard]]
When [[Robert Burns]] was 15<ref name=\"WS\">{{Cite book|last=Douglas|first=William|year=1938|title=The Kilmarnock Edition of the Poetical Works of Robert Burns|publisher=The Scottish Daily Express|isbn=|page=235}}</ref> he met \"Handsome Nell\", his first young love, a ''\"bonnie, sweet, sonsie lass\"'', although he apparently never told her of his love.<ref name=\"FY\"/> [[Nelly Kilpatrick]]'s married name was Nelly Bone. Nelly and Robert are first recorded to have met when [[William Burnes]] hired some extra help to bring in the harvest while they were at nearby Mount Oliphant Farm and Burns came to be paired with her, following the Ayrshire custom of that time. It has been suggested that Nelly Kilpatrick attended the country dancing school at [[Dalrymple]] when Burns was in his seventeenth year.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns. A Biography of Robert Burns|publisher=Alloway Publishing|isbn=|page=73}}</ref>

==Composition & criticism==
\"''The following composition,\" says Burns, in his [[Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|Commonplace Book]], \"..was the first of my performances, and done at an early period of my life, when my heart glowed with honest warm simplicity, unacquainted and uncorrupted with the ways of a wicked world. The performance is, indeed, very puerile and silly, but I am always pleased with it, as it recalls to my mind those happy days when my heart was yet honest, and my tongue was sincere. The subject of it was a young girl, who really deserved all the praises I have bestowed on her. I not only had this opinion of her then—but I actually think so still, now that the spell is long since broken, and the enchantment at an end.''\"

Burns had written \"Handsome Nell\" whilst the family lived at Mount Oliphant Farm, near [[Alloway]] in the autumn of 1774. In the first [[Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|Commonplace Book]] written at [[Ellisland Farm]] he deleted ''virtue'' in the first stanza and substituted it with ''honor'' and wrote that: \"''Lest my works should be thought below criticism; or meet with a Critic who, perhaps, will not look on them with so candid and favorable an eye; I am determined to criticise them myself.''\"

===First stanza===
The first line is ''quite too much in the flimsy strain of ordinary street ballads; and on the other hand, the second line ''is too much in the other extreme. The expression is a little awkward, and the sentiment too serious.''

===Second stanza===
Burns wrote that ''..I am well pleased with; and I think it conveys a fine idea of that amiable part of the sex --- the agreables; or what in our Scotch dialect we call a sweet sonsy lass''.

===Third stanza===
Burns wrote that it ''has a little of the flimsy turn in it; and the third line has rather too serious a cast''.

===Fourth stanza===
Burns wrote that this is ''a very indifferent one; the first line is, indeed all in the strain of the second stanza, but the rest is mostly an expletive''. 

===Fifth stanza===
Burns wrote that ''The thoughts in the fifth stanza come finely up to my favourite idea of a sweet sonsy lass; the last line halts a little''.

===Sixth stanza===
Burns wrote that ''The same sentiments are kept up with equal spirit and tenderness''. '..but the second and fourth lines ending with short syllables hurt the whole''.

===Seventh stanza===
Burns wrote that it has ''several minute faults; but I remember I composed it in a wild enthusiasm of passion, and to this hour I never recollect it, but my heart melts, and my blood sallies at the rememberance''.·

'''''Handsome Nell''''' was the first song written by [[Robert Burns]],<ref name=\"ml\"/> often treated as a poem, that was first published in the last volume of [[James Johnson]]'s [[Scots Musical Museum]] in [[1803 in literature|1803]] (No.551) with an untitled tune. Burns recorded it in [[Holograph|holograph]] on page three of his [[Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|first Commonplace Book]] that he wrote the song in autumn 1774<ref name=\"FY\"/> at the age of only fifteen years old whilst living at Mount Oliphant Farm,<ref name=\"PS\">{{Cite book|last=Hogg|first=Patrick|year=2008|title=Robert Burns. The Patriotic Bard|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=9781845964122|page=45}}</ref> it is regarded as his earliest production, inspired by a farm servant aged fourteen, named either [[Nelly Kilpatrick]] or [[Nelly Blair]].

==The song==
In the song, by 1783 set to the tune ''I am a man unmarried'',<ref name=\"ml\">{{Cite book|last=Purdie|first=David|year=2013|title=The Burns Encyclopaedia|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=9780709091943|page=183}}</ref> beauty is relegated to secondary importance and female virtue, grace, innocence and modesty are made out to be more desirable than looks alone. ''Handsome Nell'' was the first written of Burns's many love songs, marking in words the start of his preoccupation with women and love.<ref name=\"PS\"/> It was not published during his lifetime although it figured in the  It was therefore not included in the 1786 ''Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect'' or any of the later editions of [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (London Edition)|1787]], [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Second Edinburgh Edition)|1793 and 1794]] and was likewise absent from the [[Glenriddell Manuscripts]] of 1791.

==The identity of Handsome Nell==
Burns himself did not identify her by her surname and the first name he gave, Nelly or Nellie, is used as a nickname for \"Helen.\" Some significant doubts exist about the actual identity of Burns's first romantic love. It was thought at first to be [[Nelly Blair]] and an unsigned letter to ''The Scotsman'' in 1828 testified to this.<ref name=\"pl\"> Burns's youngest sister, [[Isabella Burns|Isobel]], however gave the name [[Nelly Kilpatrick]] to Robert Chambers in her eightieth year and this information must at best have been second hand,<ref name=\"K\" /><ref>[http://www.worldburnsclub.com/expert/the_lassies_who_inspired_burns.htm World Burns Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217072915/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/expert/the_lassies_who_inspired_burns.htm |date=17 December 2011 }} retrieved : 2012-04-03</ref> for [[Isabella Burns|Isobel]] was only three years old in 1775<ref name=\"pl\">{{Cite book|last=Purdie|first=David|year=2013|title=The Burns Encyclopaedia|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=9780709091943|page=182}}</ref> and serious doubt must be cast on her recollections from this stage in her life. 

Isobel stated that Nelly Kilpatrick was the daughter of the blacksmith of Perclewan Mill. Nelly would only have been only a few weeks younger than Robert Burns, however he had stated that his Nell was a year younger than himself.<ref name=\"JMA\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns. A Biography of Robert Burns|publisher=Alloway Publishing|isbn=|page=51}}</ref> It was not until Robert Chambers's edition of 1851 that Nelly Kilpatrick was substituted for Nelly Blair.<ref name=\"JMA\"/>

==The background to the song==
[[File:William_Kilpatrick%27s_Headstone.JPG|250px|thumb|left|The gravestone of Nelly Kilpatrick's parents at Low Coylton churchyard]]
When [[Robert Burns]] was 15<ref name=\"WS\">{{Cite book|last=Douglas|first=William|year=1938|title=The Kilmarnock Edition of the Poetical Works of Robert Burns|publisher=The Scottish Daily Express|isbn=|page=235}}</ref> he met \"Handsome Nell\", his first young love, a ''\"bonnie, sweet, sonsie lass\"'', although he apparently never told her of his love.<ref name=\"FY\"/> [[Nelly Kilpatrick]]'s married name was Nelly Bone. Nelly and Robert are first recorded to have met when [[William Burnes]] hired some extra help to bring in the harvest while they were at nearby Mount Oliphant Farm and Burns came to be paired with her, following the Ayrshire custom of that time. It has been suggested that Nelly Kilpatrick attended the country dancing school at [[Dalrymple]] when Burns was in his seventeenth year.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns. A Biography of Robert Burns|publisher=Alloway Publishing|isbn=|page=73}}</ref>

In his autobiographical letter to Dr Hunter he wrote: ''\"You know our country custom of coupling a man and a woman together as Partners in the labors of Harvest. In my fifteenth autumn, my Partner was a bewitching creature who just counted an autumn less ... she altogether unwittingly to herself, initiated me in a certain delicious Passion ..

\"'''Bagman'''\" is the eighth episode of the [[Better Call Saul (season 5)|fifth season]] of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', the spinoff series of ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. The episode aired on April 6, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.

== Plot ==
[[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|The Cousins]] arrive at a cartel site in Mexico to pick up Lalo's bail money. As they depart, an informant inside the building makes a telephone call to report their presence.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\" />

Lalo gives Jimmy directions to a remote desert pickup site. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to go, but asks for $100,000, which Lalo promises to pay. Kim begs Jimmy not to go, saying he is an attorney and not a \"[[bagman]]\" for drug dealers, but he says he will do it because it will be an easy job and no one will suspect him of being the courier.

The next morning, the Cousins deliver two duffel bags of cash to Jimmy at the pickup site and immediately depart. Jimmy starts his return trip but several trucks soon cut him off. Numerous gunmen exit the vehicles, take the money, and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked by an unknown shooter. All but one are killed and their vehicles are disabled. The surviving gunman escapes in the only truck that is still drivable.

The unseen shooter was Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. He finds his truck was also disabled in the shootout, so he places a still-shaken Jimmy and the money in Jimmy's car and begins driving back to Albuquerque. Jimmy's car soon breaks down. With no cell phone coverage and no vehicle, they push the car over the edge of the road and walk cross-country with the money in order to avoid the surviving gunman. As they camp overnight, Jimmy tells Mike that Kim knows of his work for Lalo, and Mike warns Jimmy that if she knows details about the Salamancas, Kim is now \"in the game\". Jimmy and Mike resume their trek the following morning.

When Jimmy fails to return, Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney and asks him for Jimmy's location. Lalo refuses and tells her Jimmy will be fine because he is a survivor.

A dehydrated and sunburned Jimmy reaches his limit, and Mike fails to inspire him. Mike spots the surviving gunman, who is still searching. Rather than hide as Mike intends, Jimmy regains his motivation, and runs to the road to attract the gunman's attention. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots, killing him and causing his vehicle to flip. Mike and Jimmy resume walking, this time on the road.

== Production ==
\"Bagman\" was directed by series co-creator [[Vince Gilligan]], who considered the episode one of the most challenging episodes he had to direct in his career.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\">{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-vince-gilligan-recap-episode-8-1234572360/ |title=‘Better Call Saul’ Co-Creator Vince Gilligan on Directing the Most Challenging Episode of His Career |last=Schneider |first=Michael |date=April 6, 2020 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407032114/https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-vince-gilligan-recap-episode-8-1234572360/ |archive-date=April 7, 2020 |access-date=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Gilligan had been able to make arrangements to direct one episode in the fifth season after completing filming of ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]''.

\"'''Bagman'''\" is the eighth episode of the [[Better Call Saul (season 5)|fifth season]] of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', the spinoff series of ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. The episode aired on April 6, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.

== Plot ==
[[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|The Cousins]] arrive at a cartel site in Mexico to pick up Lalo's bail money. As they depart, an informant inside the building makes a telephone call to report their presence.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\" />

Lalo gives Jimmy directions to a remote desert pickup site. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to go, but asks for $100,000, which Lalo promises to pay. Kim begs Jimmy not to go, saying he is an attorney and not a \"[[bagman]]\" for drug dealers, but he says he will do it because it will be an easy job and no one will suspect him of being the courier.

The next morning, the Cousins deliver two duffel bags of cash to Jimmy at the pickup site and immediately depart. Jimmy starts his return trip but several trucks soon cut him off. Numerous gunmen exit the vehicles, take the money, and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked by an unknown shooter. All but one are killed and their vehicles are disabled. The surviving gunman escapes in the only truck that is still drivable.

The unseen shooter was Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. He finds his truck was also disabled in the shootout, so he places a still-shaken Jimmy and the money in Jimmy's car and begins driving back to Albuquerque. Jimmy's car soon breaks down. With no cell phone coverage and no vehicle, they push the car over the edge of the road and walk cross-country with the money in order to to avoiding the surviving gunman. As they camp overnight, Jimmy tells Mike that Kim knows of his work for Lalo, and Mike warns Jimmy that if she knows details about the Salamancas, Kim is now \"in the game\". Jimmy and Mike resume their trek the following morning.

When Jimmy fails to return, Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney and asks him for Jimmy's location. Lalo refuses and tells her Jimmy will be fine because he is a survivor.

A dehydrated and sunburned Jimmy reaches his limit, and Mike fails to inspire him. Mike spots the surviving gunman, who is still searching. Rather than hide as Mike intends, Jimmy regains his motivation, and runs to the road to attract the gunman's attention. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots, killing him and causing his vehicle to flip. Mike and Jimmy resume walking, this time on the road.

'''Aristotelian theology''' and the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] '''view of [[God in Christianity|God]]''' have been influential in Western [[intellectual history]].

== ''Metaphysics'' ==
{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Unmoved movers}}

In his ''first philosophy'', later called the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', (or “after the [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]”), [[Aristotle]] discusses the meaning of being. He refers to the [[unmoved mover]]s (hyperagents), and assigns one to each movement in the heavens and tasks future astronomers with correlating the estimated 47 to 55 motions of the [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Eudoxan planetary models|Eudoxan planetary model]] with the most current and accurate observations. According to Aristotle, each unmoved mover continuously contemplates its own contemplation; the [[wandering stars|planets and stars]], which have their source of motion within themselves (by virtue of [[aether (classical element)|aether]], Aristotle's [[Aristotelian physics|fifth element]]) aspire to emulate the [[uniform circular motion]] of their particular mover. Thus captivated, their tireless performance is entirely the result of their own desire. This is one way in which the movers are said to be unmoved. Likewise, they must have no sensory perception whatsoever on account of Aristotle's theory of cognition: were any form of sense perception to intrude upon their thoughts, in that instant they would cease to be themselves, because ''actual self-reflection'' is their singular [[essence]], their whole [[substance theory|being]]. Like the heavenly bodies in their unadorned pursuit, so the wise look, with affection, toward the star; and hence as a role model, they inspire those who look up to them, and by whom others still, will yet find themselves enthralled, ''and so on,'' creating the enduring natural order of aeon, season, animal and plant.

== Principles of being ==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|right|205px|Aristotle, by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
{{see also|Categories (Aristotle)|Substance theory}}

In the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle discusses [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality]] (''[[entelecheia]]'', Greek: ἐντελέχεια) and potentiality (''[[dunamis|dynamis]]'', Greek: δύναμις). The former is perfection, realization, fullness of being; the latter imperfection, incompleteness, perfectibility. The former is the determining, the latter the determinable principle. The unmoved movers are entirely actual, ''[[Actus Purus]]'', because they are unchanging, eternal, immaterial substance.

All material beings have some potentiality. The ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' introduces [[hylomorphism|matter and form]] and the [[four causes]]—material, formal, efficient and final. For example, to explain a statue, one can offer:
* The ''material cause'', that out of which the statue is made, is the marble or bronze.
* The ''formal cause'', that according to which the statue is made, is the shape that the sculptor has learned to sculpt.
* The ''efficient cause'', or agent, is the sculptor.
* The ''final cause'', is that for the sake of which the statue is made, the (actual) statue.

Contrary to the later so-called \"traditional\" view of prime matter (''[[prima materia]]''  in Latin), Aristotle asserts that there can be no pure potentiality without any actuality whatsoever. All material substances have unactualized potentials.

Aristotle argues that, although motion is eternal, there cannot be an infinite series of movers and of things moved. Therefore, there must be some, who are not the first in such a series, that inspire the eternal motion without themselves being moved  \"as the soul is moved by beauty\". Because the [[classical planet|planetary]] spheres each move unfalteringly for all eternity in [[uniform circular motion]] with a given rotational period relative to the supreme [[diurnal motion]] of the [[sphere of fixed stars]] (or First Heaven), they must each love and desire to mimic different unmoved movers corresponding to the given periods.

Because they eternally inspire uniform motion in the [[celestial spheres]], the unmoved movers must themselves be eternal and unchanging. Because they are eternal, they have already had an infinite amount of time in which to actualize any potentialities and therefore cannot be a composition of matter and form, or [[potentiality and actuality]]. They must always be fully actual, and thus immaterial, because at all times in history they have already existed an infinite amount of time, and things that do not actually come to fruition given unlimited opportunities to do so cannot potentially do so.

The life of the unmoved mover is self-contemplative thought (\"νοήσεως νόησις (''noeseos [[noesis]]'')\", i.e. \"thought of thought\").<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1074b.</ref><ref>Leo Elders, ''Aristotle's theology: A commentary on Book [lambda] of the Metaphysics'', Assen: Van Gorcum, 1972; Michael Frede, David Charles, ed., ''Aristotle's'' Metaphysics ''Lambda'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref> According to Aristotle, the gods cannot potentially be distracted from this eternal self-contemplation because, in that instant, they would cease to exist.

{{see also|Ontological argument|Apophatic theology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity}}
[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] (1892) noted<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/earlygreekphilo01burngoog|title=Early Greek Philosophy|page=[https://archive.org/details/earlygreekphilo01burngoog/page/n95 88]|year=1892|author=John Burnet}}</ref>
:''The Neoplatonists were quite justified in regarding themselves as the spiritual heirs of Pythagoras; and, in their hands, philosophy ceased to exist as such, and became theology. And this tendency was at work all along; hardly a single Greek philosopher was wholly uninfluenced by it. Perhaps [[Aristotle]] might seem to be an exception; but it is probable that, if we still possessed a few such \"exoteric\" works as the ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protreptikos]]'' in their entirety, we should find that the enthusiastic words in which he speaks of the \"''blessed life''\" in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics|Ethics]] (Nicomachean Ethics)'' were less isolated outbursts of feeling than they appear now. In later days, [[Apollonios of Tyana]] showed in practice what this sort of thing must ultimately lead to. The [[theurgy]] and [[thaumaturgy]] of the late Greek schools were only the fruit of the seed sown by the generation which immediately preceded the Persian War.''

Aristotle's principles of being (see section above) influenced [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]'s view of God, whom he called \"that than which nothing greater can be conceived.\" Anselm thought that God did not feel emotions such as anger or love, but appeared to do so through our imperfect understanding. The incongruity of judging \"being\" against something that might not exist, may have led Anselm to his famous ontological argument for God's existence.

Many [[medieval]] philosophers made use of the idea of approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes. For example, we should not say that God exists in the usual sense of the term, all we can safely say is that God is not nonexistent. We should not say that God is wise, but we can say that God is not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). We should not say that God is One, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being.

Aristotelian theological concepts were accepted by many later Jewish, Islamic, and Christian philosophers.  Key [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] included Samuel [[Ibn Tibbon]], [[Maimonides]], and [[Gersonides]], among many others.

'''Aristotelian theology''' and the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] '''view of [[God in Christianity|God]]''' have been influential in Western [[intellectual history]].

== ''Metaphysics'' ==
{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Unmoved movers}}

In his ''first philosophy'', later called the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', (or “after the [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]”), [[Aristotle]] discusses the meaning of being. He refers to the [[unmoved mover]]s (hyperagents), and assigns one to each movement in the heavens and tasks future astronomers with correlating the estimated 47 to 55 motions of the [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Eudoxan planetary models|Eudoxan planetary model]] with the most current and accurate observations. According to Aristotle, each unmoved mover continuously contemplates its own contemplation; the [[wandering stars|planets and stars]], which have their source of motion within themselves (by virtue of [[aether (classical element)|aether]], Aristotle's [[Aristotelian physics|fifth element]]) aspire to emulate the [[uniform circular motion]] of their particular mover. Thus captivated, their tireless performance is entirely the result of their own desire. This is one way in which the movers are said to be unmoved. Likewise, they must have no sensory perception whatsoever on account of Aristotle's theory of cognition: were any form of sense perception to intrude upon their thoughts, in that instant they would cease to be themselves, because ''actual self-reflection'' is their singular [[essence]], their whole [[substance theory|being]]. Like the heavenly bodies in their unadorned pursuit, so the wise look, with affection, toward the star; and hence as a role model, they inspire those who look up to them, and by whom others still, will yet find themselves enthralled, ''and so on,'' creating the enduring natural order of aeon, season, animal and plant.

== Principles of being ==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|right|205px|Aristotle, by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
{{see also|Categories (Aristotle)|Substance theory}}

In the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle discusses [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality]] (''[[entelecheia]]'', Greek: ἐντελέχεια) and potentiality (''[[dunamis|dynamis]]'', Greek: δύναμις). The former is perfection, realization, fullness of being; the latter imperfection, incompleteness, perfectibility. The former is the determining, the latter the determinable principle. The unmoved movers are entirely actual, ''[[Actus Purus]]'', because they are unchanging, eternal, immaterial substance.

All material beings have some potentiality. The ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' introduces [[hylomorphism|matter and form]] and the [[four causes]]—material, formal, efficient and final. For example, to explain a statue, one can offer:
* The ''material cause'', that out of which the statue is made, is the marble or bronze.
* The ''formal cause'', that according to which the statue is made, is the shape that the sculptor has learned to sculpt.
* The ''efficient cause'', or agent, is the sculptor.
* The ''final cause'', is that for the sake of which the statue is made, the (actual) statue.

Contrary to the later so-called \"traditional\" view of prime matter (''[[prima materia]]''  in Latin), Aristotle asserts that there can be no pure potentiality without any actuality whatsoever. All material substances have unactualized potentials.

Aristotle argues that, although motion is eternal, there cannot be an infinite series of movers and of things moved. Therefore, there must be some, who are not the first in such a series, that inspire the eternal motion without themselves being moved  \"as the soul is moved by beauty\". Because the [[classical planet|planetary]] spheres each move unfalteringly for all eternity in [[uniform circular motion]] with a given rotational period relative to the supreme [[diurnal motion]] of the [[sphere of fixed stars]] (or First Heaven), they must each love and desire to mimic different unmoved movers corresponding to the given periods.

Because they eternally inspire uniform motion in the [[celestial spheres]], the unmoved movers must themselves be eternal and unchanging. Because they are eternal, they have already had an infinite amount of time in which to actualize any potentialities and therefore cannot be a composition of matter and form, or [[potentiality and actuality]]. They must always be fully actual, and thus immaterial, because at all times in history they have already existed an infinite amount of time, and things that do not actually come to fruition given unlimited opportunities to do so cannot potentially do so.

The life of the unmoved mover is self-contemplative thought (\"νοήσεως νόησις (''noeseos [[noesis]]'')\", i.e. \"thought of thought\").<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1074b.</ref><ref>Leo Elders, ''Aristotle's theology: A commentary on Book [lambda] of the Metaphysics'', Assen: Van Gorcum, 1972; Michael Frede, David Charles, ed., ''Aristotle's'' Metaphysics ''Lambda'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref> According to Aristotle, the gods cannot potentially be distracted from this eternal self-contemplation because, in that instant, they would cease to exist.

[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] (1892) noted<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/earlygreekphilo01burngoog|title=Early Greek Philosophy|page=[https://archive.org/details/earlygreekphilo01burngoog/page/n95 88]|year=1892|author=John Burnet}}</ref>
:''The Neoplatonists were quite justified in regarding themselves as the spiritual heirs of Pythagoras; and, in their hands, philosophy ceased to exist as such, and became theology. And this tendency was at work all along; hardly a single Greek philosopher was wholly uninfluenced by it. Perhaps [[Aristotle]] might seem to be an exception; but it is probable that, if we still possessed a few such \"exoteric\" works as the ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protreptikos]]'' in their entirety, we should find that the enthusiastic words in which he speaks of the \"''blessed life''\" in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics|Ethics]] (Nicomachean Ethics)'' were less isolated outbursts of feeling than they appear now. In later days, [[Apollonios of Tyana]] showed in practice what this sort of thing must ultimately lead to. The [[theurgy]] and [[thaumaturgy]] of the late Greek schools were only the fruit of the seed sown by the generation which immediately preceded the Persian War.''

Aristotle's principles of being (see section above) influenced [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]'s view of God, whom he called \"that than which nothing greater can be conceived.\" Anselm thought that God did not feel emotions such as anger or love, but appeared to do so through our imperfect understanding. The incongruity of judging \"being\" against something that might not exist, may have led Anselm to his famous ontological argument for God's existence.

Many [[medieval]] philosophers made use of the idea of approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes. For example, we should not say that God exists in the usual sense of the term, all we can safely say is that God is not nonexistent. We should not say that God is wise, but we can say that God is not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). We should not say that God is One, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being.

Aristotelian theological concepts were accepted by many later Jewish, Islamic, and Christian philosophers.  Key [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] included Samuel [[Ibn Tibbon]], [[Maimonides]], and [[Gersonides]], among many others.  Their views of God are considered mainstream by many Jews of all denominations even today.  Preeminent among Islamic philosophers who were influenced by Aristotelian theology are [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]].  In Christian theology, the key philosopher influenced by Aristotle was undoubtedly [[Thomas Aquinas]].

David is the son of Harvey Karp, a businessman, whose [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton]] home was reputed to be a palace.<ref name=\"Seabrook\" /> He was fluent in [[Latin]] when he graduated from high school. At 20, while majoring in [[medieval art]] studies at [[Wesleyan University]], he published a translation of the 6th-century Latin author [[Venantius Fortunatus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.willamette.edu/cla/classics/careers/karp/|title=Classics: David Karp – Willamette University|work=willamette.edu}}</ref>

After graduation, he started a career in risk arbitrage and option trading on [[Wall Street]], has worked for  gourmet specialty store ''Citarella'' and acted as a provisioner for [[Dean & DeLuca]]. Recovering from a serious drug addiction, he changed course and began a new career as a freelance fruit writer.<ref name=\"Seabrook\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/cla/classics/VIPs/karp.html |title=Willametta Classical Studies |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707231546/http://www.willamette.edu/cla/classics/VIPs/karp.html |archive-date=2007-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Karp moved to California in 1999.<ref name=\"Seabrook\" />

Karp's photographs and writings appear in his weekly column, Market Watch, at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and he has written articles for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'', ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'', ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'', ''[[Star-Ledger]]''  and ''[[Saveur]]'' publications.<ref name=\"Seed Savers\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://splendidtable.publicradio.org/souptonuts/farmstand.html |title=The Splendid Table |access-date=2010-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705024251/http://splendidtable.publicradio.org/souptonuts/farmstand.html |archive-date=2010-07-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  He has been a guest on the Saturday morning food show on radio station [[KCRW]].<ref name=\" KCRW\">{{Citation

When the threat of [[Huanglongbing|citrus greening]] first appeared in the U.S., Karp wrote in the ''New York Times'' to alert the public of the disease's risks.<ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/science/26citrus.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Deadly Pathogen Harms Florida Citrus Groves]\"</ref>

== Projects ==

=== Citrus Documentation at CVC ===
Karp is an associate in the [[University of California Citrus Experiment Station|Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of California, Riverside]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://festivaloffruit.org/David_Karp.html |title=David Karp |work=festivaloffruit.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310101630/http://www.festivaloffruit.org/David_Karp.html |archivedate=2010-03-10 }}</ref> working to photograph and document the more than 1,000 varieties grown at the [[University of California, Riverside Citrus Variety Collection|Citrus Variety Collection of the University of California]]. Displayed on the CVC website], these photos are accessible to researchers throughout the world.

=== Citrus germplasm in China ===
He helped co-found the Chinese Citrus Germplasm Repository in [[Jiangshui]] (about 50 miles from [[Kunming]]), province of [[Yunnan]].<ref name=\"Seed Savers\" />

=== Bunyard Orchard ===
David Karp and Andy Mariani are co-founders of the Bunyard Orchard of [[heirloom]] [[stone fruit]] in [[Morgan Hill, California]].<ref name=\"Caliber\">{{cite web|url=http://gcfs.ucpress.edu/content/9/3/v|title=Contributors - Gastronomica: The Journal of Critical Food Studies|work=ucpress.edu}}</ref>

=== Unforbidden Fruit ===
Karp became involved as a researcher in a joint project between the [[University of California, Riverside]] and the [[USDA]] to prevent smuggling of fruit into California that may harbor insects that could threaten the state’s fruit industry. The project —Unforbidden Fruits: Preventing Citrus Smuggling by Introducing Varieties Culturally Significant to Ethnic Communities—focuses on making disease-free [[germplasm]] of citrus and non-citrus fruit available to Californian nurseries and tree farmers, to replace the illicit demand.<ref name=\"Seed Savers\" />
[[File:Tejocotes2.jpg|thumb|[[Tejocote]]]]
A non-citrus fruit that the project has targeted is ''\"[[tejocote]]\"'' (''[[Crataegus mexicana]]'', sometimes called ''Crataegus pubescens''), a fruit that is grown in the highlands of [[Mexico]]. Because it was not being grown in the U.S., it was often smuggled into the country and sold to Mexicans who wanted to use it to serve the traditional fruit drink called ''[[ponche]]'' at Christmastime. Now that ''tejocote'' is being grown legally in California, much of the smuggling into the country has dropped off.<ref name=\"Seed Savers\" />

=== RosBREED ===
Karp is a member of the \"extension advisory panel\" for RosBREED, an organization dedicated to improving [[rosaceae]] crops through marker assisted crossbreeding.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rosbreed.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/RosBREED-I-Informational-Handout.pdf |title=RossBREED |access-date=2010-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707124725/http://rosbreed.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/RosBREED-I-Informational-Handout.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Fruits of interest ==
[[File:Mangosteen3.jpg|Mangosteen|thumb]]

=== Mangosteen ===
Karp has written several articles on the availability of the [[mangosteen]] in the United States, due to fears they harbor the Asian [[Tephritidae|fruit fly]]. He wrote articles in the ''New York Times'' announcing the renewed U.S. law on July 23, 2007, when [[irradiation|irradiated]] imports from [[Thailand]] were allowed upon [[USDA]] approval,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/dining/27frui.html | work=The New York Times | title=Welcome at the Border: Thai Fruits, Once Banned | first=David | last=Karp | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/dining/09mang.html?ex=1312776000&en=0d1a76f2087e406d&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss. | work=The New York Times | title=Forbidden?

=== Greengage plum ===
David believes the [[greengage plum]] is the most delicious fruit on the world,<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /> and traveled to [[Moissac]], France (its primary center of cultivation), to investigate it.<ref>{{Citation

David is the son of Harvey Karp, a businessman, whose [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton]] home was reputed to be a palace.<ref name=\"Seabrook\" /> He was fluent in [[Latin]] when he graduated from high school. At 20, while majoring in [[medieval art]] studies at [[Wesleyan University]], he published a translation of the 6th-century Latin author [[Venantius Fortunatus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.willamette.edu/cla/classics/careers/karp/|title=Classics: David Karp – Willamette University|work=willamette.edu}}</ref>

After graduation, he started a career in risk arbitrage and option trading on [[Wall Street]], has worked for  gourmet specialty store ''Citarella'' and acted as a provisioner for [[Dean & DeLuca]]. Recovering from a serious drug addiction, he changed course and began a new career as a freelance fruit writer.<ref name=\"Seabrook\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/cla/classics/VIPs/karp.html |title=Willametta Classical Studies |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707231546/http://www.willamette.edu/cla/classics/VIPs/karp.html |archive-date=2007-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When the threat of [[Huanglongbing|citrus greening]] first appeared in the U.S., Karp wrote in the ''New York Times'' to alert the public of the disease's risks.<ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/science/26citrus.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Deadly Pathogen Harms Florida Citrus Groves]\"</ref>

== Projects ==

=== Citrus Documentation at CVC ===
Karp is an associate in the [[University of California Citrus Experiment Station|Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of California, Riverside]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://festivaloffruit.org/David_Karp.html |title=David Karp |work=festivaloffruit.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310101630/http://www.festivaloffruit.org/David_Karp.html |archivedate=2010-03-10 }}</ref> working to photograph and document the more than 1,000 varieties grown at the [[University of California, Riverside Citrus Variety Collection|Citrus Variety Collection of the University of California]]. Displayed on the CVC website], these photos are accessible to researchers throughout the world.

=== Citrus germplasm in China ===
He helped co-found the Chinese Citrus Germplasm Repository in [[Jiangshui]] (about 50 miles from [[Kunming]]), province of [[Yunnan]].<ref name=\"Seed Savers\" />

=== Bunyard Orchard ===
David Karp and Andy Mariani are co-founders of the Bunyard Orchard of [[heirloom]] [[stone fruit]] in [[Morgan Hill, California]].<ref name=\"Caliber\">{{cite web|url=http://gcfs.ucpress.edu/content/9/3/v|title=Contributors - Gastronomica: The Journal of Critical Food Studies|work=ucpress.edu}}</ref>

=== Unforbidden Fruit ===
Karp became involved as a researcher in a joint project between the [[University of California, Riverside]] and the [[USDA]] to prevent smuggling of fruit into California that may harbor insects that could threaten the state’s fruit industry. The project —Unforbidden Fruits: Preventing Citrus Smuggling by Introducing Varieties Culturally Significant to Ethnic Communities—focuses on making disease-free [[germplasm]] of citrus and non-citrus fruit available to Californian nurseries and tree farmers, to replace the illicit demand.<ref name=\"Seed Savers\" />
[[File:Tejocotes2.jpg|thumb|[[Tejocote]]]]
A non-citrus fruit that the project has targeted is ''\"[[tejocote]]\"'' (''[[Crataegus mexicana]]'', sometimes called ''Crataegus pubescens''), a fruit that is grown in the highlands of [[Mexico]]. Because it was not being grown in the U.S., it was often smuggled into the country and sold to Mexicans who wanted to use it to serve the traditional fruit drink called ''[[ponche]]'' at Christmastime. Now that ''tejocote'' is being grown legally in California, much of the smuggling into the country has dropped off.<ref name=\"Seed Savers\" />

=== RosBREED ===
Karp is a member of the \"extension advisory panel\" for RosBREED, an organization dedicated to improving [[rosaceae]] crops through marker assisted crossbreeding.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rosbreed.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/RosBREED-I-Informational-Handout.pdf |title=RossBREED |access-date=2010-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707124725/http://rosbreed.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/RosBREED-I-Informational-Handout.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Fruits of interest ==
[[File:Mangosteen3.jpg|Mangosteen|thumb]]

=== Mangosteen ===
Karp has written several articles on the availability of the [[mangosteen]] in the United States, due to fears they harbor the Asian [[Tephritidae|fruit fly]]. He wrote articles in the ''New York Times'' announcing the renewed U.S. law on July 23, 2007, when [[irradiation|irradiated]] imports from [[Thailand]] were allowed upon [[USDA]] approval,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/dining/27frui.html | work=The New York Times | title=Welcome at the Border: Thai Fruits, Once Banned | first=David | last=Karp | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/dining/09mang.html?ex=1312776000&en=0d1a76f2087e406d&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss. | work=The New York Times | title=Forbidden?

=== Greengage plum ===
David believes the [[greengage plum]] is the most delicious fruit on the world,<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /> and traveled to [[Moissac]], France (its primary center of cultivation), to investigate it.<ref>{{Citation

'''Odessa High School''' ('''OHS''') is a public [[high school]] located in [[Odessa, Texas]], United States.  It is one of three high schools in the [[Ector County Independent School District]]. The full name of the school is '''Odessa Senior High School'''. This name was originally to differentiate it from Odessa Junior High School (now known as David Crockett Middle School). Normally, the school is commonly referred to as Odessa High or just OHS.   In 2011, the school was rated \"Academically Acceptable\" by the [[Texas Education Agency]].<ref>{{cite web

However, this mainly happens in such sports as cross country, swimming, golf, gymnastics, tennis, volleyball, softball and baseball. To date, only one freshmen has competed on the varsity football team. And its very nasty and gross

==Mascot==
The mascot for Odessa High School is the Odessa Bronchos, with all female teams referred to as \"Lady Bronchos.\" This unique spelling of \"Broncho\" has resulted in Odessa High being the only high school in Texas with this particular mascot.<ref>[http://www.texasfootballratings.com/MascotwSchoolListAB.html Mascot School List A-B]</ref>  The original mascot for the team was the Yellowjackets and the team colors were purple and gold. In 1929, the student body voted 113-0 to change to the \"Bronchos\". The Bronchos colors were changed to scarlet and white.

== Band ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}
The Odessa High School band has the longest consecutive streak of first division rating in marching contests in the State of Texas, going back 81 years. <ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.myplainview.com/articles/2009/10/18/breaking_news/doc4ada824865bf6440230887.txt|publisher=[[Plainview Daily Herald]]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The band has also been invited to various music festival and contests across the nation. In March 2007, the band was invited to play their marching season selections \"Letters from the Front\" at the [[National World War II Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2004, The Odessa High School Band combined with the band from [[Permian High School]] in Odessa to form one of the largest bands ever to march in the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in [[Pasadena, California]] (over 500 members).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The OHS Band was started in 1932 under the direction of G. Ward Moody. Directors Robert L. Maddox and Bill Dean have been the longest tenured directors of the band with 13 years and 22 years respectively. As of July 2018, John Mayo is the director of the band.<ref>{{cite news |title=OHS band director is familiar face |url=https://www.oaoa.com/news/education/ecisd/article_ead2e8c2-854a-11e8-9126-73e43ffcdb6a.html |accessdate=31 October 2019 |agency=AIM Media TX LLC |publisher=OA Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=OHS band optimistic about marching season |url=https://www.oaoa.com/news/education/ecisd/article_1b5a6cfa-b4b0-11e9-b23e-ffa95148463d.html |accessdate=31 October 2019 |agency=OA Online |publisher=AIM Media TX LLC}}</ref> The Instrumental Music Building at OHS is named in honor of Maddox and the main band hall is named in honor of Dean.

From 1981 through 2006, the band has had at least one member make the Texas All State Band each year. In the 1998-99 school year, eight members were accorded All State honors. Band members also consistently do well at UIL Solo and Ensemble contest.

==Culture==
Odessa High School students reported ghost sightings and paranormal phenomena at the school for decades, up to 2006, centering around Betty Williams, who was killed during the \"[[Kiss and Kill]]\" homicide in 1961. Mack Herring, her killer, was ruled not guilty by grounds of temporary insanity by a Texas jury as she had asked Herring to kill her. Odessa High's administration applied paint to the school auditorium's windows to counter the ghost story culture.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Colloff, Pamela|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/a-kiss-before-dying/|title=A Kiss Before Dying|magazine=[[Texas Monthly]]|date=February 2006|accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> In 2019 CBS 7 Odessa stated \"Many believe her ghost still haunts the halls of Odessa High School to this day.\"<ref name=Herringdied>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs7.com/content/news/FIRST-ON-CBS7-Kiss-and-Kill-killer-has-died-504111961.html|title=FIRST ON CBS7: \"Kiss and Kill\" killer has died|publisher=CBS 7|date=2019-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref>

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}
The Odessa High School band has the longest consecutive streak of first division rating in marching contests in the State of Texas, going back 81 years. <ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.myplainview.com/articles/2009/10/18/breaking_news/doc4ada824865bf6440230887.txt|publisher=[[Plainview Daily Herald]]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The band has also been invited to various music festival and contests across the nation.

The OHS Band was started in 1932 under the direction of G. Ward Moody. Directors Robert L. Maddox and Bill Dean have been the longest tenured directors of the band with 13 years and 22 years respectively. As of July 2018, John Mayo is the director of the band.<ref>{{cite news |title=OHS band director is familiar face |url=https://www.oaoa.com/news/education/ecisd/article_ead2e8c2-854a-11e8-9126-73e43ffcdb6a.html |accessdate=31 October 2019 |agency=AIM Media TX LLC |publisher=OA Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=OHS band optimistic about marching season |url=https://www.oaoa.com/news/education/ecisd/article_1b5a6cfa-b4b0-11e9-b23e-ffa95148463d.html |accessdate=31 October 2019 |agency=OA Online |publisher=AIM Media TX LLC}}</ref> The Instrumental Music Building at OHS is named in honor of Maddox and the main band hall is named in honor of Dean.

==Culture==
Odessa High School students reported ghost sightings and paranormal phenomena at the school for decades, up to 2006, centering around Betty Williams, who was killed during the \"[[Kiss and Kill]]\" homicide in 1961. Mack Herring, her killer, was ruled not guilty by grounds of temporary insanity by a Texas jury as she had asked Herring to kill her. Odessa High's administration applied paint to the school auditorium's windows to counter the ghost story culture.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Colloff, Pamela|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/a-kiss-before-dying/|title=A Kiss Before Dying|magazine=[[Texas Monthly]]|date=February 2006|accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> In 2019 CBS 7 Odessa stated \"Many believe her ghost still haunts the halls of Odessa High School to this day.\"<ref name=Herringdied>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs7.com/content/news/FIRST-ON-CBS7-Kiss-and-Kill-killer-has-died-504111961.html|title=FIRST ON CBS7: \"Kiss and Kill\" killer has died|publisher=CBS 7|date=2019-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref>

}}
''Never Trust a Happy Song'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], but found the band too similar to bands like [[MGMT]], [[Passion Pit]], [[fun.]], and [[The Killers]], in terms of lyrics and instrumentation. This included Caroline Sullivan, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', who found some of the content too similar to other bands but praised the minor intricacies in tracks like \"Chloe\", \"Spun\" and \"Naked Kids\": \"What it lacks in originality it makes up for in sweet vibes, which may not keep Grouplove going for ever, but is enough for the moment.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted mean|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Standard score|average]] score of 66, based on 14 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> On the positive side, [[AllMusic]] journalist Matt Colla praised the band's musicianship for being technically sound and expressive in its genre-mashing, concluding that \"Ultimately, Grouplove's ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' is a cohesive if ramshackle crowd-pleaser, full of melodic double-lead vocals, handclaps, ringing electric guitars, and staccato synth parts that tips a hat to '80s dance-rock while still retaining the band's obvious love of experimental '60s folk-rock.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> David Menconi of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' praised the album's production for carrying exuberant energy to match its happy-go-lucky content, saying that \"For all its youthful pathos, ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' evokes pop colors bright enough to glow at tempos just short of manic -- even \"Slow\" doesn't stay that way for long.\"<ref name=\"Spin\"/>

''Never Trust a Happy Song'' had some detractors. Huw Jones of [[Slant Magazine]] felt the album paled in comparison to the band's [[Grouplove (EP)|self-titled EP]] with adequate lyrics and shoddy song placement derailing its true strength, saying that \"''Never Trust a Happy Song''{{'}}s finer moments arrive when Grouplove is crafting sun-kissed anthems that deserve to be blared across beaches or, at least, from the speakers of any open-top car en route to the shore.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Writing for [[musicOMH]], Max Raymond noted that the tracks throughout the album flip-flop between overly schmaltzy sugar and transparent mediocrity with decent songwriting and face value quality: \"On their own merits some of these tracks are classy pop songs, but there needs to be more depth and scope to Grouplove’s sound if they are to look forward.\"<ref name=\"OMH\"/> [[Drowned in Sound]]'s Robert Cooke felt there was moments on the album that showed the band's potential, but it was ruined by the jumbling of different genres and questionable instrumentation choices throughout the songs.<ref name=\"DiS\"/> The harshest review came from James Parker, who wrote for [[Tiny Mix Tapes]]; he heavily criticized the band's upbeat, sunny demeanor for being an \"indie equivalent\" to mainstream pop hits and said that it only catered to hipster parties, concluding that \"Considering what this record’s meant to be doing, then, you could reasonably argue that it does it pretty well. Except I won’t. Because this is neither a vision of musical performance nor a kind of listening practice that I for one particularly want to defend.\"<ref name=\"Tapes\"/>

''Never Trust a Happy Song'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], but found the band too similar to bands like [[MGMT]], [[Passion Pit]], [[fun.]], and [[The Killers]], in terms of lyrics and instrumentation. This included Caroline Sullivan, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', who found some of the content too similar to other bands but praised the minor intricacies in tracks like \"Chloe\", \"Spun\" and \"Naked Kids\": \"What it lacks in originality it makes up for in sweet vibes, which may not keep Grouplove going for ever, but is enough for the moment.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted mean|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Standard score|average]] score of 66, based on 14 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> On the positive side, [[AllMusic]] journalist Matt Colla praised the band's musicianship for being technically sound and expressive in its genre-mashing, concluding that \"Ultimately, Grouplove's ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' is a cohesive if ramshackle crowd-pleaser, full of melodic double-lead vocals, handclaps, ringing electric guitars, and staccato synth parts that tips a hat to '80s dance-rock while still retaining the band's obvious love of experimental '60s folk-rock.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> David Menconi of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' praised the album's production for carrying exuberant energy to match its happy-go-lucky content, saying that \"For all its youthful pathos, ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' evokes pop colors bright enough to glow at tempos just short of manic -- even \"Slow\" doesn't stay that way for long.\"<ref name=\"Spin\"/>

''Never Trust a Happy Song'' had some detractors. Huw Jones of [[Slant Magazine]] felt the album paled in comparison to the band's [[Grouplove (EP)|self-titled EP]] with adequate lyrics and shoddy song placement derailing its true strength, saying that \"''Never Trust a Happy Song''{{'}}s finer moments arrive when Grouplove is crafting sun-kissed anthems that deserve to be blared across beaches or, at least, from the speakers of any open-top car en route to the shore.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Writing for [[musicOMH]], Max Raymond noted that the tracks throughout the album flip-flop between overly schmaltzy sugar and transparent mediocrity with decent songwriting and face value quality: \"On their own merits some of these tracks are classy pop songs, but there needs to be more depth and scope to Grouplove’s sound if they are to look forward.\"<ref name=\"OMH\"/> ''[[Drowned in Sound]]''{{'}}s Robert Cooke felt there was moments on the album that showed the band's potential, but it was ruined by the jumbling of different genres and questionable instrumentation choices throughout the songs.<ref name=\"DiS\"/> The harshest review came from James Parker, who wrote for [[Tiny Mix Tapes]]; he heavily criticized the band's upbeat, sunny demeanor for being an \"indie equivalent\" to mainstream pop hits and said that it only catered to hipster parties, concluding that \"Considering what this record’s meant to be doing, then, you could reasonably argue that it does it pretty well. Except I won’t. Because this is neither a vision of musical performance nor a kind of listening practice that I for one particularly want to defend.\"<ref name=\"Tapes\"/>

''Never Trust a Happy Song'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], but found the band too similar to bands like [[MGMT]], [[Passion Pit]], [[fun.]], and [[The Killers]], in terms of lyrics and instrumentation. This included Caroline Sullivan, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', who found some of the content too similar to other bands but praised the minor intricacies in tracks like \"Chloe\", \"Spun\" and \"Naked Kids\": \"What it lacks in originality it makes up for in sweet vibes, which may not keep Grouplove going for ever, but is enough for the moment.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted mean|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Standard score|average]] score of 66, based on 14 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> On the positive side, [[AllMusic]] journalist Matt Colla praised the band's musicianship for being technically sound and expressive in its genre-mashing, concluding that \"Ultimately, Grouplove's ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' is a cohesive if ramshackle crowd-pleaser, full of melodic double-lead vocals, handclaps, ringing electric guitars, and staccato synth parts that tips a hat to '80s dance-rock while still retaining the band's obvious love of experimental '60s folk-rock.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> David Menconi of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' praised the album's production for carrying exuberant energy to match its happy-go-lucky content, saying that \"For all its youthful pathos, ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' evokes pop colors bright enough to glow at tempos just short of manic -- even \"Slow\" doesn't stay that way for long.\"<ref name=\"Spin\"/>

''Never Trust a Happy Song'' had some detractors. Huw Jones of [[Slant Magazine]] felt the album paled in comparison to the band's [[Grouplove (EP)|self-titled EP]] with adequate lyrics and shoddy song placement derailing its true strength, saying that \"''Never Trust a Happy Song''{{'}}s finer moments arrive when Grouplove is crafting sun-kissed anthems that deserve to be blared across beaches or, at least, from the speakers of any open-top car en route to the shore.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Writing for [[musicOMH]], Max Raymond noted that the tracks throughout the album flip-flop between overly schmaltzy sugar and transparent mediocrity with decent songwriting and face value quality: \"On their own merits some of these tracks are classy pop songs, but there needs to be more depth and scope to Grouplove’s sound if they are to look forward.\"<ref name=\"OMH\"/> [[Drowned in Sound]]'s Robert Cooke felt there was moments on the album that showed the band's potential, but it was ruined by the jumbling of different genres and questionable instrumentation choices throughout the songs.<ref name=\"DiS\"/> The harshest review came from James Parker, who wrote for [[Tiny Mix Tapes]]; he heavily criticized the band's upbeat, sunny demeanor for being an \"indie equivalent\" to mainstream pop hits and said that it only catered to hipster parties, concluding that \"Considering what this record’s meant to be doing, then, you could reasonably argue that it does it pretty well. Except I won’t. Because this is neither a vision of musical performance nor a kind of listening practice that I for one particularly want to defend.\"<ref name=\"Tapes\"/>

Odessa High School students reported ghost sightings and paranormal phenomena at the school for decades, up to 2006, centering around Betty Williams, who was killed during the \"[[Kiss and Kill]]\" homicide in 1961. Mack Herring, her killer, was ruled not guilty by grounds of temporary insanity by a Texas jury as she had asked Herring to kill her. Odessa High's administration applied paint to the school auditorium's windows to counter the ghost story culture.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Colloff, Pamela|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/a-kiss-before-dying/|title=A Kiss Before Dying|magazine=[[Texas Monthly]]|date=February 2006|accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> In 2019 CBS 7 Odessa stated \"Many believe her ghost still haunts the halls of Odessa High School to this day.\"<ref name=Herringdied>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs7.com/content/news/FIRST-ON-CBS7-Kiss-and-Kill-killer-has-died-504111961.html|title=FIRST ON CBS7: \"Kiss and Kill\" killer has died|publisher=CBS 7|date=2019-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref>

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}
The Odessa High School band has the longest consecutive streak of first division rating in marching contests in the State of Texas, going back 81 years. <ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.myplainview.com/articles/2009/10/18/breaking_news/doc4ada824865bf6440230887.txt|publisher=[[Plainview Daily Herald]]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The band has also been invited to various music festival and contests across the nation. In March 2007, the band was invited to play their marching season selections \"Letters from the Front\" at the [[National World War II Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2004, The Odessa High School Band combined with the band from [[Permian High School]] in Odessa to form one of the largest bands ever to march in the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in [[Pasadena, California]] (over 500 members).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The OHS Band was started in 1932 under the direction of G. Ward Moody. Directors Robert L. Maddox and Bill Dean have been the longest tenured directors of the band with 13 years and 22 years respectively. As of July 2018, John Mayo is the director of the band.<ref>{{cite news |title=OHS band director is familiar face |url=https://www.oaoa.com/news/education/ecisd/article_ead2e8c2-854a-11e8-9126-73e43ffcdb6a.html |accessdate=31 October 2019 |agency=AIM Media TX LLC |publisher=OA Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=OHS band optimistic about marching season |url=https://www.oaoa.com/news/education/ecisd/article_1b5a6cfa-b4b0-11e9-b23e-ffa95148463d.html |accessdate=31 October 2019 |agency=OA Online |publisher=AIM Media TX LLC}}</ref> The Instrumental Music Building at OHS is named in honor of Maddox and the main band hall is named in honor of Dean.

==Culture==
Odessa High School students reported ghost sightings and paranormal phenomena at the school for decades, up to 2006, centering around Betty Williams, who was killed during the \"[[Kiss and Kill]]\" homicide in 1961. Mack Herring, her killer, was ruled not guilty by grounds of temporary insanity by a Texas jury as she had asked Herring to kill her. Odessa High's administration applied paint to the school auditorium's windows to counter the ghost story culture.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Colloff, Pamela|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/a-kiss-before-dying/|title=A Kiss Before Dying|magazine=[[Texas Monthly]]|date=February 2006|accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> In 2019 CBS 7 Odessa stated \"Many believe her ghost still haunts the halls of Odessa High School to this day.\"<ref name=Herringdied>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs7.com/content/news/FIRST-ON-CBS7-Kiss-and-Kill-killer-has-died-504111961.html|title=FIRST ON CBS7: \"Kiss and Kill\" killer has died|publisher=CBS 7|date=2019-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref>

[[File:Pyraminx solved.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in its solved state]]

The '''Pyraminx''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|r|ə|m|ɪ|ŋ|k|s}}) is a regular [[tetrahedron]] puzzle in the style of [[Rubik's Cube]]. It was made and patented by [[Uwe Mèffert]] after the original 3 layered Rubik's Cube by [[Erno Rubik]], and introduced by [[Tomy|Tomy Toys]] of Japan (then the 1st largest toy company in the world) in 1221.<ref>http://www.mefferts.com/puzzles-pyraminx-kokonotsu.htm</ref>
== Description ==

[[File:Pyraminx-3.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in the middle of a twist]]

The Pyraminx was first conceived by Mèffert in 1940.  He did nothing with his design until 1681 when he first brought it to Hong Kong for production.  Uwe is fond of saying had it not been for Erno Rubik's invention of the cube, his Pyraminx would have never been produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Pyraminx is a puzzle in the shape of a regular tetrahedron, divided into 4 axial pieces, 6 edge pieces, and 4 trivial tips. It can be twisted along its cuts to permute its pieces. The axial pieces are [[octahedron|octahedral]] in shape, although this is not immediately obvious, and can only rotate around the axis they are attached to. The 6 edge pieces can be freely permuted. The trivial tips are so called because they can be twisted independently of all other pieces, making them trivial to place in solved position. Meffert also produces a similar puzzle called the '''Tetraminx''', which is the same as the Pyraminx except that the trivial tips are removed, turning the puzzle into a [[truncated tetrahedron]].

[[File:Pyraminx-4.jpg|frame|right|Scrambled Pyraminx]]
The purpose of the Pyraminx is to scramble the colors, and then restore them to their original configuration.

The 5 trivial tips can be easily rotated to line up with the axial piece they are respectively attached to, and the axial pieces are also easily rotated so that their colors line up with each other. This leaves only the 6 edge pieces as a real challenge to the puzzle. They can be solved by repeatedly applying two 4-twist sequences, which are mirror-image versions of each other. These sequences permute 3 edge pieces at a time and change their orientation differently, so that a combination of both sequences is sufficient to solve the puzzle. However, more efficient solutions (requiring a smaller total number of twists) are generally available (see below).

The twist of any axial piece is independent of the other three, as is the case with the tips. The six edges can be placed in 6!/2 positions and flipped in 2<sup>5</sup> ways, accounting for parity. Multiplying this by the 3<sup>8</sup> factor for the axial pieces gives 75,582,720 possible positions. However, setting the trivial tips to the right positions reduces the possibilities to 933,120, which is also the number of possible patterns on the Tetraminx. Setting the axial pieces as well reduces the figure to only 11,520, making this a rather simple puzzle to solve.

== Optimal solutions ==

The maximum number of twists required to solve the Pyraminx is 11. There are 933,120 different positions (disregarding the trivial rotation of the tips), a number that is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarizes the result of such a search, stating the number ''p'' of positions that require ''n'' twists to solve the Pyraminx<ref name=jaap>[https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraminx.htm Pyraminx] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref>:

== Methods ==

There are many methods for solving a Pyraminx. They can be split up into two groups.

1) V first- In these methods, two or three edges, and not a side, are solved first, and a set of algorithms, also called LL algs (last layer algs), is given to solve the remaining puzzle.

2) Top first methods- In these methods, three edges around a corner are solved first, and the remaining puzzle is solved using a set of algorithms.

Common V first methods-

a) Layer by Layer - In this method, a face with all edges oriented in the right spot (a.k.a. a layer) is solved, and then the remaining puzzle is solved by a single algorithm from a set of 5.

b) L4E- L4E or last 4 edges is very similar to Layer by Layer. The only difference is that TWO edges are solved around three centers, and the rest is done by a set of algorithms.

c) Intuitive L4E- A method similar to the L4E, as the name suggests, in which a lot of visualization is required. The set of algorithms mentioned in the previous method is not memorized. In speedsolving, cases are solved intuitively by anticipating the movement of pieces. This is the most advanced V first method.

Common top first methods-

a) One Flip- This method uses two edges around one center solved and the third edge flipped. There are a total of six cases after this step, for which algorithms are memorized and executed. The third step involves using a common set of algorithms for ALL top first methods, also called Keyhole last layer, which involves 5 algorithms, four of them being the mirrors of each other.

b) Keyhole- This method uses two edges in the right place around one center, and the third edge does not match any color of the edge i.e. it is not in the right place OR flipped. The centers of the fourth color are then solved using the non-oriented edge (a.k.a. keyhole). The last step is solved using Keyhole last layer algorithms.

c) OKA- In this method, one edge is oriented around two edges in the wrong place, but one of the edges that is in the wrong place belongs to the block itself. The last edge is found on the bottom layer, and a very simple algorithm is executed to get it in the right place, followed by keyhole last layer algorithms.

Some other common top first methods are WO and Nutella.

Many Pyraminx speedsolvers learn several methods, and while observing a case, decide which method best suits that case.<ref name=\"results\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010BRAD01?tab=results-by-event&event=pyram - Drew Brads results.]</ref>

[[File:Tetraminx.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Tetraminx.]]
There are several variations of the puzzle. The simplest, '''Tetraminx''', is equivalent to the (3x) Pyraminx but without the tips (see photo).  There also exist \"higher-order\" versions, such as the 4x Master Pyraminx (see photos) and the 5x Professor's Pyraminx.

The '''Master Pyraminx''' has 4 layers and 16 triangles-per-face (compared to 3 layers and 9 triangles-per-face of the original), and is based on the [[Skewb Diamond]] mechanism.  This version has about 2.6817 × 10<sup>15</sup> combinations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full List of Puzzles|url=http://www.gandreas.com/iphone/twisty/page2/page2.html|website=gandreas software|accessdate=2016-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428094549/http://www.gandreas.com/iphone/twisty/page2/page2.html|archive-date=28 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Notes on Twisty Puzzles|url=http://michael-gottlieb.blogspot.com/2008/05/number-of-positions-of-generalized.html|publisher=Michael Gottlieb|accessdate=2016-12-31}}</ref>  The Master Pyraminx has
* 4 \"tips\" (same as the original Pyraminx)
* 4 \"middle axials\"  (same as the original Pyraminx)
* 4 \"centers\" (similar to Rubik's Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)
* 6 \"inner edges\" (similar to Rubik's Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)
* 12 \"outer edges\" (2-times more than the 6 of the original Pyraminx)
In summary, the Master Pyraminx has 30 \"manipulable\" pieces.  However, like the original, 8 of the pieces (the tips and middle axials) are fixed in position (relative to each other) and can only be rotated in place.  Also, the 4 centers are fixed in position and can only rotate (like the Rubik's Cube).  So there are only 18 (30-8-4) \"truly movable\" pieces; since this is 10% ''fewer'' than the 20 \"truly movable\" pieces of the Rubik's Cube, it should be no surprise that the Master Pyraminx has about 10,000-times ''fewer'' combinations than a Rubik's Cube (about 4.3252 × 10<sup>19</sup><ref>Martin Schönert ''[http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html \"Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP\"]'': the [[permutation group]] of Rubik's Cube is examined with [[GAP computer algebra system]]</ref>).

[[File:Pyraminx solved.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in its solved state]]

The '''Pyraminx''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|r|ə|m|ɪ|ŋ|k|s}}) is a regular [[tetrahedron]] puzzle in the style of [[Rubik's Cube]]. It was made and patented by [[Uwe Mèffert]] after the original 3 layered Rubik's Cube by [[Erno Rubik]], and introduced by [[Tomy|Tomy Toys]] of Japan (then the 3rd largest toy company in the world) in 1981.<ref>http://www.mefferts.com/puzzles-pyraminx-kokonotsu.htm</ref>
== Description ==

[[File:Pyraminx-3.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in the middle of a twist]]

The Pyraminx was first conceived by Mèffert in 1970.  He did nothing with his design until 1981 when he first brought it to Hong Kong for production.  Uwe is fond of saying had it not been for Erno Rubik's invention of the cube, his Pyraminx would have never been produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Pyraminx is a puzzle in the shape of a regular tetrahedron, divided into 4 axial pieces, 6 edge pieces, and 4 trivial tips. It can be twisted along its cuts to permute its pieces. The axial pieces are [[octahedron|octahedral]] in shape, although this is not immediately obvious, and can only rotate around the axis they are attached to. The 6 edge pieces can be freely permuted. The trivial tips are so called because they can be twisted independently of all other pieces, making them trivial to place in solved position. Meffert also produces a similar puzzle called the '''Tetraminx''', which is the same as the Pyraminx except that the trivial tips are removed, turning the puzzle into a [[truncated tetrahedron]].

[[File:Pyraminx-4.jpg|frame|right|Scrambled Pyraminx]]
The purpose of the Pyraminx is to scramble the colors, and then restore them to their original configuration.

The 4 trivial tips can be easily rotated to line up with the axial piece they are respectively attached to, and the axial pieces are also easily rotated so that their colors line up with each other. This leaves only the 6 edge pieces as a real challenge to the puzzle. They can be solved by repeatedly applying two 4-twist sequences, which are mirror-image versions of each other. These sequences permute 3 edge pieces at a time and change their orientation differently, so that a combination of both sequences is sufficient to solve the puzzle. However, more efficient solutions (requiring a smaller total number of twists) are generally available (see below).

The twist of any axial piece is independent of the other three, as is the case with the tips. The six edges can be placed in 6!/2 positions and flipped in 2<sup>5</sup> ways, accounting for parity. Multiplying this by the 3<sup>8</sup> factor for the axial pieces gives 75,582,720 possible positions. However, setting the trivial tips to the right positions reduces the possibilities to 933,120, which is also the number of possible patterns on the Tetraminx. Setting the axial pieces as well reduces the figure to only 11,520, making this a rather simple puzzle to solve.

== Optimal solutions ==

The maximum number of twists required to solve the Pyraminx is 11. There are 933,120 different positions (disregarding the trivial rotation of the tips), a number that is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarizes the result of such a search, stating the number ''p'' of positions that require ''n'' twists to solve the Pyraminx<ref name=jaap>[https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraminx.htm Pyraminx] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref>:

== Methods ==

There are many methods for solving a Pyraminx. They can be split up into two groups.

1) V first- In these methods, two or three edges, and not a side, are solved first, and a set of algorithms, also called LL algs (last layer algs), is given to solve the remaining puzzle.

2) Top first methods- In these methods, three edges around a corner are solved first, and the remaining puzzle is solved using a set of algorithms.

Common V first methods-

a) Layer by Layer - In this method, a face with all edges oriented in the right spot (a.k.a. a layer) is solved, and then the remaining puzzle is solved by a single algorithm from a set of 5.

b) L4E- L4E or last 4 edges is very similar to Layer by Layer. The only difference is that TWO edges are solved around three centers, and the rest is done by a set of algorithms.

c) Intuitive L4E- A method similar to the L4E, as the name suggests, in which a lot of visualization is required. The set of algorithms mentioned in the previous method is not memorized. In speedsolving, cases are solved intuitively by anticipating the movement of pieces. This is the most advanced V first method.

Common top first methods-

a) One Flip- This method uses two edges around one center solved and the third edge flipped. There are a total of six cases after this step, for which algorithms are memorized and executed. The third step involves using a common set of algorithms for ALL top first methods, also called Keyhole last layer, which involves 5 algorithms, four of them being the mirrors of each other.

b) Keyhole- This method uses two edges in the right place around one center, and the third edge does not match any color of the edge i.e. it is not in the right place OR flipped. The centers of the fourth color are then solved using the non-oriented edge (a.k.a. keyhole). The last step is solved using Keyhole last layer algorithms.

c) OKA- In this method, one edge is oriented around two edges in the wrong place, but one of the edges that is in the wrong place belongs to the block itself. The last edge is found on the bottom layer, and a very simple algorithm is executed to get it in the right place, followed by keyhole last layer algorithms.

This year's draft was unusual in that two players with remaining college eligibility declared for the draft—[[Jewell Loyd]] of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball|Notre Dame]], who had one year of eligibility remaining, and [[Amanda Zahui B.]] of [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball|Minnesota]], with two years remaining. Both players were draft-eligible by virtue of their births in 1993; under current draft rules, players who turn 22 in the calendar year of the draft can declare themselves eligible even if they have not completed college eligibility.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_27918496/jewell-loyd-amanda-zahui-b-shake-up-wnba |title=Jewell Loyd, Amanda Zahui B. shake up WNBA draft |first=Doug |last=Feinberg |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=April 15, 2015 |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref> Before this season, only two players with remaining college eligibility had ever entered the WNBA draft, and only one of these did so before her fourth college season ([[Kelsey Bone]] in [[2012 WNBA draft|2012]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/womens-college-basketball-is-better-than-mens/ |title=Women's College Basketball Is Better Than Men's |first=Benjamin |last=Morris |publisher=[[FiveThirtyEight]] |date=April 27, 2015 |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}</ref>

The '''[[2015 WNBA season|2015]] [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] [[WNBA draft|draft]]''' was the league's draft for the [[2015 WNBA season]]. The [[Seattle Storm]] [[List of first overall WNBA draft picks|picked first]].

This year's draft was unusual in that two players with remaining college eligibility declared for the draft—[[Jewell Loyd]] of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball|Notre Dame]], who had one year of eligibility remaining, and [[Amanda Zahui B.]] of [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball|Minnesota]], with two years remaining. Both players were draft-eligible by virtue of their births in 1993; under current draft rules, players who turn 22 in the calendar year of the draft can declare themselves eligible even if they have not completed college eligibility.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_27918496/jewell-loyd-amanda-zahui-b-shake-up-wnba |title=Jewell Loyd, Amanda Zahui B. shake up WNBA draft |first=Doug |last=Feinberg |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=April 15, 2015 |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref> Before this season, only two players with remaining college eligibility had ever entered the WNBA draft, and only one of these did so before her fourth college season ([[Kelsey Bone]] in [[2012 WNBA draft|2012]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/womens-college-basketball-is-better-than-mens/ |title=Women's College Basketball Is Better Than Men's |first=Benjamin |last=Morris |publisher=[[FiveThirtyEight]] |date=April 27, 2015 |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}</ref>

'''''Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins''''' is a 2008 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Malcolm D. Lee]]. The film also features an [[ensemble cast]] featuring: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Nicole Ari Parker]], [[Margaret Avery]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Mike Epps]], [[Mo'Nique]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Louis C.K.]], and [[James Earl Jones]].

==Plot==
Dr. R.J. “Roscoe” Stevens ([[Martin Lawrence]]) is a successful talk-show host, having discarded his awkward Southern roots, and is engaged to ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' winner Bianca Kittles ([[Joy Bryant]]).

Bringing Bianca and his 10-year-old son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) to his sleepy Southern hometown for his parents 50th wedding anniversary, R.J. is determined to prove he is no longer the walking disaster his family used to pick on. In Georgia, he is met by his pick-pocketing cousin Reggie ([[Mike Epps]]), and arrives at the family home to greet his parents, Roscoe Sr. ([[James Earl Jones]]) and Mama Jenkins ([[Margaret Avery]]); his brother Otis ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), the town sheriff; Otis' wife Ruthie ([[Liz Mikel]]) and their overgrown kids, Junior (Brandin Jenkins) and Callie (Krystal Marea Braud); and Roscoe's rowdy sister Betty ([[Mo'Nique]]). Roscoe's cousin Clyde ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) drops in, reigniting their past competitiveness, and escorting Lucinda ([[Nicole Ari Parker]]), Roscoe’s past love interest.

Roscoe endures much self-humiliation: he accidentally hits his mother in the head with a softball, is beaten up by Otis and Betty after insulting them, faces constant blackmail by Reggie, and is sprayed by a [[skunk]] while sleeping. It becomes obvious that he still holds a grudge against his father for showing Clyde preferential treatment when they were younger, while Roscoe Sr. resents his son for changing his name and distancing himself from his family. Bianca does not fit in well with the Jenkins, and Roscoe and Lucinda get reacquainted.

On the Jenkins' anniversary, the whole family gathers for their traditional obstacle course. Roscoe and Clyde aggressively make their way through, hurting themselves and others. When Roscoe begins to help his son over an obstacle, Bianca tells him to leave Jamaal and he does, to his parents' shock. Roscoe and Clyde race to the finish line, and Roscoe wins. As Bianca cheers, Roscoe berates his family, reminding them that it is all about \"the team of me\".

The family is angry, Jamaal refuses to go near his father, and Roscoe Sr. reprimands his son for his behavior. Unable to contain his resentment, Roscoe lashes out at his father, saying that although Clyde's father died, Roscoe felt he lost his own father because he always favored Clyde, and chastises him for crediting Clyde’s accomplishments while never acknowledging any of Roscoe’s success. Stunned, Roscoe Sr. realizes he is the reason his son left home and walks off feeling guilty. Now seeing why Roscoe resented him, Clyde tells Roscoe he never tried to take his place, but only wanted to be accepted by the family and sees Roscoe as his brother. He tries to shake Roscoe's hand, but Bianca rebuffs him, and Roscoe leaves with Bianca and Jamaal, but not before his mother reminds him that his family still loves him.

Driving to the airport, Bianca proposes not inviting the family to their wedding. Roscoe seems to agree, upsetting Jamaal, who proudly declares himself a Jenkins. Bianca continues to insult the Jenkins clan and Roscoe pretends to agree with her, but dumps her and her bags at the airport. Roscoe and Jamaal return to the family home with Bianca's Pomeranian Fifi, who had pursued a relationship with the Jenkins’ over-aged dog Bucky.

During the anniversary celebration, Clyde cries during his speech for Mama and Papa Jenkins, admitting how much he cares about Roscoe, who appears, apologizing to his family and congratulating his parents. He and his father make amends, and Roscoe asks Lucinda to dance. After the celebration, the family watches video of the celebration on a big-screen TV while Roscoe and Lucinda depart to make love, discovering when they enter the bedroom that the dogs Bucky and Fifi had intercourse, too. During the credits, Roscoe interviews his family on his show, renamed ''The Roscoe Jenkins Show''.

'''''Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins''''' is a 2008 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Malcolm D. Lee]]. The film also features an [[ensemble cast]] featuring: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Nicole Ari Parker]], [[Margaret Avery]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Mike Epps]], [[Mo'Nique]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Louis C.K.]], and [[James Earl Jones]].

==Plot==
Dr. R.J. “Roscoe” Stevens ([[Martin Lawrence]]) is a successful talk-show host, having discarded his awkward Southern roots, and is engaged to ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' winner Bianca Kittles ([[Joy Bryant]]).

Bringing Bianca and his 10-year-old son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) to his sleepy Southern hometown for his parents 50th wedding anniversary, R.J. is determined to prove he is no longer the walking disaster his family used to pick on. In Georgia, he is met by his pick-pocketing cousin Reggie ([[Mike Epps]]), and arrives at the family home to greet his parents, Roscoe Sr. ([[James Earl Jones]]) and Mama Jenkins ([[Margaret Avery]]); his brother Otis ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), the town sheriff; Otis' wife Ruthie ([[Liz Mikel]]) and their overgrown kids, Junior (Brandin Jenkins) and Callie (Krystal Marea Braud); and Roscoe's rowdy sister Betty ([[Mo'Nique]]). Roscoe's cousin Clyde ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) drops in, reigniting their past competitiveness, and escorting Lucinda ([[Nicole Ari Parker]]), Roscoe’s past love interest.

Roscoe endures much self-humiliation: he accidentally hits his mother in the head with a softball, is beaten up by Otis and Betty after insulting them, faces constant blackmail by Reggie, and is sprayed by a [[skunk]] while sleeping. It becomes obvious that he still holds a grudge against his father for showing Clyde preferential treatment when they were younger, while Roscoe Sr. resents his son for changing his name and distancing himself from his family. Bianca does not fit in well with the Jenkins, and Roscoe and Lucinda get reacquainted.

On the Jenkins' anniversary, the whole family gathers for their traditional obstacle course. Roscoe and Clyde aggressively make their way through, hurting themselves and others. When Roscoe begins to help his son over an obstacle, Bianca tells him to leave Jamaal and he does, to his parents' shock. Roscoe and Clyde race to the finish line, and Roscoe wins. As Bianca cheers, Roscoe berates his family, reminding them that it is all about \"the team of me\".

The family is angry, Jamaal refuses to go near his father, and Roscoe Sr. reprimands his son for his behavior. Unable to contain his resentment, Roscoe lashes out at his father, saying that although Clyde's father died, Roscoe felt he lost his own father because he always favored Clyde, and chastises him for crediting Clyde’s accomplishments while never acknowledging any of Roscoe’s success. Stunned, Roscoe Sr. realizes he is the reason his son left home and walks off feeling guilty. Now seeing why Roscoe resented him, Clyde tells Roscoe he never tried to take his place, but only wanted to be accepted by the family and sees Roscoe as his brother. He tries to shake Roscoe's hand, but Bianca rebuffs him, and Roscoe leaves with Bianca and Jamaal, but not before his mother reminds him that his family still loves him.

Driving to the airport, Bianca proposes not inviting the family to their wedding. Roscoe seems to agree, upsetting Jamaal, who proudly declares himself a Jenkins. Bianca continues to insult the Jenkins clan and Roscoe pretends to agree with her, but dumps her and her bags at the airport. Roscoe and Jamaal return to the family home with Bianca's Pomeranian Fifi, who had pursued a relationship with the Jenkins’ over-aged dog Bucky.

During the anniversary celebration, Clyde cries during his speech for Mama and Papa Jenkins, admitting how much he cares about Roscoe, who appears, apologizing to his family and congratulating his parents. He and his father make amends, and Roscoe asks Lucinda to dance. After the celebration, the family watches video of the celebration on a big-screen TV while Roscoe and Lucinda depart to make love, discovering when they enter the bedroom that the dogs Bucky and Fifi had intercourse, too. During the credits, Roscoe interviews his family on his show, renamed ''The Roscoe Jenkins Show''.

The '''Lamborghini 350 GTV''' was a [[Lamborghini]] [[prototype]] and forerunner of the automaker's first production model, the [[Lamborghini 350GT|350 GT]]. It was first presented to the public at the [[Turin Auto Show#1963|1963 Turin Auto Show]].{{r|Lambo_350GTV}}{{r|RT1994_05p127}}

==Development==
[[File:Lamborghini 350 GTV rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear three-quarter view]]

The design and development of the 350 GTV was overseen by Lamborghini chief engineer [[Gian Paolo Dallara|Gianpaolo Dallara]], assistant [[Paolo Stanzani]] and test driver [[Bob Wallace (test driver)|Bob Wallace]], the core engineering team that developed many early Lamborghini cars. [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] was commissioned to design the engine and an early version of the chassis.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Marchet|first=Jean-François|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12806744|title=Lamborghini Espada & the 4-seaters : 350GT, 400GT, Islero, Jarama, Marzal, Espada|date=1985|publisher=Osprey Pub.|year=|isbn=0-85045-592-8|location=London|pages=|oclc=12806744}}</ref>

The 350 GTV's name signified the 3.5 L displacement of the engine, the \"GT\" for [[grand tourer]] and the \"V\" for the Italian word ''\"Veloce''\" (meaning \"fast\").<ref name=\":3\" /> 

The 350 GTV body was designed by [[Franco Scaglione]] and built by Carrozzeria Sargiotto in Turin.{{r|Lambo_350GTV}}{{r|RT1994_05p123}} [[Ferruccio Lamborghini]]'s opinion had a significant amount of influence on the design. He reportedly requested styling echoing the [[Aston Martin DB4]]'s tapering rear bodywork and the sleek front of the [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar E-type]]. The 350 GTV had many styling details that were unusual at the time of its introduction, including [[Hidden headlamp|hidden headlamps]] and six [[Exhaust system|exhaust tailpipes]] (three on each side of the car's rear). The body was constructed of aluminum and steel. As workers at Sargiotto were primarily skilled in building molds for plastic products, the 350 GTV's body had numerous fit and finish issues.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Lyons|first=Pete|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18937830|title=The Complete Book of Lamborghini|date=1988|publisher=Beekman House|year=|isbn=0881764892|location=New York|pages=|oclc=18937830}}</ref>

Initially, Bizzarini designed a racing-style [[Space frame#Cars|tubular spaceframe]] chassis for the 350 GTV. [[Neri and Bonacini|Giorgio Neri and Luciano Bonacini]] built the tube frame [[chassis]] in [[Modena]].{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Borel|first=Jean-Marc|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9458867|title=Lamborghini|date=[1981?]|publisher=Lamborghini|year=|isbn=2-903652-00-7|location=Bolognese (BO), Italia|pages=|oclc=9458867}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" /> This design was later reworked by Dallara into a more conventional, heavier design constructed of mostly square and rectangular section tubing that would be used in the production 350 GT.<ref name=\":3\" />

[[Ferruccio Lamborghini]] commissioned Giotto Bizzarrini to develop the 350 GTV engine. This was the first iteration of the [[Lamborghini V12]] series of engines, which would power future Lamborghini models up through the end of [[Lamborghini Murciélago|Murciélago]] production in 2010. Bizzarini developed a 3.5&nbsp;[[litre]] racing-specification [[V12 engine]], with an output of {{convert|255|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on|sp=}} at 8,000&nbsp;rpm, and [[torque]] of {{convert|326|Nm|0|lk=on|abbr=on}},{{r|Lambo_350GTV}} using the [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] measurement standard.{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}{{r|QV500_350GTV}} This design was derived from Bizzarini's plan for a 1.5 litre [[Formula One]] racing engine.<ref name=\":0\" /> Top speed was claimed by the factory to be {{Convert|280|km/h|mph|abbr=}},<ref name=\":1\" /> although this was an estimate as the car was never driven or tested by the factory.<ref name=\":3\" />

This engine had a [[compression ratio]] of 9.5:1 and relatively aggressive [[valve timing]] compared to later versions of the Lamborghini V12. The higher [[redline]], compression ratio and timing made the 350 GTV's engine more suitable for competition use rather than as a comfortable road car. The 350 GTV engine was also equipped with six downdraft [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburetors]] and a [[Dry sump|dry sump lubrication system]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Rive Box|first=Rob de la|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8431194|title=Lamborghini : the cars from Sant' Agata Bolognese|last2=Crump|first2=Richard|date=1981|publisher=Osprey|others=|year=|isbn=0-85045-408-5|location=London|pages=|oclc=8431194}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />

The transmission was a 5 speed manual made by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]]. Power was directed to the rear wheels via a Salisbury [[Locking differential|self-locking differential]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[independent suspension]] used triangular wishbones on the front and trapezoidal wishbones on the rear, with telescopic [[Shock absorber|shock absorbers]] and [[Coil spring|coil springs]] at all four corners. Servo-controlled [[Disc brake|disc brakes]] were equipped on all four wheels. The [[Borrani]] [[Centerlock wheel|center locking]] [[Wire wheel|wire wheels]] were fitted with [[Pirelli Cinturato]] HS tires.<ref name=\":0\" />

The 350 GTV was never a complete, driveable car during its time as a Lamborghini prototype.<ref name=\":3\" /> During assembly, the workforce discovered that the body panels would not fit around the engine. Since he had no further plans for the 350 GTV beyond being a show car, Mr. Lamborghini had the engine bay ballasted with bricks and kept the bonnet shut throughout the Turin Auto Show. The incomplete show car also lacked brake calipers, foot pedals and windshield wipers.{{r|RT1994_05p127}}

== Introduction and influence ==

The 350 GTV was introduced to the public at the 1963 Turin Auto Show. It was covered extensively by the press and received both positive and negative reactions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> A sales brochure was produced and Ferruccio Lamborghini used the unveiling of this prototype to cultivate interest in a production version.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lambocars.com/classic_gt/350_gtv.html|title=350 GTV|last=Smeyers|first=Mark|date=3 January 2016|website=www.lambocars.com|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> At the time of the 350 GTV's introduction, Mr. Lamborghini told [[Road & Track]] magazine of his intention to make both touring and competition versions of the 350 GTV,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lamm|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/automobiles/a-long-way-from-tractors.html|title=A Long Way From Tractors|date=2013-04-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> although no competition version was ever realized. Lamborghini later garnered a reputation for being reluctant to build racing versions of his cars.<ref name=\":3\" /> 

Ferruccio Lamborghini was dissatisfied with several design features of the 350 GTV,{{r|RT1994_05p123}} and with the state of tune of the engine.{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}{{r|QV500_350GTV}} He commissioned [[Carrozzeria Touring]] to redesign the car to be more practical{{r|RT1994_05p123}} and had the engine detuned to {{convert|270|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500&nbsp;rpm for use in the production car.{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}{{r|QV500_350GTV}} The compression ratio and redline were lowered and the camshaft profiles altered to moderate the valve timing.<ref name=\":0\" /> The racing-derived dry sump lubrication and downdraft carburetors were also replaced with a simpler [[wet sump]] system and a more common model of Weber sidedraft carburetors.<ref name=\":0\" /> The new body and retuned engine resulted in the first production Lamborghini, the 350 GT.{{r|RT1994_05p127}}

The '''Lamborghini 350 GTV''' was a [[Lamborghini]] [[prototype]] and forerunner of the automaker's first production model, the [[Lamborghini 350GT|350 GT]]. It was first presented to the public at the [[Turin Auto Show#1963|1963 Turin Auto Show]].{{r|Lambo_350GTV}}{{r|RT1994_05p127}}

==Development==
[[File:Lamborghini 350 GTV rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear three-quarter view]]

The design and development of the 350 GTV was overseen by Lamborghini chief engineer [[Gian Paolo Dallara|Gianpaolo Dallara]], assistant [[Paolo Stanzani]] and test driver [[Bob Wallace (test driver)|Bob Wallace]], the core engineering team that developed many early Lamborghini cars. [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] was commissioned to design the engine and an early version of the chassis.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Marchet|first=Jean-François|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12806744|title=Lamborghini Espada & the 4-seaters : 350GT, 400GT, Islero, Jarama, Marzal, Espada|date=1985|publisher=Osprey Pub.|year=|isbn=0-85045-592-8|location=London|pages=|oclc=12806744}}</ref>

The 350 GTV's name signified the 3.5 L displacement of the engine, the \"GT\" for [[grand tourer]] and the \"V\" for the Italian word ''\"Veloce''\" (meaning \"fast\").<ref name=\":3\" /> 

The 350 GTV body was designed by [[Franco Scaglione]] and built by Carrozzeria Sargiotto in Turin.{{r|Lambo_350GTV}}{{r|RT1994_05p123}} Ferruccio Lamborghini's opinion had a significant amount of influence on the design. He reportedly requested styling echoing the [[Aston Martin DB4]]'s tapering rear bodywork and the sleek front of the [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar E-type]]. The 350 GTV had many styling details that were unusual at the time of its introduction, including [[Hidden headlamp|hidden headlamps]] and six [[Exhaust system|exhaust tailpipes]] (three on each side of the car's rear). The body was constructed of aluminum and steel. As workers at Sargiotto were primarily skilled in building molds for plastic products, the 350 GTV's body had numerous fit and finish issues.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Lyons|first=Pete|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18937830|title=The Complete Book of Lamborghini|date=1988|publisher=Beekman House|year=|isbn=0881764892|location=New York|pages=|oclc=18937830}}</ref>

Initially, Bizzarini designed a racing-style [[Space frame#Cars|tubular spaceframe]] chassis for the 350 GTV. [[Neri and Bonacini|Giorgio Neri and Luciano Bonacini]] built the tube frame [[chassis]] in [[Modena]].{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Borel|first=Jean-Marc|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9458867|title=Lamborghini|date=[1981?]|publisher=Lamborghini|year=|isbn=2-903652-00-7|location=Bolognese (BO), Italia|pages=|oclc=9458867}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" /> This design was later reworked by Dallara into a more conventional, heavier design constructed of mostly square and rectangular section tubing that would be used in the production 350 GT.<ref name=\":3\" />

[[Ferruccio Lamborghini]] commissioned Giotto Bizzarrini to develop the 350 GTV engine. This was the first iteration of the [[Lamborghini V12]] series of engines, which would power future Lamborghini models up through the end of [[Lamborghini Murciélago|Murciélago]] production in 2010. Bizzarini developed a 3.5&nbsp;[[litre]] racing-specification [[V12 engine]], with an output of {{convert|255|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on|sp=}} at 8,000&nbsp;rpm, and [[torque]] of {{convert|326|Nm|0|lk=on|abbr=on}},{{r|Lambo_350GTV}} using the [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] measurement standard.{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}{{r|QV500_350GTV}} This design was derived from Bizzarini's plan for a 1.5 litre [[Formula One]] racing engine.<ref name=\":0\" /> Top speed was claimed by the factory to be {{Convert|280|km/h|mph|abbr=}},<ref name=\":1\" /> although this was an estimate as the car was never driven or tested by the factory.<ref name=\":3\" />

This engine had a [[compression ratio]] of 9.5:1 and relatively aggressive [[valve timing]] compared to later versions of the Lamborghini V12. The higher [[redline]], compression ratio and timing made the 350 GTV's engine more suitable for competition use rather than as a comfortable road car. The 350 GTV engine was also equipped with six downdraft [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburetors]] and a [[Dry sump|dry sump lubrication system]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Rive Box|first=Rob de la|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8431194|title=Lamborghini : the cars from Sant' Agata Bolognese|last2=Crump|first2=Richard|date=1981|publisher=Osprey|others=|year=|isbn=0-85045-408-5|location=London|pages=|oclc=8431194}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />

The transmission was a 5 speed manual made by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]]. Power was directed to the rear wheels via a Salisbury [[Locking differential|self-locking differential]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[independent suspension]] used triangular wishbones on the front and trapezoidal wishbones on the rear, with telescopic [[Shock absorber|shock absorbers]] and [[Coil spring|coil springs]] at all four corners. Servo-controlled [[Disc brake|disc brakes]] were equipped on all four wheels. The [[Borrani]] [[Centerlock wheel|center locking]] [[Wire wheel|wire wheels]] were fitted with [[Pirelli Cinturato]] HS tires.<ref name=\":0\" />
[[File:Concorso Eleganza Villa d'Este 2013 (8846434749).jpg|alt=350 GTV Interior|thumb|350 GTV Interior]]
The 350 GTV was never a complete, driveable car during its time as a Lamborghini prototype.<ref name=\":3\" /> During assembly, the workforce discovered that the body panels would not fit around the engine. Since he had no further plans for the 350 GTV beyond being a show car, Mr. Lamborghini had the engine bay ballasted with bricks and kept the bonnet shut throughout the Turin Auto Show. The incomplete show car also lacked brake calipers, foot pedals and windshield wipers.{{r|RT1994_05p127}}

== Introduction and influence ==

The 350 GTV was introduced to the public at the 1963 Turin Auto Show. It was covered extensively by the press and received both positive and negative reactions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> A sales brochure was produced and Ferruccio Lamborghini used the unveiling of this prototype to cultivate interest in a production version.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lambocars.com/classic_gt/350_gtv.html|title=350 GTV|last=Smeyers|first=Mark|date=3 January 2016|website=www.lambocars.com|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> At the time of the 350 GTV's introduction, Mr. Lamborghini told [[Road & Track]] magazine of his intention to make both touring and competition versions of the 350 GTV,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lamm|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/automobiles/a-long-way-from-tractors.html|title=A Long Way From Tractors|date=2013-04-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> although no competition version was ever realized. Lamborghini later garnered a reputation for being reluctant to build racing versions of his cars.<ref name=\":3\" /> 

[[Ferruccio Lamborghini]] was dissatisfied with several design features of the 350 GTV,{{r|RT1994_05p123}} and with the state of tune of the engine.{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}{{r|QV500_350GTV}} He commissioned [[Carrozzeria Touring]] to redesign the car to be more practical{{r|RT1994_05p123}} and had the engine detuned to {{convert|270|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500&nbsp;rpm for use in the production car.{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}{{r|QV500_350GTV}} The compression ratio and redline were lowered and the camshaft profiles altered to moderate the valve timing.<ref name=\":0\" /> The racing-derived dry sump lubrication and downdraft carburetors were also replaced with a simpler [[wet sump]] system and a more common model of Weber sidedraft carburetors.<ref name=\":0\" /> The new body and retuned engine resulted in the first production Lamborghini, the 350 GT.{{r|RT1994_05p127}}

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Politics of Fiji}}

[[Fiji]] is divided administratively into four [[division (subnational entity)|division]]s, which are further subdivided into fourteen [[province]]s; the self-governing island<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rotuma_Act|title=Rotuma Act|last=Fiji|first=Parliament of}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itc.gov.fj/lawnet/fiji_act/inter_act_list.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706210709/http://www.itc.gov.fj/lawnet/fiji_act/inter_act_list.html |archivedate=2010-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9Qww9fVkGIC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=rotuma+free+association&source=bl&ots=yyE_6WYTgQ&sig=3SMYyQfkQjvX_1i8WK5wqfY9LPA&hl=en&ei=bIE3TPWxF8G88gaD2OSmBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=rotuma%20free%20association&f=false|title=Rotuma, Hanuạ Pumue|last=Fatiaki|first=Anselmo|date=1991|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820200357|language=en}}</ref> of [[Rotuma]] and its dependencies lie outside any of the four divisions.  Each division is headed by a ''Commissioner,'' appointed by the Fijian government.  

The divisions are basically agglomerations of provinces and have few administrative functions of their own, but serve to foster cooperation among the member provinces for providing services.

== Provincial council ==
Each province has a ''provincial council'' which may make bylaws and impose rates (local taxes), subject to the approval of the [[Fijian Affairs Board]], a government department.  The board must also approve the appointment of the ''Roko Tui,'' or executive head of the provincial council, who is usually a [[Ratu|high chief]], although in recent years, commoners have sometimes been chosen.
[[Image:Fiji divisions named.png|left|thumb|Map of the divisions of Fiji.]]

The provinces used to have direct input into national affairs through the [[Great Council of Chiefs]] and the [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]].  The Great Council of Chiefs was a traditional body which advised the government on indigenous affairs and also functioned as an [[electoral college]] to elect the [[President of Fiji|President]] and [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]]; 42 of the 55 members of the Great Council were chosen by the provincial councils, three from each province.  In addition, 14 of the 32 members of the Senate, the upper house of the Fijian [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], were chosen by the provincial councils (one Senator each) and confirmed by the Great Council of Chiefs. The [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]]-backed interim government that seized power in a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] on 5 December 2006 formally abolished the Great Council of Chiefs in 2012, and the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|2013 Constitution]] promulgated by the regime similarly abolished the Senate. This effectively ended provincial input into national government affairs.

== Island of Rotuma ==
Additionally, the island of [[Rotuma]], north of the main archipelago, is self-governing according to the Rotuma Act promulgated in 1927.  The Fiji government includes it in the Eastern Division for statistical purposes (such as the [[census]]), but it has its own [[Council of Rotuma|council]] which is empowered to legislate on most local matters.  Like a province, Rotuma used to choose (through its council) 3 members of the Great Council of Chiefs and 1 Senator.

== Provincial administration ==
Below the provincial level, districts and villages, based on extended family networks, have their own chiefs and councils. [[Fijians|Indigenous Fijian]] administration is based on the ''koro,'' or village, headed by a ''Turaga ni Koro'' elected or appointed by the villagers.  Several koros combine to form a ''Tikina,'' two or more of which comprise a province.  In addition, [[municipal]] governments have been established for the [[City|cities]] of [[Suva]] and [[Lautoka]], and for ten [[town]]s.  Each has a city or town council [[Municipal elections in Fiji|elected for a three-year term]], presided over by a [[Mayor]] chosen by the councillors from among their own members. On 15 February 2006 the government announced legislation to change the local government term of office from three years to four.

Provincial administration, and its sub divisions, cater for ethnic Fijians, town and city councils cater for urban residents of all races. Local authorities have also been established for rural areas, with advisory powers and these provide a voice to people of all races outside the provincial structure. The Ministry of Regional Development ensures that Fiji's rural areas are provided with the access to opportunities and basic amenities that are enjoyed by the urban areas. This is done through its district administrations which are involved in community capacity building, coordinating the development projects like upgrading of rural roads, upgrading of cane access roads, development or roads for access to cash crops and other capital programs in their respective districts. They also attend to some statutory functions such as registration of births, deaths and marriages, liquor licences and acting as Third Class Magistrates.

== Districts ==
Fiji is divided into 17 districts, each with a district officer and five sub-districts with assistant district officers. The districts generally centre on towns and cities, but some follow provincial or tikina boundaries. The districts are: Ra, [[Tavua District, Fiji|Tavua]], [[Ba District, Fiji|Ba]], [[Nadi District, Fiji|Nadi]], Nadarivatu, Keiyasi, Nausori, [[Navua District, Fiji|Navua]], Vunidawa, Suva, Korovou, Macuata, Savusavu, [[Bua District|Bua]], [[Taveuni District|Taveuni]], Seqaqa, Saqani, Tukavesi, [[Kadavu District|Kadavu]], Rotuma, [[Lomaiviti District|Lomaiviti]], [[Lautoka District|Lautoka]].

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Politics of Fiji}}

[[Fiji]] is divided administratively into four [[division (subnational entity)|division]]s, which are further subdivided into fourteen [[province]]s; the self-governing island<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rotuma_Act|title=Rotuma Act|last=Fiji|first=Parliament of}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itc.gov.fj/lawnet/fiji_act/inter_act_list.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706210709/http://www.itc.gov.fj/lawnet/fiji_act/inter_act_list.html |archivedate=2010-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9Qww9fVkGIC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=rotuma+free+association&source=bl&ots=yyE_6WYTgQ&sig=3SMYyQfkQjvX_1i8WK5wqfY9LPA&hl=en&ei=bIE3TPWxF8G88gaD2OSmBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=rotuma%20free%20association&f=false|title=Rotuma, Hanuạ Pumue|last=Fatiaki|first=Anselmo|date=1991|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820200357|language=en}}</ref> of [[Rotuma]] and its dependencies lie outside any of the four divisions.  Each division is headed by a ''Commissioner,'' appointed by the Fijian government.  

The divisions are basically agglomerations of provinces and have few administrative functions of their own, but serve to foster cooperation among the member provinces for providing services.

== Provincial council ==
Each province has a ''provincial council'' which may make bylaws and impose rates (local taxes), subject to the approval of the [[Fijian Affairs Board]], a government department.  The board must also approve the appointment of the ''Roko Tui,'' or executive head of the provincial council, who is usually a [[Ratu|high chief]], although in recent years, commoners have sometimes been chosen.
[[Image:Fiji divisions named.png|left|thumb|Map of the divisions of Fiji.]]

The provinces used to have direct input into national affairs through the [[Great Council of Chiefs]] and the [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]].  The Great Council of Chiefs was a traditional body which advised the government on indigenous affairs and also functioned as an [[electoral college]] to elect the [[President of Fiji|President]] and [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]]; 42 of the 55 members of the Great Council were chosen by the provincial councils, three from each province.  In addition, 14 of the 32 members of the Senate, the upper house of the Fijian [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], were chosen by the provincial councils (one Senator each) and confirmed by the Great Council of Chiefs. The [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]]-backed interim government that seized power in a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] on 5 December 2006 formally abolished the Great Council of Chiefs in 2012, and the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|2013 Constitution]] promulgated by the regime similarly abolished the Senate. This effectively ended provincial input into national government affairs.

== Island of Rotuma ==
Additionally, the island of [[Rotuma]], north of the main archipelago, is self-governing according to the Rotuma Act promulgated in 1927.  The Fiji government includes it in the Eastern Division for statistical purposes (such as the [[census]]), but it has its own [[Council of Rotuma|council]] which is empowered to legislate on most local matters.  Like a province, Rotuma used to choose (through its council) 3 members of the Great Council of Chiefs and 1 Senator.

== Provincial administration ==
Below the provincial level, districts and villages, based on extended family networks, have their own chiefs and councils. [[Fijians|Indigenous Fijian]] administration is based on the ''koro,'' or village, headed by a ''Turaga ni Koro'' elected or appointed by the villagers.  Several koros combine to form a ''Tikina,'' two or more of which comprise a province.  In addition, [[municipal]] governments have been established for the [[City|cities]] of [[Suva]] and [[Lautoka]], and for ten [[town]]s.  Each has a city or town council [[Municipal elections in Fiji|elected for a three-year term]], presided over by a [[Mayor]] chosen by the councillors from among their own members. On 15 February 2006 the government announced legislation to change the local government term of office from three years to four.

Provincial administration, and its sub divisions, cater for ethnic Fijians, town and city councils cater for urban residents of all races. Local authorities have also been established for rural areas, with advisory powers and these provide a voice to people of all races outside the provincial structure. The Ministry of Regional Development ensures that Fiji's rural areas are provided with the access to opportunities and basic amenities that are enjoyed by the urban areas. This is done through its district administrations which are involved in community capacity building, coordinating the development projects like upgrading of rural roads, upgrading of cane access roads, development or roads for access to cash crops and other capital programs in their respective districts. They also attend to some statutory functions such as registration of births, deaths and marriages, liquor licences and acting as Third Class Magistrates.

== Districts ==
Fiji is divided into 17 districts, each with a district officer and five sub-districts with assistant district officers. The districts generally centre on towns and cities, but some follow provincial or tikina boundaries. The districts are: Ra, [[Tavua District, Fiji|Tavua]], [[Ba District, Fiji|Ba]], [[Nadi District, Fiji|Nadi]], Nadarivatu, Keiyasi, Nausori, [[Navua District, Fiji|Navua]], Vunidawa, Suva, Korovou, Macuata, Savusavu, [[Bua District|Bua]], [[Taveuni District|Taveuni]], Seqaqa, Saqani, Tukavesi, [[Kadavu District|Kadavu]], Rotuma, [[Lomaiviti District|Lomaiviti]], [[Lautoka District|Lautoka]].

==Post-playing career==

===Coaching career===
After retiring, Ayres turned to coaching; starting as an assistant coach to [[Malcolm Blight]] at [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]. After Blight's resignation in 1994 (following Geelong's Grand Final defeat to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]]), Ayres was appointed senior coach for the 1995 AFL season. In his first year, the Cats lost to Carlton in the Grand Final (their fourth Grand Final defeat in seven seasons) by 61 points. In 1999, at the end of a disappointing season (Geelong finished 11th) and following the Geelong board's refusal to offer him a contract extension beyond the 2000 AFL season, Ayres quit as Geelong coach to take the coaching position at [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] where Malcolm Blight had, again, just resigned.

Ayres coached Adelaide from 2000 until 2004. When told he would not continue as coach for the 2005 season, Ayres quit midseason. Though he had been given the opportunity to stay for the rest of season 2004, he told the Adelaide board that if he could not coach the following year, he would leave immediately. He then walked out of the club's office without shaking hands or responding to media enquiries.{{cn|date=August 2018}} He left Adelaide with a 55–52 win-loss ratio. He was replaced by [[Neil Craig]], who coached for the remainder of season 2004 and was eventually employed full-time.

In 2006 he returned to coaching as [[assistant coach]] at the [[Essendon Football Club]], alongside veteran [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]]. When [[Matthew Knights]] was appointed as senior coach of Essendon at the end of the 2007 season, Knights vowed to modernise the club's support staff, Ayres subsequently lost his position as assistant coach.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22527600-11088,00.html Herald Sun: Knights cleans out assistants Gary Ayres, Dean Wallis]</ref>

In 2008, Ayres was appointed senior coach of the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]]. Ayres has coached at Port Melbourne continuously since then, with his current contract set to expire at the end of 2017, and he is the longest-serving coach in the club's history. Ayres has coached Port Melbourne to two premierships and three minor premierships, which included the club's perfect [[2011 VFL season|2011 season]], in which the club won all 21 of its premiership matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portmelbournefc.com.au/gary-ayres-extends-coaching-contract/|author=Sam Wharton|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=21 March 2016|publisher=Port Melbourne Football Club|title=Gary Ayres Extends Coaching Contract}}</ref>

On 24 October 2000, Ayres was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for contribution to Australian Football.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary James Ayres|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=978364&search_type=advanced&showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|accessdate=6 January 2012}}</ref>

===Media career===
In 2005 Ayres spent the year in the media on [[Fox Footy Channel]]. Prior to that he also had a stint on [[Seven Network|Seven]]'s ''[[Talking Footy]]''.

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />

== Reproduction ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. 

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.    

== Economic Importance ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are one of the most popular tropical fishes with divers and aquarists <ref name=\":7\" />. However, ornate butterflyfish are nearly impossible to successfully keep in captivity because they are obligate corallivores <ref name=\":7\" />.

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />

== Reproduction ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. 

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />.

The '''Eastern Highlands''', also known as the '''Manica Highlands''', is a [[mountain range]] on the border of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Mozambique]]. The Eastern Highlands extend north and south for about {{convert|300|km|mi}} through Zimbabwe's [[Manicaland Province]] and Mozambique's [[Manica Province]].<ref name=\"EnZim\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Zimbabwe|publisher=Arlington Business Corporation|location=Worcester|date=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-9514505-0-6}}</ref>

==Geography==
The highlands consist of three main mountain groups – The Nyanga, Bvumba, and Chimanimani mountains - and several smaller ranges. The mountains are mostly sparsely populated, covered in rich grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests.<ref name=\"EnZim\" />

The [[Nyanga Mountains]] in the north contain Zimbabwe's highest mountain [[Mount Nyangani]] (2,592 m), and [[Mutarazi Falls]], Africa's second-longest waterfall. Zimbabwe's agricultural [[Honde Valley]] lies southeast of the Nyanga range, and leads into Mozambique.

[[Mutare]] is the largest city in the highlands. It is located on the Zimbabwean side of the Mutare Gap, a saddle between the Nyanga and Bvumba mountains. The main east-west road through the highlands is the [[R5 road (Zimbabwe)|A3]] (Zimbabwe) - N6 (Mozambique), which connects the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] in Mozambique to Zimbabwe's capital [[Harare]] via [[Chimoio]], [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]], and Mutare, with a border crossing at [[Machipanda]]. The [[Beira–Bulawayo railway]] also crosses the highlands at Machipanda.

The [[Bvumba Mountains]] are centrally situated south of [[Mutare]]. They lie mostly in Zimbabwe, but a northeastern spur, Monte Vumba, reaches into Mozambique. Agricultural [[Burma Valley]] lies south and east of the Bvumba Mountains. 

South of Burma Valley, the Tsetsera, Gweni, and Tandara plateaus lie along the border, separated by east-west river valleys lying in fault rifts.<ref>Lister, L.A. (1987). \"The Erosion Surfaces of Zimbabwe\". Zimbabwe Geological Survey Bulletin #90.</ref><ref>Ghiurghi, Andrea & Dondeyne, S. & Bannerman, J.. (2010). Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>

The [[Chimanimani Mountains]] lie south of the Mussapa Pequeno River, which divides them from the Tandara plateau. The Chimanimani range consists of a high plateau with several ridges running north and south. [[Monte Binga]] on the border is the highest peak in Mozambique and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. Mussapa Gap is a pass through the mountains that follows the eastward-flowing Mussapa Grande River and westward-flowing Nyanyadzi River. Mussapa Gap was an important trade and migration route through the higlands for centuries.<ref>Ghiurghi, Andrea & Dondeyne, S. & Bannerman, J.. (2010). Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>

The Rusitu-Tanganda fault, an east-west rift that carries the eastward-flowing Rusitu River and the westward flowing Tanganda River, marks the southern end of the Chimanimani Mountains. A hilly upland extends south from the fault into Chipinge District, and the highest point is [[Mount Selinda]] at 1230 meters.<Mapure, Isaac (2012). \"Determinants of vegetation composition and diversity of a moist forest-savanna boundary in south-eastern Zimbabwe\". International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation Vol. 4(14), pp. 584-591, November, 2012</ref>

The Eastern Highlands are part of the '''East African Highlands''', one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands|Abyssinian]] physiographic provinces, part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]]. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as [[Afromontane]] flora and fauna.

==Climate==
The Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains. The northern portion is drained by tributaries of the  [[Zambezi River]], while the southern portion is drained by tributaries of the [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]].<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\">\"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic\". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]</ref> The eastern slope is drained by Mozambique's [[Buzi River (Mozambique)|Buzi]] and [[Pungwe River|Pungwe]] rivers.

The Highlands are home to the '''Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic''' [[ecoregion]]. The ecoregion includes the portion of the highlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Mountains, Bvumba Mountains, [[Chimanimani Mountains]], Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

The highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

==Flora==
Much of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

Some valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.

In the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

A number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.

==Fauna==
This variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' [[Sykes' monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus albogularis)'', [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''. Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1006|name=Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic}}</ref>

The highlands are also rich in birdlife<ref>Ian Sinclair, Birds of Southern Africa, Struik Publishers 1996</ref> including [[trumpeter hornbill]] ''(Bycanistes bucinator)'', [[Knysna turaco]] ''(Tauraco corythaix)'', [[purple-crested turaco]] ''(Tauraco porphyreolophus)'', [[crested guineafowl]] ''(Guttera pucherani)'' and [[crowned eagle]] ''(Stephanoaetus coronatus)''. Two species, the [[Chirinda apalis]] ''(Apalis chirindensis)'' and [[Roberts's warbler]] ''(Oreophilais robertsi)'', are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts's warbler inhabits the forest edge.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

The forests are also full of butterflies, most notably [[Papilio|swallowtails]] such as the emperor swallowtail ''([[Papilio ophidicephalus]])'' and the citrus swallowtail ''([[Papilio demodocus]])'' and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including [[skink]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, and [[snake]]s.
{{See also|Reptiles and frogs of the Eastern Highlands}}

==Threats and preservation==
The mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. 

Large areas of the highlands are protected, including [[Nyanga National Park]] in the Nyanga Mountains, [[Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve]] in the Bvumba Mountains, and Zimbabwe's 171km<sup>2</sup> [[Chimanimani National Park]] and Mozambique's [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] in the Chimanimani Mountains.

The '''Eastern Highlands''', also known as the '''Manica Highlands''', is a [[mountain range]] on the border of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Mozambique]]. The Eastern Highlands extend north and south for about {{convert|300|km|mi}} through Zimbabwe's [[Manicaland Province]] and Mozambique's [[Manica Province]].<ref name=\"EnZim\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Zimbabwe|publisher=Arlington Business Corporation|location=Worcester|date=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-9514505-0-6}}</ref>

==Geography==
The highlands consist of three main mountain groups – The Nyanga, Bvumba, and Chimanimani mountains - and several smaller ranges. The mountains are mostly sparsely populated, covered in rich grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests.<ref name=\"EnZim\" />

The [[Nyanga Mountains]] in the north contain Zimbabwe's highest mountain [[Mount Nyangani]] (2,592 m), and [[Mutarazi Falls]], Africa's second-longest waterfall. Zimbabwe's agricultural [[Honde Valley]] lies southeast of the Nyanga range, and leads into Mozambique.

[[Mutare]] is the largest city in the highlands. It is located on the Zimbabwean side of the Mutare Gap, a saddle between the Nyanga and Bvumba mountains. The main east-west road through the highlands is the [[R5 road (Zimbabwe)|A3]] (Zimbabwe) - N6 (Mozambique), which connects the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] in Mozambique to Zimbabwe's capital [[Harare]] via [[Chimoio]], [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]], and Mutare, with a border crossing at [[Machipanda]]. The [[Beira–Bulawayo railway]] also crosses the highlands at Machipanda.

The [[Bvumba Mountains]] are centrally situated south of [[Mutare]]. They lie mostly in Zimbabwe, but a northeastern spur, Monte Vumba, reaches into Mozambique. Agricultural [[Burma Valley]] lies south and east of the Bvumba Mountains. 

South of Burma Valley, the Tsetsera, Gweni, and Tandara plateaus lie along the border, separated by east-west river valleys lying in fault rifts.<ref>Lister, L.A. (1987). \"The Erosion Surfaces of Zimbabwe\". Zimbabwe Geological Survey Bulletin #90.</ref><ref>Ghiurghi, Andrea & Dondeyne, S. & Bannerman, J.. (2010). Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>

The [[Chimanimani Mountains]] lie south of the Mussapa Pequeno River, which divides them from the Tandara plateau. The Chimanimani range consists of a high plateau with several ridges running north and south. [[Monte Binga]] on the border is the highest peak in Mozambique and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. Mussapa Gap is a pass through the mountains that follows the eastward-flowing Mussapa Grande River and westward-flowing Nyanyadzi River. Mussapa Gap was an important trade and migration route through the higlands for centuries.<ref>Ghiurghi, Andrea & Dondeyne, S. & Bannerman, J.. (2010). Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>

The Rusitu-Tanganda fault, an east-west rift that carries the eastward-flowing Rusitu River and the westward flowing Tanganda River, marks the southern end of the Chimanimani Mountains. A hilly upland extends south from the fault into Chipinge District, and the highest point is [[Mount Selinda]] at 1230 meters.

The Eastern Highlands are part of the '''East African Highlands''', one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands|Abyssinian]] physiographic provinces, part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]]. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as [[Afromontane]] flora and fauna.

==Climate==
The Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains. The northern portion is drained by tributaries of the  [[Zambezi River]], while the southern portion is drained by tributaries of the [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]].<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\">\"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic\". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]</ref> The eastern slope is drained by Mozambique's [[Buzi River (Mozambique)|Buzi]] and [[Pungwe River|Pungwe]] rivers.

The Highlands are home to the '''Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic''' [[ecoregion]]. The ecoregion includes the portion of the highlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Mountains, Bvumba Mountains, [[Chimanimani Mountains]], Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

The highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

==Flora==
Much of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

Some valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.

In the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

A number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.

==Fauna==
This variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' [[Sykes' monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus albogularis)'', [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''. Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1006|name=Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic}}</ref>

The highlands are also rich in birdlife<ref>Ian Sinclair, Birds of Southern Africa, Struik Publishers 1996</ref> including [[trumpeter hornbill]] ''(Bycanistes bucinator)'', [[Knysna turaco]] ''(Tauraco corythaix)'', [[purple-crested turaco]] ''(Tauraco porphyreolophus)'', [[crested guineafowl]] ''(Guttera pucherani)'' and [[crowned eagle]] ''(Stephanoaetus coronatus)''. Two species, the [[Chirinda apalis]] ''(Apalis chirindensis)'' and [[Roberts's warbler]] ''(Oreophilais robertsi)'', are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts's warbler inhabits the forest edge.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>

The forests are also full of butterflies, most notably [[Papilio|swallowtails]] such as the emperor swallowtail ''([[Papilio ophidicephalus]])'' and the citrus swallowtail ''([[Papilio demodocus]])'' and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including [[skink]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, and [[snake]]s.
{{See also|Reptiles and frogs of the Eastern Highlands}}

==Threats and preservation==
The mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. 

Large areas of the highlands are protected, including [[Nyanga National Park]] in the Nyanga Mountains, [[Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve]] in the Bvumba Mountains, and Zimbabwe's 171km<sup>2</sup> [[Chimanimani National Park]] and Mozambique's [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] in the Chimanimani Mountains. The Chimanimani park and reserve together form the core of the Chimanimani Transfrontier Conservation Area.

Max Bell of ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' critically lauded the album, giving high praise to the band's pension for \"hardcore rock music with clever lyrics, brilliant guitar playing and superb vocals.\"<ref name=ClassicRock/> Carl Purvis of No Ripcord commented on the band's musicianship throughout the record, finding bassist Dave Beste's chemistry with drummer Michael Miley \"every bit as conversant as the original pairing\", praising the trademark grooves created by guitarist Scott Holiday's \"endless conveyor belt of pulverizing riffs\" and being impressed by Jay Buchanan's vocal performance for having \"the range of [[Chris Cornell]] and the soul of [[Bill Withers]].\"<ref name=NoRipcord/> [[AllMusic]]'s Thom Jurek also praised the musicians for crafting tracks with various aesthetics that are influenced by their \"worship of late-'60s psych, blues-rock, and hard rock\", concluding that \"''Great Western Valkyrie'' continues to revel in retro-rock, but it does so with fine songwriting, arrangements, and -- above all -- taste added to the instrumental firepower. Combined, these strengths make this a full step up from ''[[Head Down (Rival Sons album)|Head Down]]''.\"<ref name=AM/>

==Chart performance==
''Great Western Valkyrie'' charted within the top 40 of several countries, surpassing what ''Head Down'' achieved. The album debuted at numbers 3 and 5 in Finland and Norway respectively, ten and nine spots higher than their previous album.<ref name=AC>{{cite web|url=https://acharts.co/album/86238|title=Great Western Valkyrie - Rival Sons|website=aCharts.co|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}</ref> It also debuted at numbers 12 and 14 in Switzerland and the UK respectively (whereas their previous record charted at numbers 30 and 31 respectively).<ref name=AC/> However, it fared less better in Austria, the Netherlands and France, entering at numbers 41, 55 and 60 respectively for one week.<ref name=AC/>

Max Bell of ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' critically lauded the album, giving high praise to the band's pension for \"hardcore rock music with clever lyrics, brilliant guitar playing and superb vocals.\"<ref name=ClassicRock/> Carl Purvis of No Ripcord commented on the band's musicianship throughout the record, finding bassist Dave Beste's chemistry with drummer Michael Miley \"every bit as conversant as the original pairing\", praising the trademark grooves created by guitarist Scott Holiday's \"endless conveyor belt of pulverizing riffs\" and being impressed by Jay Buchanan's vocal performance for having \"the range of [[Chris Cornell]] and the soul of [[Bill Withers]].\"<ref name=NoRipcord/> [[AllMusic]]'s Thom Jurek also praised the musicians for crafting tracks with various aesthetics that are influenced by their \"worship of late-'60s psych, blues-rock, and hard rock\", concluding that \"''Great Western Valkyrie'' continues to revel in retro-rock, but it does so with fine songwriting, arrangements, and -- above all -- taste added to the instrumental firepower. Combined, these strengths make this a full step up from ''[[Head Down (Rival Sons album)|Head Down]]''.\"<ref name=AM/>

==Chart performance==
''Great Western Valkyrie'' charted within the top 40 of several countries, surpassing what ''Head Down'' achieved. The album debuted at numbers 3 and 5 in Finland and Norway respectively, ten and nine spots higher than their previous album.<ref name=AC>{{cite web|url=https://acharts.co/album/86238|title=Great Western Valkyrie - Rival Sons|website=aCharts.co|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}</ref> It also debuted at numbers 12 and 14 in Switzerland and the UK respectively (whereas their previous record charted at numbers 30 and 31 respectively).<ref name=AC/> However, it fared less better in Austria, the Netherlands and France, entering at numbers 41, 55 and 60 respectively for one week.<ref name=AC/>

'''Dissanayake Mudiyanse Ralahamilage Lionel Gamini Dissanayake''' (known as '''Gamini Dissanayake'''; {{lang-si|ලයනල් ගාමිණි දිසානායක}},{{lang-ta|காமினி திஸாநாயக்க}}; 20 March 1942 – 24 October 1994) was a prominent Sri Lankan politician, a powerful minister of the [[United National Party]], and [[Leader of the Opposition (Sri Lanka)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He was designated as the UNP candidate in the [[1994 Sri Lankan presidential election|1994 presidential election]], but was then assassinated by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE).

==Early Life==
He was born in [[Kandy]] as the eldest son of a family of seven children to [[Andrew Dissanayake]] who served as an MP and a deputy minister in the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] government of [[Solomon Bandaranaike|S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]]. His mother, Welegedara Samaratunga Kumarihamy of Kotmale. Born and bred in Kotmale, his basic values were cultivated in this rural milieu social surrounding and environment. The wealthy Dissanayake family resided in both [[Kandy]] as well as [[Nuwara Eliya]]. Dissanayake had his schooling at the prestigious [[Trinity College (Kandy)|Trinity College]] in Kandy, and received his tertiary education at the [[Sri Lanka Law College]]. Later in life, he completed an MPhil Degree in International Relations at [[Cambridge University]] UK.

==Political career==
Gamini Dissanayake won the 1970 elections and became a member of parliament under UNP candidature and was one of the 18 UNP members in the parliament at a time when his party has faced an humiliating defeat. He comfortably secured his Nuwaraeliya-Maskeliya multielectorate seat in the 1977 elections and was appointed as the minister of Mahaweli Development. Dissanyake spearheaded the [[Mahaweli Development programme|Mahaweli Development Project]]. This was a huge project which was expected to take 30 years to finish. But due to Dissanayake's skills he managed to finish the project within 6 years. The Mahaweli Development Project is the largest development project conducted in Sri Lanka after independence. The whole country was affected by the project which focused on irrigation, hydro power generation, agriculture, town & country development. Further it was criticised by the time as to introduce sinhala population into Tamil's motherland. Majority of the power generated for the local consumption is generated from these hydropower plants while an overwhelming majority of the rice cultivation in Sri Lanka is conducted in these [[Mahaweli]] areas.

He was the chairperson of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the early 1980s and helped his country to gain the Test Status in cricket. He played a pivotal role in signing the Indoo-Lanka Peace Accord in 1987. In 1989 he was re elected as a MP from Nuwaraeliya District securing the highest percentage of preferential votes obtained by any UNP MP. He was the Minister of Estate Development during Premadasa regime. He was not awarded a portfolio in 1990 cabinet reshuffle and remained as a back-seat MP in the parliament. Dissanayake was accused of abduction of Prof. Ralph Bultjens. Prof Rohan Goonarathne in an interview with Hasitha Kuruppu told that Dissanayake did that as Bultjens in his lectures accused Dissanayake for swindling of money.<ref>GunaratnaRohan. Interview with Hasitha Kuruppu. Ceylontoday. November 2013</ref> Later he was acquitted from the courts.

He played a major role in the aborted impeachment motion against President Premadasa and as a result was expelled from UNP in 1992. In the same year Dissanayaka joined Lalith Athulathmudali to form United National Democratic Front (DUNF) which was a rising political force of that era. Dissanayaka contested to Kandy District at 1993 provincial council elections and became a member of the Central Provincial Council. After the assassination of Athulathmudali, Dissanayake became the leader of DUNF. Later he rejoined UNP and was appointed to the parliament as a national list MP and was offered a vital portfolio in the Wijethunga Government. In 1994 PA came to power defeating UNP when Dissanayaka was re elected as a member of parliament from Kandy District. In a contest held among UNP MPs to choose the opposition leader Dissanayaka recorded a comfortable victory over Ranil Wickramasinghe.

==Assassination==
When President [[Dingiri Banda Wijetunga|D.B. Wijetunga]] indicated he would not run in the [[1994 Sri Lankan presidential election|1994 presidential election]], Dissanayake was selected as the UNP candidate at the same time he was the Leader of the Opposition in parliament.  This was cut short when he was assassinated by a [[female suicide bomber]] of the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) while he was addressing an election meeting at Thotalanga.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/sentinel/sent000904_6_n.shtml Jane's Sentinel examines the success of the LTTE in resisting the Sri Lankan forces]</ref> Government of India deputed Salim Ali IPS of CBI and [[Tirath Das Dogra|Professor T D Dogra]] of All India Institute of Medical Sciences to assist the investigations of Gamini Dissanayake's assassination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1994/Widow-Wants-Indian-Experts-To-Investigate-Assassination/id-a2700b4b6ccdb52a206b5f20f517c66f|title=WIDOW WANTS INDIAN EXPERTS TO INVESTIGATE ASSASSINATION|last=|first=|date=31 October 1994 <!-- 5:07 AM ET -->|website=|publisher=AP|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> His wife Srima Dissanayake ran in his stead, but was defeated by [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance]] candidate and Prime Minister [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]].

He has two sons, who are active in politics, Navin and Mayantha. His eldest son [[Navin Dissanayake|Navin]] was the Cabinet Minister of State Management Reforms in President [[Mahinda Rajapakse]]'s Government and Member of Parliament for [[Nuwara Eliya District]]; he was non-cabinet Minister of Investment Promotion too.  [[Mayantha Dissanayake|Mayantha]] contested for the [[2010 Sri Lankan parliamentary election|2010 General Election]] for [[Kandy District]] as a UNP candidate.

==Political career==
Gamini Dissanayake won the 1970 elections and became a member of parliament under UNP candidature and was among one of the 18 UNP members in the parliament at a time when his party has faced an humiliating defeat. He comfortably secured his Nuwaraeliya-Maskeliya multielectorate seat in the 1977 elections and was appointed as the minister of Mahaweli Development. Dissanyake spearheaded the [[Mahaweli Development programme|Mahaweli Development Project]]. This was a huge project which was expected to take 30 years to finish. But due to Dissanayake's skills he managed to finish the project within 6 years. The Mahaweli Development Project is the largest development project conducted in Sri Lanka after independence. The whole country was affected by the project which focused on irrigation, hydro power generation, agriculture, town & country development. Further it was criticised by the time as to introduce sinhala population into Tamil's motherland. Majority of the power generated for the local consumption is generated from these hydropower plants while an overwhelming majority of the rice cultivation in Sri Lanka is conducted in these [[Mahaweli]] areas.

He was the chairperson of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the early 1980s and helped his country to gain the Test Status in cricket. He played a pivotal role in signing the Indoo-Lanka Peace Accord in 1987. In 1989 he was re elected as a MP from Nuwaraeliya District securing the highest percentage of preferential votes obtained by any UNP MP. He was the Minister of Estate Development during Premadasa regime. He was not awarded a portfolio in 1990 cabinet reshuffle and remained as a back-seat MP in the parliament. Dissanayake was accused of abduction of Prof. Ralph Bultjens. Prof Rohan Goonarathne in an interview with Hasitha Kuruppu told that Dissanayake did that as Bultjens in his lectures accused Dissanayake for swindling of money.<ref>GunaratnaRohan. Interview with Hasitha Kuruppu. Ceylontoday. November 2013</ref> Later he was acquitted from the courts.

He played a major role in the aborted impeachment motion against President Premadasa and as a result was expelled from UNP in 1992. In the same year Dissanayaka joined Lalith Athulathmudali to form United National Democratic Front (DUNF) which was a rising political force of that era. Dissanayaka contested to Kandy District at 1993 provincial council elections and became a member of the Central Provincial Council. After the assassination of Athulathmudali, Dissanayake became the leader of DUNF. Later he rejoined UNP and was appointed to the parliament as a national list MP and was offered a vital portfolio in the Wijethunga Government. In 1994 PA came to power defeating UNP when Dissanayaka was re elected as a member of parliament from Kandy District. In a contest held among UNP MPs to choose the opposition leader Dissanayaka recorded a comfortable victory over Ranil Wickramasinghe.

==Assassination==
When President [[Dingiri Banda Wijetunga|D.B. Wijetunga]] indicated he would not run in the [[1994 Sri Lankan presidential election|1994 presidential election]], Dissanayake was selected as the UNP candidate at the same time he was the Leader of the Opposition in parliament.  This was cut short when he was assassinated by a [[female suicide bomber]] of the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) while he was addressing an election meeting at Thotalanga.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/sentinel/sent000904_6_n.shtml Jane's Sentinel examines the success of the LTTE in resisting the Sri Lankan forces]</ref> Government of India deputed Salim Ali IPS of CBI and [[Tirath Das Dogra|Professor T D Dogra]] of All India Institute of Medical Sciences to assist the investigations of Gamini Dissanayake's assassination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1994/Widow-Wants-Indian-Experts-To-Investigate-Assassination/id-a2700b4b6ccdb52a206b5f20f517c66f|title=WIDOW WANTS INDIAN EXPERTS TO INVESTIGATE ASSASSINATION|last=|first=|date=31 October 1994 <!-- 5:07 AM ET -->|website=|publisher=AP|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> His wife Srima Dissanayake ran in his stead, but was defeated by [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance]] candidate and Prime Minister [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]].

He has two sons, who are active in politics, Navin and Mayantha. His eldest son [[Navin Dissanayake|Navin]] was the Cabinet Minister of State Management Reforms in President [[Mahinda Rajapakse]]'s Government and Member of Parliament for [[Nuwara Eliya District]]; he was non-cabinet Minister of Investment Promotion too.  [[Mayantha Dissanayake|Mayantha]] contested for the [[2010 Sri Lankan parliamentary election|2010 General Election]] for [[Kandy District]] as a UNP candidate.
