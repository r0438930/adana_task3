The neighbourhood is a sub-district of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]], the major component of the [[London Borough of Hackney]], and is known for its Jewish [[Hasidic Judaism|Chasidic]] community, the largest concentration of [[Haredi|Charedi]] Hasidic Jews in Europe.\n\nThe district takes its name from the eponymous hill, which reaches a height of 33m [[Ordnance datum|AOD]],<ref>Archaeological Study of Hackney, see page 3 https://content.historicengland.org.uk/content/docs/planning/apa-hackney.pdf</ref> and the [[Ermine Street|originally Roman A10]] also takes the name \u2018Stamford Hill\u2019 as it makes its way through the area.\n\nThe hill is believed<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol10/pp38-44|title=Hackney: Newington and Stamford Hill - British History Online|website=British-history.ac.uk}}</ref> to be named after the ford where the A10 crossed the [[Hackney Brook]] on the southern edge of the hill.

B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|right|A map showing the Stamford Hill ward of Hackney Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.]]\nStamford Hill lies on the old [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] road of [[Ermine Street]], on the high ground where it meets the Clapton Road which runs from [[Hackney Central|central Hackney]]. By the 18th century, the Roman road (now numbered as the A10) was subject to heavy traffic, including goods wagons pulled by six or more horses, and this caused the surface of the road to deteriorate. The local parishes appealed to Parliament in 1713 for the right to set up a [[Turnpike trust|Turnpike Trust]], to pay for repairs and maintenance. Gates were installed at [[Kingsland, London|Kingsland]] and Stamford Hill to collect the tolls.<ref>[http://www.brickfields.org.uk/text/georgian-transport.html ''Georgian Transport''] (Brickfields Spitalfields) accessed 18 May 2009</ref>\n\n[[John Roque|Roque's]] map of 1745 shows a handful of buildings around the Turnpike, and by 1795 the A10 was lined with the large homes and extensive grounds of wealthy financiers and merchants attracted, in part, by the elevated position.<ref name=\"auto\">The London Encyclopaedia, Weinreb and Hibbert, 1983</ref>\n\nStamford Hill had a [[gibbet]], that was used to display the remains of criminals, executed at [[Tyburn]] in the 1740s.

[[Italy|Italian]]-born Moses Vita Montefiore (died 1789) was living there in 1763. His son Joseph (died 1804) married Rachel Mocatta, and his grandson Abraham Montefiore (died 1824) married Henrietta whose father, the financier [[Nathan Meyer Rothschild]], lived near the modern Colberg Place from 1818 to 1835. The Montefiores' property a little further south was to be transformed by Abraham's grandson, Claude Montefiore, into Montefiore House school.

In 1926, the [[Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations]] was established in Stamford Hill, and this became a magnet for other strictly observant Jews, many fleeing [[Nazi]] persecution in the years before the [[Second World War]].<ref name=brithist/> Also, many Jewish families came to the area from other areas of London, refugees in their own way from bombing and post-war clearances for new housing. One of the early Hasidic leaders in Stamford Hill was the [[Shotzer Rebbe]]. The [[Hungarian revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] also led to an influx of Haredi Jews fleeing hardship under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. Another notable Jewish resident from 1955 until his death in 2000, was the spiritual head of the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, Rabbi [[Chanoch Dov Padwa]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Governance==\nStamford Hill has never been an administrative area in its own right; it has always been an area of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. Hackney was an administrative unit with consistent boundaries from the early Middle Ages to the creation of the larger modern borough in 1965. Hackney was based for many centuries on the [[Civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]]\n\nParishes in [[Middlesex]] were grouped into [[Hundred (county division)|Hundreds]], with Hackney part of [[Ossulstone]] Hundred. Rapid Population growth around London saw the Hundred split into several 'Divisions' during the 1600s, with Hackney part of the [[Tower division|Tower Division (aka Tower Hamlets)]]. The [[Tower division|Tower Division]] was noteworthy in that the men of the area owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] - and had done even before the creation of the Division.<ref>The London Encyclopaedia, 4th Edition, 1983, Weinreb and Hibbert</ref>\n \nThe Ancient Parishes provided a framework for both civil (administrative) and ecclesiastical (church) functions, but during the nineteenth century there was a divergence into distinct civil and ecclesiastical parish systems. In London the Ecclesiastical Parishes sub-divided to better serve the needs of a growing population, while the Civil Parishes continued to be based on the same Ancient Parish areas.\n\nThe [[London Government Act 1899]] converted the parishes into [[Metropolitan Borough]]s based on the same boundaries, sometimes with minor rationalisations.  \nIn 1965, [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] merged with [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch|Shoreditch]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington]] to form the new [[London Borough of Hackney]].\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe area's usual definition is based on the physical feature of the hill and the neighbourhood's location within the [[Hackney (parish)|Ancient Parish]] and subsequent (with almost identical boundaries) [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney]].<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\" /> Reflecting that the [[Ermine Street|originally Roman A10]] also takes the name \u2018Stamford Hill\u2019 as goes over the hill between the brook and the borough boundary.\n\n'''Northern boundary with [[Tottenham]]:''' Takes the northern boundary of the [[Hackney (parish)|AP]]\\[[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|MB]] of Hackney. This corresponds to the current boundary between the [[London Borough of Hackney|modern borough of Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]].\n\n'''Western boundary with [[Stoke Newington]]:''' Takes part of the [[Hackney (parish)|AP]]\\[[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|MB]] of Hackney's boundary with the [[Stoke Newington (parish)|AP]]\\[[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|MB]] of Stoke Newington along Bethune Road and down to the A10.<ref>Describes Stoke Newingtons boundaries with Hackney and other neighbours https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol8/pp139-140</ref>\n\n'''Southern Boundary with [[West Hackney]]:''' The east-west course of the [[Hackney Brook]], which may have been as wide as 22m at this point,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locallocalhistory.co.uk/gsn/page07.htm|title=Hackney Brook|website=www.locallocalhistory.co.uk|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> provided a natural southern boundary for the district, however the river was culverted and it is now difficult to discern its former course on the ground. This has led to very ambiguous boundary, along its former course, in the Cazenove\\Northwold Road area.\n\n'''East and south-east boundary with [[Upper Clapton]]:''' [[Upper Clapton]] is also part of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] and shares much of the eastern side of the hill. There is little tradition of a particular border. The [[London postal districts|post code boundary]] is sometimes used but this is arbitrary: post code areas are not intended to define districts.\n\n== Demography ==\nThe high fertility of the Haredi community contributes to the area having one of highest birthrates in the UK, with a [[crude birth rate]] of more than 25 per 1,000 of the population, twice the UK average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_333877.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ward Level Mid-Year Population Estimates (experimental), Mid-2012|website=One.gov.uk|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe data table shows ONS Census data<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/asv2xls.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922120621/http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/asv2xls.aspx |archive-date=22 September 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> for the wards around Stamford Hill, where respondents indicated a religion:<ref>In the 2011 UK census, respondents were voluntarily asked to identify their religion.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

By the 18th century, the Roman road (now numbered as the A10) was subject to heavy traffic, including goods wagons pulled by six or more horses, and this caused the surface of the road to deteriorate. The local parishes appealed to Parliament in 1713 for the right to set up a [[Turnpike trust|Turnpike Trust]], to pay for repairs and maintenance. Gates were installed at [[Kingsland, London|Kingsland]] and Stamford Hill to collect the tolls.<ref>[http://www.brickfields.org.uk/text/georgian-transport.html ''Georgian Transport''] (Brickfields Spitalfields) accessed 18 May 2009</ref>\n\n[[John Roque|Roque's]] map of 1745 shows a handful of buildings around the Turnpike, and by 1795 the A10 was lined with the large homes and extensive grounds of wealthy financiers and merchants attracted, in part, by the elevated position.<ref name=\"auto\">The London Encyclopaedia, Weinreb and Hibbert, 1983</ref>\n\nStamford Hill had a [[gibbet]], that was used to display the remains of criminals, executed at [[Tyburn]] in the 1740s.

Another notable Jewish resident from 1955 until his death in 2000, was the spiritual head of the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, Rabbi [[Chanoch Dov Padwa]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Governance==\nStamford Hill has never been an administrative area in its own right; it has always been an area of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. Hackney was an administrative unit with consistent boundaries from the early Middle Ages to the creation of the larger modern borough in 1965. Hackney was based for many centuries on the [[Civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]]\n\nParishes in [[Middlesex]] were grouped into [[Hundred (county division)|Hundreds]], with Hackney part of [[Ossulstone]] Hundred. Rapid Population growth around London saw the Hundred split into several 'Divisions' during the 1600s, with Hackney part of the [[Tower division|Tower Division (aka Tower Hamlets)]]. The [[Tower division|Tower Division]] was noteworthy in that the men of the area owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] - and had done even before the creation of the Division.<ref>The London Encyclopaedia, 4th Edition, 1983, Weinreb and Hibbert</ref>\n \nThe Ancient Parishes provided a framework for both civil (administrative) and ecclesiastical (church) functions, but during the nineteenth century there was a divergence into distinct civil and ecclesiastical parish systems. In London the Ecclesiastical Parishes sub-divided to better serve the needs of a growing population, while the Civil Parishes continued to be based on the same Ancient Parish areas.\n\nThe [[London Government Act 1899]] converted the parishes into [[Metropolitan Borough]]s based on the same boundaries, sometimes with minor rationalisations.  \nIn 1965, [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] merged with [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch|Shoreditch]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington]] to form the new [[London Borough of Hackney]].\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe area's usual definition is based on the physical feature of the hill and the neighbourhood's location within the [[Hackney (parish)|Ancient Parish]] and subsequent (with almost identical boundaries) [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney]].<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\" /> Reflecting that the [[Ermine Street|originally Roman A10]] also takes the name \u2018Stamford Hill\u2019 as goes over the hill between the brook and the borough boundary.\n\n'''Northern boundary with [[Tottenham]]:''' Takes the northern boundary of the [[Hackney (parish)|AP]]\\[[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|MB]] of Hackney. This corresponds to the current boundary between the [[London Borough of Hackney|modern borough of Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]].\n\n'''Western boundary with [[Stoke Newington]]:''' Takes part of the [[Hackney (parish)|AP]]\\[[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|MB]] of Hackney's boundary with the [[Stoke Newington (parish)|AP]]\\[[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|MB]] of Stoke Newington along Bethune Road and down to the A10.<ref>Describes Stoke Newingtons boundaries with Hackney and other neighbours https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol8/pp139-140</ref>\n\n'''Southern Boundary with [[West Hackney]]:''' The east-west course of the [[Hackney Brook]], which may have been as wide as 22m at this point,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locallocalhistory.co.uk/gsn/page07.htm|title=Hackney Brook|website=www.locallocalhistory.co.uk|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> provided a natural southern boundary for the district, however the river was culverted and it is now difficult to discern its former course on the ground. This has led to very ambiguous boundary, along its former course, in the Cazenove\\Northwold Road area.\n\n'''East and south-east boundary with [[Upper Clapton]]:''' [[Upper Clapton]] is also part of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] and shares much of the eastern side of the hill.
