He was the son of statesman [[Jos\u00e9 Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco|Jos\u00e9 Maria da Silva Paranhos Sr]]. The Baron of Rio Branco was a member of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]], occupying its 34th chair from 1898 until his death in 1912. As a representative of Brazil, through his diplomacy, he managed to peacefully resolve Brazil's border disputes with its South American neighbours\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nJos\u00e9 Paranhos  J\u00fanior was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1845, as son of [[Jos\u00e9 Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco|Jos\u00e9 Maria da Silva Paranhos Sr, Viscount of Rio Branco]], future [[Prime Minister of Brazil]] and famous statesman and his wife, Teresa de Figueiredo Faria. He began his work in the letters in 1863, in the pages of the ''Popular magazine'', with a biography on Lu\u00eds Barroso Pereira, commander of the frigate ''Imperatriz''. Later, in 1866, in the magazine [[L'Illustration]], he drew and wrote about the [[Paraguayan War]], defending the point of view of Brazil. In 1868, he replaced for three months [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]] as lecturer of Chorography and History of Brazil, in [[Col\u00e9gio Pedro II]].\n\n===The diplomacy===\n[[File:DECRETO RA BRASIL 1902.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Decree of President [[Rodrigues Alves]], naming Rio Branco to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 1902.]]\nHe began his political career as a promoter and deputy, still in the Empire. In 1871 he was editor in the newspaper ''A Na\u00e7\u00e3o'', having collaborated, from 1891, in ''[[Jornal do Brasil]]''.\n\nHe became [[Consul General]] in [[Liverpool]] from 1876, was accredited minister in [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1900, taking over the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] from 3 December 1902 until his death in 1912. He held the position throughout the term of four presidents of the republic - the governments of [[Rodrigues Alves]], [[Afonso Pena]], [[Nilo Pe\u00e7anha]] and [[Hermes da Fonseca]] - forming a national unanimity in their time.\n\nHe received the title of Baron of Rio Branco on the eve of the end of the imperial period, but continued to use the title in his signature even after the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|proclamation of the republic]] in 1889. This was due to being a convinced monarchist and to honor his late father, the senator and diplomat Jos\u00e9 Maria da Silva Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco.\n\n===Nobleman===\n[[File:Bar\u00e3o do Rio Branco (fotografia).jpg|thumb|180px|The Baron of Rio Branco in 1875.]]\nIn 1889, Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] granted him the [[Brazilian nobility]] title ''[[Baron of Rio Branco]]'' (Bar\u00e3o do Rio Branco), a few days before the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]]. Rio Branco  continued to use the title throughout his life, despite governmental prohibition, because of his monarchist beliefs {{refnec|and in respect for his father|date=September 2017}}. Being a [[monarchist]], however, was no impediment for his success as a diplomat: the Baron of Rio Branco reached the heights of his career during the Republic, when he acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs for 10 years and settled all of Brazil's remaining border disputes by peaceful means.\n\n===Last years===\n\nSuffering from kidney problems, he resigned his post, which was denied by President [[Hermes da Fonseca]].\nIn his last moments of life, he lamented the bombing of the capital of [[Bahia]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], motivated by a political crisis and occurred on 10 January 1912.\n\nHis death, during the [[carnival]] of 1912, altered the calendar of the popular feast that year, given the official mourning and the intense tributes that honored him in the city of Rio de Janeiro. His body was buried in the grave of his father, in the [[Caju Cemetery]] in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nRio Branco is considered the patron of [[Foreign relations of Brazil|Brazilian diplomacy]].{{fact|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Career history and legacy==\n\nRio Branco began his political career as a congressman in the House of Commons. From 1876 on, he was the Brazilian Consul General in Liverpool, England. He was also the Brazilian Ambassador in Berlin in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nRio Branco's most important legacy to Brazil was his successful effort, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, in defining the country's borders with all of its neighbours. He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1902 and retained office until 1912, under four different Presidents, a feat unequalled in Brazilian history.\n\nBefore and during his term, he negotiated territorial disputes between Brazil and some of its neighbours and consolidated the borders of modern Brazil. He is considered one of the most prominent Brazilian statesmen ever, as his proverbial work capacity, knowledge and skills were essential for the successful outcome of difficult boundary disputes, some of which submitted to international arbitration \u2013 such as with [[Argentina]] and [[France]] \u2013, as well as for incorporating new territory (the state of Acre, originally Bolivian).\n\nAs a mediator he negotiated and settled disputes between the [[United States]] and many European countries. On those occasions, he never abandoned his belief in diplomacy as the means to handle international matters, thus helping establish Brazil's reputation as a peace-loving nation.\n\n==Resolved boundary disputes==\n[[File:Baraodoriobranco.gif|thumb|right|180px|Picture of Rio Branco in the 1890s]]\n===Border question with France===\nRio Branco obtained a victory over [[French Third Republic|France]] on the border of [[Amap\u00e1]] with [[French Guiana]], cause won by Brazil in 1900 in an arbitration of the Swiss government. The border was defined in the river Oiapoque.\n\n===Treaty of Petr\u00f3polis with Bolivia===\n\nIn 1903 Rio Branco signed the [[Treaty of Petr\u00f3polis]] with [[Bolivia]], putting an end to the dispute involving the present Brazilian state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]]. The region was settled mostly by native Brazilians, but the Bolivian government had come close to leasing this rubber-rich area to American private entrepreneurs. Today, the state's capital bears the name Rio Branco in his honor.\n\n===Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty with Ecuador===\n\nThe representative of [[Brazil]], Don Jos\u00e9 Maria da Silva Paranhos, who was Baron of Rio Branco met the representative of [[Ecuador]], Dr. Carlos R. Tobar, in the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], to peacefully discuss a final border between their countries. On May 6, 1904, an agreement was reached and the two representatives signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty, in which [[Ecuador]] renounced its claims to the  disputed area between the [[Caquet\u00e1 River]] and the [[Amazon river]] in favour of [[Brazil]], in return Brazil recognized Ecuador as its neighbour. The border would be a straight line that starts midpoint between the cities of [[Tabatinga]], Brazil and [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]], Colombia, on the Amazon River and runs north until it reaches the Caquet\u00e1 River, also known as the [[Japur\u00e1 River]].\n\n===Other success===\n\nRio Branco has negotiated with [[Uruguay]] the condominium on the Rio [[Jaguar\u00e3o]] and [[Lagoon Mirim]], essentially a voluntary concession from Brazil to a neighbor who needed those channels. For this reason, he was honored by the government of Uruguay, and his name was given to the old Pueblo Artigas, now the city of [[R\u00edo Branco, Uruguay|R\u00edo Branco]], in the department of [[Cerro Largo Department|Cerro Largo]], near the Brazilian Jaguar\u00e3o.\n\n[[File:Bar\u00e3o do Rio Branco.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Statue of Rio Branco in [[Porto Alegre]].]]\n\nThe municipality of [[Paranhos (Mato Grosso do Sul)|Paranhos]], in [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], located on the border with Paraguay was baptized in his honor.\nIn 1908, then in Rio de Janeiro, he invited the engineer Augusto Ferreira Ramos to design a cable car system that would facilitate access to the summit of Morro da Urca, known worldwide as the [[Sugarloaf Mountain|Sugar Loaf]].\nIn 1909, his name was suggested for the presidential succession of the following year. Rio Branco preferred to decline any candidacy that was not of national unanimity.\n\nHe was president of the [[Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute]] (1907-1912) and wrote two books.\n\nHis son, [[Paulo do Rio Branco]], was a prominent French-born Brazilian rugby player.\n\n==Popularity==\n\nIn 1909, Rio Branco was encouraged to run for the Presidency, but he declined, as he could not envisage consensus around his name. He was very popular, however, among the people, at the time of his death, to the point of paralysing [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] \u2013 another unparalleled feat in Brazilian history \u2013 on the day he died (February 10), when official mourning was declared. The first recorded instance of an official [[moment of silence]] dedicated to a person's death took place in Portugal on February 13, 1912. The Portuguese Senate dedicated 10 minutes of silence to the baron. This moment of silence was registered in the Senate's records of that day.\n\nAs a writer he wrote many books, dealing mostly with the history of Brazil, and was awarded prizes and occupied the 34th seat of the Brazilian Academy of Literature.\n\nBrazil's diplomacy academy ([[Instituto Rio Branco]]) is named after the Baron. \nRio Branco is portrayed on the fifty centavos coin of the [[Brazilian real]] currency.\n\n==Honours==\n[[File:COA Baron of Rio Branco.svg|thumb|180px|Coat of arms of the Baron of Rio Branco]]\n*{{flag|Empire of Brazil}}:\n** Knight of the [[Order of the Southern Cross]]\n** Knight of the [[Order of the Rose]]\n*{{flag|Russian Empire}}: Knight of the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov)]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rio Branco, Acre]], capital city of the Brazilian [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Acre (state)|Acre]], named after the diplomat.\n* [[R\u00edo Branco, Uruguay]], a city also named after the Brazilian diplomat.\n\n==Further reading==\n*LINS, \u00c1lvaro.
