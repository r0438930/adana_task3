I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy,\" said Corgan in the ''Adore'' reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, \"he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style\u2014like [[honkytonk]]. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician.\"<ref>[[David Wild|Wild, David]]. \"'Adore' of Perceptions\", ''Adore'' reissue liner notes, 2014.

I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy,\" said Corgan in the ''Adore'' reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, \"he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style\u2014like [[honkytonk]]. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician.\"<ref>[[David Wild|Wild, David]]. \"'Adore' of Perceptions\", ''Adore'' reissue liner notes, 2014.
