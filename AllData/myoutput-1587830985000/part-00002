Companies A, B, and C organized at [[Camp Cameron]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in July and August 1862. The remaining seven companies were organized at [[Camp Stanton]] in [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts]] and mustered into service from August 20 to 22. Colonel Timothy Ingraham initially commanded the regiment.<ref>Bowen, 576.</ref>\n\nAfter two month's [[garrison]] duty in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], the regiment embarked for [[Louisiana]], being assigned to the [[Army of the Gulf]] which was commanded by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. The regiment saw its first combat during the [[Battle of Fort Bisland]] in southern Louisiana. During May and June 1863, the 38th Massachusetts took part in the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] and the assaults on that city on May 27 and June 14, suffering considerable casualties. After the surrender of Port Hudson on July 9, the regiment participated in the ill-fated [[Red River Campaign]].<ref>Bowen, 579.</ref>\n\nIn July 1864, the [[XIX Corps (Union Army)|XIX Corps]], of which the 38th Massachusetts was a part, was transferred to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] in [[Virginia]] and were attached to the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]]. The 38th Massachusetts was engaged in several battles of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], mostly notably the [[Third Battle of Winchester]] on September 19, 1864 and the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]] on October 19, 1864 where they suffered significant casualties.<ref>Powers, 167 and 171.</ref><ref>Bowen, 586.</ref>\n\nIn January 1865, the 38th Massachusetts left the Shenandoah Valley, being transferred to [[North Carolina]]. They served guard duty in various locations during the spring of 1865 including [[Morehead City, North Carolina|Morehead City]] and [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]]. The regiment's 3-year term of service ended in July 1865. Although the war was over, regiments were still needed to serve garrison duty in the South. A portion of the remaining men of the 38th Massachusetts chose to reenlist and were transferred to the [[26th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|26th Massachusetts]]. The rest were shipped home and the 38th Massachusetts was mustered out of service on [[Gallops Island]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] Harbor on July 13, 1865.<ref>Bowen, 588.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*{{cite book\n| url         = https://www.google.com/books/edition/Massachusetts_in_the_War_1861_1865/4_lYAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Massachusetts+in+the+War+1861-1865+James+L+Bowen&pg=PR15&printsec=frontcover\n| author      = Bowen, James L\n| title       = Massachusetts in the War 1861&ndash;1865\n| publisher   = Clark W Bryer + Co\n| location    = Springfield, MA\n| year        = 1889\n| oclc        = 1986476 \n| url-access  = \n}}{{PD-notice}}\n*{{cite book\n| url         = https://archive.org/details/08697590.3359.emory.edu\n| title       = A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion\n| author      = Dyer, Frederick H. \n| publisher   = Dyer Pub.
