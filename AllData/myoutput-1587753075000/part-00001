The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8 has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash.

The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly because its camera is based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the 2nd generation iPhone SE|its predecessor|iPhone SE (1st generation)|the general use of the term ''iPhone SE''|iPhone SE (disambiguation)}}\n<noinclude>\n{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=iPhone SE (2020)|2=Talk:IPhone SE (2nd generation)#Requested move 16 April 2020}}\n</noinclude>\n{{pp-move|small=yes}}\n{{short description|thirteenth-generation Apple smartphone}}\n{{lowercase title}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox mobile phone\n| name         = iPhone SE\n| codename     = \n| logo         = IPhone SE (2nd generation) wordmark.svg\n| logosize     = <!-- include \"px\" - Uses users default image size if omitted -->\n| image        = IPhone SE (2nd generation) white vector.svg\n| imagesize    = \n| alt          = \n| caption      = iPhone SE in white, with black bezels\n| brand        = [[Apple Inc.]]\n| manufacturer = \n| slogan       = ''Lots to love.

It has the same top and bottom bezels on the front and a home button integrated with second-generation [[Touch ID]] as the iPhone 8.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/ |title = iPhone SE 2020: Everything We Know |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180805112853/https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/ |archive-date = August 5, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe iPhone SE is available in three colors \u2014 white, black,<!-- colors are not proper nouns --> and a [[Product Red|(Product) Red]] edition.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/> Where the SE deviates from the iPhone 8's design is with respect to the white model. Unlike the silver iPhone 8 (and all prior silver or white iPhones since the [[iPhone 4]]), the white iPhone SE features black bezels like the black model and red model, in line with the color schemes of the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone XR|XR]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Color !!Name      <!-- hex codes from product selection page -->\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#1F2020\"| ||Black \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"F9F6EF\" |  ||White \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#BA0C2E\"  |  ||Product Red\n|}\n\n== Specifications ==\n=== Size ===\nWith a screen diagonal of {{cvt|4.7|in}}, the second generation of the iPhone SE was among the smallest major in-production smartphones at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Axon|first=Samuel|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/04/why-apple-has-stopped-making-small-phones-and-why-it-should-start-again/|title=Why Apple has stopped making small phones\u2014and why it should start again|date=18 April 2020|work=Ars Technica|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> However, it was still thirty percent larger than the SE's first generation, whose screen diagonal measured in at {{cvt|4|in}}. This led to one journalist declaring that the SE was the \"nail in the coffin\" for small phones after rapid increases in size in smartphones of all models in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Seifert|first=Dan|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus|title=Even \u2018small\u2019 phones are big now|date=15 April 2020|work=The Verge|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nThe iPhone SE incorporates the Apple A13 Bionic system-on-chip (SoC) with an [[Apple motion coprocessors|M13 motion coprocessor]] and a third-generation neural engine. It is available in three internal storage configurations; 64&nbsp;GB, 128&nbsp;GB and 256&nbsp;GB.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> The SE has the same [[IP Code|IP67]] (dust-tight/30 minutes at 1m depth) rating for dust and water resistance as the iPhone 8.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> The phone lacks the [[ultra-wideband]] hardware (Apple U1 chip) found in the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/04/15/apples-new-iphone-se-doesnt-have-a-u1-ultra-wideband-chip|title=Apple's new iPhone SE doesn't have a U1 Ultra Wideband chip|website=appleinsider|last=Peterson|first=Mike|date=April 15, 2020|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n==== Display ====\nThe iPhone SE features the same Retina HD display found on the iPhone 8, with True Tone and wide color gamut ([[DCI-P3#Display P3|Display P3]]). The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8, has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly because its camera is based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "name_user": "Prahlad balaji", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDisplay:Minor grammar fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)"}
