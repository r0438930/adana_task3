There are PlayStation 3 specific installation instructions available for openSUSE.<ref>[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:PS3 en.opensuse.org]</ref>\n\nStarting with openSUSE 11.2, support for the [[PowerPC]] (and therefore the PlayStation 3) has been dropped.<ref>[https://old-en.opensuse.org/POWER@SUSE old-en.opensuse.org]</ref>\n\n===Fedora===\n[[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] also ran on the [[PlayStation 3]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxforps3.org |title=CECHExx PS3 with firmware 2.01 |access-date=2011-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918142613/http://linuxforps3.org/ |archive-date=2017-09-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Fedora 7 works on a USB external hard disk but fails to detect the internal disk, Fedora 9 detects the internal disk but not the USB disk, Fedora 8 will not work due to video \"card\" detection problems. Fedora 10 installs on the internal hard disk without any issues and works fine without having to change any settings.\n\nFedora 12 only installs on the PlayStation 3 when running the 64 bit kernel and only when English is the chosen language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philipotoole.com/fedora-12-on-the-ps3 |title=Installing FC12 on an 80GB PlayStation 3}}</ref>\n\n==RSX Homebrew==\nLinux on the PlayStation 3 allows for a range of [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] programs to be developed. Although the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell's]] performance is more than enough to handle most media requirements or render complex [[3D graphics]], it does lack the [[FLOPS|teraflops]] performance of a contemporary [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]'s texture fetching hardware. For this reason many complex games are not possible on the PlayStation 3 through Linux, as access to hardware acceleration in the [[RSX 'Reality Synthesizer'|RSX]] is restricted by a [[hypervisor]].\n\nThere have been developments in enabling access to the RSX through the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[X Window System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.ps2dev.org/ps3:rsx |title=ps3:rsx |publisher=Wiki.ps2dev.org |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121132934/http://wiki.ps2dev.org/ps3:rsx |archivedate=2009-01-21 }}</ref> It is possible to use the RSX memory as swap space. A trick to access some 3D functions was blocked with firmware 2.10.\n\n==AsbestOS==\n\nReverse engineering advancements focused around a recently{{when|date=December 2018}} discovered USB descriptor parsing vulnerability in 3.41 firmware, which allowed running the Linux kernel on 3.41 firmware.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://marcansoft.com/blog/2010/10/asbestos-running-linux-as-gameos/ | title=AsbestOS - running linux as gameos | accessdate=2010-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://lwn.net/Articles/410773/ | title=LWN - AsbestOS news entry | accessdate=2010-10-26 }}</ref> The current state of the project is the ability to load the Linux kernel via TFTP and run it with access to all 7 [[Synergistic Processing Unit|SPEs]] (requires applying a small patch to the kernel). The rest of the system can run on an NFS share - hard disk access is currently not implemented, as well as some other features.\n\nAlso, since the exploit runs the kernel with game privileges, graphics acceleration is now available, although it requires reworking of the [[nouveau (graphics)|nouveau]] driver code.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n==FreeBSD==\n\nSupport for PlayStation 3 was added to [[FreeBSD]] 9.0 in summer 2010. This support is limited to machines with OtherOS functionality still intact (firmware version 3.15 and earlier).\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Illegal number]]\n*[[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]]\n*[[PlayStation 3 cluster]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikibooks|Linux Guide|PlayStation 3}}\n*[http://www.playstation.com/ps3-openplatform/index.html Open Platform for Playstation 3 Overview]\n*[http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/03/28/ps3-firmware-v3-21-update/ 3.21 firmware update removing OtherOS capability]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100406124520/http://3004.pokemonger.com/showthread.php?tid=21 How to Bypass PS3 Firmware 3.21 and Connect to PSN using an internal DNS server]\n\n{{PlayStation 3}}\n{{PlayStation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Linux On The Playstation 3}}\n[[Category:Linux]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3]]\n[[Category:PowerPC operating systems]]\n[[Category:Game console operating systems]]\n[[Category:Video game controversies]]\n", "name_user": "Bumm13", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAsbestOS:changed \"Nouveau (graphics)\" (nouveau) wikilink to \"Nouveau (software)\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS"}
