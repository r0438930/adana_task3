They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls J.P. Singh on his cell phone and reports that the family has been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir.\nThe whole scene is then revealed in the sequel.\n\n===Introduction of Wasseypur and Dhanbad===\nNasir's narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. During the [[British Raj]], Wasseypur and [[Dhanbad]] were located in the [[Bengal]] region. After India gained its independence in 1947, they were carved out of Bengal and redistricted into the state of [[Bihar]] in 1956. In 2000, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were redistricted for a second time into the newly formed state of [[Jharkhand]] where they remain. The village has been historically dominated by the [[Qureshi]] Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims living there and Dhanbad by extension.\n\nDuring British colonial rule, the British had seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus held some patriotic value for the locals.\n\n===1940s===\nShahid Khan ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]), a [[Pathans in Bihar|Pathan]], takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a [[Qureshi]], by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side during childbirth, and she dies. The enraged Shahid kills the coal mine's muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh ([[Tigmanshu Dhulia]]) receives a few coal mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid Khan as the new muscleman of one of the coal mines. Shahid terrorises the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance.\n\nOn a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid into traveling to [[Varanasi]] for business but instead has him murdered by an assassin named Yadav Ji ([[Harish Khanna (actor)|Harish Khanna]]). Nasir ([[Piyush Mishra]]), Shahid's cousin, finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door and concludes that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the house with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi ([[Vipin Sharma]]), another associate of Ramadhir Singh and a member of the Wasseypur Qureshi clan, shows up to kill them but is too late. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered, burnt, and buried. Under the care of Nasir, Sardar grows up along with Nasir's nephew Asgar ([[Jameel Khan]]). Sardar learns the truth about his father's death, upon which he shaves his head and vows not to grow his hair until he has avenged his father's murder.\n\n===Early and Mid 1970s===\nThe coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) and his kin start hijacking Ramadhir's coal trucks mid-transit. Ramadhir Singh suspects S.P. Sinha, a [[Coal India]] official, to be behind the hijackings and has him murdered. After Sinha's murder, Ramadhir's reputation for ruthlessness grows, and he becomes feared in Dhanbad.\n\nSardar marries Nagma Khatoon ([[Richa Chadda]]). The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish Khan but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kin. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonour the family name.\n\nSardar, Asgar and Nasir start working for J.P. Singh (Satya Anand), Ramadhir Singh's son. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land, which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle, but Ramadhir Singh realizes that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid Khan who he had murdered in the late 1940s. Sardar and Asgar are jailed for assaulting J.P. Singh during the meeting.\n\n===Early 1980s===\nSardar and Asgar escape from jail. While hiding in Wasseypur, Sardar marries a [[Bengali Hindus|Bengali Hindu]] woman named Durga ([[Reema Sen]]). Asgar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife, leaving Nagma helpless. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad and the Qureshi clan continues to terrorise the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals then approach Sardar Khan for help as he was well known for standing up to Ramadhir Singh. During [[Muharram]], both [[Shias]] and [[Sunnis]] are out mourning, including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. When word spreads about Sardar's raids, his reputation grows and he commands more fear than the Qureshi clan.\n\nEventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses, which prompts an angry Sardar to leave. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga, and she gives birth to his son, Definite. Ramadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out to Nagma through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a stoner, permanently seen with his chillum. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated, but Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again.\n\n===Mid and Late 1980s===\nSensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), his nephew and Ramadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar. Sultan asks Ramadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give.\n\n===1990s===\nSardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan ([[Vineet Kumar Singh]]) joins the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between  Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family.\n\nA mature Faizal ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]) is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Sardar sends Faizal to Varanasi to buy guns, but Faizal is caught by the police and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun seller Yadav, who unbeknownst to Faizal was the nameless assassin who had killed Shahid Khan (Faizal's grandfather) and who had implicated Faizal to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Faizal begins romancing Mohsina Hamid ([[Huma Qureshi (actress)|Huma Qureshi]]), another kin of Sultan.\n\n===Epilogue===\nFaizal reveals to his friend, Faizlu that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day. Unbeknownst to Faizal, Faizlu is actually an ally of Sultan.  Late that night, while Faizal is still asleep, Faizlu calls up the Qureshis and tells them that Sardar's bodyguards wouldn't be with him the next day. The next morning, Sardar leaves home alone and reaches Durga's house where he gives her her expense allowance. Once Sardar leaves, Durga also calls up the Qureshis and tells them that he has just left her house. The Qureshi men follow Sardar's car, and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting as Sardar ducks in the car for cover. The Qureshi men put several close rounds through the car window ensuring a precise and unmistakable hit, after which they escape. A shocked Sardar opens the car door and stands up to reveal multiple bullet wounds, with one bullet embedded in his head. He steps out with his gun drawn to stop a cycle ferry on which he eventually collapses to his death.\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Gangs of Wasseypur \u2013 Part 2}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:GOW Khan Family.png|250px|thumb|Family tree of the Khan family.

In 2008 he met [[Zeishan Quadri]] (the writer of Gangs of Wasseypur) who told him about Wasseypur's story. He found it unreal to believe that mafia activity and gang war existed at such high level. Zeishan narrated enough stories but what really attracted him was not gang war but the entire story of emergence of mafia. According to him to tell the story through a few families is what interested him but that also meant a longer reel. \"We all know mafia exists but what they do, how they operate, why they do we don't know and that is something which forms the basis of the film\".\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to Bajpayee, the role of Sardar Khan is the most negative role he has done till date.

Anurag Kashyap never has to resort to extraneous elements like stylised entries, editing patterns or camera motions to add to the effect because the story has an intrinsic impact of its own.

There are several differences in the film which contradict actual documented events most notably the character of Faizal Khan (based on [[Faheem Khan]]) who dies in the climax. [[Faheem Khan]] is currently in jail in Hazaribagh and has been sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\">http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/pangs-of-wasseypur/article3967902.ece Pangs of Wasseypur (''link error'': 11/12/2018))</ref> In the film, Sardar Khan marries the Bengali girl but in real life, the woman was maintained as a keep. Most of the gang wars were between the gangs of Wasseypur, not with the Singhs, who had been instrumental in instigating these wars, but never participated in them.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/> There was no character akin to Shahid Khan.\n\nAnother scene in the movie, where a Muslim girl is kidnapped by Singh's men, has been portrayed conversely. In real life, the victim was a local [[Hindu]] girl and the kidnappers were a few goons from Wasseypur. The members of the Singh family ultimately had to threaten the entire Wasseypur community to return the girl in 24 hours. The girl was eventually returned as the Singhs were regarded in the village with might and fear.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/>\n\nThe character of Ramadhir Singh is based on Surajdeo Singh. In the film's climax, Singh is brutally killed by Faizal but in real life, Singh died of natural causes in June 1991.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nFazloo's character is based on Sabir Alam. In the film, Fazloo is killed and dismembered by Faizal Khan. In real life, Sabir Alam and Faheem Khan were childhood friends turned enemies. Sabir was awarded life sentence in 2007 for the murder of Faheem Khan's mother and aunt, is out on bail in Wasseypur.<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120622/jsp/jharkhand/story_15642956.jsp Wassup Wasseypur?

It is considered a modern [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|film|date=December 2018}}\n===Prologue===\nA gang of heavily armed men scour and finally narrow down on a house in [[Wasseypur]]. They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls J.P. Singh on his cell phone and reports that the family has been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir.\nThe whole scene is then revealed in the sequel.\n\n===Introduction of Wasseypur and Dhanbad===\nNasir's narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. During the [[British Raj]], Wasseypur and [[Dhanbad]] were located in the [[Bengal]] region. After India gained its independence in 1947, they were carved out of Bengal and redistricted into the state of [[Bihar]] in 1956. In 2000, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were redistricted for a second time into the newly formed state of [[Jharkhand]] where they remain. The village has been historically dominated by the [[Qureshi]] Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims living there and Dhanbad by extension.\n\nDuring British colonial rule, the British had seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus held some patriotic value for the locals.\n\n===1940s===\nShahid Khan ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]), a [[Pathans in Bihar|Pathan]], takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a [[Qureshi]], by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side during childbirth, and she dies. The enraged Shahid kills the coal mine's muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh ([[Tigmanshu Dhulia]]) receives a few coal mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid Khan as the new muscleman of one of the coal mines. Shahid terrorises the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance.\n\nOn a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid into traveling to [[Varanasi]] for business but instead has him murdered by an assassin named Yadav Ji ([[Harish Khanna (actor)|Harish Khanna]]). Nasir ([[Piyush Mishra]]), Shahid's cousin, finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door and concludes that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the house with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi ([[Vipin Sharma]]), another associate of Ramadhir Singh and a member of the Wasseypur Qureshi clan, shows up to kill them but is too late. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered, burnt, and buried. Under the care of Nasir, Sardar grows up along with Nasir's nephew Asgar ([[Jameel Khan]]). Sardar learns the truth about his father's death, upon which he shaves his head and vows not to grow his hair until he has avenged his father's murder.\n\n===Early and Mid 1970s===\nThe coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) and his kin start hijacking Ramadhir's coal trucks mid-transit. Ramadhir Singh suspects S.P. Sinha, a [[Coal India]] official, to be behind the hijackings and has him murdered. After Sinha's murder, Ramadhir's reputation for ruthlessness grows, and he becomes feared in Dhanbad.\n\nSardar marries Nagma Khatoon ([[Richa Chadda]]). The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish Khan but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kin. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonour the family name.\n\nSardar, Asgar and Nasir start working for J.P. Singh (Satya Anand), Ramadhir Singh's son. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land, which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle, but Ramadhir Singh realizes that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid Khan who he had murdered in the late 1940s. Sardar and Asgar are jailed for assaulting J.P. Singh during the meeting.\n\n===Early 1980s===\nSardar and Asgar escape from jail. While hiding in Wasseypur, Sardar marries a [[Bengali Hindus|Bengali Hindu]] woman named Durga ([[Reema Sen]]). Asgar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife, leaving Nagma helpless. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad and the Qureshi clan continues to terrorise the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals then approach Sardar Khan for help as he was well known for standing up to Ramadhir Singh. During [[Muharram]], both [[Shias]] and [[Sunnis]] are out mourning, including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. When word spreads about Sardar's raids, his reputation grows and he commands more fear than the Qureshi clan.\n\nEventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses, which prompts an angry Sardar to leave. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga, and she gives birth to his son, Definite. Ramadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out to Nagma through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a stoner, permanently seen with his chillum. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated, but Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again.\n\n===Mid and Late 1980s===\nSensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), his nephew and Ramadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar. Sultan asks Ramadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give.\n\n===1990s===\nSardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan ([[Vineet Kumar Singh]]) joins the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between  Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family.\n\nA mature Faizal ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]) is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Sardar sends Faizal to Varanasi to buy guns, but Faizal is caught by the police and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun seller Yadav, who unbeknownst to Faizal was the nameless assassin who had killed Shahid Khan (Faizal's grandfather) and who had implicated Faizal to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Faizal begins romancing Mohsina Hamid ([[Huma Qureshi (actress)|Huma Qureshi]]), another kin of Sultan.\n\n===Epilogue===\nFaizal reveals to his friend, Faizlu that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day. Unbeknownst to Faizal, Faizlu is actually an ally of Sultan.  Late that night, while Faizal is still asleep, Faizlu calls up the Qureshis and tells them that Sardar's bodyguards wouldn't be with him the next day. The next morning, Sardar leaves home alone and reaches Durga's house where he gives her her expense allowance. Once Sardar leaves, Durga also calls up the Qureshis and tells them that he has just left her house. The Qureshi men follow Sardar's car, and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting as Sardar ducks in the car for cover. The Qureshi men put several close rounds through the car window ensuring a precise and unmistakable hit, after which they escape. A shocked Sardar opens the car door and stands up to reveal multiple bullet wounds, with one bullet embedded in his head.

In 2008 he met [[Zeishan Quadri]] (the writer of Gangs of Wasseypur) who told him about Wasseypur's story. He found it unreal to believe that mafia activity and gang war existed at such high level. Zeishan narrated enough stories but what really attracted him was not gang war but the entire story of emergence of mafia. According to him to tell the story through a few families is what interested him but that also meant a longer reel. \"We all know mafia exists but what they do, how they operate, why they do we don't know and that is something which forms the basis of the film\".\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to Bajpayee, the role of Sardar Khan is the most negative role he has done till date.

Anurag Kashyap never has to resort to extraneous elements like stylised entries, editing patterns or camera motions to add to the effect because the story has an intrinsic impact of its own.

With a runtime this long, meandering side tracks and random sub-plots, countless characters, documentary-style narrative backed with black and white montages from actual history, it loses blood in the second half because of the Director's over-(self)indulgence.

There doesn\u2019t seem to be one here, at least on the face of it. The genre it comes closest to then is an epic, spelt with a capital E, along the lines of say Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy, or this film's immediate inspiration Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002). And, of course, it is like all mythologies are supposed to be. You enjoy them for the parts rather than caring merely for the hero's final goal. If it wasn\u2019t a film, this would\u2019ve been a stylised graphic novel. But you would\u2019ve missed a memorable background score and striking sound design.\"\n\n;International\nThe film met positive international reviews. Deborah Young of [[The Hollywood Reporter]] called the film \"an extraordinary ride through Bollywood's spectacular, over-the-top filmmaking\".

There are several differences in the film which contradict actual documented events most notably the character of Faizal Khan (based on [[Faheem Khan]]) who dies in the climax. [[Faheem Khan]] is currently in jail in Hazaribagh and has been sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\">http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/pangs-of-wasseypur/article3967902.ece Pangs of Wasseypur (''link error'': 11/12/2018))</ref> In the film, Sardar Khan marries the Bengali girl but in real life, the woman was maintained as a keep. Most of the gang wars were between the gangs of Wasseypur, not with the Singhs, who had been instrumental in instigating these wars, but never participated in them.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/> There was no character akin to Shahid Khan.\n\nAnother scene in the movie, where a Muslim girl is kidnapped by Singh's men, has been portrayed conversely. In real life, the victim was a local [[Hindu]] girl and the kidnappers were a few goons from Wasseypur. The members of the Singh family ultimately had to threaten the entire Wasseypur community to return the girl in 24 hours. The girl was eventually returned as the Singhs were regarded in the village with might and fear.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/>\n\nThe character of Ramadhir Singh is based on Surajdeo Singh. In the film's climax, Singh is brutally killed by Faizal but in real life, Singh died of natural causes in June 1991.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nFazloo's character is based on Sabir Alam. In the film, Fazloo is killed and dismembered by Faizal Khan. In real life, Sabir Alam and Faheem Khan were childhood friends turned enemies. Sabir was awarded life sentence in 2007 for the murder of Faheem Khan's mother and aunt, is out on bail in Wasseypur.<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120622/jsp/jharkhand/story_15642956.jsp Wassup Wasseypur?
