[[Hideo Nakata]], director of the original Japanese film ''Ringu'', on which the American versions are based, directed this film in place of [[Gore Verbinski]].\n\nThe film was shot in [[Astoria, Oregon]] and [[Los Angeles, California]]. It was released on March 18, 2005, and although it was met by generally negative critical reception, it opened in the United States with a strong [[US dollar|US$]]35 million its first weekend, more than doubling the opening weekend of ''The Ring''. Its final $76 million domestic gross was less than the original's $129 million, but it took $85 million internationally, for a total gross of $161 million.\n\nIt is the second installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' film series]] and was followed by ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'' (2017).\n\n==Plot==\nSix months<!-- The short film ''Rings'' (2005) takes place in 2003 and this film is set in the same year, do not remove it --> after the events of the [[The Ring (2002 film)|first film]] and immediately following the events of the short film ''[[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]]'', [[Samara Morgan]]\u2019s cursed videotape has been circulating through teenagers in [[Astoria, Oregon]]. Jake Pierce is on his seventh day as per the tape's rules, and asks his friend Emily to watch the tape. He briefly steps into his kitchen while Emily supposedly watches the tape. Jake receives a phone call and initially thinks it is Samara but is relieved to realize it is only his friend with whom he had planned to trick Emily into watching the tape. Suddenly, Jake notices dark liquid pouring from under the kitchen door and runs outside to the living room, only to discover Emily closed her eyes while watching the tape. Jake is then promptly murdered by Samara.\n\n[[Rachel Keller]] and her son, Aidan, have moved to Astoria from [[Seattle]] after sending the tape off into the ether. Rachel works at ''[[The Daily Astorian]]'' for editor Max Rourke. Rachel learns of Jake's death, inspecting his body, only for Samara to appear, declaring that she has been looking for her. Rachel breaks into Jake's house, obtains the videotape and burns it. Aidan experiences a [[nightmare]] where Samara drags him into a television. He soon starts developing [[hypothermia]] and bruises on his arms. At a [[county fair]], Aidan wanders into a restroom and takes photographs of his reflection, where Samara appears. Rachel takes him home but they are attacked by multiple wild deer on the way. Rachel realizes Aidan may be possessed by Samara.\n\nMax takes them in. While Rachel is attempting to give Aidan a bath, he develops an irrational [[Aquaphobia|fear of water]]. Samara causes the water to recede from the bath, replacing Aidan with herself, and terrorizing Rachel so that she tries to drown Samara. Max enters, seeing her drowning Aidan instead, and forces her to take her son to the hospital. Based on Aidan's bruises, psychiatrist Emma Temple suspects [[child abuse]] on the part of Rachel, who admits she had [[postpartum depression]], and she sends Rachel away. Looking for answers, Rachel returns to the Morgan ranch on Moesko Island, finding evidence of Samara's biological mother Evelyn, who tried to drown her as an infant. Rachel visits Evelyn in a [[psychiatric hospital]], who advises her to \"listen to her baby\".\n\nIn the hospital, Samara takes control of Aidan's body and [[Mind control in popular culture|telepathically forces]] Dr. Temple to commit suicide before returning to Max's house. Max arrives, suspects foul play, and tries to secretly take photos of Aidan. Rachel arrives, discovering an affectionate Aidan waiting for her, but acting suspiciously out-of-character. She steps out, finding Max's corpse in his pickup truck. Rachel falls asleep, dreaming of Aidan, who tells her that she will have to [[exorcism|exorcise]] Samara. Upon awakening, Rachel drugs Samara with sleeping pills and places her in the bath to temporarily drown Aidan in order to exorcise her. Samara is removed but appears in the television. Rachel allows herself to be dragged into Samara's monochromatic world.\n\nFinding herself in the bottom of the [[water well|well]] Samara died in, Rachel discovers the lid is partially open. She scales the well's walls, pursued by Samara, but escapes by climbing out and pushing the lid shut on Samara, locking her out of her and Aidan's lives.\n\nWandering through the woods, she comes to the cliff where Samara's adoptive mother Anna committed suicide. Hearing Aidan's voice, Rachel falls off the cliff and falls into the water, returning to the real world and reuniting with Aidan.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Rachel Keller\n* [[David Dorfman]] as Aidan Keller\n* [[Simon Baker]] as Max Rourke\n* [[Kelly Stables]] as Samara Morgan\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Evelyn Borden\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Dr. Emma Temple\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Martin Savide\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Young Evelyn Borden\n* [[Ryan Merriman]] as Jake Pierce\n* [[Emily VanCamp]] as Emily\n* [[Kelly Overton (actress)|Kelly Overton]] as Betsy\n* [[James Lesure]] as Doctor\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 20%, based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 4.44/10.
