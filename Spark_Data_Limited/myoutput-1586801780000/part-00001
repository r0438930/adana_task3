It was first established in Spain following the Christian recovery of their territories under Muslim rule (known as the ''[[Reconquista]]''), and it was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of [[indigenous peoples]], held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.<ref>James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.</ref>\n\nEncomiendas devolved from their original Iberian form into a form of \"communal\" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[pork]], or other agricultural products.\n\nWith the ousting of [[Christopher Columbus]], the Spanish crown sent a royal governor, Fray [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]], who established the formal ''encomienda'' system.<ref>Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 47</ref> In many cases natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.<ref name=\"encslav\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion|page=184|volume=1|first=Junius P.|last=Rodriguez|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33272-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_kuS42BxIYC&pg=PA184}}</ref> However, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] forbade slavery of the native population and deemed the indigenous to be \"free vassals of the crown\".<ref>Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, 143</ref> Various versions of the ''Leyes de Indias'' or [[Laws of the Indies]] from 1512 onwards attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives.

However, coerced labor continued in other forms throughout the Spanish colonies.\n\n== History ==\nThe heart of ''encomienda'' and ''encomendero'' lies in the Spanish verb ''encomendar'', \"to entrust\". The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. This system originated in the Catholic South of Spain to extract labor and tribute from Muslims (Moors) before they were exiled in 1492 after the Moors were defeated in the battle in Granada.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref> This system was a method of rewarding soldiers and moneymen who defeated the Moors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77348-5 |pages=388}}</ref> The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.\n\nThe ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; native lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.<ref>Scott, Meredith, \"[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}\".</ref>\n\n==''Encomenderos''==\n[[File:Hern\u00e1n_Cort\u00e9s_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]\nThe first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.\n\nIn his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]' original expedition, calling them \"first conquerors\", and those who were members of the later [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez|Narv\u00e1ez]] expedition, calling them \"conquerors\". The latter were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers) a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.\n\nIn the New World, the Crown granted conquistadores as encomendero, which is the right to extract labor and tribute from natives who were under Spanish rule. Christopher Columbus established the encomienda system after his arrival and settlement on the island of Hispaniola requiring them to pay tributes or face brutal punishments. Tributes were required to be paid in gold however during this time gold was scarce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>\n\nHolders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite.

It was the first major organizational law instituted on the continent, which was affected by war, widespread disease epidemics caused by Eurasian diseases, and resulting turmoil.<ref>[[Inga Clendinnen|Clendinnen, Inga]]; ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucat\u00e1n, 1517\u20131570''.

This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.\nIn 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.\n\nEach ''reducci\u00f3n'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]].\n\nIn Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, \"I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order.\"<ref>Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.</ref> The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.\n\nThe ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepci\u00f3n, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=onepage&q=15%2C000&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.\n\nLater, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=snippet&q=three%20thousand%20islanders&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders <!-- where are we?

The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.<ref>''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254</ref>\n\nOnce natives committed themselves to Spanish authority, Columbus, and Spanish overlords, they also were forced to get baptized and attend Catholic Church services. Religion allowed conquistadores to label the native population as barbaric and in need of saving. The encomienda system perpetuated because many conquistadores believed they were being altruistic and were doing God\u2019s work. Religion encouraged the expansion of conquest through the encomienda system throughout the New World.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"''sin indios no hay Indias''\" (without Indians, there are no Indies \u2013 i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]].

It was first established in Spain following the Christian recovery of their territories under Muslim rule (known as the ''[[Reconquista]]''), and it was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of [[indigenous peoples]], held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.<ref>James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.</ref>\n\nEncomiendas devolved from their original Iberian form into a form of \"communal\" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[pork]], or other agricultural products.\n\nWith the ousting of [[Christopher Columbus]], the Spanish crown sent a royal governor, Fray [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]], who established the formal ''encomienda'' system.<ref>Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 47</ref> In many cases natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.<ref name=\"encslav\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion|page=184|volume=1|first=Junius P.|last=Rodriguez|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33272-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_kuS42BxIYC&pg=PA184}}</ref> However, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] forbade slavery of the native population and deemed the indigenous to be \"free vassals of the crown\".<ref>Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, 143</ref> Various versions of the ''Leyes de Indias'' or [[Laws of the Indies]] from 1512 onwards attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives. Both natives and Spaniards appealed to the [[Real Audiencia]]s for relief under the ''encomienda'' system.\n\n''Encomiendas'' had often been characterized by the geographical displacement of the enslaved and breakup of communities and family units, but in Mexico, the ''encomienda'' ruled the free vassals of the crown through existing community hierarchies, and the natives were allowed to keep in touch with their families and homes.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule,'' Stanford, 1964.</ref> This was not true in all areas as in some parts of [[Hispaniola]],<ref name=\"otherslaver\">{{cite web|last=Trever |first=David |title=The new book 'The Other Slavery' will make you rethink American history |url=https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-native-american-slavery-20160505-snap-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620020336/https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-native-american-slavery-20160505-snap-story.html |archive-date=2019-06-20|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> [[Spanish conquest of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]],<ref name=\"churwas\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Churchill|first=Ward|date=1999|title=Genocide of native populations in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Basin|editor=Israel W.

The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. This system originated in the Catholic South of Spain to extract labor and tribute from Muslims (Moors) before they were exiled in 1492 after the Moors were defeated in the battle in Granada <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>. This system was a method of rewarding soldiers and moneymen who defeated the Moors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77348-5 |pages=388}}</ref>. The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.\n\nThe ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; native lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.<ref>Scott, Meredith, \"[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}\".</ref>\n\n==''Encomenderos''==\n[[File:Hern\u00e1n_Cort\u00e9s_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]\nThe first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.\n\nIn his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]' original expedition, calling them \"first conquerors\", and those who were members of the later [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez|Narv\u00e1ez]] expedition, calling them \"conquerors\". The latter were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers) a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.\n\nIn the New World, the Crown granted conquistadores as encomendero, which is the right to extract labor and tribute from natives who were under Spanish rule. Christopher Columbus established the encomienda system after his arrival and settlement on the island of Hispaniola requiring them to pay tributes or face brutal punishments. Tributes were required to be paid in gold however during this time gold was scarce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>\n\nHolders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite.

This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.\nIn 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.\n\nEach ''reducci\u00f3n'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]].\n\nIn Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, \"I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order.\"<ref>Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.</ref> The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.\n\nThe ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepci\u00f3n, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=onepage&q=15%2C000&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.\n\nLater, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=snippet&q=three%20thousand%20islanders&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders <!-- where are we?

The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.<ref>''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254</ref>\n\nOnce natives committed themselves to Spanish authority, Columbus, and Spanish overlords, they also were forced to get baptized and attend Catholic Church services. Religion allowed conquistadores to label the native population as barbaric and in need of saving. The encomienda system perpetuated because many conquistadores believed they were being altruistic and were doing God\u2019s work. Religion encouraged the expansion of conquest through the encomienda system throughout the New World.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>  \n\nThe phrase \"''sin indios no hay Indias''\" (without Indians, there are no Indies \u2013 i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]].

In 1510, an [[Hispaniola]] ''encomendero'' named Valenzuela murdered a group of Native American leaders who had agreed to meet for peace talks in full confidence. The Ta\u00edno Cacique [[Enriquillo]] rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. In 1538, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], realizing the seriousness of the Ta\u00edno revolt, changed the laws governing the treatment of people laboring in the encomiendas.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492\u20131566 | author=David M.

The crown also actively prosecuted abuses of the ''encomienda'' system, through the Law of Burgos (1512\u201313) and the [[New Laws|New Law of the Indies (1542)]].\n\nThe priest of Hispaniola and former ''encomendero'' [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people.<ref>Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, who arrived in the New World in 1502, averred that greed was the reason Christians \u201cmurdered on such a vast scale,\u201d killing \u201canyone and everyone who has shown the slightest sign of resistance,\u201d and subjecting \u201call males to the harshest and most iniquitous and brutal slavery that man has ever devised for oppressing his fellow-men, treating them, in fact, worse than animals.\u201d Res\u00e9ndez, Andr\u00e9s.

Las Casas participated in an [[Valladolid debate|important debate]], where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the ''encomienda'' system.<ref>Benjamin Keen, ''Bartolome de las Casas in history: toward an understanding of the man and his work''.

When [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]], the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the ''encomienda'', many of the ''encomenderos'' were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.\n\n===The New Laws of 1542===\n{{Main|New Laws}}\n\nWhen the news of this situation and of the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the [[New Laws]] were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, 1543, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. These extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.<ref>Su\u00e1rez Romero.

The Spanish crown's formal prohibition of slavery of native people in 1542 gave rise to a number of related institutions, such as encomiendas, repartimientos, the selling of convict labor, and ultimately debt peonage ... In other words, formal slavery was replaced by multiple forms of informal labor coercion and enslavement that were extremely difficult to track, let alone eradicate.\"<ref name=otherslaver />\n\n==Repartimiento==\nThe ''encomienda'' system was generally replaced by the crown-managed ''[[repartimiento]]'' system throughout Spanish America after mid-sixteenth century.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Like the ''encomienda'', the new ''repartimiento'' did not include the attribution of land to anyone, rather only the allotment of native workers. But they were directly allotted to the crown, who, through a local crown official, would assign them to work for settlers for a set period of time, usually several weeks. The ''repartimiento'' was an attempt \"to reduce the abuses of forced labour\".<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> As the number of [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives declined]] and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the [[hacienda]], or large landed estates in which laborers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (''hacendados''), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labor.<ref>Tindall, George Brown & David E.
