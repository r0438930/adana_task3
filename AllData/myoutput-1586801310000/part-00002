That point, (''\u03c6''{{sub|1}}, ''\u03bb''{{sub|0}}), will project to the center of a circular projection, with ''\u03c6'' referring to latitude and ''\u03bb'' referring to longitude. All points along a given azimuth will project along a straight line from the center, and the angle ''\u03b8'' that the line subtends from the vertical is the azimuth angle. The distance from the center point to another projected point ''\u03c1'' is the [[arc length]] along a [[great circle]] between them on the globe.

This is shown in the example of two maps centered about [[Los Angeles]], and [[Taipei]]. The antipode for Los Angeles is in the south [[Indian Ocean]] hence there is not much significant distortion of land masses for the Los Angeles centered map except for [[East Africa]] and [[Madagascar]].

This type of projection allows the operator to easily determine in which direction to point their [[directional antenna]]. The operator simply finds on the map the location of the target transmitter or receiver (i.e. the other antenna being communicated with) and uses the map to determine the [[azimuth|azimuth angle]] needed to point the operator's antenna. The operator would use an [[Antenna rotator|electric rotator]] to point the antenna. The map can also be used in one way communication. For example if the operator is looking to receive signals from a distant radio station, this type of projection could help identify the direction of the distant radio station. In order for the map to be useful, the map should be centered as close as possible about the location of the operator's antenna.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:North Korean missile range.svg|250px|thumb|An azimuthal equidistant projection centered on North Korea along with ranges of [[List of North Korean missile tests|their different missiles]].]]\nAzimuthal equidistant projection maps can also be useful to show ranges of missiles, as demonstrated by the map on the right.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of map projections]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.radicalcartography.net/?projectionref Table of examples and properties of all common projections], from radicalcartography.net\n* [http://www.wm7d.net/azproj.shtml Online Azimuthal Equidistant Map Generator]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225345/http://www.uff.br/mapprojections/AzimuthalEquidistant_en.html An interactive Java Applet to study the metric deformations of the Azimuthal Equidistant Projection].\n* [https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io GeographicLib] provides a class for performing azimuthal equidistant projections centered at any point on the ellipsoid.\n* [http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/isobaric/500hPa/azimuthal_equidistant=24.64,98.15,169 Animated US National Weather Service Wind Data for Azimuthal equidistant projection].\n* [https://ns6t.net/azimuth/azimuth.html Generate an Azimuthal equidistant projection from any point on Earth] from ns6t.net.\n{{Map Projections}}\n\n[[Category:Map projections]]\n[[Category:Equidistant projections]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Azimuthal equidistant projection SW.jpg|thumb|300px|An azimuthal equidistant projection about the [[North Pole]] extending all the way to the [[South Pole]].]]\n[[File:Azimuthal equidistant projection south SW.jpg|thumb|300px|An azimuthal equidistant projection about the [[South Pole]] extending all the way to the [[North Pole]].]]\n[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|300px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]] containing a polar azimuthal equidistant projection.]]\nThe '''azimuthal equidistant projection''' is an [[Azimuthal projection#Azimuthal .28projections onto a plane.29|azimuthal map projection]].
