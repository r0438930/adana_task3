The defending champion is [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], which defeated [[AllieStein]] in the [[TCEC Season 16]] superfinal.\n\nSeason 17 featured for the first time two separate leagues, one for [[GPU]]-based engines and one for [[CPU]]-based engines. TCEC also doubled the computing power available to CPU engines, from 44 cores to 88.\n\n==Overview==\nIn keeping with its identity as a competition run at long time controls on high-end hardware,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|title = TCEC Computer Chess Championship New Season starts August 26th|last = Kosteniuk |first = Alexandra|date = August 15, 2013|website = Chess News Blog|accessdate = October 25, 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063745/http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|archivedate = October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://nypost.com/2013/06/09/engine-super-bowl/|title = Engine Super Bowl|last = Soltis|first = Andy|date = June 9, 2013|website = New York Post|accessdate = October 25, 2013}}</ref> TCEC secured a hardware upgrade for the competing CPU engines.<ref name=\"S17Info\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-s17-detailed-information/|title=TCEC S17 \u2013 detailed information|publisher=Chessdom|date=21 December 2019}}</ref> Among other changes, the number of cores available is doubled from 44 to 88, the operating system used is now [[Linux]], and Syzygy [[endgame tablebases]] are now cached directly in the RAM for faster access. Because this upgrade advantages CPU engines compared to GPU engines, TCEC split the qualification paths to Premier Division by introducing separate leagues for CPU and GPU engines. While an upgrade to the GPU servers is being secured, the CPU leagues are played first.\n\n===Structure===\nFor CPU engines, there will first be a Qualification League consisting of 16 engines, followed by League 2 (16 engines) and League 1 (16 engines). In the Qualification League the top 6 engines promote. In League 2 the top 4 engines promote. The engines in each league are seeded based on their performances in previous seasons. For GPU engines, there will be one league only, with up to 16 competitors. The top 2 GPU engines will then contest a playoff against the top 4 CPU engines in League 1, with the four highest-placing engines promoting to Premier Division.\n\nPremier Division is also expanded from 8 engines to 10. Six engines - [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], [[Leela Chess Zero]], [[AllieStein]], and Stoofvlees - are seeded directly to Premier Division, based on their top 6 finishes in the previous season. Finally, the top two engines in Premier Division qualify for the 100-game superfinal match.\n\n==Results==\n===CPU Qualification League===\nAfter not competing for five seasons, Season 11 Div 3 engine Defenchess trailblazed the qualification league. It scored 18 wins while conceding no losses, finishing 3.5 points clear at the top. It was the only undefeated engine. Demolito and Winter also locked up two of the promotion spots smoothly, but the remaining three slots were closely contested. Among the competitors, Igel was the only engine to not lose to Defenchess and Demolito, but it lost to bottom-half engines FabChess and Topple. Comparatively, iCE was whitewashed by Defenchess and Igel, but it turned in a strong performance against its other rivals, losing only one other game to Winter. Pirarucu went through a tense moment when it lost to Winter in the penultimate round; however, it pulled out a win with Black against Topple to promote. 7th-placed Minic was in a promotion spot all the way up to the final round, when it lost to Gogobello while iCE beat Counter. This left the two tied at 17.5 points. Minic had the better [[Sonneborn\u2013Berger score]], but it also had one crash, and the number of crashes was the first tiebreak. Nonetheless, in a stroke of good fortune for Minic (and 8th-placed PeSTO), the League Two engines chess22k and [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] crashed three times during testing for the division. By TCEC rules, if this happened, the author(s) would have to update the engine or it is disqualified. chess22k's and Fritz's authors were not able to update the engines in time, resulting in Minic and PeSTO promoting as lucky losers.<ref>https://imgur.com/GHNF1Zu</ref>\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=ql&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|result5=WC \n|result6=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League Two}}\n|result7=WB \n|result8=WB \n|col_WB=blue1 |text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League Two (see text)}}\n|team1=DEF|team2=DEM|team3=WIN|team4=PIR|team5=IGE|team6=ICE|team7=MIN|team8=PES|team9=MAR|team10=GOG|team11=TOP|team12=COU|team13=FAB|team14=TUC|team15=ASY|team16=CHE|\n\n|win_DEF=18 |draw_DEF=12 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_DEM=12 |draw_DEM=17 |loss_DEM=1\n|win_WIN=14 |draw_WIN=12 |loss_WIN=4\n|win_PIR=10 |draw_PIR=16 |loss_PIR=4\n|win_IGE=10 |draw_IGE=16 |loss_IGE=4\n|win_ICE=10 |draw_ICE=15 |loss_ICE=5\n|win_MIN=10 |draw_MIN=15 |loss_MIN=5\n|win_PES=8 |draw_PES=17 |loss_PES=5\n|win_MAR=8 |draw_MAR=16 |loss_MAR=6\n|win_GOG=8 |draw_GOG=14 |loss_GOG=8\n|win_TOP=8 |draw_TOP=12 |loss_TOP=10\n|win_COU=4 |draw_COU=12 |loss_COU=14\n|win_FAB=3 |draw_FAB=14 |loss_FAB=13\n|win_TUC=4 |draw_TUC=9 |loss_TUC=17\n|win_ASY=2 |draw_ASY=13 |loss_ASY=15\n|win_CHE=2 |draw_CHE=8 |loss_CHE=20\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_MAR=Marvin |short_MAR=MAR\n|name_GOG=Gogobello |short_GOG=GOG\n|name_TOP=Topple |short_TOP=TOP\n|name_COU=Counter |short_COU=COU\n|name_FAB=FabChess |short_FAB=FAB\n|name_TUC=Tucano |short_TUC=TUC\n|name_ASY=Asymptote |short_ASY=ASY\n|name_CHE=Cheese |short_CHE=CHE\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League Two===\nFormer Premier Division engine Fire won League Two. It had been relegated in [[TCEC Season 16|the previous season]] because its developer had submitted a drastically different neural network-based version that turned out to be significantly weaker. This season, the original, traditional engine played, and it dominated with an undefeated 22/28 (16 wins and 12 draws). It defeated seven engines, including fourth-place Vajolet, 2-0. Second-placed Defenchess also turned in a strong performance, finishing with an undefeated 20.5/28 (13 wins and 15 draws). For the other promoted engines, Winter and PeSTO performed surprisingly well, comfortably finishing above their peers in 7th and 8th respectively. The remaining five promoted engines occupied the bottom five spots and were all relegated along with Wasp (which crashed three times).\n\nAfter the division concluded, in a repeat of testing for League Two, four League One engines either pulled out or did not run on the new Linux operating system, resulting in the 5th-8th placed engines in League One promoting.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=l1&game=1], see also [https://tcecbayeselo.chessdom.org/2020/01/25/tcec-season-17-league2-game-240-defenchess-2-3_dev-igel-2-3-1/] for table with Wasp's score zeroed out\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League One}}\n|result5=WB\n|result6=WB\n|result7=WB\n|result8=WB\n|col_WB=blue1|text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League One (see text)}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=DEF|team3=RUB|team4=VAJ|team5=PED|team6=NEM|team7=WIN|team8=PES|team9=GUL|team10=WAS|team11=TEX|team12=DEM|team13=MIN|team14=ICE|team15=IGE|team16=PIR|\n\n|win_FIR=16|draw_FIR=14 |loss_FIR=0\n|win_DEF=14|draw_DEF=16|loss_DEF=0\n|win_RUB=9 |draw_RUB=19|loss_RUB=2\n|win_VAJ=10 |draw_VAJ=15 |loss_VAJ=5\n|win_PED=7|draw_PED=19 |loss_PED=4\n|win_WIN=6|draw_WIN=18|loss_WIN=6\n|win_PES=6|draw_PES=17|loss_PES=7\n|win_NEM=7 |draw_NEM=15|loss_NEM=8\n|win_GUL=4 |draw_GUL=21 |loss_GUL=5\n|win_WAS=5 |draw_WAS=19 |loss_WAS=6 |status_WAS=D\n|win_DEM=7 |draw_DEM=13 |loss_DEM=10\n|win_TEX=4 |draw_TEX=19 |loss_TEX=7\n|win_MIN=3 |draw_MIN=19 |loss_MIN=8\n|win_ICE=1 |draw_ICE=20 |loss_ICE=9\n|win_IGE=3 |draw_IGE=15 |loss_IGE=12\n|win_PIR=3 |draw_PIR=11 |loss_PIR=16\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_TEX=Texel|short_TEX=TEX\n|name_RUB=RubiChess|short_RUB=RUBP\n|name_NEM=Nemorino|short_NEM=NEM\n|name_GUL=Gull|short_GUL=GUL\n|name_PED=Pedone|short_PED=PED\n|name_WAS=Wasp|short_WAS=WAS\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet|short_VAJ=VAJ\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League One===\nDuring testing for League One, three engines (Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB) did not play because they did not run on [[Wine (software)|Wine]], the [[compatibility layer]] that TCEC is using to run Windows programs on Linux. One further engine (former champion [[Jonny]]) crashed and was not updated in time. As a result, the 5th to 8th-placed engines from League Two, Pedone, Nemorino, Winter and PeSTO, promoted as lucky losers.\n\nIn League One itself, Xiphos, which had just missed out on promotion in Season 16, vaulted to an early lead after scoring five wins with no losses. However, after this bright start, it failed to score more wins. This allowed former Division Premier engine Ethereal to seize first place, in spite of a loss to Komodo MCTS. Fellow competitors Fire and Komodo MCTS also amassed more wins than Xiphos, and by the midway point had overtaken it in the standings. By the final double round-robin, Ethereal, Fire, and Komodo MCTS had more or less secured a playoff spot. Xiphos, who had yet to lose, was barely holding on to fourth place, with rofChade and Defenchess both breathing down its neck. When it lost a crucial game to Fire, it allowed rofChade to pull even, with Defenchess half a point further back. Xiphos knocked Defenchess out of contention with a head-to-head win, but with rofChade having the superior tiebreaks (by number of wins), it needed to either hope for Fire to beat rofChade or to beat Vajolet in its last game. When both games ended drawn, Xiphos finished fifth, again just missing out on promotion.\n\nFor the other engines, Laser, which had pipped Xiphos to a playoff spot last season, was able to remain unbeaten until the final double round-robin. However, it collapsed in that round, losing three games (plus forfeited a fourth due to a crash). Winter scored likely the biggest upset of the league by defeating rofChade once, but the rest of the division was not kind to it and fellow lucky losers Nemorino and PeSTO, with all three engines placing in the bottom four. Former Division Premier engine Fizbo, which had been forced to run at a much slower speed because it was not able to utilize all the hardware available to it, finished solidly last, five points off the pace. \n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|show_matches=false\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|update=complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=cpul1&game=1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|for_against_style=none\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|res_col_header=Q\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result1=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result2=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result3=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result4=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Playoff}}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team1=ETH|team2=FIR|team3=KMC|team4=ROF|team5=XIP|team6=DEF|team7=RUB|team8=AND|team9=LAS|team10=ARA|team11=VAJ|team12=PED|team13=NEM|team14=WIN|team15=PES|team16=FIZ|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ETH=21|draw_ETH=38 |loss_ETH=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIR=18|draw_FIR=42|loss_FIR=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_KMC=13 |draw_KMC=47|loss_KMC=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ROF=13 |draw_ROF=44 |loss_ROF=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_XIP=11|draw_XIP=48 |loss_XIP=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_DEF=13|draw_DEF=42|loss_DEF=5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_RUB=10|draw_RUB=46|loss_RUB=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_AND=8 |draw_AND=49|loss_AND=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_LAS=6 |draw_LAS=50 |loss_LAS=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ARA=12 |draw_ARA=37|loss_ARA=11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PED=9 |draw_PED=37 |loss_PED=14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_VAJ=8 |draw_VAJ=40|loss_VAJ=12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_NEM=6 |draw_NEM=32 |loss_NEM=22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_WIN=6 |draw_WIN=30 |loss_WIN=24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PES=3 |draw_PES=34 |loss_PES=23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIZ=0 |draw_FIZ=30 |loss_FIZ=30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|winpoints=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|drawpoints=0.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|losspoints=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team_header=Engine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIR=Fire |short_FIR=FIR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PED=Pedone |short_PED=PED\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_RUB=RubiChess |short_RUB=RUB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIZ=Fizbo |short_FIZ=FIZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_NEM=Nemorino |short_NEM=NEM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_AND=Andscacs |short_AND=AND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet2 |short_VAJ=VAJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_KMC=KomodoMCTS|short_KMC=KMCP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_DEF=Defenchess|short_DEF=DEF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_LAS=Laser|short_LAS=LAS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_XIP=Xiphos|short_XIP=XIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ARA=Arasan|short_ARA=ARA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ROF=rofChade|short_ROF=ROF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}}\n\n===GPU league===\nThe GPU league was cancelled because only two participants met all the uniqueness criteria: ChessFighter and ScorpioNN.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Both engines automatically qualified to play against the top four engines from the CPU league one.\n\n===Playoff===\nFire convincingly won the playoff for Premier Division in spite of no longer being under development. It finished with a +7 score, defeating all its rivals except ScorpioNN at least once. Komodo MCTS and ScorpioNN both lost two games, but finished comfortably in the top four, with wins against rofChade and ChessFighter. League One winner Ethereal stumbled badly in the playoffs, losing first to rofChade and then to Fire. As a result, the final promotion spot was closely contested. In the penultimate round rofChade temporarily pulled even with Ethereal by defeating ChessFighter, but Ethereal drew against Komodo MCTS to remain half a point ahead. It came down to the direct head-to-head encounter in the final round. rofChade needed to defeat Ethereal with the black pieces, which would've let it qualify because of its superior head-to-head score. However, it did not make any headway, and Ethereal squeaked into the Premier Division, half a point ahead of rofChade.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=playofffordivp&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Premier Division}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=KMC|team3=SCO|team4=ETH|team5=ROF|team6=CF\n\n|win_FIR=7 |draw_FIR=13 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_KMC=6 |draw_KMC=12 |loss_KMC=2\n|win_SCO=3 |draw_SCO=15 |loss_SCO=2\n|win_ETH=1 |draw_ETH=17 |loss_ETH=2\n|win_ROF=3 |draw_ROF=12 |loss_ROF=5\n|win_CF=0  |draw_CF=11 |loss_CF=9\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_KMC=Komodo MCTS|short_KMC=KMC\n|name_SCO=ScorpioNN |short_SCO=SCO\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\n|name_ROF=rofChade |short_ROF=ROF\n|name_CF=ChessFighter |short_CF=CF\n}}\n\n===Premier Division===\nIn an unprecedented move, TCEC played all the CPU-CPU matches first, to minimize rental costs for the GPUs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-17-premier-division-is-now-live/|title=TCEC Season 17 \u2013 Premier Division is now live!|publisher=Chessdom|date=17 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/zAHOIMR</ref>\n\nIn the CPU-CPU matches, defending champion [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] steamrolled its rivals. It defeated [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] and Ethereal twice, scoring six wins in the process, one more than the rest of the division combined. Houdini, which had not been updated for over two years, was further handicapped by only being able to make use of 64 of the 176 available [[thread (computing)|threads]], and was last after the double round robin. Komodo MCTS was the only engine not to lose to Stockfish, but it also failed to score any wins. Fellow promoted engine Fire performed surprisingly well, scoring two wins while losing only to Stockfish. Combined with its run through the lower divisions as well as in Season 16, it set a new TCEC record of 124 games without losing.\n\nIn the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU matches, S16 runner-up AllieStein took an early lead over S16 third-place finisher Lc0, scoring 4 wins to Lc0's 2 in the first round robin. It looked as though the season 16 result, in which AllieStein pipped Lc0 to second place in spite of the latter not losing any games, would be repeated. However, a dramatic second round robin saw Ethereal playing kingmaker. First it defeated AllieStein, then it was defeated by Lc0 after it blundered a 7-man [[endgame tablebase]] draw. After this stroke of good fortune Lc0 went on a winning streak to take the lead, defeating Stoofvlees, Komodo, and Komodo MCTS successively. However Ethereal continued to play kingmaker, this time losing to AllieStein in the reverse game and then defeating Lc0 after the latter blundered in a complicated position (diagram). Lc0 finally effectively eliminated Alliestein with a head-to-head win, which also put her ahead of Stockfish in first place, but the drama was not over as she lost another game to Komodo. This allowed Stockfish the chance to at least tie Lc0 at the top of the standings with a win over Stoofvlees, but it failed to do so. In the end, Lc0 won the premier division for the first time in spite of losing its first premier division games since [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], while Stockfish failed to finish first for the first time since Season 10. \n\nIn the fight to avoid relegation, Houdini, ScorpioNN and Komodo MCTS were quickly left behind, but the final slot was closely-contested. Fire failed to score any more wins after its initial two, but it also only lost two more games, to AllieStein and Lc0. Ethereal, with its giant-slaying performance against Lc0 and AllieStein, had taken a surprising fourth place, ahead of traditional powerhouse [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]]. Stoofvlees had played extremely optimistically and suffered losses to the top three competitors as a result, but scored a head-to-head win against both Komodo and Ethereal while not conceding any other losses. By the final games, Ethereal had successfully reached safety, but Komodo was in real danger of relegating after finding itself in a tight position against Lc0. If it lost and Stockfish beat Stoofvlees in the final game, then it would find itself in a three-way tie with Stoofvlees and Fire, and relegated because it had the worst head-to-head score amongst the three. However, when Lc0 pushed too hard and blundered in a time scramble, the game turned into a win for Komodo that put it ahead of Ethereal and left Fire to relegate.\n\n{{Chess diagram\n|fen=r1q1rb1k/pb4pp/3p1n1N/2p3Q1/3nP3/P1N1B1P1/1P3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 4 24|align=tright|header=Ethereal\u2013Leela Chess Zero|footer=In this complicated position, White is in the midst of an attack against Black's king, but has no forced win.

After both scoring wins as white in the Scandinavian opening in games 43 and 44 respectively, there then followed an extremely tense run of 21 successive draws, with the occasional game being characterised with Leela Chess Zero outplaying Stockfish with the white pieces in the middlegame but being unable to break through Stockfish's extremely accurate defensive play. Leela Chess Zero then scored a crucial victory in game 66 to extend her lead to 3 points, but Stockfish fought back to narrow the gap to 2 points going into the final 12 games. However, Leela Chess Zero finished with a remarkable six wins in the final ten games of the superfinal, and could have won a seventh game were it not for Stockfish finding a brilliant defensive resource in game 100 that Leela did not spot, and was thus able to force a drawn endgame. Leela Chess Zero confirmed herself as champion with wins in games 95 and 96, marking the superfinal's only occurrence of one engine winning the same predetermined opening line as both black and white. Grandmaster [[Mykhaylo Oleksiyenko]] described game 96 as a 'magnificent masterpiece'.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oleksiyenko |first1=Mykhaylo |title=LcZero blunders and completely crushes Stockfish! {{!}} TCEC Superfinal |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6bOnCFc9KI&t=2763s |website=YouTube |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=21 April 2020 |quote=This is magnificent masterpiece from LC0, with long, long-term pawn sacrifice.}}</ref><ref>Games are archived at https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=sf&game=1</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Computer chess competitions]]\n[[Category:2020 in chess]]\n[[Category:Top Chess Engine Championship]]\n", "text_old": "{| class=\"infobox\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:30%;  border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;\"\n |-\n | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:115%\"|'''Winner'''\n | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:115%\"|'''Runner-up'''\n |-\n | width=33% | [[File:Leela Chess Zero logo.svg|center|Leela Chess Zero|140px]]\n | width=33% | \n |-\n | style=\"text-align:center\"|'''[[Leela Chess Zero]]'''\n | style=\"text-align:center\"|'''[[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]]'''\n |-\n | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:200%\"|'''52.5 (17)'''\n | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:200%\"|'''47.5 (12)'''\n |-\n |style=\"text-align:left\"| \u2190 [[TCEC Season 16]]\n |style=\"text-align:right\"| [[TCEC Season 18]] \u2192\n|}\n\nThe 17th season of the [[Top Chess Engine Championship]] began on 2 January 2020. The defending champion is [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], which defeated [[AllieStein]] in the [[TCEC Season 16]] superfinal.\n\nSeason 17 featured for the first time two separate leagues, one for [[GPU]]-based engines and one for [[CPU]]-based engines. TCEC also doubled the computing power available to CPU engines, from 44 cores to 88.\n\n==Overview==\nIn keeping with its identity as a competition run at long time controls on high-end hardware,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|title = TCEC Computer Chess Championship New Season starts August 26th|last = Kosteniuk |first = Alexandra|date = August 15, 2013|website = Chess News Blog|accessdate = October 25, 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063745/http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|archivedate = October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://nypost.com/2013/06/09/engine-super-bowl/|title = Engine Super Bowl|last = Soltis|first = Andy|date = June 9, 2013|website = New York Post|accessdate = October 25, 2013}}</ref> TCEC secured a hardware upgrade for the competing CPU engines.<ref name=\"S17Info\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-s17-detailed-information/|title=TCEC S17 \u2013 detailed information|publisher=Chessdom|date=21 December 2019}}</ref> Among other changes, the number of cores available is doubled from 44 to 88, the operating system used is now [[Linux]], and Syzygy [[endgame tablebases]] are now cached directly in the RAM for faster access. Because this upgrade advantages CPU engines compared to GPU engines, TCEC split the qualification paths to Premier Division by introducing separate leagues for CPU and GPU engines. While an upgrade to the GPU servers is being secured, the CPU leagues are played first.\n\n===Structure===\nFor CPU engines, there will first be a Qualification League consisting of 16 engines, followed by League 2 (16 engines) and League 1 (16 engines). In the Qualification League the top 6 engines promote. In League 2 the top 4 engines promote. The engines in each league are seeded based on their performances in previous seasons. For GPU engines, there will be one league only, with up to 16 competitors. The top 2 GPU engines will then contest a playoff against the top 4 CPU engines in League 1, with the four highest-placing engines promoting to Premier Division.\n\nPremier Division is also expanded from 8 engines to 10. Six engines - [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], [[Leela Chess Zero]], [[AllieStein]], and Stoofvlees - are seeded directly to Premier Division, based on their top 6 finishes in the previous season. Finally, the top two engines in Premier Division qualify for the 100-game superfinal match.\n\n==Results==\n===CPU Qualification League===\nAfter not competing for five seasons, Season 11 Div 3 engine Defenchess trailblazed the qualification league. It scored 18 wins while conceding no losses, finishing 3.5 points clear at the top. It was the only undefeated engine. Demolito and Winter also locked up two of the promotion spots smoothly, but the remaining three slots were closely contested. Among the competitors, Igel was the only engine to not lose to Defenchess and Demolito, but it lost to bottom-half engines FabChess and Topple. Comparatively, iCE was whitewashed by Defenchess and Igel, but it turned in a strong performance against its other rivals, losing only one other game to Winter. Pirarucu went through a tense moment when it lost to Winter in the penultimate round; however, it pulled out a win with Black against Topple to promote. 7th-placed Minic was in a promotion spot all the way up to the final round, when it lost to Gogobello while iCE beat Counter. This left the two tied at 17.5 points. Minic had the better [[Sonneborn\u2013Berger score]], but it also had one crash, and the number of crashes was the first tiebreak. Nonetheless, in a stroke of good fortune for Minic (and 8th-placed PeSTO), the League Two engines chess22k and [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] crashed three times during testing for the division. By TCEC rules, if this happened, the author(s) would have to update the engine or it is disqualified. chess22k's and Fritz's authors were not able to update the engines in time, resulting in Minic and PeSTO promoting as lucky losers.<ref>https://imgur.com/GHNF1Zu</ref>\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=ql&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|result5=WC \n|result6=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League Two}}\n|result7=WB \n|result8=WB \n|col_WB=blue1 |text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League Two (see text)}}\n|team1=DEF|team2=DEM|team3=WIN|team4=PIR|team5=IGE|team6=ICE|team7=MIN|team8=PES|team9=MAR|team10=GOG|team11=TOP|team12=COU|team13=FAB|team14=TUC|team15=ASY|team16=CHE|\n\n|win_DEF=18 |draw_DEF=12 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_DEM=12 |draw_DEM=17 |loss_DEM=1\n|win_WIN=14 |draw_WIN=12 |loss_WIN=4\n|win_PIR=10 |draw_PIR=16 |loss_PIR=4\n|win_IGE=10 |draw_IGE=16 |loss_IGE=4\n|win_ICE=10 |draw_ICE=15 |loss_ICE=5\n|win_MIN=10 |draw_MIN=15 |loss_MIN=5\n|win_PES=8 |draw_PES=17 |loss_PES=5\n|win_MAR=8 |draw_MAR=16 |loss_MAR=6\n|win_GOG=8 |draw_GOG=14 |loss_GOG=8\n|win_TOP=8 |draw_TOP=12 |loss_TOP=10\n|win_COU=4 |draw_COU=12 |loss_COU=14\n|win_FAB=3 |draw_FAB=14 |loss_FAB=13\n|win_TUC=4 |draw_TUC=9 |loss_TUC=17\n|win_ASY=2 |draw_ASY=13 |loss_ASY=15\n|win_CHE=2 |draw_CHE=8 |loss_CHE=20\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_MAR=Marvin |short_MAR=MAR\n|name_GOG=Gogobello |short_GOG=GOG\n|name_TOP=Topple |short_TOP=TOP\n|name_COU=Counter |short_COU=COU\n|name_FAB=FabChess |short_FAB=FAB\n|name_TUC=Tucano |short_TUC=TUC\n|name_ASY=Asymptote |short_ASY=ASY\n|name_CHE=Cheese |short_CHE=CHE\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League Two===\nFormer Premier Division engine Fire won League Two. It had been relegated in [[TCEC Season 16|the previous season]] because its developer had submitted a drastically different neural network-based version that turned out to be significantly weaker. This season, the original, traditional engine played, and it dominated with an undefeated 22/28 (16 wins and 12 draws). It defeated seven engines, including fourth-place Vajolet, 2-0. Second-placed Defenchess also turned in a strong performance, finishing with an undefeated 20.5/28 (13 wins and 15 draws). For the other promoted engines, Winter and PeSTO performed surprisingly well, comfortably finishing above their peers in 7th and 8th respectively. The remaining five promoted engines occupied the bottom five spots and were all relegated along with Wasp (which crashed three times).\n\nAfter the division concluded, in a repeat of testing for League Two, four League One engines either pulled out or did not run on the new Linux operating system, resulting in the 5th-8th placed engines in League One promoting.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=l1&game=1], see also [https://tcecbayeselo.chessdom.org/2020/01/25/tcec-season-17-league2-game-240-defenchess-2-3_dev-igel-2-3-1/] for table with Wasp's score zeroed out\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League One}}\n|result5=WB\n|result6=WB\n|result7=WB\n|result8=WB\n|col_WB=blue1|text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League One (see text)}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=DEF|team3=RUB|team4=VAJ|team5=PED|team6=NEM|team7=WIN|team8=PES|team9=GUL|team10=WAS|team11=TEX|team12=DEM|team13=MIN|team14=ICE|team15=IGE|team16=PIR|\n\n|win_FIR=16|draw_FIR=14 |loss_FIR=0\n|win_DEF=14|draw_DEF=16|loss_DEF=0\n|win_RUB=9 |draw_RUB=19|loss_RUB=2\n|win_VAJ=10 |draw_VAJ=15 |loss_VAJ=5\n|win_PED=7|draw_PED=19 |loss_PED=4\n|win_WIN=6|draw_WIN=18|loss_WIN=6\n|win_PES=6|draw_PES=17|loss_PES=7\n|win_NEM=7 |draw_NEM=15|loss_NEM=8\n|win_GUL=4 |draw_GUL=21 |loss_GUL=5\n|win_WAS=5 |draw_WAS=19 |loss_WAS=6 |status_WAS=D\n|win_DEM=7 |draw_DEM=13 |loss_DEM=10\n|win_TEX=4 |draw_TEX=19 |loss_TEX=7\n|win_MIN=3 |draw_MIN=19 |loss_MIN=8\n|win_ICE=1 |draw_ICE=20 |loss_ICE=9\n|win_IGE=3 |draw_IGE=15 |loss_IGE=12\n|win_PIR=3 |draw_PIR=11 |loss_PIR=16\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_TEX=Texel|short_TEX=TEX\n|name_RUB=RubiChess|short_RUB=RUBP\n|name_NEM=Nemorino|short_NEM=NEM\n|name_GUL=Gull|short_GUL=GUL\n|name_PED=Pedone|short_PED=PED\n|name_WAS=Wasp|short_WAS=WAS\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet|short_VAJ=VAJ\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League One===\nDuring testing for League One, three engines (Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB) did not play because they did not run on [[Wine (software)|Wine]], the [[compatibility layer]] that TCEC is using to run Windows programs on Linux. One further engine (former champion [[Jonny]]) crashed and was not updated in time. As a result, the 5th to 8th-placed engines from League Two, Pedone, Nemorino, Winter and PeSTO, promoted as lucky losers.\n\nIn League One itself, Xiphos, which had just missed out on promotion in Season 16, vaulted to an early lead after scoring five wins with no losses. However, after this bright start, it failed to score more wins. This allowed former Division Premier engine Ethereal to seize first place, in spite of a loss to Komodo MCTS. Fellow competitors Fire and Komodo MCTS also amassed more wins than Xiphos, and by the midway point had overtaken it in the standings. By the final double round-robin, Ethereal, Fire, and Komodo MCTS had more or less secured a playoff spot. Xiphos, who had yet to lose, was barely holding on to fourth place, with rofChade and Defenchess both breathing down its neck. When it lost a crucial game to Fire, it allowed rofChade to pull even, with Defenchess half a point further back. Xiphos knocked Defenchess out of contention with a head-to-head win, but with rofChade having the superior tiebreaks (by number of wins), it needed to either hope for Fire to beat rofChade or to beat Vajolet in its last game. When both games ended drawn, Xiphos finished fifth, again just missing out on promotion.\n\nFor the other engines, Laser, which had pipped Xiphos to a playoff spot last season, was able to remain unbeaten until the final double round-robin. However, it collapsed in that round, losing three games (plus forfeited a fourth due to a crash). Winter scored likely the biggest upset of the league by defeating rofChade once, but the rest of the division was not kind to it and fellow lucky losers Nemorino and PeSTO, with all three engines placing in the bottom four. Former Division Premier engine Fizbo, which had been forced to run at a much slower speed because it was not able to utilize all the hardware available to it, finished solidly last, five points off the pace. \n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|show_matches=false\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|update=complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=cpul1&game=1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|for_against_style=none\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|res_col_header=Q\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result1=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result2=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result3=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result4=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Playoff}}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team1=ETH|team2=FIR|team3=KMC|team4=ROF|team5=XIP|team6=DEF|team7=RUB|team8=AND|team9=LAS|team10=ARA|team11=VAJ|team12=PED|team13=NEM|team14=WIN|team15=PES|team16=FIZ|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ETH=21|draw_ETH=38 |loss_ETH=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIR=18|draw_FIR=42|loss_FIR=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_KMC=13 |draw_KMC=47|loss_KMC=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ROF=13 |draw_ROF=44 |loss_ROF=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_XIP=11|draw_XIP=48 |loss_XIP=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_DEF=13|draw_DEF=42|loss_DEF=5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_RUB=10|draw_RUB=46|loss_RUB=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_AND=8 |draw_AND=49|loss_AND=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_LAS=6 |draw_LAS=50 |loss_LAS=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ARA=12 |draw_ARA=37|loss_ARA=11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PED=9 |draw_PED=37 |loss_PED=14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_VAJ=8 |draw_VAJ=40|loss_VAJ=12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_NEM=6 |draw_NEM=32 |loss_NEM=22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_WIN=6 |draw_WIN=30 |loss_WIN=24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PES=3 |draw_PES=34 |loss_PES=23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIZ=0 |draw_FIZ=30 |loss_FIZ=30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|winpoints=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|drawpoints=0.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|losspoints=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team_header=Engine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIR=Fire |short_FIR=FIR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PED=Pedone |short_PED=PED\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_RUB=RubiChess |short_RUB=RUB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIZ=Fizbo |short_FIZ=FIZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_NEM=Nemorino |short_NEM=NEM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_AND=Andscacs |short_AND=AND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet2 |short_VAJ=VAJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_KMC=KomodoMCTS|short_KMC=KMCP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_DEF=Defenchess|short_DEF=DEF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_LAS=Laser|short_LAS=LAS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_XIP=Xiphos|short_XIP=XIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ARA=Arasan|short_ARA=ARA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ROF=rofChade|short_ROF=ROF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}}\n\n===GPU league===\nThe GPU league was cancelled because only two participants met all the uniqueness criteria: ChessFighter and ScorpioNN.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Both engines automatically qualified to play against the top four engines from the CPU league one.\n\n===Playoff===\nFire convincingly won the playoff for Premier Division in spite of no longer being under development. It finished with a +7 score, defeating all its rivals except ScorpioNN at least once. Komodo MCTS and ScorpioNN both lost two games, but finished comfortably in the top four, with wins against rofChade and ChessFighter. League One winner Ethereal stumbled badly in the playoffs, losing first to rofChade and then to Fire. As a result, the final promotion spot was closely contested. In the penultimate round rofChade temporarily pulled even with Ethereal by defeating ChessFighter, but Ethereal drew against Komodo MCTS to remain half a point ahead. It came down to the direct head-to-head encounter in the final round. rofChade needed to defeat Ethereal with the black pieces, which would've let it qualify because of its superior head-to-head score. However, it did not make any headway, and Ethereal squeaked into the Premier Division, half a point ahead of rofChade.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=playofffordivp&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Premier Division}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=KMC|team3=SCO|team4=ETH|team5=ROF|team6=CF\n\n|win_FIR=7 |draw_FIR=13 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_KMC=6 |draw_KMC=12 |loss_KMC=2\n|win_SCO=3 |draw_SCO=15 |loss_SCO=2\n|win_ETH=1 |draw_ETH=17 |loss_ETH=2\n|win_ROF=3 |draw_ROF=12 |loss_ROF=5\n|win_CF=0  |draw_CF=11 |loss_CF=9\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_KMC=Komodo MCTS|short_KMC=KMC\n|name_SCO=ScorpioNN |short_SCO=SCO\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\n|name_ROF=rofChade |short_ROF=ROF\n|name_CF=ChessFighter |short_CF=CF\n}}\n\n===Premier Division===\nIn an unprecedented move, TCEC played all the CPU-CPU matches first, to minimize rental costs for the GPUs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-17-premier-division-is-now-live/|title=TCEC Season 17 \u2013 Premier Division is now live!|publisher=Chessdom|date=17 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/zAHOIMR</ref>\n\nIn the CPU-CPU matches, defending champion [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] steamrolled its rivals. It defeated [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] and Ethereal twice, scoring six wins in the process, one more than the rest of the division combined. Houdini, which had not been updated for over two years, was further handicapped by only being able to make use of 64 of the 176 available [[thread (computing)|threads]], and was last after the double round robin. Komodo MCTS was the only engine not to lose to Stockfish, but it also failed to score any wins. Fellow promoted engine Fire performed surprisingly well, scoring two wins while losing only to Stockfish. Combined with its run through the lower divisions as well as in Season 16, it set a new TCEC record of 124 games without losing.\n\nIn the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU matches, S16 runner-up AllieStein took an early lead over S16 third-place finisher Lc0, scoring 4 wins to Lc0's 2 in the first round robin. It looked as though the season 15 result, in which AllieStein pipped Lc0 to second place in spite of the latter not losing any games, would be repeated. However, a dramatic second round robin saw Ethereal playing kingmaker. First it defeated AllieStein, then it was defeated by Lc0 after it blundered a 7-man [[endgame tablebase]] draw. After this stroke of good fortune Lc0 went on a winning streak to take the lead, defeating Stoofvlees, Komodo, and Komodo MCTS successively. However Ethereal continued to play kingmaker, this time losing to AllieStein in the reverse game and then defeating Lc0 after the latter blundered in a complicated position (diagram). Lc0 finally effectively eliminated Alliestein with a head-to-head win, which also put her ahead of Stockfish in first place, but the drama was not over as she lost another game to Komodo. This allowed Stockfish the chance to at least tie Lc0 at the top of the standings with a win over Stoofvlees, but it failed to do so. In the end, Lc0 won the premier division for the first time in spite of losing its first premier division games since [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], while Stockfish failed to finish first for the first time since Season 10. \n\nIn the fight to avoid relegation, Houdini, ScorpioNN and Komodo MCTS were quickly left behind, but the final slot was closely-contested. Fire failed to score any more wins after its initial two, but it also only lost two more games, to AllieStein and Lc0. Ethereal, with its giant-slaying performance against Lc0 and AllieStein, had taken a surprising fourth place, ahead of traditional powerhouse [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]]. Stoofvlees had played extremely optimistically and suffered losses to the top three competitors as a result, but scored a head-to-head win against both Komodo and Ethereal while not conceding any other losses. By the final games, Ethereal had successfully reached safety, but Komodo was in real danger of relegating after finding itself in a tight position against Lc0. If it lost and Stockfish beat Stoofvlees in the final game, then it would find itself in a three-way tie with Stoofvlees and Fire, and relegated because it had the worst head-to-head score amongst the three. However, when Lc0 pushed too hard and blundered in a time scramble, the game turned into a win for Komodo that put it ahead of Ethereal and left Fire to relegate.\n\n{{Chess diagram\n|fen=r1q1rb1k/pb4pp/3p1n1N/2p3Q1/3nP3/P1N1B1P1/1P3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 4 24|align=tright|header=Ethereal\u2013Leela Chess Zero|footer=In this complicated position, White is in the midst of an attack against Black's king, but has no forced win.

After both scoring wins as white in the Scandinavian opening in games 43 and 44 respectively, there then followed an extremely tense run of 21 successive draws, with the occasional game being characterised with Leela Chess Zero outplaying Stockfish with the white pieces in the middlegame but being unable to break through Stockfish's extremely accurate defensive play. Leela Chess Zero then scored a crucial victory in game 66 to extend her lead to 3 points, but Stockfish fought back to narrow the gap to 2 points going into the final 12 games. However, Leela Chess Zero finished with a remarkable six wins in the final ten games of the superfinal, and could have won a seventh game were it not for Stockfish finding a brilliant defensive resource in game 100 that Leela did not spot, and was thus able to force a drawn endgame. Leela Chess Zero confirmed herself as champion with wins in games 95 and 96, marking the superfinal's only occurrence of one engine winning the same predetermined opening line as both black and white.
