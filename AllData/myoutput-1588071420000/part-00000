Forty-five years later, Herzl's remains  were brought to Israel and re-interred in Jerusalem.

Only in 1964 did Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] decide in favor of burying him there, in the interest of promoting national reconciliation and setting aside political grievances. Soldiers awarded with the [[Medal of Valor (Israel)|Medal of Valor]] may also be buried at Mount Herzl.\n\nTo the north of Herzl's grave is a plot reserved for the leaders of the (World) Zionist Organization, among them [[David Wolffsohn]], [[Nahum Sokolow]], [[Simcha Dinitz]], and [[Arieh Dulzin]].

Only in 1964 did Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] decide in favor of burying him there, in the interest of promoting national reconciliation and setting aside political grievances. Soldiers awarded with the [[Medal of Valor (Israel)|Medal of Valor]] may also be buried at Mount Herzl.\n\nTo the north of Herzl's grave is a plot reserved for the leaders of the (World) Zionist Organization, among them [[David Wolffsohn]], [[Nahum Sokolow]], [[Simcha Dinitz]], and [[Arieh Dulzin]].
