In military operations, the object is to rapidly clear a path through a minefield, and this is often done with devices such as [[mine plow]]s and blast waves. By contrast, the goal of ''humanitarian demining'' is to remove all of the landmines to a given depth and make the land safe for human use. Specially trained dogs are also used to narrow down the search and verify that an area is cleared. Mechanical devices such as flails and excavators are sometimes used to clear mines.\n\nA great variety of methods for detecting landmines have been studied. These include electromagnetic methods, one of which ([[ground penetrating radar]]) has been employed in tandem with metal detectors. Acoustic methods can sense the cavity created by mine casings. Sensors have been developed to detect vapor leaking from landmines. Animals such as rats and mongooses can safely move over a minefield and detect mines, and animals can also be used to screen air samples over potential minefields. Bees, plants and bacteria are also potentially useful. Explosives in landmines can also be detected directly using nuclear quadrupole resonance and neutron probes.\n\nDetection and removal of landmines is a dangerous activity, and [[personal protective equipment]] does not protect against all types of landmine. Once found, mines are generally defused or blown up with more explosives, but it is possible to destroy them with certain chemicals or extreme heat without making them explode.\n\n== Land mines ==\n{{main|Land mine}}\n[[File:PROM-1 bounding landmine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[PROM-1]] bounding landmine.

Anti-tank mines are designed to damage tanks or other vehicles; they are usually larger and require at least {{convert|100|kg|lb}} of force to trigger, so infantry will not set them off.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mine Awareness Day - factsheet |url=https://www.una.org.uk/mine-awareness-day-factsheet |website=United Nations Association |accessdate=8 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAnti-personnel mines are designed to maim or kill soldiers. There are over 350 types, but they come in two main groups: ''blast'' and ''[[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]]''. Blast mines are buried close to the surface and triggered by pressure. A weight between {{convert|4|and|24|lb|kg}}, the weight of a small child, is usually enough to set one off. They are usually cylindrical with a diameter of {{convert|2|-|4|in|cm}} and a height of {{convert|1.3|-|3.0|in|cm}}. Fragmentation mines are designed to explode outwards, in some cases \"bounding\" upward and exploding above the ground, resulting in casualties as much as 100 metres away. Their size varies and they are mostly metal, so they are easily detected by metal detectors. However, they are normally activated by tripwires that can be up to 20 metres away from the mine, so tripwire detection is essential.<ref name=\"MacDonald 2003 3\u20135\">{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=3\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThe casing of blast mines may be made of metal, wood or plastic.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|p=4}}</ref> Some mines, referred to as [[minimum metal mine]]s, are constructed with as little metal as possible \u2013 as little as {{convert|1|g|oz}} \u2013 to make them difficult to detect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=The Arms Project of Human Rights Watch |last2=Physicians for Human Rights |title=Landmines : a deadly legacy |date=1993 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=9781564321138 |page=[https://archive.org/details/landminesdeadlyl00arms/page/242 242] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/landminesdeadlyl00arms/page/242 }}</ref> Common explosives used in land mines include [[TNT]] ({{chem|C|7|H|5|N|3|O|6}}), [[RDX]] ({{chem|C|3|H|6|N|6|O|6}}), [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate]] (PETN, {{chem|O|12|N|8|C|4|H|8}}), [[HMX]] ({{chem|O|8|N|8|C|4|H|8}}) and [[ammonium nitrate]] ({{chem|O|3|N|2|H|4}}).<ref name=Kregar>{{cite web |last1=Kregar |first1=Matija |title=Detection of Landmines and Explosives Using Neutrons |url=http://mafija.fmf.uni-lj.si/seminar/files/2015_2016/Detection_of_Landmines_and_Explosives_Using_Neutrons.pdf |website=Department of Mathematics and Physics |publisher=[[University of Ljubljana]] |accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLand mines are found in about 60 countries. Deminers must cope with environments that include deserts, jungles and urban environments. Antitank mines are deeply buried while antipersonnel mines are usually within 6 inches of the surface. They may be placed by hand or scattered from airplanes, in regular or irregular patterns. In urban environments, fragments of destroyed buildings may hide them; in rural environments, soil erosion may cover them or displace them. Detectors can be confused by high-metal soils and junk. Thus, demining presents a considerable engineering challenge.<ref name=Ingenia>{{cite journal |last1=Peyton |first1=Anthony |last2=Daniels |first2=David |title=Detecting landmines for a safer world |journal=Ingenia |date=June 2018 |volume=75 |pages=19\u201323 |url=https://www.ingenia.org.uk/Ingenia/Articles/2f67b8a4-4fee-4fc2-88d7-f0c535b0dc89}}</ref>\n\n== Goals ==\n=== Military ===\n{{See also|Route clearance (IEDs)}}\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B7342.jpg|thumb|British Army sappers clearing a beach front in Normandy (1944)]]\nIn military demining, the goal is to create a safe path for troops and equipment.

Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty are required to clear all mines within 10 years of joining the treaty, and as of 2017, 28 countries had succeeded.

This begins with ''non-technical survey'', gathering records of mine placement and accidents from mines, interviewing former combatants and locals, noting locations of warning signs and unused agricultural land, and going to look at possible sites.

A deminer advances along a lane, swinging a metal detector close to the ground. When metal is detected, the deminer prods the object with a stick or stainless steel probe to determine whether it is a mine. If a mine is found, it must be deactivated.<ref name=RANDp6/>\n\nAlthough conventional demining is slow (5\u2013150 square metres cleared per day), it is reliable, so it is still the most commonly used method.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=134}}</ref> Integration with other methods such as explosive sniffing dogs can increase its reliability.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=137}}</ref>\n\nDemining is a dangerous occupation. If a mine is prodded too hard or it is not detected, the deminer can suffer injury or death. The large number of false positives from metal detectors can make deminers tired and careless. According to one report, there is one such incident for every 1000\u20132000 mines cleared. 35 percent of the accidents occur during mine excavation and 24 percent result from missed mines.<ref name=RANDpp7-11/>\n\n=== Prodders ===\nIn [[World War II]], the primary method of locating mines was by prodding the ground with a pointed stick or bayonet. Modern tools for prodding range from a military prodder to a screwdriver or makeshift object.<ref name=Contact>{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Kevin |title=Appendix W: Contact methods |pages=327\u2013336}}. In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003}}</ref> They are inserted at shallow angles (30 degrees or less) to probe the sides of potential mines, avoiding the triggering mechanism that is usually on top. This method requires the deminer's head and hands to be near the mine. Rakes may also be used when the terrain is soft (e.g., sandy beaches); the deminer is further away from the mine and the rake can be used to either prod or scoop up mines from beneath.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=136}}</ref>\n\n=== Metal detectors ===\n[[File:Detecteur de metal 501607 fh000007.jpg|thumb|Foerster Minex 2FD 4.500 [[metal detector]] used by the [[French army]].]]\nMetal detectors used by deminers work on the same principles as detectors used in World War I and refined during World War II.<ref name=RANDpp7-11>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=7\u201311}}</ref> A practical design by Polish officer [[J\u00f3zef Kosacki]], known as the [[Polish mine detector]], was used to clear German mine fields during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Modelski |first1=Tadeusz |title=The Polish contribution to the ultimate allied victory in the Second World War |date=1986 |publisher=Tadeusz Modelski |isbn=9780951117101|page=221}}</ref>\n\nAlthough metal detectors have become much lighter, more sensitive and easy to operate than the early models, the basic principle is still [[electromagnetic induction]]. Current through a wire coil produces a time-varying magnetic field that in turn induces currents in conductive objects in the ground. In turn, these currents generate a magnetic field that induces currents in a receiver coil, and the resulting changes in [[electric potential]] can be used to detect metal objects. Similar devices are used by hobbyists.<ref name=RANDpp7-11/>\n\nNearly all mines contain enough metal to be detectable. No detector finds all mines, and the performance depends on factors such as the soil, type of mine and depth of burial. An international study in 2001 found that the most effective detector found 91 percent of the test mines in clay soil but only 71 percent in iron-rich soil. The worst detector found only 11 percent even in clay soils. The results can be improved by multiple passes.<ref name=RANDpp7-11/>\n\nAn even greater problem is the number of [[false positive]]s. Minefields contain many other fragments of metal, including [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]], bullet casings, and metallic minerals. 100\u20131000 such objects are found for every real mine. The greater the sensitivity, the more false positives.

A blast shield protects the driver and the cabin is designed to deflect projectiles.<ref name=DSTA/> Mine flail effectiveness can approach 100% in ideal conditions, but clearance rates as low as 50\u201360% have been reported.<ref>{{harvnb|Mechanical Application in Demining|pp=62\u201364}}</ref>\n\nFirst used in World War I with tanks, rollers are designed to detonate mines; blast-resistant vehicles with steel wheels, such as the [[Casspir]], serve a similar purpose. However, those used in humanitarian demining cannot withstand the blast from an anti-tank mine, so their use must be preceded by careful surveying. Unlike flails and tillers, they only destroy functioning mines, and even those do not always explode.<ref>{{harvnb|Mechanical Application in Demining|pp=35\u201338}}</ref><ref name=DSTA/>\n\nExcavation, the removal of soil to a given depth, is done using modified construction vehicles such as [[bulldozer]]s, [[excavator]]s, [[front-end loader]]s, [[tractor]]s and soil sifters. Armor plates and reinforced glass are added. Removed soil is sifted and inspected. It can also be fed through an industrial rock crusher, which is robust enough to withstand blasts from antipersonnel mines. Excavation is a reliable way of clearing an area to a depth that other mechanical systems cannot reach, and it has been used in several countries. In particular, the [[HALO Trust]] estimates that their excavation program destroys mines about 7 times faster than manual deminers.<ref>{{harvnb|Mechanical Application in Demining|pp=31\u201335}}</ref><ref name=DSTA/>\n\nA 2004 study by the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining concluded that the data on the performance of mechanical demining systems was poor, and perhaps as a result, they were not being used as the primary clearance system (with the exception of excavators).<ref>{{harvnb|Mechanical Application in Demining|p=4}}</ref> However, by 2014, confidence in these systems had increased to the point where some deminers were using them as primary clearance systems.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=140}}</ref>\n\nMechanical demining techniques have some challenges. In steep, undulating terrain they may skip over some of the ground. Operators can be endangered by defective mines or mines with delay charges that detonate after the blast shield has passed over; [[shaped charge]] mines that are capable of piercing most armor; and intelligent mines that are off to the side and use a variety of sensors to decide when to fire a rocket at an armored vehicle.<ref name=DSTA/> One answer is to use remote controlled vehicles such as the [[Caterpillar D7]] MCAP (United States) and the [[IDF Caterpillar D9|Caterpillar D9]] (Israel).\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" >\nFile:M4a4 flail cfb borden 1.JPG|World War II [[M4 Sherman]] tank fitted with a flail\nhydrema mine cleaning vehicle.jpg|[[Hydrema]] mine clearing vehicles use flails.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pike|first1=John|title=Hydrema 910 Mine Clearing Vehicle|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/hydrema.htm|website=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>\nCasspir vehicle Ai101503g1.jpg|The [[Casspir]], a steel, armor-bodied [[V-hull]]ed vehicle de-mining [[Bagram Air Base]]\nD9-IDF-1460a.jpg|IDF Caterpillar D9 uses a standard blade or a special mineplow\n</gallery>\n\n==== Smart prodders ====\nDespite advances in mine detection technology, \"mine detection boils down to rows of nervous people wearing blast-resistant clothing and creeping laboriously across a field, prodding the ground ahead to check for buried objects.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=<!-- Staff writer --> |title=Using fluorescent bacteria to find landmines |url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2017/04/20/using-fluorescent-bacteria-to-find-landmines |accessdate=4 April 2019 |work=The Economist |date=20 April 2017}}</ref> Often, especially when the soil is hard, they unwittingly apply too much force and risk detonating a mine.

One quantitative measure is a [[receiver operating characteristic]] (ROC) curve, which measures the tradeoff between false positives and false negatives. Ideally, there should be a high probability of detection with few false positives,<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|p=8}}</ref> but such curves have not been obtained for most of the technologies.<ref name=RANDp15/> Also, even if field tests were available for all technologies, they may not be comparable because performance depends on a myriad of factors, including the size, shape and composition of the mines; their depth and orientation; the type of explosive; environmental conditions; and performance of human operators. Most field tests have taken place in conditions that favor the performance of the technology, leading to overestimates of their performance.<ref name=RANDp15/>\n\n=== Electromagnetic ===\n\n====Ground-penetrating radar====\n[[Ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR) probes the ground using [[radar]]. A GPR device emits [[radio wave]]s; these waves are reflected at discontinuities in [[permittivity]] and one or more antennae pick up the return signal. The signal is analyzed to determine the shapes and locations of the reflectors. Discontinuities occur between materials with different [[dielectric constant]]s such as a landmine, a rock and soil.<ref name=RANDpp19to21>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=19\u201321}}</ref> Unlike metal detectors, GPR devices can detect nonmetallic mine casings.<ref name=Comparative>{{harvnb|Kasban et al.|2010|pages=89\u2013112}}</ref> However, radio waves have wavelengths that are comparable to the dimensions of landmines, so the images have low resolution.<ref name=Ingenia/> The wavelength can be varied; smaller wavelengths give better image quality but cannot penetrate as far into the soil. This tradeoff in performance depends on soil properties and other environmental factors as well as the properties of the mines. In particular, [[attenuation]] in wet soils can make it difficult to spot mines deeper than 4 centimetres, while low-frequency radar will \"bounce\" off small plastic mines near the surface. Although GPR is a mature technology for other applications such as searching for archaeological artifacts, the effect of those factors on mine detection is still not adequately understood, and GPR is not widely used for demining.<ref name=RANDpp19to21/>\n\nGPR can be used with a metal detector and data-fusion algorithms to greatly reduce the false alarms generated by metallic clutter. One such dual-sensor device, the Handheld Standoff Mine Detection System (HSTAMIDS) became the standard mine detector of the U.S. Army in 2006. For humanitarian demining, it was tested in Cambodia for a variety of soil conditions and mine types, detecting 5,610 mines and correctly identifying 96.5% of the clutter. Another dual detector developed by [[ERA Technology Ltd|ERA Technology]], the Cobham VMR3 Minehound, had similar success in Bosnia, Cambodia and Angola. These dual-sensor devices are relatively light and cheap, and the HALO Trust has begun to deploy more of them around the world.<ref name=Ingenia/>\n\n==== Infrared and hyperspectral ====\nSoil absorbs radiation from the Sun and is heated, with a resulting change in the [[infrared]] radiation that it emits. Landmines are better insulators than soil. As a result, the soil overhead tends to heat faster during the day and cool faster at night. [[Thermography]] uses [[infrared]] sensors to detect anomalies in the heating and cooling cycle.<ref name=Baertlein>{{cite book |last1=Baertlein |first1=Brian |title=Infrared/hyperspectral methods (Paper I)}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=93\u2013110}}</ref><ref name=Comparative/> The effect can be enhanced using a heat source.<ref>{{harvnb|Makki|2017|p=20}}</ref> The act of burying a mine also affects the soil properties, with small particles tending to collect near the surface. This tends to suppress the frequency-dependent characteristics that are evident in the larger particles. [[Hyperspectral imaging]], which senses dozens of frequency bands ranging from visible light to [[long-wave infrared]], can detect this effect. Finally, [[polarization (waves)|polarized]] light reflecting off man-made materials tend to remain polarized while natural materials depolarize it; the difference can be seen using a [[polarimeter]].<ref name=Ackenhusen>{{cite book |last1=Ackenhusen |first1=John G. |title=Infrared/hyperspectral methods (Paper II)}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=111\u2013125}}</ref>\n\nThe above methods can be used from a safe distance, including on airborne platforms. The detector technology is well developed and the main challenge is to process and interpret the images.<ref name=Ackenhusen/> The algorithms are underdeveloped and have trouble coping with the extreme dependence of performance on environmental conditions. Many of the surface effects are strongest just after the mine is buried and are soon removed by weathering.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|p=26}}</ref>\n\n==== Electrical impedance tomography ====\n[[Electrical impedance tomography]] (EIT) maps out the [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] of the ground using a two-dimensional grid of electrodes. Pairs of electrodes receive a small current and the resulting voltages measured on the remaining electrodes. The data are analyzed to construct a map of the conductivity. Both metallic and non-metallic mines will show up as anomalies.<ref name=EIT>{{cite journal |last1=Church |first1=Philip |title=Electrical impedance tomography |pages=}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=161\u2013168}}.</ref><ref name=McFee2005>{{cite report|last1=McFee |first1=J.

Metals strongly absorb x-rays and little is reflected back, while organic materials absorb little and reflect a lot.<ref name=Grodzins>{{cite journal |last1=Grodzins |first1=Lee |title=X-ray backscatter (paper I)}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=191\u2013204}}.</ref> Methods that use [[collimator]]s to narrow the beams are not suitable for demining because the collimators are heavy and high-power sources are required. The alternative is to use wide beams and [[deconvolution|deconvolve]] the signal using spatial filters. The medical industry has driven improvements in x-ray technology, so portable x-ray generators are available. In principle, the short wavelength would allow high-resolution images, but it may take too long because the intensity must be kept low to limit exposure of humans to the radiation. Also, only mines less than 10 centimetres deep would be imaged.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\n=== Explosive vapor detection ===\nA buried mine will almost always leak explosives through the casing. 95 percent of this will be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] by the soil, but the other 5 percent will mostly dissolve in water and be transported away. If it gets to the surface, it leaves a chemical signature. TNT [[biodegradation|biodegrades]] within a few days in soil, but an impurity, [[2,4-Dinitrotoluene]] (2,4-DNT), lasts much longer and has a high vapor pressure. Thus, it is the primary target for chemical detection. However, the concentrations are very small, particularly in dry conditions. A reliable vapor detection system needs to detect 10<sup>\u221218</sup> grams of 2,4-DNT per millilitre of air in very dry soil or 10<sup>\u221215</sup> grams per millilitre in moist soil. Biological detectors are very effective, but some chemical sensors are being developed.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=29\u201331}}</ref>\n\n==== Honey bees ====\n{{main|Hymenoptera training}}\n[[Honey bee]]s can be used to locate mines in two ways: passive sampling and active detection. In passive sampling, their mop-like hairs, which are electrostatically charged, collect a variety of particles including chemicals leaking from explosives. The chemicals are also present in water that they bring back and air that they breathe. Methods such as [[solid phase microextraction]], sorbent [[sol-gel]]s, [[gas chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]] can be used to identify explosive chemicals in the hive.<ref name=RANDbees>{{cite book |last1=Bromenshenk |first1=J.

When targets were placed consisting of small amounts of 2.4-DNT mixed with sand, they detect vapor plumes from the source several meters away and follow them to the source. Bees make thousands of foraging flights per day, and over time high concentrations of bees occur over targets. The most challenging issue is tracking them when a bee can fly 3\u20135 kilometres before returning to the hive.

After the war ended in 2002, they started returning, but Angola was littered with millions of landmines. A biologist noticed that the elephants soon learned to avoid them. In a study in South Africa, researchers found that some elephants could detect TNT samples with a high sensitivity, missing only one out of 97 samples. They were 5% more likely to indicate the presence of TNT than dogs, but 6% less likely to miss a sample (the more important measure of success).

Unfortunately, there is no strain of bacteria capable of detecting [[RDX]], another common explosive, and the bacteria may not be visible under desert conditions.

Each compound has a unique set of resonance frequencies.<ref name=Garroway/> Unlike a metal detector, NQR does not have false positives from other objects in the ground. Instead, the main performance issue is the low ratio of the signal to the random thermal noise in the detector. This [[signal-to-noise ratio]] can be increased by increasing the interrogation time, and in principle the probability of detection can be near unity and the probability of false alarm low. Unfortunately, the most common explosive material (TNT) has the weakest signal. Also, its resonance frequencies are in the [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] band and can be overwhelmed by radio broadcasts. Finally, it cannot see through metal casing or detect liquid explosives.

According to a RAND study in 2003, \"Virtually every conceivable nuclear reaction has been examined, but ... only a few have potential for mine detection.\"<ref name=McFee2003/> In particular, reactions that emit charged particles can be eliminated because they do not travel far in the ground,<ref name=McFee2003/> and methods involving transmission of neutrons through the medium (useful in applications such as airport security) are not feasible because the detector and receiver cannot be placed on opposite sides. This leaves emission of radiation from targets and scattering of neutrons.<ref name=Rosengard>{{cite journal|last1=Rosengard |first1=Ulf |last2=Dolan |first2=Thomas |last3=Miklush |first3=Dmitri |last4=Samiei |first4=Massoud \n|date=2001 |title=Humanitarian demining: Nuclear techniques may help the search for landmines |journal=IAEA Bulletin |volume=43 |pages=16\u201318 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330601661 |accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref> For neutron detectors to be portable, they must be able to detect landmines efficiently with low-intensity beams so that little shielding is needed to protect human operators. One factor that determines the efficiency is the [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] of the nuclear reaction; if it is large, a neutron does not have to come as close to a nucleus to interact with it.<ref name=McFee2003/>\n\nOne possible [[neutron source|source of neutrons]] is [[spontaneous fission]] from a radioactive isotope, most commonly \n[[isotopes of californium|californium-252]].

One such reaction, [[Isotopes of nitrogen|nitrogen-14]] captures a neutron to make nitrogen-15, releasing a [[gamma ray]] with energy 10.835 MeV.<ref name=McFee2003/> No other naturally occurring isotope emits a photon with such a high energy,<ref name=Rosengard/> and there are few transitions that emit nearly as much energy, so detectors do not need high energy resolution.<ref name=McFee2003/> Also, nitrogen has a large cross section for thermal neutrons.<ref name=Rosengard/> The Canadian Army has deployed a multi-detector vehicle, the Improved Landmine Detection System, with a TNA detector to confirm the presence of anti-tank mines that were spotted by other instruments.<ref name=Rosengard/> However, the time required to detect antipersonnel mines is prohibitively long, especially if they are deeper than a few centimeters, and a human-portable detector is considered unachievable.<ref name=McFee2003/>\n\nAn alternative neutron detector uses fast neutrons that enter the ground and are moderated by it; the flux of thermal neutrons scattered back is measured.

A typical demining process deployed by the Chinese is as follows. Firebreaks are dug around the minefield to be cleared. Then engineers would set the minefield on fire with flamethrowers. Key factors of this burning process are: thick vegetation covering the minefields; most anti-personnel mines are buried very close to the ground level; the mines are made of mostly either wood, thin metal or plastic. This burning process would usually destroy about 90% of the mines, as the mines are either detonated or melted. Mines which have trip wires would have these wires burned off. Demining teams then would plow the area with mine detectors. When the teams have cleared the mines, they would walk over the field hand in hand themselves to show to the locals that all the mines have been cleared.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2004/china|title=China , Landmine Monitor Report 2004|publisher=Icbl.org|date=|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Aftermath: The Remnants of War (film)|''Aftermath: The Remnants of War'' (film)]]\n* [[Bomb disposal]]\n* [[Center for International Stabilization and Recovery]]\n* [[Counter-IED efforts]]\n* [[Land mines in Central America]]\n* [[Mines Advisory Group]]\n* [[Mine clearance agency]]\n* [[MineWolf Systems]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title=A Guide to Mine Action |date=March 2014 |publisher=Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining |location=Geneva, Switzerland |isbn=978-2940369-48-5 |edition=5th |url=https://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/GICHD-resources/rec-documents/Guide-to-mine-action-2014.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2019|ref={{harvid|GICHD Guide to Mine Action}}}}\n*{{cite report |last1=Cumming-Bruce |first1=Nick |last2=Frost |first2=Alex |last3=Harrison |first3=Katherine |last4=Pinches |first4=Lucy |title=Clearing the mines 2018 |date=1 October 2018 |publisher=Mine Action Review |url=http://www.mineactionreview.org/documents-and-reports/clearing-the-mines-2018 |accessdate=16 May 2019}}\n*{{cite journal|title=A Study of Mechanical Application in Demining|publisher=Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining|year=2004|url=http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/publications/Mechanical_study/Mechanical_study_complete.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2007|ref={{harvid|Mechanical Application in Demining}}|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928141042/http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/publications/Mechanical_study/Mechanical_study_complete.pdf|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}\n*{{cite book |last=Fisher|first=Mark |chapter=7.

In military operations, the object is to rapidly clear a path through a minefield, and this is often done with devices such as [[mine plow]]s and blast waves. By contrast, the goal of ''humanitarian demining'' is to remove all of the landmines to a given depth and make the land safe for human use. Specially trained dogs are also used to narrow down the search and verify that an area is cleared. Mechanical devices such as flails and excavators are sometimes used to clear mines.\n\nA great variety of methods for detecting landmines have been studied. These include electromagnetic methods, one of which ([[ground penetrating radar]]) has been employed in tandem with metal detectors. Acoustic methods can sense the cavity created by mine casings. Sensors have been developed to detect vapor leaking from landmines. Animals such as rats and mongooses can safely move over a minefield and detect mines, and animals can also be used to screen air samples over potential minefields. Bees, plants and bacteria are also potentially useful. Explosives in landmines can also be detected directly using nuclear quadrupole resonance and neutron probes.\n\nDetection and removal of landmines is a dangerous activity, and [[personal protective equipment]] does not protect against all types of landmine. Once found, mines are generally defused or blown up with more explosives, but it is possible to destroy them with certain chemicals or extreme heat without making them explode.\n\n== Land mines ==\n{{main|Land mine}}\n[[File:PROM-1 bounding landmine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[PROM-1]] bounding landmine. Normally it is buried so only the prongs are visible.]]\nLand mines overlap with other categories of explosive devices, including [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXOs), [[booby trap]]s and [[improvised explosive devices]] (IEDs). In particular, most mines are factory-built, but the definition of landmine can include \"artisanal\" (improvised) mines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keeley |first=Robert |date=2017 |title=Improvised Explosive Devices (IED): A Humanitarian Mine Action Perspective |journal=Journal of Conventional Weapons Destruction |volume=21 |issue=1 |page=Article 3 |url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cisr-journal/vol21/iss1/3 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref> Thus, the [[United Nations Mine Action Service]] includes mitigation of IEDs in its mission.<ref>{{cite web |title=Improvised explosive device threat mitigation |url=https://www.unmas.org/en/improvised-explosive-device-threat-mitigation |website=UNMAS |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref> Injuries from IEDs are much more serious,<ref>{{cite news |title=Improvised explosive devices inflict much more serious injuries than land mines |url=https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/improvised-explosive-devices-inflict-much-more-serious-injuries-than-land-mines/ |accessdate=11 March 2019 |work=BMJ newsroom}}</ref> but factory-built landmines are longer lasting and often more plentiful.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Oppenheimer |first1=Andy |title=Demining: Ridding Lands of a Deadly Legacy |url=http://www.cbrneportal.com/11456-2/ |accessdate=8 March 2019 |work=CBRNe Portal |date=6 February 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Over 1999\u20132016, yearly casualties from landmines and unexploded ordnance have varied between 9,228 and 3,450.

Anti-tank mines are designed to damage tanks or other vehicles; they are usually larger and require at least {{convert|100|kg|lb}} of force to trigger, so infantry will not set them off.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mine Awareness Day - factsheet |url=https://www.una.org.uk/mine-awareness-day-factsheet |website=United Nations Association |accessdate=8 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAnti-personnel mines are designed to maim or kill soldiers. There are over 350 types, but they come in two main groups: ''blast'' and ''[[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]]''. Blast mines are buried close to the surface and triggered by pressure. A weight between {{convert|4|and|24|lb|kg}}, the weight of a small child, is usually enough to set one off. They are usually cylindrical with a diameter of {{convert|2|-|4|in|cm}} and a height of {{convert|1.3|-|3.0|in|cm}}. Fragmentation mines are designed to explode outwards, in some cases \"bounding\" upward and exploding above the ground, resulting in casualties as much as 100 metres away. Their size varies and they are mostly metal, so they are easily detected by metal detectors. However, they are normally activated by tripwires that can be up to 20 metres away from the mine, so tripwire detection is essential.<ref name=\"MacDonald 2003 3\u20135\">{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=3\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThe casing of blast mines may be made of metal, wood or plastic.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|p=4}}</ref> Some mines, referred to as [[minimum metal mine]]s, are constructed with as little metal as possible \u2013 as little as {{convert|1|g|oz}} \u2013 to make them difficult to detect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=The Arms Project of Human Rights Watch |last2=Physicians for Human Rights |title=Landmines : a deadly legacy |date=1993 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=9781564321138 |page=[https://archive.org/details/landminesdeadlyl00arms/page/242 242] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/landminesdeadlyl00arms/page/242 }}</ref> Common explosives used in land mines include [[TNT]] ({{chem|C|7|H|5|N|3|O|6}}), [[RDX]] ({{chem|C|3|H|6|N|6|O|6}}), [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate]] (PETN, {{chem|O|12|N|8|C|4|H|8}}), [[HMX]] ({{chem|O|8|N|8|C|4|H|8}}) and [[ammonium nitrate]] ({{chem|O|3|N|2|H|4}}).<ref name=Kregar>{{cite web |last1=Kregar |first1=Matija |title=Detection of Landmines and Explosives Using Neutrons |url=http://mafija.fmf.uni-lj.si/seminar/files/2015_2016/Detection_of_Landmines_and_Explosives_Using_Neutrons.pdf |website=Department of Mathematics and Physics |publisher=[[University of Ljubljana]] |accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLand mines are found in about 60 countries. Deminers must cope with environments that include deserts, jungles and urban environments. Antitank mines are deeply buried while antipersonnel mines are usually within 6 inches of the surface. They may be placed by hand or scattered from airplanes, in regular or irregular patterns. In urban environments, fragments of destroyed buildings may hide them; in rural environments, soil erosion may cover them or displace them. Detectors can be confused by high-metal soils and junk. Thus, demining presents a considerable engineering challenge.<ref name=Ingenia>{{cite journal |last1=Peyton |first1=Anthony |last2=Daniels |first2=David |title=Detecting landmines for a safer world |journal=Ingenia |date=June 2018 |volume=75 |pages=19\u201323 |url=https://www.ingenia.org.uk/Ingenia/Articles/2f67b8a4-4fee-4fc2-88d7-f0c535b0dc89}}</ref>\n\n== Goals ==\n=== Military ===\n{{See also|Route clearance (IEDs)}}\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B7342.jpg|thumb|British Army sappers clearing a beach front in Normandy (1944)]]\nIn military demining, the goal is to create a safe path for troops and equipment.

Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty are required to clear all mines within 10 years of joining the treaty, and as of 2017, 28 countries had succeeded. However, several countries were not on track to meet their deadline or had requested extensions.<ref>{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date= 2017 |chapter=Contamination & Clearance |title=Landmine Monitor |url=http://www.the-monitor.org/en-gb/reports/2017/landmine-monitor-2017/casualties.aspx |publisher=International Campaign for the Banning of Landmines |page= |docket= |access-date= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nA 2003 RAND Corporation report estimated that there are 45\u201350 million mines and 100,000 are cleared each year, so at present rates it would take about 500 years to clear them all. Another 1.9 million (19 more years of clearance) are added each year.<ref name=\"MacDonald 2003 3\u20135\"/> However, there is a large uncertainty in the total number and the area affected. Records by armed forces are often incomplete or nonexistent, and many mines were dropped by airplane. Various natural events such as floods can move mines around and new mines continue to be laid.<ref>{{cite web |title=How many landmines are in the ground worldwide? |url=https://ask.un.org/faq/14494 |website=Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref> When minefields are cleared, the actual number of mines tends to be far smaller than the initial estimate; for example, early estimates for [[Mozambique]] were several million, but after most of the clearing had been done only 140,000 mines had been found. Thus, it may be more accurate to say that there are millions of landmines, not tens of millions.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=28}}</ref>\n\nBefore minefields can be cleared, they need to be located. This begins with ''non-technical survey'', gathering records of mine placement and accidents from mines, interviewing former combatants and locals, noting locations of warning signs and unused agricultural land, and going to look at possible sites. This is supplemented by ''technical survey'', where potentially hazardous areas are physically explored to improve knowledge of their boundaries.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|pp=129,131\u2013132}}</ref> A good survey can greatly reduce the time required to clear an area; in one study of 15 countries, less than 3 percent of the area cleared actually contained mines.<ref>{{harvnb|Mechanical Application in Demining|p=5}}</ref>\n\n==Economics==\nBy one United Nations estimate, the cost of a landmine is between $3 and $75 while the cost of removing it is between $300 and $1000.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Doswald-Beck |first1=Louise |last2=Herby |first2=Peter |last3=Dorais-Slakmon |first3=Johanne |title=Basic Facts: the human cost of landmines \u2013 ICRC |url=https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/misc/57jmcy.htm |website=International Committee of the Red Cross |accessdate=12 March 2019 |language=en-us |date=1 January 1995}}</ref> However, such estimates may be misleading.

A deminer advances along a lane, swinging a metal detector close to the ground. When metal is detected, the deminer prods the object with a stick or stainless steel probe to determine whether it is a mine. If a mine is found, it must be deactivated.<ref name=RANDp6/>\n\nAlthough conventional demining is slow (5\u2013150 square metres cleared per day), it is reliable, so it is still the most commonly used method.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=134}}</ref> Integration with other methods such as explosive sniffing dogs can increase its reliability.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=137}}</ref>\n\nDemining is a dangerous occupation. If a mine is prodded too hard or it is not detected, the deminer can suffer injury or death. The large number of false positives from metal detectors can make deminers tired and careless. According to one report, there is one such incident for every 1000\u20132000 mines cleared. 35 percent of the accidents occur during mine excavation and 24 percent result from missed mines.<ref name=RANDpp7-11/>\n\n=== Prodders ===\nIn [[World War II]], the primary method of locating mines was by prodding the ground with a pointed stick or bayonet. Modern tools for prodding range from a military prodder to a screwdriver or makeshift object.<ref name=Contact>{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Kevin |title=Appendix W: Contact methods |pages=327\u2013336}}. In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003}}</ref> They are inserted at shallow angles (30 degrees or less) to probe the sides of potential mines, avoiding the triggering mechanism that is usually on top. This method requires the deminer's head and hands to be near the mine. Rakes may also be used when the terrain is soft (e.g., sandy beaches); the deminer is further away from the mine and the rake can be used to either prod or scoop up mines from beneath.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=136}}</ref>\n\n=== Metal detectors ===\n[[File:Detecteur de metal 501607 fh000007.jpg|thumb|Foerster Minex 2FD 4.500 [[metal detector]] used by the [[French army]].]]\nMetal detectors used by deminers work on the same principles as detectors used in World War I and refined during World War II.<ref name=RANDpp7-11>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=7\u201311}}</ref> A practical design by Polish officer [[J\u00f3zef Kosacki]], known as the [[Polish mine detector]], was used to clear German mine fields during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Modelski |first1=Tadeusz |title=The Polish contribution to the ultimate allied victory in the Second World War |date=1986 |publisher=Tadeusz Modelski |isbn=9780951117101|page=221}}</ref>\n\nAlthough metal detectors have become much lighter, more sensitive and easy to operate than the early models, the basic principle is still [[electromagnetic induction]]. Current through a wire coil produces a time-varying magnetic field that in turn induces currents in conductive objects in the ground. In turn, these currents generate a magnetic field that induces currents in a receiver coil, and the resulting changes in [[electric potential]] can be used to detect metal objects. Similar devices are used by hobbyists.<ref name=RANDpp7-11/>\n\nNearly all mines contain enough metal to be detectable. No detector finds all mines, and the performance depends on factors such as the soil, type of mine and depth of burial. An international study in 2001 found that the most effective detector found 91 percent of the test mines in clay soil but only 71 percent in iron-rich soil. The worst detector found only 11 percent even in clay soils. The results can be improved by multiple passes.<ref name=RANDpp7-11/>\n\nAn even greater problem is the number of [[false positive]]s. Minefields contain many other fragments of metal, including [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]], bullet casings, and metallic minerals. 100\u20131000 such objects are found for every real mine.

The chains act like swinging hammers.<ref name=DSTA/> The strike force is enough to set off mines, smash them to pieces, damage the firing mechanism or throw the mine up.

However, those used in humanitarian demining cannot withstand the blast from an anti-tank mine, so their use must be preceded by careful surveying. Unlike flails and tillers, they only destroy functioning mines, and even those do not always explode.<ref>{{harvnb|Mechanical Application in Demining|pp=35\u201338}}</ref><ref name=DSTA/>\n\nExcavation, the removal of soil to a given depth, is done using modified construction vehicles such as [[bulldozer]]s, [[excavator]]s, [[front-end loader]]s, [[tractor]]s and soil sifters. Armor plates and reinforced glass are added. Removed soil is sifted and inspected. It can also be fed through an industrial rock crusher, which is robust enough to withstand blasts from antipersonnel mines. Excavation is a reliable way of clearing an area to a depth that other mechanical systems cannot reach, and it has been used in several countries. In particular, the [[HALO Trust]] estimates that their excavation program destroys mines about 7 times faster than manual deminers.<ref>{{harvnb|Mechanical Application in Demining|pp=31\u201335}}</ref><ref name=DSTA/>\n\nA 2004 study by the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining concluded that the data on the performance of mechanical demining systems was poor, and perhaps as a result, they were not being used as the primary clearance system (with the exception of excavators).<ref>{{harvnb|Mechanical Application in Demining|p=4}}</ref> However, by 2014, confidence in these systems had increased to the point where some deminers were using them as primary clearance systems.<ref>{{harvnb|GICHD Guide to Mine Action|p=140}}</ref>\n\nMechanical demining techniques have some challenges. In steep, undulating terrain they may skip over some of the ground. Operators can be endangered by defective mines or mines with delay charges that detonate after the blast shield has passed over; [[shaped charge]] mines that are capable of piercing most armor; and intelligent mines that are off to the side and use a variety of sensors to decide when to fire a rocket at an armored vehicle.<ref name=DSTA/> One answer is to use remote controlled vehicles such as the [[Caterpillar D7]] MCAP (United States) and the [[IDF Caterpillar D9|Caterpillar D9]] (Israel).\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" >\nFile:M4a4 flail cfb borden 1.JPG|World War II [[M4 Sherman]] tank fitted with a flail\nhydrema mine cleaning vehicle.jpg|[[Hydrema]] mine clearing vehicles use flails.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pike|first1=John|title=Hydrema 910 Mine Clearing Vehicle|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/hydrema.htm|website=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>\nCasspir vehicle Ai101503g1.jpg|The [[Casspir]], a steel, armor-bodied [[V-hull]]ed vehicle de-mining [[Bagram Air Base]]\nD9-IDF-1460a.jpg|IDF Caterpillar D9 uses a standard blade or a special mineplow\n</gallery>\n\n==== Smart prodders ====\nDespite advances in mine detection technology, \"mine detection boils down to rows of nervous people wearing blast-resistant clothing and creeping laboriously across a field, prodding the ground ahead to check for buried objects.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=<!-- Staff writer --> |title=Using fluorescent bacteria to find landmines |url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2017/04/20/using-fluorescent-bacteria-to-find-landmines |accessdate=4 April 2019 |work=The Economist |date=20 April 2017}}</ref> Often, especially when the soil is hard, they unwittingly apply too much force and risk detonating a mine.

One quantitative measure is a [[receiver operating characteristic]] (ROC) curve, which measures the tradeoff between false positives and false negatives. Ideally, there should be a high probability of detection with few false positives,<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|p=8}}</ref> but such curves have not been obtained for most of the technologies.<ref name=RANDp15/> Also, even if field tests were available for all technologies, they may not be comparable because performance depends on a myriad of factors, including the size, shape and composition of the mines; their depth and orientation; the type of explosive; environmental conditions; and performance of human operators. Most field tests have taken place in conditions that favor the performance of the technology, leading to overestimates of their performance.<ref name=RANDp15/>\n\n=== Electromagnetic ===\n\n====Ground-penetrating radar====\n[[Ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR) probes the ground using [[radar]]. A GPR device emits [[radio wave]]s; these waves are reflected at discontinuities in [[permittivity]] and one or more antennae pick up the return signal. The signal is analyzed to determine the shapes and locations of the reflectors. Discontinuities occur between materials with different [[dielectric constant]]s such as a landmine, a rock and soil.<ref name=RANDpp19to21>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=19\u201321}}</ref> Unlike metal detectors, GPR devices can detect nonmetallic mine casings.<ref name=Comparative>{{harvnb|Kasban et al.|2010|pages=89\u2013112}}</ref> However, radio waves have wavelengths that are comparable to the dimensions of landmines, so the images have low resolution.<ref name=Ingenia/> The wavelength can be varied; smaller wavelengths give better image quality but cannot penetrate as far into the soil. This tradeoff in performance depends on soil properties and other environmental factors as well as the properties of the mines. In particular, [[attenuation]] in wet soils can make it difficult to spot mines deeper than 4 centimetres, while low-frequency radar will \"bounce\" off small plastic mines near the surface. Although GPR is a mature technology for other applications such as searching for archaeological artifacts, the effect of those factors on mine detection is still not adequately understood, and GPR is not widely used for demining.<ref name=RANDpp19to21/>\n\nGPR can be used with a metal detector and data-fusion algorithms to greatly reduce the false alarms generated by metallic clutter. One such dual-sensor device, the Handheld Standoff Mine Detection System (HSTAMIDS) became the standard mine detector of the U.S. Army in 2006. For humanitarian demining, it was tested in Cambodia for a variety of soil conditions and mine types, detecting 5,610 mines and correctly identifying 96.5% of the clutter. Another dual detector developed by [[ERA Technology Ltd|ERA Technology]], the Cobham VMR3 Minehound, had similar success in Bosnia, Cambodia and Angola. These dual-sensor devices are relatively light and cheap, and the HALO Trust has begun to deploy more of them around the world.<ref name=Ingenia/>\n\n==== Infrared and hyperspectral ====\nSoil absorbs radiation from the Sun and is heated, with a resulting change in the [[infrared]] radiation that it emits. Landmines are better insulators than soil. As a result, the soil overhead tends to heat faster during the day and cool faster at night. [[Thermography]] uses [[infrared]] sensors to detect anomalies in the heating and cooling cycle.<ref name=Baertlein>{{cite book |last1=Baertlein |first1=Brian |title=Infrared/hyperspectral methods (Paper I)}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=93\u2013110}}</ref><ref name=Comparative/> The effect can be enhanced using a heat source.<ref>{{harvnb|Makki|2017|p=20}}</ref> The act of burying a mine also affects the soil properties, with small particles tending to collect near the surface. This tends to suppress the frequency-dependent characteristics that are evident in the larger particles. [[Hyperspectral imaging]], which senses dozens of frequency bands ranging from visible light to [[long-wave infrared]], can detect this effect. Finally, [[polarization (waves)|polarized]] light reflecting off man-made materials tend to remain polarized while natural materials depolarize it; the difference can be seen using a [[polarimeter]].<ref name=Ackenhusen>{{cite book |last1=Ackenhusen |first1=John G. |title=Infrared/hyperspectral methods (Paper II)}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=111\u2013125}}</ref>\n\nThe above methods can be used from a safe distance, including on airborne platforms. The detector technology is well developed and the main challenge is to process and interpret the images.<ref name=Ackenhusen/> The algorithms are underdeveloped and have trouble coping with the extreme dependence of performance on environmental conditions. Many of the surface effects are strongest just after the mine is buried and are soon removed by weathering.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|p=26}}</ref>\n\n==== Electrical impedance tomography ====\n[[Electrical impedance tomography]] (EIT) maps out the [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] of the ground using a two-dimensional grid of electrodes. Pairs of electrodes receive a small current and the resulting voltages measured on the remaining electrodes. The data are analyzed to construct a map of the conductivity. Both metallic and non-metallic mines will show up as anomalies.<ref name=EIT>{{cite journal |last1=Church |first1=Philip |title=Electrical impedance tomography |pages=}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=161\u2013168}}.</ref><ref name=McFee2005>{{cite report|last1=McFee |first1=J.

Metals strongly absorb x-rays and little is reflected back, while organic materials absorb little and reflect a lot.<ref name=Grodzins>{{cite journal |last1=Grodzins |first1=Lee |title=X-ray backscatter (paper I)}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=191\u2013204}}.</ref> Methods that use [[collimator]]s to narrow the beams are not suitable for demining because the collimators are heavy and high-power sources are required. The alternative is to use wide beams and [[deconvolution|deconvolve]] the signal using spatial filters. The medical industry has driven improvements in x-ray technology, so portable x-ray generators are available. In principle, the short wavelength would allow high-resolution images, but it may take too long because the intensity must be kept low to limit exposure of humans to the radiation. Also, only mines less than 10 centimetres deep would be imaged.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\n=== Explosive vapor detection ===\nA buried mine will almost always leak explosives through the casing. 95 percent of this will be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] by the soil, but the other 5 percent will mostly dissolve in water and be transported away. If it gets to the surface, it leaves a chemical signature. TNT [[biodegradation|biodegrades]] within a few days in soil, but an impurity, [[2,4-Dinitrotoluene]] (2,4-DNT), lasts much longer and has a high vapor pressure. Thus, it is the primary target for chemical detection. However, the concentrations are very small, particularly in dry conditions. A reliable vapor detection system needs to detect 10<sup>\u221218</sup> grams of 2,4-DNT per millilitre of air in very dry soil or 10<sup>\u221215</sup> grams per millilitre in moist soil. Biological detectors are very effective, but some chemical sensors are being developed.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=29\u201331}}</ref>\n\n==== Honey bees ====\n{{main|Hymenoptera training}}\n[[Honey bee]]s can be used to locate mines in two ways: passive sampling and active detection. In passive sampling, their mop-like hairs, which are electrostatically charged, collect a variety of particles including chemicals leaking from explosives. The chemicals are also present in water that they bring back and air that they breathe. Methods such as [[solid phase microextraction]], sorbent [[sol-gel]]s, [[gas chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]] can be used to identify explosive chemicals in the hive.<ref name=RANDbees>{{cite book |last1=Bromenshenk |first1=J.

When targets were placed consisting of small amounts of 2.4-DNT mixed with sand, they detect vapor plumes from the source several meters away and follow them to the source. Bees make thousands of foraging flights per day, and over time high concentrations of bees occur over targets. The most challenging issue is tracking them when a bee can fly 3\u20135 kilometres before returning to the hive.

An alternative is to detect the bulk explosive inside a landmine by interacting with the nuclei of certain elements. In landmines, explosives contain 18\u201338% nitrogen by weight, 16\u201337% carbon and 2\u20133% hydrogen. By contrast, soils contain less than 0.07% nitrogen, 0.1\u20139% carbon and 0\u201350% hydrogen.<ref name=McFee2003>{{cite journal |last1=McFee |first1=John E. |title=Neutron technologies (paper I)}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=225\u2013238}}</ref> Methods for interrogating the nuclei include nuclear quadrupole resonance and neutron methods.<ref name=bulk>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=40\u201344}}</ref> Detection can be difficult because the \"bulk\" may amount to less than 100 grams and a much greater signal may come from the surrounding earth and [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref name=Sparrow>{{cite journal |last1=Sparrow |first1=David A. |title=Neutron technologies (paper II)}} In {{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=239\u2013244}}</ref>\n\n==== Nuclear quadrupole resonance ====\n[[Nuclear quadrupole resonance]] (NQR) spectroscopy uses [[radio frequency]] (RF) waves to determine the chemical structure of compounds.

Each compound has a unique set of resonance frequencies.<ref name=Garroway/> Unlike a metal detector, NQR does not have false positives from other objects in the ground. Instead, the main performance issue is the low ratio of the signal to the random thermal noise in the detector. This [[signal-to-noise ratio]] can be increased by increasing the interrogation time, and in principle the probability of detection can be near unity and the probability of false alarm low. Unfortunately, the most common explosive material (TNT) has the weakest signal. Also, its resonance frequencies are in the [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] band and can be overwhelmed by radio broadcasts. Finally, it cannot see through metal casing or detect liquid explosives. Nevertheless, it is considered a promising technology for confirming results from other scanners with a low false alarm rate.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|Lockwood|2003|pp=40\u201342}}</ref>\n\n==== Neutrons ====\n[[File:Timed neutron detector test.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|PNNL]] engineer testing a timed neutron detector.]]\nSince the late 1940s, a lot of research has examined the potential of nuclear techniques for detecting landmines and there have been several reviews of the technology. According to a RAND study in 2003, \"Virtually every conceivable nuclear reaction has been examined, but ... only a few have potential for mine detection.\"<ref name=McFee2003/> In particular, reactions that emit charged particles can be eliminated because they do not travel far in the ground,<ref name=McFee2003/> and methods involving transmission of neutrons through the medium (useful in applications such as airport security) are not feasible because the detector and receiver cannot be placed on opposite sides. This leaves emission of radiation from targets and scattering of neutrons.<ref name=Rosengard>{{cite journal|last1=Rosengard |first1=Ulf |last2=Dolan |first2=Thomas |last3=Miklush |first3=Dmitri |last4=Samiei |first4=Massoud \n|date=2001 |title=Humanitarian demining: Nuclear techniques may help the search for landmines |journal=IAEA Bulletin |volume=43 |pages=16\u201318 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330601661 |accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref> For neutron detectors to be portable, they must be able to detect landmines efficiently with low-intensity beams so that little shielding is needed to protect human operators. One factor that determines the efficiency is the [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] of the nuclear reaction; if it is large, a neutron does not have to come as close to a nucleus to interact with it.<ref name=McFee2003/>\n\nOne possible [[neutron source|source of neutrons]] is [[spontaneous fission]] from a radioactive isotope, most commonly \n[[isotopes of californium|californium-252]]. Neutrons can also be generated using a portable [[linear particle accelerator|particle accelerator]] (a ''[[sealed neutron tube]]'') that promotes the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]], producing [[helium-4]] and a neutron.<ref name=Kregar/> This has the advantage that tritium, being less [[radiotoxic]] than californium-252, would pose a smaller threat to humans in the event of an accident such as an explosion.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sheehy |first1=Christian B. |title=Fast Neutron Technology Used for Explosive Detection |url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2003/6/1/2003june-fast-neutron-technology-used-for-explosive-detection |accessdate=7 March 2019 |work=National Defense |date=1 June 2003 |language=en}}</ref> These sources emit [[fast neutron]]s with an energy of 14.1 [[electron volt|million electron volts]] (MeV) from the neutron tube and 0\u201313 MeV from californium-252.

One such reaction, [[Isotopes of nitrogen|nitrogen-14]] captures a neutron to make nitrogen-15, releasing a [[gamma ray]] with energy 10.835 MeV.<ref name=McFee2003/> No other naturally occurring isotope emits a photon with such a high energy,<ref name=Rosengard/> and there are few transitions that emit nearly as much energy, so detectors do not need high energy resolution.<ref name=McFee2003/> Also, nitrogen has a large cross section for thermal neutrons.<ref name=Rosengard/> The Canadian Army has deployed a multi-detector vehicle, the Improved Landmine Detection System, with a TNA detector to confirm the presence of anti-tank mines that were spotted by other instruments.<ref name=Rosengard/> However, the time required to detect antipersonnel mines is prohibitively long, especially if they are deeper than a few centimeters, and a human-portable detector is considered unachievable.<ref name=McFee2003/>\n\nAn alternative neutron detector uses fast neutrons that enter the ground and are moderated by it; the flux of thermal neutrons scattered back is measured.

These are the legacy of border clashes in the 1980s. The mines are mainly anti-personnel, and have kept large areas of arable land from use by local farmers. A typical demining process deployed by the Chinese is as follows. Firebreaks are dug around the minefield to be cleared. Then engineers would set the minefield on fire with flamethrowers. Key factors of this burning process are: thick vegetation covering the minefields; most anti-personnel mines are buried very close to the ground level; the mines are made of mostly either wood, thin metal or plastic. This burning process would usually destroy about 90% of the mines, as the mines are either detonated or melted. Mines which have trip wires would have these wires burned off. Demining teams then would plow the area with mine detectors. When the teams have cleared the mines, they would walk over the field hand in hand themselves to show to the locals that all the mines have been cleared.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2004/china|title=China , Landmine Monitor Report 2004|publisher=Icbl.org|date=|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Aftermath: The Remnants of War (film)|''Aftermath: The Remnants of War'' (film)]]\n* [[Bomb disposal]]\n* [[Center for International Stabilization and Recovery]]\n* [[Counter-IED efforts]]\n* [[Land mines in Central America]]\n* [[Mines Advisory Group]]\n* [[Mine clearance agency]]\n* [[MineWolf Systems]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title=A Guide to Mine Action |date=March 2014 |publisher=Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining |location=Geneva, Switzerland |isbn=978-2940369-48-5 |edition=5th |url=https://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/GICHD-resources/rec-documents/Guide-to-mine-action-2014.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2019|ref={{harvid|GICHD Guide to Mine Action}}}}\n*{{cite report |last1=Cumming-Bruce |first1=Nick |last2=Frost |first2=Alex |last3=Harrison |first3=Katherine |last4=Pinches |first4=Lucy |title=Clearing the mines 2018 |date=1 October 2018 |publisher=Mine Action Review |url=http://www.mineactionreview.org/documents-and-reports/clearing-the-mines-2018 |accessdate=16 May 2019}}\n*{{cite journal|title=A Study of Mechanical Application in Demining|publisher=Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining|year=2004|url=http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/publications/Mechanical_study/Mechanical_study_complete.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2007|ref={{harvid|Mechanical Application in Demining}}|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928141042/http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/publications/Mechanical_study/Mechanical_study_complete.pdf|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}\n*{{cite book |last=Fisher|first=Mark |chapter=7.
