He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\".

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. \n\n\n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]] \n \nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''.
