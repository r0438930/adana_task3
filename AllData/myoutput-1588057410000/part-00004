Venkatappayya edited till 1905. He had given the editorial responsibilities to [[Mutnuri Krishna Rao]] when he moved to [[Guntur]].[http://krishnapatrika.com/abt_us.html KRISHNA PATRIKA \u2013 A CENTENARY TRIBUTE]\n\n==The Newspaper==\nThe vernacular press played a glorious role in the [[Indian Freedom Movement]]. Several newspapers both in English and the regional languages, in different parts of the country, prepared the people for the freedom struggle by instilling among them patriotic fervour, indomitable courage and the spirit of heroic self-sacrifice.\n\nIn the [[Andhra State|Andhra region]], among the Telugu journals, the Krishna Patrika played a prominent role in the freedom struggle. Krishna Patrika along with [[Andhra Patrika]] were two newspapers in Telugu, which were started in the early years of the 20th century and survived till the country became independent.\n\nA unique feature of the Krishna Patrika was that it was started by a District Association. Its first issue came out on 2 February 1902, in accordance with a resolution of the Krishna District Association, passed in the year 1899. The Journal claimed that no other political association in the country was managing a newspaper for the purpose of political education. In 1909 the Krishna District Association gave up its ownership of the paper.\n\nThe man who was responsible for the success of the Krishna Patrika, in earning for itself the admiration and respect of millions of Andhras was [[Mutnuri Krishna Rao]], who for a long time was its editor. He was one of the founders of the paper and from 1902 was associated with it as its Sub-Editor. In 1907 he became its editor and continued to serve the journals in that capacity, till he died in 1945. Krishna Rao was an institution by himself, known for his scholastic proficiency and oratorical brilliance. As an intellectual, nationalist and great writer he was a towering personality in the Andhra region during his times. He invited the great nationalist leader of Bengal, B.C.Pal to tour Andhra during the Vandemataram movement in 1907 and Pal made a great impact on the Andhras. However, in later years Krishna Rao did not involve himself in active politics, but many national leaders considered him as their political Guru. Even though he was a supporter of the Congress and its policies, he kept himself aloof from that organisation, to devote his entire time and attention to the Krishna Patrika.\n\nDuring India's Freedom Struggle, particularly in the early phases, weekly journalism, played a more important part than daily journalism. Daily newspapers were very few and were not as popular as some weeklies. Krishna Patrika was a prominent nationalist weekly in the country, though it was started as a fortnightly. It enjoyed a position of preeminence among the political weeklies in the Andhra region. But for a short stint as biweekly it remained a political weekly throughout the period of the struggle for freedom.\n\nThe Krishna Patrika, carried on publicity for all the phases of India's struggle for freedom, like, the Vandemataram movement, the Home-Rule movement, the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Civil-Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement. It provided the leaders and active participants in the freedom struggle, a lot of material, which they used against the British Government. To the common man, the material published in the journal, was a source of inspiration, which promoted patriotism among the people.\n\nThe Krishna Patrika influenced not only the urban educated elite but also rural masses. During certain periods, the journal was sent free of cost to all schools in the rural areas and its contents were read out not only to the students but also to the villagers. That increased the reach of the journal, extending its influence to the masses also. Many contemporary leaders who were in their youth during the Freedom Struggle acknowledged the impact of Krishna Patrika. Prof. N.G. Ranga, Bezwada Gopala Reddy, Gottepati Brahmayya, Tenneti Viswanadham and others stated that the Krishna Patrika and Andhra Patrika influenced them in giving up their studies to take active part in the Freedom Struggle. The confidential reports of the British Government, on the contemporary newspapers, mention about the \"pernicious\" influence of the Krishna Patrika and the Andhra Patrika on the people.\n\nThe influence, popularity and the services of the Krishna Patrika and Andhra Patrika, so much impressed the people of Andhra, that they honoured the two papers in 1929. Celebrations to honour the people were organised on 8 and 9 September 1929, at Vijayawada. N.V.L. Narasimha Rao, Freedom Fighter, was the Chairman of the Reception Committee for the Celebrations. An Address, eulogising the services of the papers was presented to the editors of the two papers. Konda Venkatappayya speaking on that occasion declared, \u2018those two papers have been able to inculcate among the people, courage, spirit of sacrifice and intense patriotism\u2019. Certain Associations in Hyderabad like the Andhra Jana Sangham also met in Hyderabad and passed a resolution praising the services of Andhra Patrika and Krishna Patrika.\n\nKanuparti Varalakshmamma, a freedom fighter and social reformer, stated that many people left schools, resigned their jobs, faced the lathi blows, lost their property and entered the jails after reading the contents of Krishna Patrika.\n\nLike many papers of those days, the Krishna Patrika had to face many financial troubles. It survived due to contributions from philanthropists, zamindars and other rich people who had a patriotic bent of mind. The editor and other staff had to live on meagre salaries, and sometimes they had to live even without salaries.\n\n==Revival==\nPopularly known as \"PIRATLA\" by his friends was a student activist, a social worker and all the more a champion ofCitizen's rights to protect the Democratic Institutions of the Country as he believes development of this great glorious,traditional peace loving people is possible in a Democracy only. He never worked for his personal benefits- he participated in Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan's Movement TOTAL REVOLUTION, as an all India Secretary for student's and youth wing. He struggled for safeguarding the Democracy during Emergency Period and went in underground for a year and spent his life under MISA for Nine months in Musheerabad and Rajahmundry central Jails in Andhra Pradesh. Later on he has taken over the age old Krishna Patrika and became an Editor and Publisher of the Paper. In 1902 Krishna Patrika was established to awaken the people to wage a war against British Government in the freedom movement. Even to day with 104 years of its existence, the Krishna Patrika is striving in the direction of Nation's renaissance in all walks of life. Under the Editorship of Piratla, Krishna Patrika had celebrated its Centenary Celebrations at Delhi. Sri Mutnuri Krishna Rao one of the greatest Editor of Telugu Journalism was the Editor Inspiredby his editorials people affered Satyagraha and wore Khadi for their life of this paper for more than four decades. Piratla Venkateswarlu\nbegan his career as a full-time Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker. He was the All India Genral Secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the students\u2019 wing of Bharatiya Janata Party. Later, he took up journalism by working for News Channel Jagruthi. He became the editor of Krishna Patrika Telugu daily in 1982 and ran the publication till 2012. He is also actively associated with small newspapers association of India. In August 2001, its centenary was celebrated in Delhi in quiet dignity with the blessings of India's Prime Minister at that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.krishnapatrika.com |title=This website is for sale! - krishnapatrika Resources and Information |publisher=Krishnapatrika.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/releases98/lyr2001/raug2001/11082001/r110820017.html|title=Latest Releases|website=pibarchive.nic.in|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/PM-to-inaugurate-Krishna-Patrika-centenary-celebrations/articleshow/1156399621.cms|title=PM to inaugurate Krishna Patrika centenary celebrations {{!}} Hyderabad News - Times of India|last=Aug 8|first=TNN {{!}} Updated|last2=2001|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-08-07|last3=Ist|first3=22:45}}</ref>\n\n==Present Day==\nIt is now published from [[Vijayawada]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://krishnapatrika.com/ Official site]\n\n[[Category:Daily newspapers published in India]]\n[[Category:Telugu-language newspapers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Underlinked|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox Newspaper\n| name                = Krishna Patrika\n| logo                = \n| caption             = \n| type                = Daily [[newspaper]]\n| format              = \n| foundation          = {{start date and age|1902}}\n| ceased publication  = \n| owners              = [[Konda Venkatappayya]] (founder, editor) & Dasu Narayana Rao\n| political           = \n| publisher           = \n| editor              = \n| staff               = \n| circulation         = \n| headquarters        = [[Vijayawada]]\n| ISSN                = \n}}\n\n'''Krishna Patrika''' is a [[Telugu language|Telugu-language]] newspaper founded by [[India]]n [[freedom fighter]], [[Konda Venkatappayya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/29/stories/2008112958030300.htm |title=Archive News |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-08-08/hyderabad/27248941_1_centenary-celebrations-prime-minister-inaugurate |title=India News, Latest Sports, Bollywood, World, Business & Politics News - Times of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nKrishna Patrika started publishing on 2 February 1902 by founders Konda Venkatappayyaand Dasu Narayana Rao as a weekly magazine.
