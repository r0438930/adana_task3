He worked as a perfume salesman, a security guard, and as an interpreter for Louis Armstrong, but a back injury severely restricted him. In 1945, he attempted to regain his nightclub in Paris, but it had been destroyed during the war.

He was knocked to the ground and beaten by an angry mob, which included members of the state and local law enforcement. The attack was captured on film and can be seen in the 1970s documentary ''[[The Tallest Tree in Our Forest]]'' and the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning documentary narrated by [[Sidney Poitier]], ''[[Paul Robeson: Tribute to an Artist]]''. None of the assailants was ever prosecuted.

His daughters had married, and he lived alone in his apartment, which was decorated with pictures of his famous friends and a framed case containing his 15 French war medals.
