At that time the land consisted of farms, [[market garden]]s and [[orchard]]s; there was a \"Heathrow Farm\" approximately where the modern Terminal 2 is situated, a \"Heathrow Hall\" and a \"Heathrow House.\" This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road), which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.\n\nDevelopment of the whole Heathrow area as a much larger airport began in 1944. It was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East; by the time the airfield was nearing completion, [[World War II]] had ended, and the UK Government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport. The airport was opened on 25 March 1946 as London Airport and was renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966. The layout for the airport was designed by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]], who designed the original terminals and central area buildings, including the original control tower and the multi-faith Chapel of St George's.\n\n==Operations==\n===Facilities===\n[[File:TerminalFiveAirportHeathrowAugust2012.JPG|thumb|Central waiting area in [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]\n[[File:Concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] G-BOAB in storage at Heathrow]]\n[[File:Four aircraft on the approach to LHR runway 09L 10Sep2015 arp.jpg|thumb|Four aircraft on the approach to Heathrow runway 09L]]\n[[File:London Heathrow tower and Virgin B747 (5048342074) (2).jpg|thumb|Heathrow's control tower with a departing [[Virgin Atlantic]] [[Boeing 747-400]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5C Iwelumo-1.jpg|thumb|British Airways aircraft at [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5C]]]]\nHeathrow Airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries. The airport is the primary [[Airline hub|hub]] of British Airways and is a base for [[Virgin Atlantic]]. It has four passenger terminals (numbered 2 to 5) and a cargo terminal. Of Heathrow's 78&nbsp;million passengers in 2017, 94% were international travellers; the remaining 6% were bound for (or arriving from) places in the UK.<ref name=Facts>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/facts-and-figures|title=Facts and figures|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=13 March 2019|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvLjhZ76?url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/facts-and-figures|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The busiest single destination in passenger numbers is New York, with over 3&nbsp;million passengers flying between Heathrow and JFK Airport in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf|title=International Air Passenger Traffic To and From Reporting Airports for 2013|page=68|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=12 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704161033/https://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Heathrow had six runways, arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a [[hexagram]] with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field; two of its runways would always be within 30\u00b0 of the wind direction. As the required length for runways has grown, Heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east\u2013west. These are extended versions of the two east\u2013west runways from the original hexagram. From the air, almost all of the original runways can still be seen, incorporated into the present system of taxiways.

Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby landings are allocated to one runway and takeoffs to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the takeoff runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded [[Cranford Agreement]], pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.\n\nNight-time flights at Heathrow are subject to [[Night flying restrictions|restrictions]]. Between 23:00 and 04:00, the noisiest aircraft (rated [[Quota Count system|QC]]/8 and QC/16) cannot be scheduled for operation. Also, during the night quota period (23:30\u201306:00) there are four limits:\n*A limit on the number of flights allowed;\n*A [[Quota Count system]] which limits the total amount of noise permitted, but allows operators to choose to operate fewer noisy aircraft or a greater number of quieter planes;<ref name=\"Ref_p\">{{cite web|title=Noise limits|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=27 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225040213/http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|archive-date=25 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*QC/4 aircraft cannot be scheduled for operation.\n*A voluntary agreement with the airlines that no early morning arrivals will be scheduled to land before 04:30.\n\nA trial of \"noise relief zones\" ran from December 2012 to March 2013, which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out.

In 1991, Pan Am and TWA sold their rights to [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] respectively, while Virgin Atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes. The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the Right of Establishment of the United Kingdom concerning its EU membership, and as a consequence, the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004.

The airport is located within the [[Hayes and Harlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hayes and Harlington]] parliamentary constituency.\n\nAs the airport is located west of London and as its runways run east\u2013west, an airliner's landing approach is usually directly over the conurbation of London when the wind is from the west, which is most of the time.\n\nAlong with [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]], [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]], [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] and [[London City Airport|London City]], Heathrow is one of six airports with scheduled services serving the London area.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Heathrow Airport, 1955.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of Heathrow Airport from the 1950s, before the terminals were built]]\n[[File:EI-DWI LHR (7079539739).jpg|thumb|right|Heathrow in 2009, much expanded from its original layout.]]\n<!-- The history of Heathrow Airport is now described in [[History of Heathrow Airport]].

At that time the land consisted of farms, [[market garden]]s and [[orchard]]s; there was a \"Heathrow Farm\" approximately where the modern Terminal 2 is situated, a \"Heathrow Hall\" and a \"Heathrow House.\" This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road), which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.\n\nDevelopment of the whole Heathrow area as a much larger airport began in 1944. It was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East; by the time the airfield was nearing completion, [[World War II]] had ended, and the UK Government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport. The airport was opened on 25 March 1946 as London Airport and was renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966. The layout for the airport was designed by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]], who designed the original terminals and central area buildings, including the original control tower and the multi-faith Chapel of St George's.\n\n==Operations==\n===Facilities===\n[[File:TerminalFiveAirportHeathrowAugust2012.JPG|thumb|Central waiting area in [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]\n[[File:Concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] G-BOAB in storage at Heathrow]]\n[[File:Four aircraft on the approach to LHR runway 09L 10Sep2015 arp.jpg|thumb|Four aircraft on the approach to Heathrow runway 09L]]\n[[File:London Heathrow tower and Virgin B747 (5048342074) (2).jpg|thumb|Heathrow's control tower with a departing [[Virgin Atlantic]] [[Boeing 747-400]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5C Iwelumo-1.jpg|thumb|British Airways aircraft at [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5C]]]]\nHeathrow Airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries. The airport is the primary [[Airline hub|hub]] of British Airways and is a base for [[Virgin Atlantic]]. It has four passenger terminals (numbered 2 to 5) and a cargo terminal. Of Heathrow's 78&nbsp;million passengers in 2017, 94% were international travellers; the remaining 6% were bound for (or arriving from) places in the UK.<ref name=Facts>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/facts-and-figures|title=Facts and figures|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=13 March 2019|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvLjhZ76?url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/facts-and-figures|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The busiest single destination in passenger numbers is New York, with over 3&nbsp;million passengers flying between Heathrow and JFK Airport in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf|title=International Air Passenger Traffic To and From Reporting Airports for 2013|page=68|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=12 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704161033/https://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Heathrow had six runways, arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a [[hexagram]] with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field; two of its runways would always be within 30\u00b0 of the wind direction. As the required length for runways has grown, Heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east\u2013west. These are extended versions of the two east\u2013west runways from the original hexagram. From the air, almost all of the original runways can still be seen, incorporated into the present system of taxiways.

Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby landings are allocated to one runway and takeoffs to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the takeoff runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded [[Cranford Agreement]], pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.\n\nNight-time flights at Heathrow are subject to [[Night flying restrictions|restrictions]]. Between 23:00 and 04:00, the noisiest aircraft (rated [[Quota Count system|QC]]/8 and QC/16) cannot be scheduled for operation. Also, during the night quota period (23:30\u201306:00) there are four limits:\n*A limit on the number of flights allowed;\n*A [[Quota Count system]] which limits the total amount of noise permitted, but allows operators to choose to operate fewer noisy aircraft or a greater number of quieter planes;<ref name=\"Ref_p\">{{cite web|title=Noise limits|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=27 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225040213/http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|archive-date=25 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*QC/4 aircraft cannot be scheduled for operation.\n*A voluntary agreement with the airlines that no early morning arrivals will be scheduled to land before 04:30.\n\nA trial of \"noise relief zones\" ran from December 2012 to March 2013, which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out.

The treaty originally allowed only British Airways, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] and [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] to fly from Heathrow to the US. In 1991, Pan Am and TWA sold their rights to [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] respectively, while Virgin Atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes. The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the Right of Establishment of the United Kingdom concerning its EU membership, and as a consequence, the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004. A new \"[[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement|open skies]]\" agreement was signed by the United States and the [[European Union]] on 30 April 2007 and came into effect on 30 March 2008.
