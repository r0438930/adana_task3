After the [[Battle of Klyuch]], some of Samuil's soldiers, who were each blinded in one eye, settled in a village on the shore of [[Lake Prespa]]. The Byzantines called the village ''Asamati''. The Byzantine meaning of this word is \"settlement of one-eyed people\". From then on, Resen was under Byzantine rule.\n\nLater, Resen became part of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Serbian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], and it was the birthplace of [[Ahmed Niyazi Bey]], an [[Albanians|Albanian]] officer from a noble family of the town, who was one of the initiators and leaders of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in the region in 1908.<ref name=\"Kedourie2000\">{{cite book|last=Kedourie|first=Sylvia|title=Seventy-five years of the Turkish Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=42jWqHghlQ4C&pg=PA32|accessdate=18 February 2011|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5042-5|page=32}}</ref> Ahmed Niyazi Bey's most famous monument in Resen is the [[Saraj (Resen)|Saraj]], a French-style estate he built.<ref>[http://exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=7D670A5C9473FA4BBD3C4337BB2C8227 Macedonia National Tourism Portal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115143327/http://exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=7D670A5C9473FA4BBD3C4337BB2C8227 |date=November 15, 2006 }}</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th century, Resen was part of the [[Manastir Vilayet]] of the Ottoman Empire. \nFrom 1929 to 1941, Resen was part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Resen old.jpg|Resen in the early 20th century\nFile:Sarajcrop.jpg|Old picture of the [[Saraj (Resen)|Saraj]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the late Ottoman period, according to N.

After the [[Battle of Klyuch]], some of Samuil's soldiers, who were each blinded in one eye, settled in a village on the shore of [[Lake Prespa]]. The Byzantines called the village ''Asamati''. The Byzantine meaning of this word is \"settlement of one-eyed people\". From then on, Resen was under Byzantine rule.\n\nLater, Resen became part of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Serbian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], and it was the birthplace of [[Ahmed Niyazi Bey]], an [[Albanians|Albanian]] officer from a noble family of the town, who was one of the initiators and leaders of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in the region in 1908.<ref name=\"Kedourie2000\">{{cite book|last=Kedourie|first=Sylvia|title=Seventy-five years of the Turkish Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=42jWqHghlQ4C&pg=PA32|accessdate=18 February 2011|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5042-5|page=32}}</ref> Ahmed Niyazi Bey's most famous monument in Resen is the [[Saraj (Resen)|Saraj]], a French-style estate he built.<ref>[http://exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=7D670A5C9473FA4BBD3C4337BB2C8227 Macedonia National Tourism Portal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115143327/http://exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=7D670A5C9473FA4BBD3C4337BB2C8227 |date=November 15, 2006 }}</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th century, Resen was part of the [[Manastir Vilayet]] of the Ottoman Empire. \nFrom 1929 to 1941, Resen was part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Resen old.jpg|Resen in the early 20th century\nFile:Sarajcrop.jpg|Old picture of the [[Saraj (Resen)|Saraj]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the late Ottoman period, according to N.
