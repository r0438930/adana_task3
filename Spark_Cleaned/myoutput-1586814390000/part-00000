Each division is headed by a ''Commissioner,'' appointed by the Fijian government.  \n\nThe divisions are basically agglomerations of provinces and have few administrative functions of their own, but serve to foster cooperation among the member provinces for providing services.\n\n== Provincial council ==\nEach province has a ''provincial council'' which may make bylaws and impose rates (local taxes), subject to the approval of the [[Fijian Affairs Board]], a government department.  The board must also approve the appointment of the ''Roko Tui,'' or executive head of the provincial council, who is usually a [[Ratu|high chief]], although in recent years, commoners have sometimes been chosen.\n[[Image:Fiji divisions named.png|left|thumb|Map of the divisions of Fiji.]]\n\nThe provinces used to have direct input into national affairs through the [[Great Council of Chiefs]] and the [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]].  The Great Council of Chiefs was a traditional body which advised the government on indigenous affairs and also functioned as an [[electoral college]] to elect the [[President of Fiji|President]] and [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]]; 42 of the 55 members of the Great Council were chosen by the provincial councils, three from each province.  In addition, 14 of the 32 members of the Senate, the upper house of the Fijian [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], were chosen by the provincial councils (one Senator each) and confirmed by the Great Council of Chiefs. The [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]]-backed interim government that seized power in a [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] on 5 December 2006 formally abolished the Great Council of Chiefs in 2012, and the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|2013 Constitution]] promulgated by the regime similarly abolished the Senate. This effectively ended provincial input into national government affairs.\n\n== Island of Rotuma ==\nAdditionally, the island of [[Rotuma]], north of the main archipelago, is self-governing according to the Rotuma Act promulgated in 1927.  The Fiji government includes it in the Eastern Division for statistical purposes (such as the [[census]]), but it has its own [[Council of Rotuma|council]] which is empowered to legislate on most local matters.  Like a province, Rotuma used to choose (through its council) 3 members of the Great Council of Chiefs and 1 Senator.\n\n== Provincial administration ==\nBelow the provincial level, districts and villages, based on extended family networks, have their own chiefs and councils. [[Fijians|Indigenous Fijian]] administration is based on the ''koro,'' or village, headed by a ''Turaga ni Koro'' elected or appointed by the villagers.  Several koros combine to form a ''Tikina,'' two or more of which comprise a province.  In addition, [[municipal]] governments have been established for the [[City|cities]] of [[Suva]] and [[Lautoka]], and for ten [[town]]s.  Each has a city or town council [[Municipal elections in Fiji|elected for a three-year term]], presided over by a [[Mayor]] chosen by the councillors from among their own members. On 15 February 2006 the government announced legislation to change the local government term of office from three years to four.\n\nProvincial administration, and its sub divisions, cater for ethnic Fijians, town and city councils cater for urban residents of all races. Local authorities have also been established for rural areas, with advisory powers and these provide a voice to people of all races outside the provincial structure. The Ministry of Regional Development ensures that Fiji's rural areas are provided with the access to opportunities and basic amenities that are enjoyed by the urban areas. This is done through its district administrations which are involved in community capacity building, coordinating the development projects like upgrading of rural roads, upgrading of cane access roads, development or roads for access to cash crops and other capital programs in their respective districts. They also attend to some statutory functions such as registration of births, deaths and marriages, liquor licences and acting as Third Class Magistrates.\n\n== Districts ==\nFiji is divided into 17 districts, each with a district officer and five sub-districts with assistant district officers. The districts generally centre on towns and cities, but some follow provincial or tikina boundaries. The districts are: Ra, [[Tavua District, Fiji|Tavua]], [[Ba District, Fiji|Ba]], [[Nadi District, Fiji|Nadi]], Nadarivatu, Keiyasi, Nausori, [[Navua District, Fiji|Navua]], Vunidawa, Suva, Korovou, Macuata, Savusavu, [[Bua District|Bua]], [[Taveuni District|Taveuni]], Seqaqa, Saqani, Tukavesi, [[Kadavu District|Kadavu]], Rotuma, [[Lomaiviti District|Lomaiviti]], [[Lautoka District|Lautoka]].
