The larvae can grow up to {{convert|60|mm}} in length, while the adults are generally {{convert|27|\u2013|35|mm}}.\n\nThese beetles live in [[fresh water]], either still or slow-running, and seem to prefer water with vegetation. They are dark-coloured (brown to black) on their back and wing cases ([[elytra]]) and yellow on their abdomen and [[arthropod leg|legs]]. The male's wing cases are shiny, while those of the female are finely grooved. A voracious predator, this beetle hunts a wide variety of prey including small [[fish]]. The first two pairs of legs of the male are equipped with numerous suction cups, enabling them to obtain a secure grip while mating, and on their prey.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/28088928@N07/2714933716/in/pool-scanningelectronmicroscopy%7C28088928@N07 |title = Great Diving Beetle, Dytiscus|date = 2008-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://livingwithinsects.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/getting-a-grip/ | title=Getting a Grip| date=2011-11-05}}</ref> [[File:Beetle paw 1.2.jpg|thumb|Ventral view of a great diving beetle's (Dytiscus marginalis) front leg.]]\n\nThey are able fliers and fly usually at night.
