In some cases, the package may appear to work but produce different results in detail.\n\nIn contrast, conda analyses the current environment including everything currently installed, and, together with any version limitations specified (e.g. the user may wish to have Tensorflow version 2,0 or higher), works out how to install a compatible set of dependencies, and shows a warning if this cannot be done.\n\nOpen source packages can be individually installed from the Anaconda repository<ref name=\"AnacondaRepo\">{{cite web |title=Anaconda repository |url=https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo |website=anaconda.org}}</ref>, Anaconda Cloud (anaconda.org), or the user's own private repository or mirror, using the <code>'''conda install'''</code> command.
