She was pained to see that Jawahar Singh was not adopting a favourable policy towards the members of the family and the nobles. She knew that only keeping him engaged in warfare could control him. She also knew that the [[Rajput]]s of Jaipur could never tolerate this abrupt rise of Jat rule and would always resist the latter's efforts to gain power.  The solution for both the problems lay in war.\n\n[[Maharani Kishori]] expressed her desire to her proud son that she wanted to go for a sacred bath at [[Pushkar]]. Jawahar Singh pointed out that Pushkar was situated in the territory of his eternal and deadly foe, Raja Madho Singh, who would not tolerate her arrival at Pushkar with a large retinue, and advised her that if at all she were keen to go for Pushkar bath, she would go with only a few followers and Rupa Ram the [[Purohit]].\n\nThe Rani retorted by saying that she was the mother of Jawahar Singh, and the Rani of Maharaja Suraj Mal and taking a bath like [[Marwaris|Marwari]] women would hurt her pride, and that she would like to take her bath along with the Rajput Ranis there.\n\nJawahar Singh marched to Pushkar with 60,000 Cavalry, 5000 Infantry and 100 Cannons. With fluttering banners and beating drums they entered Jaipur territory and set up an impressive camp in the Sandy plains of Pushkar. While returning Jawahar Singh looted villages of Jaipur state and harassed its inhabitants. Learning of the news [[Madho Singh I]] rushed towards Jat Army which was now on the way out of Jaipur boundary at Maonda. In the battle that ensued between Jaipur and Bharatpur army, Army of Jawahar Singh was utterly routed and Jats fled the battlefield.
