These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of [[Augustus]], in 14 AD, to the years of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], in 70 AD. There are substantial [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in the surviving texts, including a gap in the ''Annals'' that is four books long.\n\nTacitus' other writings discuss [[Public speaking|oratory]] (in [[dialogue]] format, see ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''), [[Germania]] (in ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]''), and the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], the general responsible for much of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] of [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], mainly focusing on his campaign in [[Britannia]] (''[[De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'').\n\n==Life==\nDetails about his personal life are scarce. What little is known comes from scattered hints throughout his work, the letters of his friend and admirer [[Pliny the Younger]], and an inscription found at [[Mylasa]] in [[Caria]].<ref>''[[Orientis Graeci Inscriptionis Selectae|OGIS]]'' 487, first brought to light in ''Bulletin de correspondance hell\u00e9nique'', 1890, pp. 621\u2013623</ref>\n\nTacitus was born in 56 or 57 to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family;<ref>Since he was appointed to the quaestorship during Titus's short rule (see [[#note-quaestor|note]] below) and twenty-five was the minimum age for the position, the date of his birth can be fixed with some accuracy</ref> but the exact place and date of his birth are not known, and his [[praenomen]] (first name) is also unknown; in the letters of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] his name is ''Gaius'', but in the major surviving manuscript of his work his name is given as ''Publius''.<ref>See Oliver, 1951, for an analysis of the manuscript from which the name Publius is taken; see also Oliver, 1977, which examines the evidence for each suggested praenomen (the well-known ''Gaius'' and ''Publius'', the lesser-known suggestions of ''Sextus'' and ''Quintus'') before settling on ''Publius'' as the most likely.</ref> One scholar's suggestion of ''Sextus'' has gained no approval.<ref>Oliver, 1977, cites an article by [[Harold Mattingly]] in ''Rivista storica dell'Antichit\u00e0'', 2 (1972) 169\u2013185</ref>\n\n===Family and early life===\nMost of the older [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families failed to survive the [[proscription]]s which took place at the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and Tacitus makes it clear that he owed his rank to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] emperors (''Hist.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]). The claim that he was descended from a [[freedman]] is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen (''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.27 13.27]), but this is generally disputed.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 612\u2013613; Gordon, 1936, pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\nHis father may have been the Cornelius Tacitus who served as [[Promagistrate|procurator]] of [[Belgica]] and [[Germania]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions that Cornelius had a son who aged rapidly ([[Pliny's Natural History|NH]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/7*.html 7.76]), which implies an early death. There is no mention of Tacitus suffering such a condition, but it is possible that this refers to a brother\u2014if Cornelius was indeed his father.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 60, 613; Gordon, 1936, p. 149; Martin, 1981, p. 26</ref> The friendship between the younger Pliny and Tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63</ref>\n\nThe province of his birth remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest [[Gallia Belgica]], Gallia Narbonensis or [[Northern Italy]].<ref>Michael Grant in Introduction to Tacitus, ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', p. xvii; Herbert W. Benario in Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.</ref> His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] in the ''Dialogus'' may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 614\u2013616</ref> No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint that the two men had a common background.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 616\u2013619</ref> Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he was asked if he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was asked if he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 619; Gordon, 1936, p. 145</ref>\n\nHis ancestry, his skill in oratory, and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted Roman rule (e.g., ''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.9 2.9]) have led some to suggest that he was a [[Celts|Celt]]. This belief stems from the fact that the Celts who had occupied Gaul prior to the Roman invasion were famous for their skill in oratory, and had been subjugated by Rome.<ref>Gordon, 1936, pp. 150\u2013151; Syme, 1958, pp. 621\u2013624</ref>\n\n===Public life, marriage, and literary career===\nAs a young man, Tacitus studied [[rhetoric]] in Rome to prepare for a career in [[law]] and [[politics]]; like Pliny, he may have studied under [[Quintilian]]<ref>The fact that he studied rhetoric and law is known from the ''Dialogus'', ch. 2; see also Martin, 1981, p. 26; Syme, 1958, pp. 114\u2013115</ref> ({{circa|35 AD}} \u2013 {{circa| 100}}).<!---The precedent is established in 1st paragraph, so BC/AD should be retained throughout---> In 77 or 78, he married [[Julia Agricola]], daughter of the famous general Agricola.<ref>''Agricola'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+9 9]</ref> Little is known of their domestic life, save that Tacitus loved [[hunting]] and the outdoors.<ref>Pliny, ''Letters'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny1.html#6 1.6], [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny9.html#10 9.10]; Benario, 1975, pp. 15, 17; Syme, 1958, pp. 541\u2013542</ref> He started his career (probably the ''[[latus clavus]]'', mark of the senator)<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63; Martin, 1981, pp. 26\u201327</ref> under [[Vespasian]]<ref>([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1])</ref> (r. 69\u201379), but entered political life as a [[quaestor]] in 81 or 82 under [[Titus]].<ref name=quaestor>He states his debt to Titus in his ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]); since Titus ruled only briefly, these are the only years possible.</ref> He advanced steadily through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', becoming [[praetor]] in 88 and a [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]], a member of the priestly college in charge of the [[Sibylline Books]] and the [[Secular games]].<ref>In the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+11.11 11.11]), he mentions that, as praetor, he assisted in the Secular Games held by Domitian, which can be precisely dated to 88.

A passage in the ''Annals'' fixes 116 as the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' of his death, which may have been as late as 125 or even 130.

''Annals'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.61 2.61], says that the Roman Empire \"now extends to the [[Red Sea]]\". If by ''mare rubrum'' he means the [[Persian Gulf]], the passage must have been written after Trajan's eastern conquests in 116, but before [[Hadrian]] abandoned the new territories in 117. But this may only indicate the date of publication for the first books of the ''Annals''; Tacitus could have lived well into Hadrian's reign, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not. See Dudley, 1968, p. 17; Mellor, 1993, p. 9; Mendell, 1957, p. 7; Syme, 1958, p. 473; against this traditional interpretation, e.g., Goodyear, 1981, pp. 387\u2013393.</ref>\nIt remains unknown whether Tacitus had any children. The ''[[Augustan History]]'' reports that Emperor [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] (r. 275\u2013276) claimed him for an ancestor and provided for the preservation of his works, but this story may be fraudulent, like much of the ''Augustan History''.<ref>''Augustan History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tacitus*.html ''Tacitus'' X]. Scholarly opinion on this story is that it is either \"a confused and worthless rumor\" (Mendell, 1957, p. 4) or \"pure fiction\" (Syme, 1958, p. 796). [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] reports (''Letters'', 4.14; cited in Syme, 1958, p. 796) that [[Polemius]], a 5th-century [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, is descended from Tacitus\u2014but this claim, says Syme (ibid.), is of little value.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of persons mentioned in the works of Tacitus}}\n[[File:Lipsius manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of [[Justus Lipsius]]'s 1598 edition of the complete works of Tacitus, bearing the stamps of the ''Bibliotheca Comunale'' in [[Empoli]], Italy]]\n\nFive works ascribed to Tacitus have survived (albeit with lacunae), the most substantial of which are the ''Annals'' and the ''Histories''. This canon (with approximate dates) consists of:\n* (98) ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita Iulii Agricolae]]'' (''The Life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]'')\n* (98) ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' (''Germania'')\n* (102) ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' (''Dialogue on Oratory'')\n* (105) ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'' (''Histories'')\n* (117) ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ab excessu divi Augusti]]'' (''Annals'')\n\n===History of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus===\nThe ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', published separately, were meant to form a single edition of thirty books.<ref>[[Jerome]]'s commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]] (14.1, 2; quoted in Mendell, 1957, p. 228) says that Tacitus's history was extant ''triginta voluminibus'', \"in thirty volumes\".</ref>\nAlthough Tacitus wrote the ''Histories'' before the ''Annals'', the events in the ''Annals'' precede the ''Histories''; together they form a continuous narrative from the death of [[Augustus]] (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the ''Annals'' survived in a single manuscript from [[Corvey Abbey]] in Germany, and the second half in a single manuscript from [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy, and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.\n\n====The ''Histories''====\n{{Main|Histories (Tacitus)}}\nIn an early chapter of the ''Agricola'', Tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In the ''Histories'' the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] and end with the despotism of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavians]]. Only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book contains\u2014as a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]\u2014a short [[ethnography|ethnographic]] survey of the ancient [[Jew]]s, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.\n\n====The ''Annals''====\n{{Main|Annals (Tacitus)}}\nThe ''Annals'', Tacitus' final work, covers the period from the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7\u201310 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of [[Tiberius]] and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the ''Histories''. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the [[Roman Empire]], with which he had planned to finish his work. The ''Annals'' is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention [[Christ]], which Tacitus does in connection with [[Nero#First persecutor|Nero's persecution of the Christians]].\n[[File:MII.png|thumb|''Annals'' 15.44, in the second Medicean manuscript]]\n\n===Monographs===\nTacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. ''Agricola'', a biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola; the ''Germania'', a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the ''Dialogus'', a dialogue on the art of rhetoric.\n\n====''Germania''====\n{{Main|Germania (book)}}\n\nThe ''Germania'' ([[Latin]] title: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum'') is an ethnographic work on the [[Germanic tribe]]s outside the Roman Empire. The ''Germania'' fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. The book begins (chapters 1\u201327) with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], such as the [[Fenni]]. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his ''Agricola'' (chapters 10\u201313).\n\n====''Agricola'' (''De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae'')====\n{{Main|Agricola (book)}}\nThe ''Agricola'' (written {{circa|98}}) recounts the life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola, an eminent Roman general and Tacitus' father-in-law; it also covers, briefly, the geography and ethnography of ancient [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. As in the ''Germania'', Tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] with the tyranny and corruption of the Empire; the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of Rome, one of which, that Tacitus claims is from a speech by [[Calgacus]], ends by asserting that ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. \u2014Oxford Revised Translation).\n\n====''Dialogus''====\n{{Main|Dialogus de oratoribus}}\n[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The style of the ''Dialogus'' follows Cicero's models for Latin rhetoric.]]\nThere is uncertainty about when Tacitus wrote ''Dialogus de oratoribus''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned. It is likely to be early work, indebted to the author's rhetorical training, since its style imitates that of the foremost Roman orator [[Cicero]]. It lacks (for example) the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works. The ''Dialogus'' is dedicated to Fabius Iustus, a consul in 102 AD.\n\n==Literary style==\nTacitus's writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as [[Plutarch]]. When he writes about a near-defeat of the Roman army in ''Ann.'' I, 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment.\n\nIn most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order, only seldom outlining the bigger picture, leaving the readers to construct that picture for themselves. Nonetheless, where he does use broad strokes, for example, in the opening paragraphs of the ''Annals'', he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story.\n\n===Approach to history===\nTacitus's historical style owes some debt to [[Sallust]]. His historiography offers penetrating\u2014often pessimistic\u2014insights into the psychology of power politics, blending straightforward descriptions of events, moral lessons, and tightly focused dramatic accounts. Tacitus's own declaration regarding his approach to history (''Annals'' I,1) is well known:\n:{|-\n| \"inde consilium mihi ... tradere ... sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.\"\n| &nbsp;\n| ''my purpose is to relate ... without either anger or zeal, motives from which I am far removed.''\n|}\nThere has been much scholarly discussion about Tacitus' \"neutrality\". Throughout his writing, he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the Senate and the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]], and the increasing corruption of the governing [[social class|classes]] of Rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire. In Tacitus's view, Senators squandered their cultural inheritance\u2014that of [[free speech]]\u2014to placate their (rarely benign) emperor.\n\nTacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies. The Julio-Claudians eventually gave way to generals, who followed Julius Caesar (and Sulla and Pompey) in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in Rome.(''Hist.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.4 1.4])\n\n<blockquote>Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.</blockquote>\n\nTacitus's political career was largely lived out under the emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and [[decadence]] of that era (81\u201396) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. He draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the [[apathy]] and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire.\n\nNonetheless, the image he builds of Tiberius throughout the first six books of the ''Annals'' is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly ''positive'' in the first books, and predominantly ''negative'' after the intrigues of [[Sejanus]]. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the [[hypocrisy]] of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.\n\nIn general, Tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person, often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's hallmarks is refraining from ''conclusively'' taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see [[Tacitean studies]], ''Black'' vs. ''Red'' Tacitists).\n\n===Prose===\nHis Latin style is highly praised.<ref>Donald R. Dudley. Introduction to: ''The Annals of Tacitus''.

But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying ''and'' in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending \"\u2026-entibus \u2026-is\" are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions\u2014which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.<ref>Ostler 2007, pp.&nbsp;98\u201399 where the quoted example is used; Further quotes from the book: \"\u2026some writers\u2014notably the perverse genius Tacitus\u2014delighted in disappointing the expectations raised by periodic theory.\" \u2013 \"this monkeying with hard-won stylistic norms\u2026only makes sense if readers knew the rules that Tacitus was breaking.\"</ref>\n\nHis historical works focus on the motives of the characters, often with penetrating insight\u2014though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct, and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill.<ref>John Taylor. ''Tacitus and the Boudican Revolt''. Dublin: Camvlos, 1998. p. 1 ff</ref> He is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and dissimulation; for example, he follows a narrative recounting Tiberius's refusal of the title ''pater patriae'' by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any \"treasonous\" speech or writings\u2014and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted (''Annals'', 1.72). Elsewhere (''Annals'' 4.64\u201366) he compares Tiberius's public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun. Although this kind of insight has earned him praise, he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context.\n\nTacitus owes most, both in language and in method, to Sallust, and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style.\n\n==Sources==\nTacitus makes use of the official sources of the Roman state: the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the sessions of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital). He also read collections of emperors' speeches, such as those of Tiberius and Claudius. He is generally seen{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources. The minor inaccuracies in the ''Annals'' may be due to Tacitus dying before he had finished (and therefore before he had proof-read) his work.\n\nTacitus cites some of his sources directly, among them [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Pliny the Elder, who had written ''Bella Germaniae'' and a historical work which was the continuation of that of [[Aufidius Bassus]]. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (''epistolarium''). He also took information from ''exitus illustrium virorum''. These were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example [[Cremutius Cordus]]' speech in ''Ann.'' IV, 34\u201335.\n\n==Editions==\n* Damon, Cynthia (2003) ''Tacitus: Histories Book I.'' Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics.

These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of [[Augustus]], in 14 AD, to the years of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], in 70 AD. There are substantial [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in the surviving texts, including a gap in the ''Annals'' that is four books long.\n\nTacitus' other writings discuss [[Public speaking|oratory]] (in [[dialogue]] format, see ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''), [[Germania]] (in ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]''), and the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], the general responsible for much of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] of [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], mainly focusing on his campaign in [[Britannia]] (''[[De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'').\n\n==Life==\nDetails about his personal life are scarce. What little is known comes from scattered hints throughout his work, the letters of his friend and admirer [[Pliny the Younger]], and an inscription found at [[Mylasa]] in [[Caria]].<ref>''[[Orientis Graeci Inscriptionis Selectae|OGIS]]'' 487, first brought to light in ''Bulletin de correspondance hell\u00e9nique'', 1890, pp. 621\u2013623</ref>\n\nTacitus was born in 56 or 57 to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family;<ref>Since he was appointed to the quaestorship during Titus's short rule (see [[#note-quaestor|note]] below) and twenty-five was the minimum age for the position, the date of his birth can be fixed with some accuracy</ref> but the exact place and date of his birth are not known, and his [[praenomen]] (first name) is also unknown; in the letters of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] his name is ''Gaius'', but in the major surviving manuscript of his work his name is given as ''Publius''.<ref>See Oliver, 1951, for an analysis of the manuscript from which the name Publius is taken; see also Oliver, 1977, which examines the evidence for each suggested praenomen (the well-known ''Gaius'' and ''Publius'', the lesser-known suggestions of ''Sextus'' and ''Quintus'') before settling on ''Publius'' as the most likely.</ref> One scholar's suggestion of ''Sextus'' has gained no approval.<ref>Oliver, 1977, cites an article by [[Harold Mattingly]] in ''Rivista storica dell'Antichit\u00e0'', 2 (1972) 169\u2013185</ref>\n\n===Family and early life===\nMost of the older [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families failed to survive the [[proscription]]s which took place at the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and Tacitus makes it clear that he owed his rank to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] emperors (''Hist.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]). The claim that he was descended from a [[freedman]] is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen (''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.27 13.27]), but this is generally disputed.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 612\u2013613; Gordon, 1936, pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\nHis father may have been the Cornelius Tacitus who served as [[Promagistrate|procurator]] of [[Belgica]] and [[Germania]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions that Cornelius had a son who aged rapidly ([[Pliny's Natural History|NH]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/7*.html 7.76]), which implies an early death. There is no mention of Tacitus suffering such a condition, but it is possible that this refers to a brother\u2014if Cornelius was indeed his father.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 60, 613; Gordon, 1936, p. 149; Martin, 1981, p. 26</ref> The friendship between the younger Pliny and Tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63</ref>\n\nThe province of his birth remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest [[Gallia Belgica]], Gallia Narbonensis or [[Northern Italy]].<ref>Michael Grant in Introduction to Tacitus, ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', p. xvii; Herbert W. Benario in Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.</ref> His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] in the ''Dialogus'' may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 614\u2013616</ref> No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint that the two men had a common background.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 616\u2013619</ref> Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he was asked if he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was asked if he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 619; Gordon, 1936, p. 145</ref>\n\nHis ancestry, his skill in oratory, and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted Roman rule (e.g., ''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.9 2.9]) have led some to suggest that he was a [[Celts|Celt]]. This belief stems from the fact that the Celts who had occupied Gaul prior to the Roman invasion were famous for their skill in oratory, and had been subjugated by Rome.<ref>Gordon, 1936, pp. 150\u2013151; Syme, 1958, pp. 621\u2013624</ref>\n\n===Public life, marriage, and literary career===\nAs a young man, Tacitus studied [[rhetoric]] in Rome to prepare for a career in [[law]] and [[politics]]; like Pliny, he may have studied under [[Quintilian]]<ref>The fact that he studied rhetoric and law is known from the ''Dialogus'', ch. 2; see also Martin, 1981, p. 26; Syme, 1958, pp. 114\u2013115</ref> ({{circa|35 AD}} \u2013 {{circa| 100}}).<!---The precedent is established in 1st paragraph, so BC/AD should be retained throughout---> In 77 or 78, he married [[Julia Agricola]], daughter of the famous general Agricola.<ref>''Agricola'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+9 9]</ref> Little is known of their domestic life, save that Tacitus loved [[hunting]] and the outdoors.<ref>Pliny, ''Letters'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny1.html#6 1.6], [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny9.html#10 9.10]; Benario, 1975, pp. 15, 17; Syme, 1958, pp. 541\u2013542</ref> He started his career (probably the ''[[latus clavus]]'', mark of the senator)<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63; Martin, 1981, pp. 26\u201327</ref> under [[Vespasian]]<ref>([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1])</ref> (r. 69\u201379), but entered political life as a [[quaestor]] in 81 or 82 under [[Titus]].<ref name=quaestor>He states his debt to Titus in his ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]); since Titus ruled only briefly, these are the only years possible.</ref> He advanced steadily through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', becoming [[praetor]] in 88 and a [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]], a member of the priestly college in charge of the [[Sibylline Books]] and the [[Secular games]].<ref>In the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+11.11 11.11]), he mentions that, as praetor, he assisted in the Secular Games held by Domitian, which can be precisely dated to 88.

''Annals'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.61 2.61], says that the Roman Empire \"now extends to the [[Red Sea]]\". If by ''mare rubrum'' he means the [[Persian Gulf]], the passage must have been written after Trajan's eastern conquests in 116, but before [[Hadrian]] abandoned the new territories in 117. But this may only indicate the date of publication for the first books of the ''Annals''; Tacitus could have lived well into Hadrian's reign, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not. See Dudley, 1968, p. 17; Mellor, 1993, p. 9; Mendell, 1957, p. 7; Syme, 1958, p. 473; against this traditional interpretation, e.g., Goodyear, 1981, pp. 387\u2013393.</ref>\nIt remains unknown whether Tacitus had any children. The ''[[Augustan History]]'' reports that Emperor [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] (r. 275\u2013276) claimed him for an ancestor and provided for the preservation of his works, but this story may be fraudulent, like much of the ''Augustan History''.<ref>''Augustan History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tacitus*.html ''Tacitus'' X]. Scholarly opinion on this story is that it is either \"a confused and worthless rumor\" (Mendell, 1957, p. 4) or \"pure fiction\" (Syme, 1958, p. 796). [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] reports (''Letters'', 4.14; cited in Syme, 1958, p. 796) that [[Polemius]], a 5th-century [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, is descended from Tacitus\u2014but this claim, says Syme (ibid.), is of little value.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of persons mentioned in the works of Tacitus}}\n[[File:Lipsius manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of [[Justus Lipsius]]'s 1598 edition of the complete works of Tacitus, bearing the stamps of the ''Bibliotheca Comunale'' in [[Empoli]], Italy]]\n\nFive works ascribed to Tacitus have survived (albeit with lacunae), the most substantial of which are the ''Annals'' and the ''Histories''. This canon (with approximate dates) consists of:\n* (98) ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita Iulii Agricolae]]'' (''The Life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]'')\n* (98) ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' (''Germania'')\n* (102) ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' (''Dialogue on Oratory'')\n* (105) ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'' (''Histories'')\n* (117) ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ab excessu divi Augusti]]'' (''Annals'')\n\n===History of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus===\nThe ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', published separately, were meant to form a single edition of thirty books.<ref>[[Jerome]]'s commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]] (14.1, 2; quoted in Mendell, 1957, p. 228) says that Tacitus's history was extant ''triginta voluminibus'', \"in thirty volumes\".</ref>\nAlthough Tacitus wrote the ''Histories'' before the ''Annals'', the events in the ''Annals'' precede the ''Histories''; together they form a continuous narrative from the death of [[Augustus]] (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the ''Annals'' survived in a single manuscript from [[Corvey Abbey]] in Germany, and the second half in a single manuscript from [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy, and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.\n\n====The ''Histories''====\n{{Main|Histories (Tacitus)}}\nIn an early chapter of the ''Agricola'', Tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In the ''Histories'' the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] and end with the despotism of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavians]]. Only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book contains\u2014as a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]\u2014a short [[ethnography|ethnographic]] survey of the ancient [[Jew]]s, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.\n\n====The ''Annals''====\n{{Main|Annals (Tacitus)}}\nThe ''Annals'', Tacitus' final work, covers the period from the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7\u201310 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of [[Tiberius]] and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the ''Histories''. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the [[Roman Empire]], with which he had planned to finish his work. The ''Annals'' is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention [[Christ]], which Tacitus does in connection with [[Nero#First persecutor|Nero's persecution of the Christians]].\n[[File:MII.png|thumb|''Annals'' 15.44, in the second Medicean manuscript]]\n\n===Monographs===\nTacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. ''Agricola'', a biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola; the ''Germania'', a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the ''Dialogus'', a dialogue on the art of rhetoric.\n\n====''Germania''====\n{{Main|Germania (book)}}\n\nThe ''Germania'' ([[Latin]] title: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum'') is an ethnographic work on the [[Germanic tribe]]s outside the Roman Empire. The ''Germania'' fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. The book begins (chapters 1\u201327) with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], such as the [[Fenni]]. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his ''Agricola'' (chapters 10\u201313).\n\n====''Agricola'' (''De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae'')====\n{{Main|Agricola (book)}}\nThe ''Agricola'' (written {{circa|98}}) recounts the life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola, an eminent Roman general and Tacitus' father-in-law; it also covers, briefly, the geography and ethnography of ancient [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. As in the ''Germania'', Tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] with the tyranny and corruption of the Empire; the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of Rome, one of which, that Tacitus claims is from a speech by [[Calgacus]], ends by asserting that ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. \u2014Oxford Revised Translation).\n\n====''Dialogus''====\n{{Main|Dialogus de oratoribus}}\n[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The style of the ''Dialogus'' follows Cicero's models for Latin rhetoric.]]\nThere is uncertainty about when Tacitus wrote ''Dialogus de oratoribus''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned. It is likely to be early work, indebted to the author's rhetorical training, since its style imitates that of the foremost Roman orator [[Cicero]]. It lacks (for example) the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works. The ''Dialogus'' is dedicated to Fabius Iustus, a consul in 102 AD.\n\n==Literary style==\nTacitus's writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as [[Plutarch]]. When he writes about a near-defeat of the Roman army in ''Ann.'' I, 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment.\n\nIn most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order, only seldom outlining the bigger picture, leaving the readers to construct that picture for themselves. Nonetheless, where he does use broad strokes, for example, in the opening paragraphs of the ''Annals'', he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story.\n\n===Approach to history===\nTacitus's historical style owes some debt to [[Sallust]]. His historiography offers penetrating\u2014often pessimistic\u2014insights into the psychology of power politics, blending straightforward descriptions of events, moral lessons, and tightly focused dramatic accounts. Tacitus's own declaration regarding his approach to history (''Annals'' I,1) is well known:\n:{|-\n| \"inde consilium mihi ... tradere ... sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.\"\n| &nbsp;\n| ''my purpose is to relate ... without either anger or zeal, motives from which I am far removed.''\n|}\nThere has been much scholarly discussion about Tacitus' \"neutrality\". Throughout his writing, he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the Senate and the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]], and the increasing corruption of the governing [[social class|classes]] of Rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire. In Tacitus's view, Senators squandered their cultural inheritance\u2014that of [[free speech]]\u2014to placate their (rarely benign) emperor.\n\nTacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies. The Julio-Claudians eventually gave way to generals, who followed Julius Caesar (and Sulla and Pompey) in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in Rome.(''Hist.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.4 1.4])\n\n<blockquote>Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.</blockquote>\n\nTacitus's political career was largely lived out under the emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and [[decadence]] of that era (81\u201396) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. He draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the [[apathy]] and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire.\n\nNonetheless, the image he builds of Tiberius throughout the first six books of the ''Annals'' is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly ''positive'' in the first books, and predominantly ''negative'' after the intrigues of [[Sejanus]]. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the [[hypocrisy]] of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.\n\nIn general, Tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person, often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's hallmarks is refraining from ''conclusively'' taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see [[Tacitean studies]], ''Black'' vs. ''Red'' Tacitists).\n\n===Prose===\nHis Latin style is highly praised.<ref>Donald R. Dudley. Introduction to: ''The Annals of Tacitus''. NY: Mentor Book, 1966. p. xiv: \"No other writer of Latin prose\u2014not even Cicero\u2014deploys so effectively the full resources of the language.\"</ref> His style, although it has a grandeur and eloquence (thanks to Tacitus's education in rhetoric), is extremely concise, even [[epigram]]matic\u2014the sentences are rarely flowing or beautiful, but their point is always clear. The style has been both derided as \"harsh, unpleasant, and thorny\" and praised as \"grave, concise, and pithily eloquent\".\n\nA passage of [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|''Annals'' 1.1]], where Tacitus laments the state of the historiography regarding the last four [[Roman Emperor (Principate)#Julio-Claudian dynasty|emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty]], illustrates his style: \"The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred\",<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_1&oldid=3754977#1 The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1] Translation based on Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb (1876).

But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying ''and'' in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending \"\u2026-entibus \u2026-is\" are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions\u2014which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.<ref>Ostler 2007, pp.&nbsp;98\u201399 where the quoted example is used; Further quotes from the book: \"\u2026some writers\u2014notably the perverse genius Tacitus\u2014delighted in disappointing the expectations raised by periodic theory.\" \u2013 \"this monkeying with hard-won stylistic norms\u2026only makes sense if readers knew the rules that Tacitus was breaking.\"</ref>\n\nHis historical works focus on the motives of the characters, often with penetrating insight\u2014though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct, and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill.<ref>John Taylor. ''Tacitus and the Boudican Revolt''. Dublin: Camvlos, 1998. p. 1 ff</ref> He is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and dissimulation; for example, he follows a narrative recounting Tiberius's refusal of the title ''pater patriae'' by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any \"treasonous\" speech or writings\u2014and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted (''Annals'', 1.72). Elsewhere (''Annals'' 4.64\u201366) he compares Tiberius's public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun. Although this kind of insight has earned him praise, he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context.\n\nTacitus owes most, both in language and in method, to Sallust, and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style.\n\n==Sources==\nTacitus makes use of the official sources of the Roman state: the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the sessions of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital). He also read collections of emperors' speeches, such as those of Tiberius and Claudius. He is generally seen{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources. The minor inaccuracies in the ''Annals'' may be due to Tacitus dying before he had finished (and therefore before he had proof-read) his work.\n\nTacitus cites some of his sources directly, among them [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Pliny the Elder, who had written ''Bella Germaniae'' and a historical work which was the continuation of that of [[Aufidius Bassus]]. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (''epistolarium''). He also took information from ''exitus illustrium virorum''. These were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example [[Cremutius Cordus]]' speech in ''Ann.'' IV, 34\u201335.\n\n==Editions==\n* Damon, Cynthia (2003) ''Tacitus: Histories Book I.'' Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics.
