The patient is then treated with high-dose [[chemotherapy]] with or without [[radiotherapy]] with the intention of eradicating the patient's malignant cell population at the cost of partial or complete [[bone marrow]] ablation (destruction of patient's bone marrow's ability to grow new blood cells).  The patient's own stored stem cells are then transfused into his/her bloodstream, where they replace destroyed tissue and resume the patient's normal blood cell production. Autologous transplants have the advantage of lower risk of infection during the immune-compromised portion of the treatment since the recovery of immune function is rapid. Also, the incidence of patients experiencing rejection is very rare (and [[graft-versus-host disease]] impossible) due to the donor and recipient being the same individual. These advantages have established autologous HSCT as one of the standard second-line treatments for such diseases as [[lymphoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Canellos, George |title=Lymphoma Update: 1997 |journal=The Oncologist |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=181\u201383 |year=1997 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.2-3-181a}}</ref>\n\nHowever, for other cancers such as [[acute myeloid leukemia]], the reduced mortality of the autogenous relative to allogeneic HSCT may be outweighed by an increased likelihood of cancer relapse and related mortality, and therefore the allogeneic treatment may be preferred for those conditions.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bruno B, Rotta M, Patriarca F, et al. |title=A comparison of allografting with autografting for newly diagnosed myeloma |journal=N.

Allogeneic HSC donors must have a tissue ([[human leukocyte antigen]], HLA) type that matches the recipient. Matching is performed on the basis of variability at three or more [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of the HLA gene, and a perfect match at these loci is preferred. Even if there is a good match at these critical [[Allele|alleles]], the recipient will require [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] medications to mitigate [[graft-versus-host disease]]. Allogeneic transplant donors may be ''related'' (usually a closely HLA matched sibling), ''syngeneic'' (a [[monozygotic]] or 'identical' twin of the patient \u2013 necessarily extremely rare since few patients have an identical twin, but offering a source of perfectly HLA matched stem cells) or ''unrelated'' (donor who is not related and found to have very close degree of HLA matching). Unrelated donors may be found through a registry of bone marrow donors, such as the [[National Marrow Donor Program]] in the U.S. People who would like to be tested for a specific family member or friend without joining any of the bone marrow registry data banks may contact a private HLA testing laboratory and be tested with a blood test or mouth swab to see if they are a potential match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm|title=Public registry or private donation? - Information - BoneMarrowTest.com - Private HLA Testing, Stem Cell Transplantation Resources|last=Kate|website=www.bonemarrowtest.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115175514/http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm|archivedate=15 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A \"[[savior sibling]]\" may be intentionally selected by [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] in order to match a child both regarding HLA type and being free of any obvious inheritable disorder.

In general, mismatches of the Type-I genes (i.e. [[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], or [[HLA-C]]) increase the risk of graft rejection.  A mismatch of an HLA Type II gene (i.e. [[HLA-DR]], or [[HLA-DQB1]]) increases the risk of graft-versus-host disease.  In addition, a genetic mismatch as small as a single [[DNA]] [[base pair]] is significant so perfect matches require knowledge of the exact DNA sequence of these genes for both donor and recipient.  Leading transplant centers currently perform testing for all five of these HLA genes before declaring that a donor and recipient are HLA-identical.\n\n[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] and [[ethnicity]] are known to play a major role in donor recruitment drives, as members of the same ethnic group are more likely to have matching genes, including the genes for HLA.<ref>[http://bethematch.org/transplant-basics/matching-patients-with-donors/why-race-and-ethnicity-matter/ \"Why race and ethnicity matter\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201154351/http://bethematch.org/transplant-basics/matching-patients-with-donors/why-race-and-ethnicity-matter/ |date=1 February 2014 }}.

About 25 to 30 percent of allogeneic HSCT recipients have an HLA-identical sibling. Even so-called \"perfect matches\" may have mismatched minor alleles that contribute to graft-versus-host disease.\n\n===Bone marrow===\n[[Image:Bone marrow biopsy.jpg|thumb|Bone marrow harvest.]]\nIn the case of a bone marrow transplant, the HSC are removed from a large bone of the donor, typically the [[pelvis]], through a large [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] that reaches the center of the bone. The technique is referred to as a bone marrow harvest and is performed under [[Local anesthesia|local]] or [[general anesthesia]].\n\n===Peripheral blood stem cells===\n{{Main|Peripheral stem cell transplantation}}\n[[File:Hematopoietic stem cell.jpg|thumb|Peripheral blood stem cells]]\nPeripheral blood stem cells<ref name=\"Cutler\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cutler C, Antin JH |title=Peripheral blood stem cells for allogeneic transplantation: a review |journal=[[Stem Cells]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=108\u201317 |year=2001 |pmid=11239165 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.19-2-108}}</ref> are now the most common source of stem cells for HSCT. They are collected from the blood through a process known as [[apheresis]]. The donor's blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes [[white blood cells]]. The [[red blood cells]] are returned to the donor. The peripheral stem cell yield is boosted with daily [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous injections]] of [[granulocyte-colony stimulating factor]], serving to mobilize stem cells from the donor's bone marrow into the peripheral circulation.\n\n===Amniotic fluid===\nIt is also possible to extract stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] for both [[Autotransplantation|autologous]] or [[Xenotransplantation|heterologous]] use at the time of childbirth.\n\n===Umbilical cord blood===\nUmbilical [[cord blood]] is obtained when a mother donates her infant's [[umbilical cord]] and [[placenta]] after birth. [[Cord blood]] has a higher concentration of HSC than is normally found in adult blood.  However, the small quantity of blood obtained from an umbilical cord (typically about 50 mL) makes it more suitable for transplantation into small children than into adults.  Newer techniques using ''ex vivo'' expansion of cord blood units or the use of two cord blood units from different donors allow cord blood transplants to be used in adults.\n\nCord blood can be harvested from the umbilical cord of a child being born after [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) for [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) matching (see [[PGD for HLA matching]]) in order to donate to an ill sibling requiring HSCT.\n\n===Storage of HSC===\nUnlike other organs, bone marrow cells can be frozen ([[cryopreserved]]) for prolonged periods without damaging too many cells. This is a necessity with autologous HSC because the cells must be harvested from the recipient months in advance of the transplant treatment. In the case of [[Allogeneic|allogeneic transplants]], fresh HSC are preferred in order to avoid cell loss that might occur during the freezing and thawing process. Allogeneic [[cord blood]] is stored frozen at a [[cord blood bank]] because it is only obtainable at the time of [[childbirth]]. To cryopreserve HSC, a preservative, [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], must be added, and the cells must be cooled very slowly in a controlled-rate freezer to prevent [[osmosis|osmotic]] cellular injury during ice crystal formation. HSC may be stored for years in a ''cryofreezer,'' which typically uses [[liquid nitrogen]].\n\n{{anchor|conditioning}}\n\n==Conditioning regimens==\n\n===Myeloablative===\nThe [[chemotherapy]] or [[irradiation]] given immediately prior to a transplant is called the ''conditioning regimen'', the purpose of which is to help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ''ablated'' (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[total body irradiation]] is conventionally employed.

This can occur even if the donor and recipient are HLA-identical because the immune system can still recognize other differences between their tissues.

The patient is then treated with high-dose [[chemotherapy]] with or without [[radiotherapy]] with the intention of eradicating the patient's malignant cell population at the cost of partial or complete [[bone marrow]] ablation (destruction of patient's bone marrow's ability to grow new blood cells).  The patient's own stored stem cells are then transfused into his/her bloodstream, where they replace destroyed tissue and resume the patient's normal blood cell production. Autologous transplants have the advantage of lower risk of infection during the immune-compromised portion of the treatment since the recovery of immune function is rapid. Also, the incidence of patients experiencing rejection is very rare (and [[graft-versus-host disease]] impossible) due to the donor and recipient being the same individual. These advantages have established autologous HSCT as one of the standard second-line treatments for such diseases as [[lymphoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Canellos, George |title=Lymphoma Update: 1997 |journal=The Oncologist |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=181\u201383 |year=1997 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.2-3-181a}}</ref>\n\nHowever, for other cancers such as [[acute myeloid leukemia]], the reduced mortality of the autogenous relative to allogeneic HSCT may be outweighed by an increased likelihood of cancer relapse and related mortality, and therefore the allogeneic treatment may be preferred for those conditions.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bruno B, Rotta M, Patriarca F, et al. |title=A comparison of allografting with autografting for newly diagnosed myeloma |journal=N.

Allogeneic HSC donors must have a tissue ([[human leukocyte antigen]], HLA) type that matches the recipient. Matching is performed on the basis of variability at three or more [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of the HLA gene, and a perfect match at these loci is preferred. Even if there is a good match at these critical [[Allele|alleles]], the recipient will require [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] medications to mitigate [[graft-versus-host disease]]. Allogeneic transplant donors may be ''related'' (usually a closely HLA matched sibling), ''syngeneic'' (a [[monozygotic]] or 'identical' twin of the patient \u2013 necessarily extremely rare since few patients have an identical twin, but offering a source of perfectly HLA matched stem cells) or ''unrelated'' (donor who is not related and found to have very close degree of HLA matching). Unrelated donors may be found through a registry of bone marrow donors, such as the [[National Marrow Donor Program]] in the U.S. People who would like to be tested for a specific family member or friend without joining any of the bone marrow registry data banks may contact a private HLA testing laboratory and be tested with a blood test or mouth swab to see if they are a potential match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm|title=Public registry or private donation? - Information - BoneMarrowTest.com - Private HLA Testing, Stem Cell Transplantation Resources|last=Kate|website=www.bonemarrowtest.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115175514/http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm|archivedate=15 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A \"[[savior sibling]]\" may be intentionally selected by [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] in order to match a child both regarding HLA type and being free of any obvious inheritable disorder.

In general, mismatches of the Type-I genes (i.e. [[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], or [[HLA-C]]) increase the risk of graft rejection.  A mismatch of an HLA Type II gene (i.e. [[HLA-DR]], or [[HLA-DQB1]]) increases the risk of graft-versus-host disease.  In addition, a genetic mismatch as small as a single [[DNA]] [[base pair]] is significant so perfect matches require knowledge of the exact DNA sequence of these genes for both donor and recipient.  Leading transplant centers currently perform testing for all five of these HLA genes before declaring that a donor and recipient are HLA-identical.\n\n[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] and [[ethnicity]] are known to play a major role in donor recruitment drives, as members of the same ethnic group are more likely to have matching genes, including the genes for HLA.<ref>[http://bethematch.org/transplant-basics/matching-patients-with-donors/why-race-and-ethnicity-matter/ \"Why race and ethnicity matter\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201154351/http://bethematch.org/transplant-basics/matching-patients-with-donors/why-race-and-ethnicity-matter/ |date=1 February 2014 }}.

About 25 to 30 percent of allogeneic HSCT recipients have an HLA-identical sibling. Even so-called \"perfect matches\" may have mismatched minor alleles that contribute to graft-versus-host disease.\n\n===Bone marrow===\n[[Image:Bone marrow biopsy.jpg|thumb|Bone marrow harvest.]]\nIn the case of a bone marrow transplant, the HSC are removed from a large bone of the donor, typically the [[pelvis]], through a large [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] that reaches the center of the bone. The technique is referred to as a bone marrow harvest and is performed under [[Local anesthesia|local]] or [[general anesthesia]].\n\n===Peripheral blood stem cells===\n{{Main|Peripheral stem cell transplantation}}\n[[File:Hematopoietic stem cell.jpg|thumb|Peripheral blood stem cells]]\nPeripheral blood stem cells<ref name=\"Cutler\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cutler C, Antin JH |title=Peripheral blood stem cells for allogeneic transplantation: a review |journal=[[Stem Cells]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=108\u201317 |year=2001 |pmid=11239165 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.19-2-108}}</ref> are now the most common source of stem cells for HSCT. They are collected from the blood through a process known as [[apheresis]]. The donor's blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes [[white blood cells]]. The [[red blood cells]] are returned to the donor. The peripheral stem cell yield is boosted with daily [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous injections]] of [[granulocyte-colony stimulating factor]], serving to mobilize stem cells from the donor's bone marrow into the peripheral circulation.\n\n===Amniotic fluid===\nIt is also possible to extract stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] for both [[Autotransplantation|autologous]] or [[Xenotransplantation|heterologous]] use at the time of childbirth.\n\n===Umbilical cord blood===\nUmbilical [[cord blood]] is obtained when a mother donates her infant's [[umbilical cord]] and [[placenta]] after birth. [[Cord blood]] has a higher concentration of HSC than is normally found in adult blood.  However, the small quantity of blood obtained from an umbilical cord (typically about 50 mL) makes it more suitable for transplantation into small children than into adults.  Newer techniques using ''ex vivo'' expansion of cord blood units or the use of two cord blood units from different donors allow cord blood transplants to be used in adults.\n\nCord blood can be harvested from the umbilical cord of a child being born after [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) for [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) matching (see [[PGD for HLA matching]]) in order to donate to an ill sibling requiring HSCT.\n\n===Storage of HSC===\nUnlike other organs, bone marrow cells can be frozen ([[cryopreserved]]) for prolonged periods without damaging too many cells. This is a necessity with autologous HSC because the cells must be harvested from the recipient months in advance of the transplant treatment. In the case of [[Allogeneic|allogeneic transplants]], fresh HSC are preferred in order to avoid cell loss that might occur during the freezing and thawing process. Allogeneic [[cord blood]] is stored frozen at a [[cord blood bank]] because it is only obtainable at the time of [[childbirth]]. To cryopreserve HSC, a preservative, [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], must be added, and the cells must be cooled very slowly in a controlled-rate freezer to prevent [[osmosis|osmotic]] cellular injury during ice crystal formation. HSC may be stored for years in a ''cryofreezer,'' which typically uses [[liquid nitrogen]].\n\n{{anchor|conditioning}}\n\n==Conditioning regimens==\n\n===Myeloablative===\nThe [[chemotherapy]] or [[irradiation]] given immediately prior to a transplant is called the ''conditioning regimen'', the purpose of which is to help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ''ablated'' (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[total body irradiation]] is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an [[immunosuppressive]] effect that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's [[immune system]]. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic [[graft-versus-host disease]] that may be life-threatening. However, in certain leukemias this can coincide with protection against cancer relapse owing to the [[graft-versus-tumor effect]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Toze CL, Galal A, Barnett MJ, et al |title=Myeloablative allografting for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: evidence for a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect associated with graft-versus-host disease |journal=[[Bone Marrow Transplant.]] |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=825\u201330 |year=2005 |pmid=16151430 |doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1705130|doi-access=free }}</ref> ''Autologous'' transplants may also use similar conditioning regimens, but many other chemotherapy combinations can be used depending on the type of disease.\n\n===Non-myeloablative===\nA newer treatment approach, non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation, also termed reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), uses doses of [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation]] too low to eradicate all the [[bone marrow cells]] of the recipient.<ref name=\"Williams_2010_8\">{{Cite book | last=Kaushansky | first=K |author2=Lichtman, M |author3=Beutler, E |author4=Kipps, T |author5=Prchal, J |author6= Seligsohn, U. |title=Williams Hematology | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2010 | chapter= |edition=8th |isbn= 978-0071621519}}</ref>{{rp|320\u201321}} Instead, non-myeloablative transplants run lower risks of serious infections and transplant-related mortality while relying upon the ''graft versus tumor'' effect to resist the inherent increased risk of cancer relapse.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Alyea EP, Kim HT, Ho V, etal |title=Impact of conditioning regimen intensity on outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for advanced acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome |journal=Biol.

In case the patient's own stem cells are increasing in number post-treatment, this might be a sign the treatment did not work as intended.\n\n==Complications==\nHSCT is associated with a high treatment-related [[Mortality rate|mortality]] in the recipient, which limits its use to conditions that are themselves life-threatening. (The one-year survival rate has been estimated to be roughly 60%, although this figure includes deaths from the underlying disease as well as from the transplant procedure.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mskcc.org/blog/msk-s-one-year-survival-rate-after-allogeneic-bone-marrow-transplant-exceeds-expectations|title=MSK's One-Year Survival Rate after Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant Exceeds Expectations - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|date=2012|website=www.mskcc.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013200722/https://www.mskcc.org/blog/msk-s-one-year-survival-rate-after-allogeneic-bone-marrow-transplant-exceeds-expectations|archivedate=13 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Major complications include [[veno-occlusive disease]], [[mucositis]], infections ([[sepsis]]), [[graft-versus-host disease]], and the development of new [[cancer|malignancies]].\n\n===Infection===\nBone marrow transplantation usually requires that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation).

Transplant patients lose their [[immune system|acquired immunity]], for example immunity to childhood diseases such as [[measles]] or [[poliomyelitis|polio]]. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood [[vaccines]] once they are off immunosuppressive medications.\n\n===Veno-occlusive disease===\nSevere liver injury can result from hepatic [[veno-occlusive disease]] (VOD), newly termed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://livertox.nih.gov/Phenotypes_sinus.html|title=Sinusoidal Obstruction|website=livertox.nih.gov|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref> Elevated levels of [[bilirubin]], [[hepatomegaly]], and fluid retention are clinical hallmarks of this condition.

This can occur even if the donor and recipient are HLA-identical because the immune system can still recognize other differences between their tissues.
