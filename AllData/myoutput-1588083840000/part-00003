Leopardi often wrote about poetry in general and about his own idea of poetry, of its language and scope. Many pages on this subject can be found in the ''[[Zibaldone di pensieri|Zibaldone]]'', a private diary and collection of notes, literary projects, translations, etc. Until 1822\u201323, he affirms the [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns|superiority of ancient men over his contemporaries]], believing the powers of the [[imagination]] to have been very strong in the past; hence he upheld a kind of poetry which could give happiness through representations of a living nature, animated by [[gods]], and near to men's feelings. In modern times, he believed, the progressive discovery of truth by science and philosophy had destroyed the faculty of imagination among all but very young children<blockquote>L'immaginazione come ho detto \u00e8 il primo fonte della felicit\u00e0 umana. Quanto pi\u00f9 questa regner\u00e0 nell'uomo, tanto pi\u00f9 l'uomo sar\u00e0 felice. Lo vediamo nei fanciulli. Ma questa non pu\u00f2 regnare senza l'ignoranza, almeno una certa ignoranza come quella degli antichi. La cognizione del vero cio\u00e8 dei limiti e definizioni delle cose, circoscrive l'immaginazione.<ref>Giacomo Leopardi, ''[[Zibaldone di pensieri|Zibaldone]]'', 165-172; see also ''Alla Primavera o delle favole antiche'' in  ''[[Canti (Leopardi)|Canti]]''.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTherefore, in Leopardi's view, modern poetry could no longer be imaginative, only \"sentimental\": the chief sentiment being disappointment at the contrast between the sweet illusions of the past and the blankness and sadness of the present. The language most suited to these sentiments is distanced and vague. Words which define are not poetic; words which are able to evoke distant feelings are poetic<blockquote>Le parole ''lontano'', ''antico'' e simili sono poeticissime e piacevoli, perch\u00e9 destano idee vaste, e indefinite, e non determinabili e confuse [...* le parole ''notte'', ''notturno'' ecc., le descrizioni della notte ecc., sono poeticissime, perch\u00e9 la notte confondendo gli oggetti, l'animo non ne concepisce che un'immagine vaga, indistinta, incompleta, s\u00ec di essa che di quanto ella contiene. Cos\u00ec ''oscurit\u00e0'', ''profondo'', ecc. (28 settembre 1821)<ref>Giacomo Leopardi, ''Zibaldone'', 1789, 1798, 1804-1805</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis, roughly, is what is called in Italian ''poetica dell'indefinito e del vago'', which can be recognized in the ''[[Idyll|Idilli]]'' and in ''Canti'' written between 1828 and 1830.\n\nDuring the years 1824-27 Leopardian thought reached a turning point, which later affected even his poetics. He concluded that mankind had always been unhappy, because it is at the mercy of Nature, which creates men only to destroy them in its never-ending cycle.<ref>Giacomo Leopardi, ''[[Small Moral Works|Operette Morali]]'', \"Dialogo della Natura e di un Islandese\"</ref> No space can be granted by the poet for illusions, or for sweet memories of youth: truth must be affirmed with terse, even hard language. This ''nuova poetica'' (new poetics) explains why poems written between 1831 and 1837 offer fewer fascinating images or recollections than the former poems.<ref>Walter Binni, ''La protesta di Leopardi'', Sansoni, Firenze, 1977</ref> It is a language that sometimes seems to verge on prose; it is, indeed, a poetry which does not refrain from harsh or sarcastic phrases (see, for instance, ''La Ginestra'') but which is open to a new, more subtle kind of musicality.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Main sources==\n{{Wikiquote|Giacomo Leopardi}}\n*{{cite book|last=Leopardi|first= Giacomo|title=Zibaldone di pensieri|publisher=Mondadori|location=Milano|year=1937}}\n*{{cite book|last=Leopardi|first= Giacomo|title=Operette Morali|editor= trans.
