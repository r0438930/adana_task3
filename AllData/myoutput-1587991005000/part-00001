According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Etymology==\nWhat is now the town's Barangay Punta was the seat of an earlier settlement later known as Hala\u00e1n. During the summer from April to May, the shores of [[Laguna de Bay]] along Punta would be filled with small shellfish locally known as ''hala\u00e1n''.\n\nAs is typical with many modern Philippine [[toponym]]s, the town's name supposedly resulted from miscommunication between early Spanish visitors and natives. The Spaniards enquired of some natives along the shoreline, \"''\u00bfComo se llama este sitio?''\" (\"What is the name of this place?\") to which the latter replied, \"''hala\u00e1n p\u00f2,''\" thinking that the foreigners referred to the shells. The Spaniards accepted the response as the name of the place, and began calling it ''hala\u00e1n'', later corrupting it into ''Jalajala''.\n\nAnother folk etymology is that Jalajala stems from an [[endemic]] breed of boar called ''berk jala'', which is abundant in the wilds around the town and is depicted on its seal. As with the other story, a Spaniard asked the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking natives the place's name, and the locals' interjection of \"''hala-hala''\u201d (possibly a hunting chant) was taken by the Spaniards to be their answer.\n\n==Geography==\n\nJalajala is on a peninsula located {{convert|75|km}} southeast of [[Manila]] in the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines, [[Laguna de Bay]]. It lies on the eastern part of the Rizal Province and has a land area of 4,930.000 hectares representing 3.77% of the total land area of the province. Jalajala\u2019s political boundary on the north is the Panguil River, wherein it shares the boundary with the town of [[Pakil]] in Laguna. On its southern, eastern, and western boundaries lies the Laguna de Bay.\n\n[[Mount Sembrano]] forms the boundary of Jalajala and Pililla.\n\n==Barangays==\n[[File:JALA-JALA, RIZAL POLITICAL MAP.png|thumb|536x536px|Jala-jala, Rizal Political Map (Subject to Correction)]]\nJalajala is politically subdivided into eleven [[barangay]]s (three urban, eight rural).{{PSGC detail|area}} Bayugo, Palay-Palay, and Sipsipin were elevated as barrios in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1512.html|title=An Act Converting the Sitios of Bayugo, Palay-palay, and Sipsipin, Municipality of Jalajala, Province of Rizal, into Barrios of Said Municipality|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n* Bagumbong\n* Bayugo\n* Second District ([[Poblacion]])\n* Third District ([[Poblacion]])\n* Lubo\n* Pagkalinawan\n* Palaypalay\n* Punta\n* Sipsipin\n* First (Special) District ([[Poblacion]])\n* Paalaman\n\n==History==\n\n===World War II===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Invasion of Jalajala\n| partof      = [[World War II]], the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|1944-1945 Philippine Campaign]] and [[Pacific War]]\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| date        = January to August 1945\n| place       = Jalajala, Rizal\n| coordinates = \n| map_type    = \n| latitude    = \n| longitude   = \n| map_size    = \n| map_caption = \n| map_label   = \n| territory   = \n| result      = Decisive Filipino Victory\n| status      = \n| combatant1  = {{flag|Philippine Commonwealth}} <br> \n* {{flagicon|Philippine Commonwealth}} [[Philippine Army|Philippine Commonwealth Army]]\n* {{flagicon|Philippine Commonwealth}} [[Philippine Constabulary]]\n* {{flagicon|Philippine Commonwealth}} Col.

During the summer from April to May, the shores of [[Laguna de Bay]] along Punta would be filled with small shellfish locally known as ''hala\u00e1n''.\n\nAs is typical with many modern Philippine [[toponym]]s, the town's name supposedly resulted from miscommunication between early Spanish visitors and natives. The Spaniards enquired of some natives along the shoreline, \"''\u00bfComo se llama este sitio?''\" (\"What is the name of this place?\") to which the latter replied, \"''hala\u00e1n p\u00f2,''\" thinking that the foreigners referred to the shells. The Spaniards accepted the response as the name of the place, and began calling it ''hala\u00e1n'', later corrupting it into ''Jalajala''.\n\nAnother folk etymology is that Jalajala stems from an [[endemic]] breed of boar called ''berk jala'', which is abundant in the wilds around the town and is depicted on its seal. As with the other story, a Spaniard asked the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking natives the place's name, and the locals' interjection of \"''hala-hala''\u201d (possibly a hunting chant) was taken by the Spaniards to be their answer.\n\n==Geography==\n\nJalajala is on a peninsula located {{convert|75|km}} southeast of [[Manila]] in the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines, [[Laguna de Bay]]. It lies on the eastern part of the Rizal Province and has a land area of 4,930.000 hectares representing 3.77% of the total land area of the province. Jalajala\u2019s political boundary on the north is the Panguil River, wherein it shares the boundary with the town of [[Pakil]] in Laguna. On its southern, eastern, and western boundaries lies the Laguna de Bay.\n\n[[Mount Sembrano]] forms the boundary of Jalajala and Pililla.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nJalajala is politically subdivided into eleven [[barangay]]s (three urban, eight rural).{{PSGC detail|area}} Bayugo, Palay-Palay, and Sipsipin were elevated as barrios in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1512.html|title=An Act Converting the Sitios of Bayugo, Palay-palay, and Sipsipin, Municipality of Jalajala, Province of Rizal, into Barrios of Said Municipality|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n* Bagumbong\n* Bayugo\n* Second District ([[Poblacion]])\n* Third District ([[Poblacion]])\n* Lubo\n* Pagkalinawan\n* Palaypalay\n* Punta\n* Sipsipin\n* First (Special) District ([[Poblacion]])\n* Paalaman\n\n==History==\n\n===World War II===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Invasion of Jalajala\n| partof      = [[World War II]], the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|1944-1945 Philippine Campaign]] and [[Pacific War]]\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| date        = January to August 1945\n| place       = Jalajala, Rizal\n| coordinates = \n| map_type    = \n| latitude    = \n| longitude   = \n| map_size    = \n| map_caption = \n| map_label   = \n| territory   = \n| result      = Decisive Filipino Victory\n| status      = \n| combatant1  = {{flag|Philippine Commonwealth}} <br> \n* {{flagicon|Philippine Commonwealth}} [[Philippine Army|Philippine Commonwealth Army]]\n* {{flagicon|Philippine Commonwealth}} [[Philippine Constabulary]]\n* {{flagicon|Philippine Commonwealth}} Col.
