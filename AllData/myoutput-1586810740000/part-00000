Dates are often approximate and change as more research is done, reported and seen. Older examples of any given technology are found often. The locations listed are for the site where the earliest solid evidence has been found, but especially for the earlier inventions, there is little certainty how close that may be to where the invention took place.\n\n===Lower Paleolithic===\nThe Lower Paleolithic period lasted over 3 million years, and corresponds to the human species prior to the emergence of Homo Sapiens. The original divergence between humans and chimpanzees occurred 13 ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), however interbreeding continued until as recently as 4 Ma, with the first species clearly belonging to the human (and not chimpanzee) lineage being the [[Australopithecus anamensis]]. This time period is characterized as an ice age with regular periodic warmer periods \u2013 interglacial episodes.\n* 3.3-2.6 Ma: [[Stone tools]] \u2013 found in present-day [[Kenya]], they are so old that only a pre-human species could have invented them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/archaeologists-take-wrong-turn-find-world-s-oldest-stone-tools-update/|title=Archaeologists Take Wrong Turn, Find World's Oldest Stone Tools [Update]|first=Kate|last=Wong|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref> The otherwise earliest known stone tools ([[Oldowan]]) were found in [[Ethiopia]]<ref>{{cite journal | author=Semaw, S. |author2=M.

This is coincident with the complete collapse of the already-fledgling [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. This event is followed by the beginning of the Iron age. We define the iron age as ending in 510 BC for the purposes of this article, even though the typical definition is region-dependent (e.g. 510 BC in Greece, 322 BC in India, 200 BC in China), thus being an 800-year period.\n\nIt's worth noting the uncertainty in dating several Indian developments between 600 BC and 300 AD, due to the tradition that existed of editing existing documents  (such as the Sushruta Samhita and Arthashastra) without specifically documenting the edit. Most such documents were canonized at the start of the Gupta empire (mid-3rd century AD).\n\n* 1300 BC: [[Iron smelting]] in either [[India]] or the [[Middle East]].<ref name=UCP>Early Antiquity By I.M.

The original divergence between humans and chimpanzees occurred 13 ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), however interbreeding continued until as recently as 4 Ma, with the first species clearly belonging to the human (and not chimpanzee) lineage being the [[Australopithecus anamensis]].

This is coincident with the complete collapse of the already-fledgling [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. This event is followed by the beginning of the Iron age. We define the iron age as ending in 510 BC for the purposes of this article, even though the typical definition is region-dependent (e.g. 510 BC in Greece, 322 BC in India, 200 BC in China), thus being an 800-year period.\n\nIt's worth noting the uncertainty in dating several Indian developments between 600 BC and 300 AD, due to the tradition that existed of editing existing documents  (such as the Sushruta Samhita and Arthashastra) without specifically documenting the edit. Most such documents were canonized at the start of the Gupta empire (mid-3rd century AD).\n\n* 1300 BC: [[Iron smelting]] in either [[India]] or the [[Middle East]].<ref name=UCP>Early Antiquity By I.M.
