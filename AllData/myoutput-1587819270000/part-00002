Many of the first anarchists in [[Belarus]] were dissatisfied with the moderate positions and \"neutrality\" of the existing socialist parties like the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Labour Bund]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), and the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]. Anarchists demanded the destruction of the [[State (polity)|state]], which included not only the [[monarchy]], but also the [[parliamentary republic]]. These were both deemed a tool of [[class oppression]]. For these anarchists, [[democracy]] was not a viable alternative, as the word meant \"''kratiya''\", or power, specifically of the bourgeoisie.\n\n[[Expropriation]] and the provocation of [[individual terror]], which created a halo of the \"defenders of the working class\" around said anarchists, were some of their most decisive tactics. Though workers from [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bialystok]] joined the anarchist federation on a massive scale, the anarchists could not move beyond the local economic victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politring.com/articles/25433-yuriy-glushakov-anarhisty-v-belarusi.html|title=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|date=2019|work=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n=== The October Revolution ===\nIn 1917, the leaders of the anarchist movement in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt]] were either born or participated in the anarchist movement in Belarus. They included Joseph Blakhman-Solntsev, Konstantin Akashev, Efim Yarchuk, and others. Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s party would even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]], later taking the name \"Communist Bolsheviks\" under his guidance to distinguish itself from anarchist-communists and esser-communists.\n\nThe united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. Around this time, anarchist Communism saw competition from the Communist Party, and the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. Still, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles continued operating in Belarus until the early 1920s. Eventually, however, the Councils of People's Self-Government, which was the dream of Peter Kropotkin's supporters, was finally turned by the party bureaucracy into its auxiliary bodies. The anarchists added to the exiles and political isolators.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430! \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f!|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|publisher=\u0428SS|year=2015|isbn=|location=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Anarchism in Republic Belarus ==\nThe revival of anarchism was already underway during the years of [[perestroika]]. In the spring of 1991, Gomel anarchists took part in a citywide strike, helping the workers of the \"Polespechat\" factory to join it. In summer 1992, at the initiative of Oleg Novikov, at a congress in Minsk, activists from Minsk, Gomel and Svetlogorsk joined the Federation of Anarchists of Belarus (FAB).\n\nOn October 6th, 1992, International Unemployment Day, Gomel anarchists held an unsanctioned rally, which ended in clashes with police and arrests. The same year the \"Union of the Unemployed\" was created with the participation of Gomel anarchists and agitation campaigns were organized at the city enterprises. The Anarchy newspaper, the first anarchist edition in Belarus, was published in Gomel in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 in Minsk the anti-party group \"Chyrvony Zhond\", which played a significant role in the development of anarchist movement in Belarus, became active.\n\nSince the beginning of 1998, the Navinki newspaper has been published. At the beginning of 1999, as a result of the happening campaign \"Legalize It\", the newspaper Navinki was officially registered, which had previously been published illegally. At the same time, Chyrvonyi Zhond, which originally issued Navinki, was banned in Belarus.\n\nOne of the longest and at the same time the most successful actions, conducted with the participation of Belarusian anarchists, can be considered the environmental campaign \"Viasiolka\", launched in 1998. The campaign was directed against the plans of the [[Belarusian nuclear power plant|Belarusian NPP]] construction developed by the government. With the participation of the FAB activists an independent environmental initiative Ecasupraciou was created, which took upon itself the organization of the whole campaign, to which were drawn employees of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, interested scientists, press, as well as activists of the Russian radical environmental movement Rainbow Keepers, who had experience of such events. The newspaper Viasiolka started to be published. Its pages covered all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and radioecology. During 1998-99 with the help of scientists several seminars were organized on the expediency of NPP construction. In summer 1998, the activists of Ekasupravu organized a \"March for Nuclear Free Belarus\" on the planned sites of the NPP construction in [[Mogilev Region|Mahiliou voblast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy in By - \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0437\u043c \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a|first=\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\u043a|publisher=Samizdat|year=2003|isbn=|location=Minsk|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
