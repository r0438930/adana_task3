He utilizes high-profile media events and intentionally provocative rhetoric in order to highlight what his clients view as an unfair crusade against tobacco and nicotine products.\n\nThe political [[satire]] is heightened by Naylor's informal association with lobbyists from other industries that are subjected to routine vilification in the media, e.g. Polly Bailey, a lobbyist for the [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]/spirits industry, and Bobby Jay Bliss, who represents the firearms industry.

Squad, a reference to the title of a [[The Mod Squad|police drama]], although in this case, \"M.O.D.\" stands for \"Merchants Of Death\".\n\nA pivotal point in the plot occurs when Naylor is kidnapped by a clandestine group who attempt to kill him by covering him with [[nicotine patch]]es.
