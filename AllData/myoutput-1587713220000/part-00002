Matthai]], seeing the rising demand for graduates of the first two IIMs namely [[IIM Calcutta]] and [[IIM Ahmedabad]], recommended the need to have two more IIMs. While the first two IIMs were oriented towards the private sector, it was decided that the new institutions shall be oriented towards the public sector to cater to its growing needs of management graduates. The Institute at Bangalore was consequently set up next year, designed to cater exclusively to the needs of public sector enterprises.<ref name=\"IIMReviewCommitteeReport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author1=RC Bhargava |author2=Ajit Balakrishnan |author3=Anusua Basu |author4=Ram S Tarneja |author5=Ashok Thakur |access-date=19 March 2010 |publisher=Ministry of HRD, Government of India |date=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221200750/http://education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |archivedate=21 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the proposed institute, the [[Government of Karnataka]] offered {{convert|100|acre}} of land free of cost and a contribution of {{INRconvert|3|m}}.
