After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it is accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat; a parchment scroll slips out of the ship and rolls under a piece of Tintin's furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of [[pickpocket]] [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, which he suspects Sakharine of doing. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken, he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin returns to his apartment, which has been ransacked, and is shown the scroll by Snowy. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''.\n\nTintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pick-pocketed by Silk the next morning and soon afterwards abducted by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin encounters the ship's captain, [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], who is permanently drunk and has forgotten most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship attempts to ram their boat but instead ram an empty lifeboat Haddock accidentally released during his escape. Noticing that two lifeboats have been released, Sakharine presumes them to have survived and sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to put out a fire he started in the boat, causing an explosion that leaves the trio stranded on top of the upturned boat. The trio seize the seaplane and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but it crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert along with Tintin and Snowy, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'', whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] led by [[Red Rackham]], who is later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered, but since the pirates killed all of his crew, he chose to sink the ''Unicorn'', along with most of its treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert, which results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues, during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock; he is then rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls, which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy travel there. Inside, aided by Haddock, they find some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location; Tintin and Haddock both agree on setting up an expedition to find [[Red Rackham's Treasure]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January&nbsp;26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

Eventually, several cues had to be revised during the editing of the film.

There are major differences from the source material, most notably with regard to the antagonists. In the book, Ivan Sakharine is a minor character, neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham. As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film, the book's main villains, the [[Bird brothers]], are absent from the adaptation, save for a small \"cameo\" in the initial sequence at the market. As a result of this change, many events transpire that bear no relation to events in the books involving Sakharine's character.<ref name=\"Guardian_18Oct2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this-tintin/|title=How could they do this to Tintin?|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> As in other adaptations, Snowy's \"voice\" is not used.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Spielberg and Tintin 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Spielberg]] and a costumed character of Tintin at the film's [[premiere]] in Paris, 22 October 2011.]]\nThe film's first press-screening was held in Belgium on 10 October 2011.<ref name=\"la libre\">{{cite web|title=Les Aventuriers de la Licorne Perdue|url=http://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/article/691191/les-aventuriers-de-la-licorne-perdue.html|publisher=La Libre|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=French|date=12 October 2011}}</ref> The world premi\u00e8re was held in Brussels, Belgium on 22 October 2011\u2014attended by [[Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Astrid]] and her younger daughters, [[Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Luisa Maria]] and [[Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Laetitia Maria]]; with the Paris premi\u00e8re later the same day.<ref name=\"DT\">{{cite news|title=Tintin fans flock to Belgian film premiere|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8844394/Tintin-fans-flock-to-Belgian-film-premiere.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=22 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Sony later released the film during late October and early November 2011 in Europe, Latin America and India.

The simplicity of the comic strip, she wrote, is a crucial part of the success of Tintin, who is \"an avatar for armchair adventurers\". Dargis noted that Tintin's appearance in the film \"resembled Herg\u00e9's creation, yet was eerily different as if, like [[Pinocchio]], his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted\". Another major fault in the film, Dargis opines, is how it is overworked; she writes that there is \"hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes\". Nevertheless, she singles out some of the \"interludes of cinematic delight\", approving of the visual imagination employed within the movie's numerous exciting scenes.<ref name=\"Dargis\">Dargis, Manohla.

After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it is accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat; a parchment scroll slips out of the ship and rolls under a piece of Tintin's furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of [[pickpocket]] [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, which he suspects Sakharine of doing. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken, he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin returns to his apartment, which has been ransacked, and is shown the scroll by Snowy. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''.\n\nTintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pick-pocketed by Silk the next morning and soon afterwards abducted by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin encounters the ship's captain, [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], who is permanently drunk and has forgotten most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship attempts to ram their boat but instead ram an empty lifeboat Haddock accidentally released during his escape. Noticing that two lifeboats have been released, Sakharine presumes them to have survived and sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to put out a fire he started in the boat, causing an explosion that leaves the trio stranded on top of the upturned boat. The trio seize the seaplane and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but it crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert along with Tintin and Snowy, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'', whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] led by [[Red Rackham]], who is later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered, but since the pirates killed all of his crew, he chose to sink the ''Unicorn'', along with most of its treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert,which results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues, during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock; he is then rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls, which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy travel there. Inside, aided by Haddock, they find some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location; Tintin and Haddock both agree on setting up an expedition to find [[Red Rackham's Treasure]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January&nbsp;26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

There are major differences from the source material, most notably with regard to the antagonists. In the book, Ivan Sakharine is a minor character, neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham. As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film, the book's main villains, the [[Bird brothers]], are absent from the adaptation, save for a small \"cameo\" in the initial sequence at the market. As a result of this change, many events transpire that bear no relation to events in the books involving Sakharine's character.<ref name=\"Guardian_18Oct2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this-tintin/|title=How could they do this to Tintin?|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> As in other adaptations, Snowy's \"voice\" is not used.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Spielberg and Tintin 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Spielberg]] and a costumed character of Tintin at the film's [[premiere]] in Paris, 22 October 2011.]]\nThe film's first press-screening was held in Belgium on 10 October 2011.<ref name=\"la libre\">{{cite web|title=Les Aventuriers de la Licorne Perdue|url=http://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/article/691191/les-aventuriers-de-la-licorne-perdue.html|publisher=La Libre|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=French|date=12 October 2011}}</ref> The world premi\u00e8re was held in Brussels, Belgium on 22 October 2011\u2014attended by [[Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Astrid]] and her younger daughters, [[Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Luisa Maria]] and [[Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Laetitia Maria]]; with the Paris premi\u00e8re later the same day.<ref name=\"DT\">{{cite news|title=Tintin fans flock to Belgian film premiere|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8844394/Tintin-fans-flock-to-Belgian-film-premiere.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=22 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Sony later released the film during late October and early November 2011 in Europe, Latin America and India.

The simplicity of the comic strip, she wrote, is a crucial part of the success of Tintin, who is \"an avatar for armchair adventurers\". Dargis noted that Tintin's appearance in the film \"resembled Herg\u00e9's creation, yet was eerily different as if, like [[Pinocchio]], his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted\". Another major fault in the film, Dargis opines, is how it is overworked; she writes that there is \"hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes\". Nevertheless, she singles out some of the \"interludes of cinematic delight\", approving of the visual imagination employed within the movie's numerous exciting scenes.<ref name=\"Dargis\">Dargis, Manohla.
