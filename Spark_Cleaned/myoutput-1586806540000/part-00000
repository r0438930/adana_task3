Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]] (seasons 1\u20132), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony).

Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" /> while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful{{nbsp}}... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer.\"<ref name=\"BGresponse\" />\n\nConversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note \u2013 and that note is horrifying.

He praised Langford's \"stunning performance\" but noted, \"There are times when we simply don't believe the characters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led to believe they are{{nbsp}}...

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

for [[Netflix]] as limited series by [[Brian Yorkey]], based on the 2007 novel ''[[Thirteen Reasons Why]]'' by [[Jay Asher]]. The series revolves around seventeen-year-old high school student [[Clay Jensen]] and his deceased friend [[Hannah Baker]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/13-reasons-why/1032508|title=13 Reasons Why |website=TVGuide.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> who takes her own life after having to face a culture of gossip, bullying and sexual assault at her high school and a lack of support from her friends, her family and her school. A box of [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] recorded by Hannah in the weeks preceding her suicide detail why she chose to end her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, [[Anonymous Content]] and [[Paramount Television]], with Yorkey and [[Diana Son]] serving as [[showrunners]].\n\n[[Dylan Minnette]] stars as Clay Jensen, while [[Katherine Langford]] plays [[Hannah Baker]].

A film from [[Universal Pictures]] based on ''Thirteen Reasons Why'' began development in February 2011, with [[Selena Gomez]] set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering an adaptation as a limited series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/selena-gomez-13-reasons-why-netflix-1201620194/ |title=Netflix Adapting '13 Reasons Why' Into Selena Gomez Series (Exclusive) |last=Wagmeister |first=Elizabeth |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.

Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]] (seasons 1\u20132), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony).

Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" /> while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful{{nbsp}}...

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling.

At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids.

Each warning voice over is read by a different cast member at the end of the episode, with Katherine Langford reading in her native Australian accent in her voice-overs. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |title=13 Reasons Why: Headspace issues warning over new Netflix show |date=April 18, 2017 |publisher=[[Community Newspaper Group]] |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419101534/http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |title=Netflix series 13 Reasons Why under fire from mental health experts |work=news.com.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418233845/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |archivedate=April 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |title=headspace: dangerous content in 13 Reasons Why |work=headspace.org.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419104903/https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the graphic nature of the series and New Zealand's high youth suicide rate, which was the highest among the 34{{efn|name=OECD note|The 2009\u20132012 data exclude Latvia, which became the 35th OECD member country on July 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0,3746,en_2649_201185_1889402_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=List of OECD Member countries \u2013 Ratification of the Convention on the OECD |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031730/http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0%2C3746%2Cen_2649_201185_1889402_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=November 23, 2015}}</ref>}} [[OECD]] countries during 2009 to 2012,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Social Report 2016 \u2013 Te p\u016brongo oranga tangata |url=http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/suicide.html |publisher=Ministry of Social Development \u2013 New Zealand Government |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406215234/http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/suicide.html |archivedate=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mconnell |first1=Glenn |title=The highest rate of teen suicide in the developed world |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/85305366/the-highest-rate-of-teen-suicide-in-the-developed-world |website=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref> the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|Office of Film & Literature Classification]] in the country created a new rating, \"RP18\", allowing individuals aged 18 and over to watch the series alone and those below having to watch it with supervision from a parent or guardian.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand teens can only watch Netflix show 13 Reasons Why with their parents |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39732715/new-zealand-teens-can-only-watch-netflix-show-13-reasons-why-with-their-parents |website=BBC |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427212208/http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39732715/new-zealand-teens-can-only-watch-netflix-show-13-reasons-why-with-their-parents |archivedate=April 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=13 Reasons Why: Censors make new RP18 rating for controversial Netflix show |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/91956245/13-reasons-why-censors-make-new-rp18-rating-for-controversial-netflix-show |website=stuff.co.nz |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] [[Jay Asher]] created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do{{nbsp}}...

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.
