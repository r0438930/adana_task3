But as the series went on Gilbert became a more genuine friend of the Beav, really his closest friend, as seen in episodes like \"Beaver on TV\" (1963) when Gilbert is the only one to believe Beaver had been on a local TV show that did not air live as everyone expected (it had been taped for later broadcast, a new concept at the time).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0630188/]</ref>\n\nHaving spent his early years in front of the cameras on ''Leave it to Beaver'' as Gilbert Bates (56 episodes), Talbot abandoned acting for a career as a journalist.

But as the series went on Gilbert became a more genuine friend of the Beav, really his closest friend, as seen in episodes like \"Beaver on TV\" (1963) when Gilbert is the only one to believe Beaver had been on a local TV show that did not air live as everyone expected (it had been taped for later broadcast, a new concept at the time).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0630188/]</ref>\n\nHaving spent his early years in front of the cameras on ''Leave it to Beaver'' as Gilbert Bates (56 episodes), Talbot abandoned acting for a career as a journalist. In an article for [[Salon.com]] in 1997, he looked back with a sense of humor about his past role.\n\n<blockquote>In the interests of historical accuracy I should say that, yes, Gilbert was a troublemaker and an occasional liar, but my character was certainly no Eddie Haskell \u2013 that leering teenage hypocrite who spoke unctuously to parents ('Well, hello Mrs. Cleaver, and how is young Theodore today?') and venomously to the Beav ('Hey, squirt, take a powder before I squash you like a bug').\"!<ref name=\"talbot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/aug97/mothers/beaver970822.html|title=Living Down Beaver|last=Talbot|first=Stephen|work=Salon|accessdate=2006-10-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205114704/https://www.salon.com/aug97/mothers/beaver970822.html|archivedate=2007-02-05}}</ref> \"I have spent my adult life trying to conceal my ''Leave it to Beaver'' past or correcting the historical record.

He appeared in comedy sketches with [[Bob Newhart]] in the early '60s NBC variety program, ''[[The Bob Newhart Show (1961 TV series)|The Bob Newhart Show]]''.
