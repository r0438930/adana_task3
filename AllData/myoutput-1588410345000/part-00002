It was founded in Germany in 1988 and is currently owned by [[United Internet]]. In addition to Web hosting, 1&1 Ionos also provides [[domain registration]], SSL certificates, email services, [[Website builder]] packages and cloud hosting, as well as [[virtual private server]]s and dedicated servers. The company has two headquarters, one in [[Montabaur]], [[Germany]], and the other in [[Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania]]. 1&1 Ionos has approximately 2,000 employees in 40 countries, with 8 million customers, 10 data centers and over 90,000 servers. The company's CEO is Achim Weiss.\n\n== History ==\nIn 2000, the company changed its name to United Internet and moved its product business to 1&1 Internet AG. In the same year, 1&1 began operating in the United Kingdom, and three years later began serving United States customers. One of the company's biggest North American data centers is located in [[Lenexa, Kansas]], which houses more than 40,000 servers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/hardware/data-centers/inside-11s-giant-web-hosting-data-center/210604699|title=Inside 1&1's Giant Web Hosting Data Center|last1=Nucci|first1=Cora|date=30 September 2008|website=[[InformationWeek]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, 1&1 merged with cloud infrastructure specialists ProfitBricks (founded by Achim Weiss) and rebranded as 1&1 Ionos.

One of the five UPS systems in the affected data center suffered a technical malfunction, which meant several servers suffered a temporary loss of power and had to be restarted.
