Azim stayed with a friend for a couple days and returned when the Maaliks returned to their home. Azim and Yasmine helped and organise the wedding and Azim noticed Sami's behaviour since he returned from Spain. Sami tells Azim that he and Sinead have been fighting during their stay in Spain, about them rushing into things.\n\nWhen Sami receives a note from [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) to meet him outside the backyard, Sami threw the note, but Azim takes it and meets Ste outside the backyard in the morning and Ste tells Azim that he wants to leave the Far Right Group and Azim agrees to help him. Azim tells Ste's estranged sister, [[Leela Lomax]] ([[Kirsty-Leigh Porter]]) about Ste's plan on leaving. Azim and Ste kept on talking between the fences of the backyard every morning. Azim tells Ste not to believe or trust [[Jonny Baxter]] ([[Ray Quinn]]) about him wanting to leave or tell him his plans.\n\nAzim meets Ste face-to-face for the first time, when they threw out the trash, and they began to flirt and share a kiss. On the day of the wedding, Azim tells Sami to cancel the wedding since Sinead isn't coming. Azim supports Sami when he calls off the wedding front of the guests at the ceremony and he later helps Leela and [[Peri Lomax]] ([[Ruby O'Donnell]]), to rescue Ste and Sami, who were kidnapped by Jonny and Stuart, with a help from Stuart's son [[#Sid Sumner|Sid Sumner]] (Billy Price).

Cohen investigates after [[Joel Dexter]] ([[Rory Douglas-Speed]]) is assaulted by [[Liam Donovan]] (Jude Monk McGowan). She arrests Liam for the assault, after [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) reports that she saw him follow Joel into the alley. However, after threats from [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), Joel doesn't identify Liam as the person who assaulted them, telling D.S. Cohen it was just a random person. D.S. Cohen tells Diane when Harry's body is ready to be released. After Diane reports Mercedes for murdering Harry, D.S. Cohen arrives to arrest her, however she is unable to arrest her as [[Sylver McQueen]] (David Tag) refuses to reveal her whereabouts. She later comes to question Liam over Mercedes's disappearance, but is stopped when [[Goldie McQueen]] ([[Chelsee Healey]]) discovers her body. The next day, she collects alibis from Sylver, Liam and [[Grace Black]] ([[Tamara Wall]]). After a tip-off from Liam, she arrives to search The Dog, looking for a gun, but Grace manages to hide it. Sylver tells D.S. Cohen about why Liam would want Mercedes dead, and when an officer finds the gun in Liam's car, she arrests him. She prepares to charge Liam with shooting Mercedes, until James intervenes and gets the charges against him dropped. After [[#Sid Sumner|Sid Sumner]] (Billy Price) pushes [[#Stuart Sumner|Stuart Sumner]] ([[Chris Simmons]]) to his death, D.S. Cohen interviews him. After witness statements say the attack was in self-defence, she drops the charges against him. After Mercedes wakes up from her coma, she tells D.S. Cohen that Sylver shot her, and she subsequently arrests him and charges him for the attempted murder. After blood is found at the crime scene, Diane admits to D.S. Cohen that it is hers. She then shows D.S. Cohen evidence of her kissing [[#Edward Hutchinson|Edward Hutchinson]] ([[Joe McGann]]) as her alibi, which also gives the time of Mercedes's shooting. Later, Mercedes goes to the police station to tell D.S. Cohen that she's retracting her statement about Sylver shooting her. After [[Breda McQueen]] ([[Moya Brady]]) anonymously drops off a picture with a confession written on it, D.S. Cohen runs forensics and decides that Mercedes is the village's serial killer. D.S. Cohen then has Mercedes arrested for the murders, but fails to find evidence at The Dog that could convict her. After Breda is discovered to be the serial killer, D.S. Cohen attempts to speak to Mercedes to get her version of events for what happened on the pig farm, but she is rebuffed. After [[Jesse Donovan]] ([[Luke Jerdy]]) dies, D.S. Cohen returns his personal items to [[Courtney Campbell]] (Amy Conachan), and tells her Grace and Liam that Jesse died from alcohol poisoning. After reviewing footage of Jesse drinking, she decides not to launch an investigation. After [[#Mitchell Deveraux|Mitchell Deveraux]] (Imran Adams) is reported for homophobic abuse against [[#Azim Desai|Azim Desai]] (Nav Sidhu), D.S. Cohen arrests him. Once Azim drops the charges, she releases Mitchell. When [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) comes to find her to ask about Breda's body, D.S. Cohen tells him that it was mostly burnt, fueling his paranoia that Breda had returned. After learning where [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) is, D.S.

Cohen investigates after [[Joel Dexter]] ([[Rory Douglas-Speed]]) is assaulted by [[Liam Donovan]] (Jude Monk McGowan). She arrests Liam for the assault, after [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) reports that she saw him follow Joel into the alley. However, after threats from [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), Joel doesn't identify Liam as the person who assaulted them, telling D.S. Cohen it was just a random person. D.S. Cohen tells Diane when Harry's body is ready to be released. After Diane reports Mercedes for murdering Harry, D.S. Cohen arrives to arrest her, however she is unable to arrest her as [[Sylver McQueen]] (David Tag) refuses to reveal her whereabouts. She later comes to question Liam over Mercedes's disappearance, but is stopped when [[Goldie McQueen]] ([[Chelsee Healey]]) discovers her body. The next day, she collects alibis from Sylver, Liam and [[Grace Black]] ([[Tamara Wall]]). After a tip-off from Liam, she arrives to search The Dog, looking for a gun, but Grace manages to hide it. Sylver tells D.S. Cohen about why Liam would want Mercedes dead, and when an officer finds the gun in Liam's car, she arrests him. She prepares to charge Liam with shooting Mercedes, until James intervenes and gets the charges against him dropped. After [[#Sid Sumner|Sid Sumner]] (Billy Price) pushes [[#Stuart Sumner|Stuart Sumner]] ([[Chris Simmons]]) to his death, D.S. Cohen interviews him. After witness statements say the attack was in self-defence, she drops the charges against him. After Mercedes wakes up from her coma, she tells D.S. Cohen that Sylver shot her, and she subsequently arrests him and charges him for the attempted murder. After blood is found at the crime scene, Diane admits to D.S. Cohen that it is hers. She then shows D.S. Cohen evidence of her kissing [[#Edward Hutchinson|Edward Hutchinson]] ([[Joe McGann]]) as her alibi, which also gives the time of Mercedes's shooting. Later, Mercedes goes to the police station to tell D.S. Cohen that she's retracting her statement about Sylver shooting her. After [[Breda McQueen]] ([[Moya Brady]]) anonymously drops off a picture with a confession written on it, D.S. Cohen runs forensics and decides that Mercedes is the village's serial killer. D.S. Cohen then has Mercedes arrested for the murders, but fails to find evidence at The Dog that could convict her. After Breda is discovered to be the serial killer, D.S. Cohen attempts to speak to Mercedes to get her version of events for what happened on the pig farm, but she is rebuffed. After [[Jesse Donovan]] ([[Luke Jerdy]]) dies, D.S. Cohen returns his personal items to [[Courtney Campbell]] (Amy Conachan), and tells her Grace and Liam that Jesse died from alcohol poisoning. After reviewing footage of Jesse drinking, she decides not to launch an investigation. After [[#Mitchell Deveraux|Mitchell Deveraux]] (Imran Adams) is reported for homophobic abuse against [[#Azim Desai|Azim Desai]] (Nav Sidhu), D.S. Cohen arrests him. Once Azim drops the charges, she releases Mitchell. When [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) comes to find her to ask about Breda's body, D.S. Cohen tells him that it was mostly burnt, fueling his paranoia that Breda had returned. After learning where [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) is, D.S.
