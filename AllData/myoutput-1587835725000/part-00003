It features the [[Marvel Comics]] characters ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' in a side-scrolling [[Beat 'em up|brawling]] and [[Shoot 'em up|shooting]] adventure to defeat the evil [[Red Skull]]. The game received ports for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Gear]]. A different Data East game was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Red Skull has assembled an army of supervillains and other henchmen in a plot to take over the world. Along with battling generic enemies, players also face [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], the [[Living Laser]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], [[Sentinel (comics)|a Sentinel]], [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Ultron]], the assassin [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], and finally the Red Skull himself.\n\nPlayers can choose to play as one of four members of the Avengers: [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Each character can fight hand-to-hand; throw select items when on the ground; and use a ranged special attack, either a projectile weapon (Captain America's shield and Hawkeye's arrows) or an energy beam (Iron Man and Vision), known as that character's \"Avenger Attack.\" During a jump, Captain America and Hawkeye can attack with a flying kick, while Iron Man and Vision instead attack by firing their energy beams at a 45 degree angle. Other Avengers, including the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Wonder Man]], and [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], appear when special power-ups are collected, allowing those characters to temporarily assist the players' characters.\n\nMost game levels feature side-scrolling fighting, with free movement as in traditional arcade brawlers. Occasionally, players take flight for side-scrolling flying & shooting sequences; Iron Man and Vision fly on their own, while Captain America and Hawkeye use flying machines.\n\n==Versions==\n[[Image:Captain America and The Avengers (Arcade) gameplay.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of the 1991 two-player arcade version.]]\nThe original arcade game was sold in two forms. One version allowed four players to play simultaneously, with each player position controlling a specific character. An alternate version featured two-player gameplay, with players able to select from any of the available four characters.\n\n==Ports and related releases==\nData East released a home version of the game in North America for the [[Sega Genesis]] co-developed with ISCO/Opera House.<ref>http://www.isco-inc.co.jp/Web_izen/game_etc.htm</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20161220184805/http://opera-house.co.jp/works.html</ref> This version was published in Europe by [[Sega]] for the [[Mega Drive]].
