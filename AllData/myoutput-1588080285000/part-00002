In German, Pentecost is called ''Pfingsten'', developed through contracting the Greek term ''pen[te]k[os]te'', and often coincides with scholastic holidays and the beginning of many outdoor and springtime activities, such as festivals and organized outdoor activities by youth organizations. The Monday after Pentecost is a legal holiday in many European nations.\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity]], Pentecost can also refer to the entire fifty days of [[Easter]] through Pentecost inclusive; hence the book containing the liturgical texts is called the \"''[[Pentecostarion]]''\". Since its date depends on the [[date of Easter]], Pentecost is a \"[[moveable feast]]\".\n\nPentecost is one of the [[Great Feasts]] of the Eastern Orthodox Church, a [[Solemnity]] in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)#Festivals|Festival]] in the Lutheran Churches, and a [[Principal Feast]] in the Anglican Communion. Many Christian denominations provide a special liturgy for this holy celebration.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term Pentecost comes from the Greek {{lang|el|\u03a0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae}} ({{transl|grc|Pent\u0113kost\u0113}}) meaning \"fiftieth\".

He also denounces [[Manichean]] doctrine on the Holy Spirit, which taught that the Holy Spirit was present in [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]]. Leo discusses other Catholic doctrine pertaining to the Holy Spirit, especially emphasizing the Spirit's relationship to the Father and Son of the Trinity and the Catholic Church.

[[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|Orthodox churches]] are often decorated with greenery and flowers on this feast day, and the celebration is intentionally similar to the Jewish holiday of [[Shavuot]], which celebrates the giving of the [[Mosaic Law]].\n\nThe feast itself lasts three days.

This is a [[Great Vespers|Vespers]] service to which are added three sets of long poetical prayers, the composition of Saint [[Basil the Great]], during which everyone makes a full [[Genuflection#Orthodox Christianity|prostration]], touching their foreheads to the floor (prostrations in church having been forbidden from the day of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter) up to this point).  Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible.<ref>[http://www.stnicholaspdx.org/2004/06/02/25.pentecost-prayers-of-kneeling/ Pentecost\u2014Prayers of Kneeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102021042/http://www.stnicholaspdx.org/2004/06/02/25.pentecost-prayers-of-kneeling/ |date=2013-11-02 }}. See the third prayer.</ref>\n\nAll of the remaining days of the [[ecclesiastical year]], until the preparation for the next [[Great Lent]], are named for the day after Pentecost on which they occur (for example, the 13th Tuesday After Pentecost).\n\nThe Second Monday after Pentecost is the beginning of the [[Apostles' Fast]] (which continues until the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] on June 29). Theologically, Orthodox do not consider Pentecost to be the \"birthday\" of the Church; they see the Church as having existed before the creation of the world (cf. ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'')<ref>''[[Patrologia Graecae]]'', 35:1108\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox [[icon]] of the feast depicts the Twelve Apostles seated in a semicircle (sometimes the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) is shown sitting in the center of them). At the top of the icon, the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of fire, is descending upon them. At the bottom is an [[allegory|allegorical]] figure, called ''[[Cosmos|Kosmos]]'', which symbolizes the world. Although Kosmos is crowned with earthly glory he sits in the darkness caused by the ignorance of God. He is holding a towel on which have been placed 12 scrolls, representing the teaching of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nIn the ancient [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], Pentecost is one of the seven Major \"Lord's Feasts\". It is celebrated at the time of ninth hour (3:00&nbsp;pm) on the Sunday of Pentecost by a special three-segment prayer known as the \"Office of Genuflection (Kneeling Prayer)\". This feast is followed with the \"Apostles Fast\" which has a fixed end date on the fifth of the Coptic month of Epip [which currently falls on July 12, which is equivalent to June 29, due to the current 13-day Julian-Gregorian calendar offset]. The fifth of Epip is the commemoration of the Martyrdom of St. Peter and Paul.\n\n=== Western churches ===\n[[File:Pentecost Altar.jpg|thumb|A Protestant church altar, decorated for Pentecost with red burning candles and red banners and altar cloth depicting the movement of the Holy Spirit]]\n\nThe liturgical celebrations of Pentecost in [[Western Christianity|Western churches]] are as rich and varied as those in the East.

It symbolizes joy and the fire of the Holy Spirit.\n\nPriests or ministers, and choirs wear red [[vestments]], and in modern times, the custom has extended to the [[laity|lay people]] of the congregation wearing red clothing in celebration as well.

Red flowers at the altar/preaching area, and red flowering plants such as [[geraniums]] around the church are also typical decorations for Pentecost masses/services.

At Pentecost, these Holy Ghost holes would be decorated with flowers, and sometimes a dove figure lowered through into the church while the narrative of Pentecost was read. Holy Ghost holes can still be seen today in European churches such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|reason=I can't find any scholarly references to this \u2013 'Middle Ages' is a huge category with ecclesiastical and architectural shifts occurring in various countries at various times.|date=November 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, a large two dimensional dove figure would be, and in some places still is, cut from wood, painted, and decorated with flowers, to be lowered over the congregation, particularly during the singing of the [[sequence (poetry)|sequence hymn]], or ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]''. In other places, particularly [[Sicily]] and the [[Italy|Italian peninsula]], [[Rosalia (festival)#Rose Sundays|rose petals]] were and are thrown from the galleries over the congregation, recalling the tongues of fire. In modern times, this practice has been revived, and adapted as well, to include the strewing of [[origami]] doves from above or suspending them, sometimes by the hundreds, from the ceiling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecva.org/congregations/resources/trinity_bloomington_pentecost/trinity_pentecost.htm |title=The Episcopal Church and Visual Arts |publisher=Ecva.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, red fans, or red handkerchiefs, are distributed to the congregation to be waved during the procession, etc. Other congregations have incorporated the use of red balloons, signifying the \"Birthday of the Church\". These may be borne by the congregants, decorate the sanctuary, or released all at once.\n\n=== Fasting, baptisms, and confirmations ===\nFor some [[Protestants]], the nine days between [[Ascension Day]], and Pentecost are set aside as a time of [[fasting]] and universal prayer in honor of the disciples' time of prayer and unity awaiting the Holy Spirit. Similarly among [[Roman Catholics]], special Pentecost [[novenas]] are prayed. The Pentecost Novena is considered the first novena, all other novenas prayed in preparation of various feasts deriving their practice from those original nine days of prayer observed by the disciples of Christ.\n\nWhile the Eve of Pentecost was traditionally a day of fasting for Catholics, contemporary [[canon law]] no longer requires it. Both Catholics and Protestants may hold spiritual [[retreats]], prayer [[vigil]]s, and [[litanies]] in the days leading up to Pentecost. In some cases vigils on the Eve of Pentecost may last all night. Pentecost is also one of the occasions specially appointed for the Lutheran Litany to be sung.<ref>{{cite web |author=(P. Drews.) |url=http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc06/htm/iii.lxxiv.xvi.htm |title=Litany |publisher=Ccel.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early days of Western Christianity, Pentecost became one of the days set aside to celebrate [[Baptism]]. In Northern Europe Pentecost was preferred even over Easter for this rite, as the temperatures in late spring might be supposed to be more conducive to outdoor [[immersion baptism|immersion]] as was then the practice. It is proposed that the term [[Whit Sunday]] derives from the custom of the newly baptized wearing white clothing, and from the white vestments worn by the clergy in [[Sarum Rite|English liturgical uses]]. The holiday was also one of the three days each year (along with [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]) Roman Catholics were required to [[confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] in order to remain in good ecclesiastical standing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06278a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Frequent Communion |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nHoly Communion is likewise often a feature of the Protestant observance of Pentecost as well. It is one of the relatively few Sundays some [[Reformed]] denominations may offer the communion meal, and is one of the days of the year specially appointed among [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] for the celebration of their Love Feasts. [[Ordinations]] are celebrated across a wide array of Western denominations at Pentecost, or near to it. In some denominations, for example the [[Lutheran]] Church, even if an ordination or consecration of a [[deaconess]] is not celebrated on Pentecost, the [[liturgical color]] will invariably be red, and the theme of the service will be the Holy Spirit.\n\nAbove all, Pentecost is a day to hold [[Confirmation]] celebrations for youth. Flowers, the wearing of white robes or white dresses recalling Baptism, rites such as the [[laying on of hands]], and vibrant singing play prominent roles on these joyous occasions, the blossoming of Spring forming an equal analogy with the blossoming of youth.\n\nThe typical image of Pentecost in the West is that of the [[Virgin Mary]] seated centrally and prominently among the disciples with flames resting on the crowns of their heads. Occasionally, parting clouds suggesting the action of the \"mighty wind\",<ref name=\"bibleverse|Acts|2:2|KJV\" /> rays of light and the Dove are also depicted. Of course, the Western iconographic style is less static and stylized than that of the East, and other very different representations have been produced, and, in some cases, have achieved great fame such as the Pentecosts by [[Titian]], [[Giotto]], and [[el Greco]].\n\n[[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] already in the 1st century notes the importance of this festival to the [[early Christian]] communities. (See: {{bibleref2|Acts|20:16}} & {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|16:8}}) Since the lifetime of some who may have been eyewitnesses, annual celebrations of the descent of the Holy Spirit have been observed. Before the [[Second Vatican Council]] [[Whitmonday|Pentecost Monday]] as well was a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] during which the Catholic Church addressed the newly baptized and confirmed. After the Council, Pentecost Monday is no longer solemnized.\n\nNevertheless, Pentecost Monday remains an official festival in many Protestant churches, such as the (Lutheran) [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], and others. In the [[Greek Byzantine Catholic Church|Byzantine Catholic Rite]] Pentecost Monday is no longer a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], but rather a simple [[holiday]]. In the Extraordinary Form of the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, as at Easter, the [[Ranks of Catholic liturgical days|liturgical rank]] of Monday and Tuesday of Pentecost week is a Double of the First Class<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15614b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Pentecost |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> and across many Western denominations, Pentecost is celebrated with an [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] culminating on [[Trinity Sunday]]. However, in the modern Roman Rite (Ordinary Form), Pentecost ends after Evening Prayer on the feast day itself, with [[Ordinary Time]] resuming the next day.\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 018.jpg|thumb|alt=A typical Western image of the Pentecost.

In other cases, Pentecost may be ignored as a holy day in these churches. In many evangelical churches in the United States, the secular holiday, [[Mother's Day]], may be more celebrated than the ancient and biblical feast of Pentecost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.churchyear.net/pentecost.html |title=Pentecost: All About Pentecost (Whitsunday)! |publisher=ChurchYear.net |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> Some evangelicals and Pentecostals are observing the liturgical calendar and observe Pentecost as a day to teach the [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit]].{{clarify|Note that this says just the opposite of the first sentence|date=December 2012}}\n\nAcross denominational lines Pentecost has been an opportunity for Christians to honor the role of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and celebrate the birth of the Church in an [[ecumenical]] context.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themint.org.uk/yPhoto086_PentecostPicnic2009.html |title=Pentecost Picnic 2009 |publisher=Themint.org.uk |accessdate=2010-05-17}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://monashcatholics.blogspot.com/2007/06/photos-of-ecumenical-pentecost.html |title=Catholics at Monash: Photos of Ecumenical Pentecost Celebrations |publisher=MonashCatholics.blogspot.com |date=2007-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\n== Classical compositions for Pentecost ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\nThe [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church of the [[Baroque]] observed three days of Pentecost.

Leo discusses other Catholic doctrine pertaining to the Holy Spirit, especially emphasizing the Spirit's relationship to the Father and Son of the Trinity and the Catholic Church. He draws an analogy between Jewish practices and the Christian feast day: \"As once to the Hebrew people, freed from Egypt, the law was given on Mt.

Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible.<ref>[http://www.stnicholaspdx.org/2004/06/02/25.pentecost-prayers-of-kneeling/ Pentecost\u2014Prayers of Kneeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102021042/http://www.stnicholaspdx.org/2004/06/02/25.pentecost-prayers-of-kneeling/ |date=2013-11-02 }}. See the third prayer.</ref>\n\nAll of the remaining days of the [[ecclesiastical year]], until the preparation for the next [[Great Lent]], are named for the day after Pentecost on which they occur (for example, the 13th Tuesday After Pentecost).\n\nThe Second Monday after Pentecost is the beginning of the [[Apostles' Fast]] (which continues until the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] on June 29). Theologically, Orthodox do not consider Pentecost to be the \"birthday\" of the Church; they see the Church as having existed before the creation of the world (cf. ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'')<ref>''[[Patrologia Graecae]]'', 35:1108\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox [[icon]] of the feast depicts the Twelve Apostles seated in a semicircle (sometimes the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) is shown sitting in the center of them). At the top of the icon, the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of fire, is descending upon them. At the bottom is an [[allegory|allegorical]] figure, called ''[[Cosmos|Kosmos]]'', which symbolizes the world. Although Kosmos is crowned with earthly glory he sits in the darkness caused by the ignorance of God. He is holding a towel on which have been placed 12 scrolls, representing the teaching of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nIn the ancient [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], Pentecost is one of the seven Major \"Lord's Feasts\". It is celebrated at the time of ninth hour (3:00&nbsp;pm) on the Sunday of Pentecost by a special three-segment prayer known as the \"Office of Genuflection (Kneeling Prayer)\". This feast is followed with the \"Apostles Fast\" which has a fixed end date on the fifth of the Coptic month of Epip [which currently falls on July 12, which is equivalent to June 29, due to the current 13-day Julian-Gregorian calendar offset]. The fifth of Epip is the commemoration of the Martyrdom of St. Peter and Paul.\n\n=== Western churches ===\n[[File:Pentecost Altar.jpg|thumb|A Protestant church altar, decorated for Pentecost with red burning candles and red banners and altar cloth depicting the movement of the Holy Spirit]]\n\nThe liturgical celebrations of Pentecost in [[Western Christianity|Western churches]] are as rich and varied as those in the East. The main sign of Pentecost in the West is the color red. It symbolizes joy and the fire of the Holy Spirit.\n\nPriests or ministers, and choirs wear red [[vestments]], and in modern times, the custom has extended to the [[laity|lay people]] of the congregation wearing red clothing in celebration as well.

Red flowers at the altar/preaching area, and red flowering plants such as [[geraniums]] around the church are also typical decorations for Pentecost masses/services. These symbolize the renewal of life, the coming of the warmth of summer, and the growth of the church at and from the first Pentecost.<ref name=\"stcatherineofsweden1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatherineofsweden.org/BULLETIN.htm |title=St. Catherine of Sweden Roman Catholic Church \u2013 Bulletin |publisher=StCatherineofSweden.org |accessdate=2010-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829002010/http://www.stcatherineofsweden.org/BULLETIN.htm |archivedate=2009-08-29 }}</ref> In the southern hemisphere, for example, in southern Australia, Pentecost comes in the mellow autumntide, after the often great heat of summer, and the red leaves of the poinsettia have often been used to decorate churches then.\n\n[[File:Protestant Altar Pentecost Red Flowers Green Birch.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Protestant church altar and font, decorated for Pentecost with red flowering plants and green birch branches|A Protestant church altar and font, decorated for Pentecost with red flowering plants and green birch branches]]\nThese flowers often play an important role in the ancestral rites, and other rites, of the particular congregation.

At Pentecost, these Holy Ghost holes would be decorated with flowers, and sometimes a dove figure lowered through into the church while the narrative of Pentecost was read. Holy Ghost holes can still be seen today in European churches such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|reason=I can't find any scholarly references to this \u2013 'Middle Ages' is a huge category with ecclesiastical and architectural shifts occurring in various countries at various times.|date=November 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, a large two dimensional dove figure would be, and in some places still is, cut from wood, painted, and decorated with flowers, to be lowered over the congregation, particularly during the singing of the [[sequence (poetry)|sequence hymn]], or ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]''. In other places, particularly [[Sicily]] and the [[Italy|Italian peninsula]], [[Rosalia (festival)#Rose Sundays|rose petals]] were and are thrown from the galleries over the congregation, recalling the tongues of fire. In modern times, this practice has been revived, and adapted as well, to include the strewing of [[origami]] doves from above or suspending them, sometimes by the hundreds, from the ceiling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecva.org/congregations/resources/trinity_bloomington_pentecost/trinity_pentecost.htm |title=The Episcopal Church and Visual Arts |publisher=Ecva.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, red fans, or red handkerchiefs, are distributed to the congregation to be waved during the procession, etc. Other congregations have incorporated the use of red balloons, signifying the \"Birthday of the Church\". These may be borne by the congregants, decorate the sanctuary, or released all at once.\n\n=== Fasting, baptisms, and confirmations ===\nFor some [[Protestants]], the nine days between [[Ascension Day]], and Pentecost are set aside as a time of [[fasting]] and universal prayer in honor of the disciples' time of prayer and unity awaiting the Holy Spirit. Similarly among [[Roman Catholics]], special Pentecost [[novenas]] are prayed. The Pentecost Novena is considered the first novena, all other novenas prayed in preparation of various feasts deriving their practice from those original nine days of prayer observed by the disciples of Christ.\n\nWhile the Eve of Pentecost was traditionally a day of fasting for Catholics, contemporary [[canon law]] no longer requires it. Both Catholics and Protestants may hold spiritual [[retreats]], prayer [[vigil]]s, and [[litanies]] in the days leading up to Pentecost. In some cases vigils on the Eve of Pentecost may last all night. Pentecost is also one of the occasions specially appointed for the Lutheran Litany to be sung.<ref>{{cite web |author=(P. Drews.) |url=http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc06/htm/iii.lxxiv.xvi.htm |title=Litany |publisher=Ccel.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early days of Western Christianity, Pentecost became one of the days set aside to celebrate [[Baptism]]. In Northern Europe Pentecost was preferred even over Easter for this rite, as the temperatures in late spring might be supposed to be more conducive to outdoor [[immersion baptism|immersion]] as was then the practice. It is proposed that the term [[Whit Sunday]] derives from the custom of the newly baptized wearing white clothing, and from the white vestments worn by the clergy in [[Sarum Rite|English liturgical uses]]. The holiday was also one of the three days each year (along with [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]) Roman Catholics were required to [[confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] in order to remain in good ecclesiastical standing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06278a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Frequent Communion |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nHoly Communion is likewise often a feature of the Protestant observance of Pentecost as well. It is one of the relatively few Sundays some [[Reformed]] denominations may offer the communion meal, and is one of the days of the year specially appointed among [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] for the celebration of their Love Feasts. [[Ordinations]] are celebrated across a wide array of Western denominations at Pentecost, or near to it. In some denominations, for example the [[Lutheran]] Church, even if an ordination or consecration of a [[deaconess]] is not celebrated on Pentecost, the [[liturgical color]] will invariably be red, and the theme of the service will be the Holy Spirit.\n\nAbove all, Pentecost is a day to hold [[Confirmation]] celebrations for youth. Flowers, the wearing of white robes or white dresses recalling Baptism, rites such as the [[laying on of hands]], and vibrant singing play prominent roles on these joyous occasions, the blossoming of Spring forming an equal analogy with the blossoming of youth.\n\nThe typical image of Pentecost in the West is that of the [[Virgin Mary]] seated centrally and prominently among the disciples with flames resting on the crowns of their heads. Occasionally, parting clouds suggesting the action of the \"mighty wind\",<ref name=\"bibleverse|Acts|2:2|KJV\" /> rays of light and the Dove are also depicted. Of course, the Western iconographic style is less static and stylized than that of the East, and other very different representations have been produced, and, in some cases, have achieved great fame such as the Pentecosts by [[Titian]], [[Giotto]], and [[el Greco]].\n\n[[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] already in the 1st century notes the importance of this festival to the [[early Christian]] communities. (See: {{bibleref2|Acts|20:16}} & {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|16:8}}) Since the lifetime of some who may have been eyewitnesses, annual celebrations of the descent of the Holy Spirit have been observed. Before the [[Second Vatican Council]] [[Whitmonday|Pentecost Monday]] as well was a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] during which the Catholic Church addressed the newly baptized and confirmed. After the Council, Pentecost Monday is no longer solemnized.\n\nNevertheless, Pentecost Monday remains an official festival in many Protestant churches, such as the (Lutheran) [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], and others. In the [[Greek Byzantine Catholic Church|Byzantine Catholic Rite]] Pentecost Monday is no longer a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], but rather a simple [[holiday]]. In the Extraordinary Form of the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, as at Easter, the [[Ranks of Catholic liturgical days|liturgical rank]] of Monday and Tuesday of Pentecost week is a Double of the First Class<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15614b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Pentecost |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> and across many Western denominations, Pentecost is celebrated with an [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] culminating on [[Trinity Sunday]]. However, in the modern Roman Rite (Ordinary Form), Pentecost ends after Evening Prayer on the feast day itself, with [[Ordinary Time]] resuming the next day.\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 018.jpg|thumb|alt=A typical Western image of the Pentecost.

In other cases, Pentecost may be ignored as a holy day in these churches. In many evangelical churches in the United States, the secular holiday, [[Mother's Day]], may be more celebrated than the ancient and biblical feast of Pentecost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.churchyear.net/pentecost.html |title=Pentecost: All About Pentecost (Whitsunday)! |publisher=ChurchYear.net |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> Some evangelicals and Pentecostals are observing the liturgical calendar and observe Pentecost as a day to teach the [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit]].{{clarify|Note that this says just the opposite of the first sentence|date=December 2012}}\n\nAcross denominational lines Pentecost has been an opportunity for Christians to honor the role of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and celebrate the birth of the Church in an [[ecumenical]] context.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themint.org.uk/yPhoto086_PentecostPicnic2009.html |title=Pentecost Picnic 2009 |publisher=Themint.org.uk |accessdate=2010-05-17}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://monashcatholics.blogspot.com/2007/06/photos-of-ecumenical-pentecost.html |title=Catholics at Monash: Photos of Ecumenical Pentecost Celebrations |publisher=MonashCatholics.blogspot.com |date=2007-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\n== Classical compositions for Pentecost ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\nThe [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church of the [[Baroque]] observed three days of Pentecost.
