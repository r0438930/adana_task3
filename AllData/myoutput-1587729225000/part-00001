{"title_page": "Voronoi diagram", "text_new": "{{Short description|Type of plane partition}}\n[[Image:Euclidean Voronoi diagram.svg|thumb|20 points and their Voronoi cells (larger version [[#Illustration|below]])]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Voronoi diagram''' is a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] into regions close to each of a given set of objects. In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators). For each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] to its [[Delaunay triangulation]].\n\nThe Voronoi diagram is named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy]], and is also called a '''Voronoi tessellation''', a '''Voronoi decomposition''', a '''Voronoi partition''', or a '''Dirichlet tessellation''' (after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]). Voronoi cells are also known as '''Thiessen polygons'''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter A. |last=Burrough |first2=Rachael |last2=McDonnell |first3=Rachael A. |last3=McDonnell |first4=Christopher D. |last4=Lloyd |title=Principles of Geographical Information Systems |chapter=8.11 Nearest neighbours: Thiessen (Dirichlet/Voroni) polygons |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvoJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160 |year=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874284-5 |pages=160\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Paul A. |last=Longley |first2=Michael F. |last2=Goodchild |first3=David J. |last3=Maguire |first4=David W. |last4=Rhind |title=Geographic Information Systems and Science |chapter=14.4.4.1 Thiessen polygons |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FbVI-2tSuYC&pg=PA333 |date=2005 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-87001-3 |pages=333\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Zekai |last=Sen |title=Spatial Modeling Principles in Earth Sciences |chapter=2.8.1 Delaney, Varoni, and Thiessen Polygons  |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N0yDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA57 |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-41758-5 |pages=57\u2013}}</ref> Voronoi diagrams have practical and theoretical applications in many fields, mainly in [[science]] and [[technology]], but also in [[visual art]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Franz |last=Aurenhammer |authorlink=Franz Aurenhammer |date=1991 |title=Voronoi Diagrams \u2013 A Survey of a Fundamental Geometric Data Structure |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=345\u2013405 |doi=10.1145/116873.116880}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Atsuyuki |last1=Okabe |first2=Barry |last2=Boots |first3=Kokichi |last3=Sugihara |first4=Sung Nok |last4=Chiu |date=2000 |title=Spatial Tessellations \u2013 Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-98635-5}}</ref>\n\n==The simplest case==\nIn the simplest case, shown in the first picture, we are given a finite set of points {''p''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>} in the [[Euclidean plane]]. In this case each site ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> is simply a point, and its corresponding Voronoi cell ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> consists of every point in the Euclidean plane whose distance to ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> is less than or equal to its distance to any other ''p''<sub>''k''</sub>. Each such cell is obtained from the intersection of [[Half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]], and hence it is a [[convex polygon]]. The [[line segment]]s of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites.  The Voronoi vertices ([[Node (graph theory)|node]]s) are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites.\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet <math display=\"inline\"> X </math> be a [[metric space]] with distance function <math display=\"inline\">d</math>. Let <math display=\"inline\">K</math> be a set of indices and let <math display=\"inline\">(P_k)_{k \\in K}</math> be a [[tuple]] (ordered collection) of nonempty [[subsets]] (the sites) in the space <math display=\"inline\"> X</math>. The Voronoi cell, or Voronoi region,  <math display=\"inline\"> R_k</math>, associated with the site <math display=\"inline\">P_k</math> is the set of all points in <math display=\"inline\">X</math> whose distance to <math display=\"inline\"> P_k</math> is not greater than their distance to the other sites <math display=\"inline\">P_j</math>, where <math display=\"inline\">j</math> is any index different from <math display=\"inline\">k</math>. In other words, if <math display=\"inline\"> d(x,\\, A) = \\inf\\{d(x,\\, a) \\mid a \\in A\\}</math> denotes the distance between the point <math display=\"inline\">x</math> and the subset <math display=\"inline\">A</math>, then\n\n:<math> R_k = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_k) \\leq d(x, P_j)\\; \\text{for all}\\; j \\neq k\\}</math>\n\nThe Voronoi diagram is simply the [[tuple]] of cells <math display=\"inline\">(R_k)_{k \\in K} </math>. In principle, some of the sites can intersect and even coincide (an application is described below for sites representing shops), but usually they are assumed to be disjoint. In addition, infinitely many sites are allowed in the definition (this setting has  applications in [[geometry of numbers]] and [[crystallography]]), but again, in many cases only finitely many sites are considered.\n\nIn the particular case where the space is a [[finite-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], each site is a point, there are finitely many points and all of them are different, then the Voronoi cells are [[convex polytope]]s and they can be represented in a combinatorial way using their vertices, sides, two-dimensional faces, etc. Sometimes the induced combinatorial structure is referred to as the Voronoi diagram. However, the Voronoi cells may not be convex or even connected.\n\nIn the usual Euclidean space,  we can rewrite the formal definition in usual terms. Each Voronoi polygon <math display=\"inline\">R_k</math> is associated with a generator point  <math display=\"inline\">P_k</math>.\nLet <math display=\"inline\">X</math> be the set of all points in the Euclidean space. Let <math display=\"inline\">P_1</math> be a point that generates its Voronoi region  <math display=\"inline\">R_1</math>, <math display=\"inline\">P_2</math> that generates  <math display=\"inline\">R_2</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">P_3</math> that generates  <math display=\"inline\">R_3</math>, and so on. <!--Then,\n\n:<math> R_1 = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_1) \\leq d(x, P_2) \\;\\and\\; d(x, P_1) \\leq d(x, P_3) \\;\\and\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n:<math> R_2 = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_2) \\leq d(x, P_1) \\;\\and\\; d(x, P_2) \\leq d(x, P_3) \\;\\and\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n:...\n--> Then, as expressed by Tran ''et al''<ref name=\"Tran09\">{{cite book |first1=Q.

Suppose we want to estimate the number of customers of a given shop. With all else being equal (price, products, quality of service, etc.), it is reasonable to assume that customers choose their preferred shop simply by distance considerations: they will go to the shop located nearest to them. In this case the Voronoi cell <math>\\scriptstyle R_k</math> of a given shop <math>\\scriptstyle P_k</math> can be used for giving a rough estimate on the number of potential customers going to this shop (which is modeled by a point in our city).\n\nFor most cities, the distance between points can be measured using the familiar\n[[Euclidean distance]]: <math>\\ell_2 = d\\left[\\left(a_1, a_2\\right), \\left(b_1, b_2\\right)\\right] = \\sqrt{\\left(a_1 - b_1\\right)^2 + \\left(a_2 - b_2\\right)^2}</math> or the [[Manhattan distance]]:<math>d\\left[\\left(a_1, a_2\\right), \\left(b_1, b_2\\right)\\right] = \\left|a_1 - b_1\\right| + \\left|a_2 - b_2\\right|</math>. The corresponding Voronoi diagrams look different for different distance metrics.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 382\n | header    = Voronoi diagrams of 20 points under two different metrics\n | header_align = center\n | image1    = Euclidean Voronoi diagram.svg\n | alt1      = Voronoi diagram under Euclidean distance\n | caption1  = [[Euclidean distance]]\n | image2    = Manhattan Voronoi Diagram.svg\n | alt2      = Voronoi diagram under Manhattan distance\n | caption2  = [[Manhattan distance]]\n}}\n\n==Properties==\n* The [[dual graph]] for a Voronoi diagram (in the case of a [[Euclidean space]] with point sites) corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.\n* The [[closest pair of points]] corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram.\n* Assume the setting is the [[Euclidean plane]] and a group of different points is given. Then two points are adjacent on the [[convex hull]] if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side.\n* If the space is a [[normed space]] and the distance to each site is attained (e.g., when a site is a [[compact set]] or a closed ball), then each Voronoi cell can be represented as a union of line segments emanating from the sites.<ref name=Reem_alg>{{harvnb|Reem|2009}}</ref> As shown there, this property does not necessarily hold when the distance is not attained.\n* Under relatively general conditions (the space is a possibly infinite-dimensional [[uniformly convex space]], there can be infinitely many sites of a general form, etc.) Voronoi cells enjoy a certain stability property: a small change in the shapes of the sites, e.g., a change caused by some translation or distortion, yields a small change in the shape of the Voronoi cells. This is the geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams.<ref name=Reem_geo_stable>{{harvnb|Reem|2011}}</ref> As shown there, this property does not hold in general, even if the space is two-dimensional (but non-uniformly convex, and, in particular, non-Euclidean) and the sites are points.\n\n==History and research==\nInformal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to [[Descartes]] in 1644. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] used two-dimensional and three-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850.\nBritish physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] used a Voronoi diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|Broad Street cholera outbreak]] lived closer to the infected [[Soho#Broad Street pump|Broad Street pump]] than to any other water pump.\n\nVoronoi diagrams are named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy|Georgy Feodosievych Voronoy]] who defined and studied the general ''n''-dimensional case in 1908. Voronoi diagrams that are used in [[geophysics]] and [[meteorology]] to analyse spatially distributed data (such as rainfall measurements) are called Thiessen polygons after American meteorologist [[Alfred H. Thiessen]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], such tessellations are also known as [[Wigner\u2013Seitz unit cell]]s. Voronoi tessellations of the [[reciprocal lattice]] of [[momentum|momenta]] are called [[Brillouin zone]]s. For general lattices in [[Lie group]]s,  the cells are simply called [[fundamental domain]]s. In the case of general [[metric space]]s, the cells are often called metric [[fundamental polygon]]s.\nOther equivalent names for this concept (or particular important cases of it): Voronoi polyhedra, Voronoi polygons, domain(s) of influence, Voronoi decomposition, Voronoi tessellation(s), Dirichlet tessellation(s).\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:Coloured Voronoi 3D slice.svg|right|thumb|This is a slice of the Voronoi diagram of a random set of points in a 3D box. In general, a cross section of a 3D Voronoi tessellation is not a 2D Voronoi tessellation itself. (The cells are all [[Convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].)]]\n\nVoronoi tessellations of regular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]]s of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations.\n* A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares). See [https://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/voronoi.html here] for a dynamic visual example.\n* A [[simple cubic lattice]] gives the [[cubic honeycomb]].\n* A [[hexagonal close-packed]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron|trapezo-rhombic dodecahedra]].\n* A [[face-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedra]].\n* A [[body-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[truncated octahedron|truncated octahedra]].\n* Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each other's centers give the [[hexagonal prismatic honeycomb]].\n* Certain body-centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with [[rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron|rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra]].\n\nFor the set of points (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') with ''x'' in a discrete set ''X'' and ''y'' in a discrete set ''Y'', we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers.\n\n==Higher-order Voronoi diagrams==\nAlthough a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in ''S'', an ''n''th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of ''n'' points in ''S'' as its ''n'' nearest neighbors. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space.\n\nHigher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively.  To generate the ''n''<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram from set&nbsp;''S'', start with the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<sup>th</sup>-order diagram and replace each cell generated by ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''X''.\n\n===Farthest-point Voronoi diagram===\nFor a set of ''n'' points the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.\n\nFor a given set of points ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''p''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''p''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>} the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of ''P'' is the farthest point. A point of ''P'' has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the [[convex hull]] of ''P''. Let ''H''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''h''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''h''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''h''<sub>''k''</sub>} be the convex hull of ''P''; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into ''k'' cells, one for each point in ''H'', with the property that a point ''q'' lies in the cell corresponding to a site ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> if and only if d(''q'', ''h''<sub>''i''</sub>) > d(''q'', ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>) for each ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''S'' with ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2260 ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>, where d(''p'', ''q'') is the [[Euclidean distance]] between two points ''p'' and&nbsp;''q''.<ref name=\"berg2008\">{{cite book|year=2008|title=Computational Geometry |isbn=978-3-540-77974-2 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|edition=Third |first1=Mark |last1=de Berg |first2=Marc |last2=van Kreveld |first3=Mark |last3=Overmars |first4=Otfried |last4=Schwarzkopf |authorlink1=Mark de Berg |authorlink2=Marc van Kreveld |authorlink3=Mark Overmars |authorlink4=Otfried Schwarzkopf }} 7.4 Farthest-Point Voronoi Diagrams.

However, in these cases the boundaries of the Voronoi cells may be more complicated than in the Euclidean case, since the equidistant locus for two points may fail to be subspace of codimension 1, even in the two-dimensional case.\n\n[[Image:Approximate Voronoi Diagram.svg|thumb|Approximate Voronoi diagram of a set of points. Notice the blended colors in the fuzzy boundary of the Voronoi cells.]]\nA [[weighted Voronoi diagram]] is the one in which the function of a pair of points to define a Voronoi cell is a distance function modified by multiplicative or additive weights assigned to generator points. In contrast to the case of Voronoi cells defined using a distance which is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], in this case some of the Voronoi cells  may be empty. A [[power diagram]] is a type of Voronoi diagram defined from a set of circles using the [[Power of a point|power distance]]; it can also be thought of as a weighted Voronoi diagram in which a weight defined from the radius of each circle is added to the [[quadrance|squared distance]] from the circle's center.<ref>{{cite book |last=Edelsbrunner|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|chapter=13.6 Power Diagrams|pages=327\u2013328|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=EATCS Monographs on Theoretical Computer Science|title=Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry|volume=10|origyear=1987 |year=2012 |isbn=9783642615689}}.</ref>\n\nThe Voronoi diagram of ''n'' points in ''d''-dimensional space requires <math>\\textstyle O\\left(n^{\\left\\lceil d/2 \\right\\rceil}\\right)</math> storage space.{{clarify | reason = 'Storage space' for what, exactly?|date=November 2016}} Therefore, Voronoi diagrams are often not feasible for ''d''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2.{{clarify | reason = It seems implausible that a modern computer could not easily work with, say, a 3D diagram for reasonable ''n''|date=November 2016}} An alternative is to use [[approximate Voronoi diagram]]s, where the Voronoi cells have a fuzzy boundary, which can be approximated.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Space-efficient approximate Voronoi diagrams |isbn=1581134959 |doi=10.1145/509907.510011 |title=Proceedings of the thiry-fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing |first=Sunil |last=Sunil Arya |first2=Theocharis |last2=Malamatos |first3=David M. |last3=Mount |author3link=David Mount |date=2002 |pages=721\u2013730 }}</ref>\n\nVoronoi diagrams are also related to other geometric structures such as the [[medial axis]] (which has found applications in image segmentation, [[optical character recognition]], and other computational applications), [[straight skeleton]], and [[zone diagram]]s.

These methods can be used in spaces of arbitrary dimension to iteratively converge towards a specialized form of the Voronoi diagram, called a [[Centroidal Voronoi tessellation]], where the sites have been moved to points that are also the geometric centers of their cells.\n\n==Software tools==\nVoronoi diagrams require a computational step before showing the results. An efficient tool therefore would process the computation in real time to show a direct result to the user. Many commercial and free applications exist. A particularly practical type of tools are the web based ones. Web based tool are easier to access and reference. Also, [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] being a natively supported format by the web, allows at the same time an efficient (GPU accelerated) rendering and is a standard format supported by multiple [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] tools (e.g. [[Autodesk]] Fusion360).\n* [https://www.voronator.com/ Voronator] is a free (Ad based) tool acting on 3D object meshes to apply Voronoi on their surface.

In this case each site ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> is simply a point, and its corresponding Voronoi cell ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> consists of every point in the Euclidean plane whose distance to ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> is less than or equal to its distance to any other ''p''<sub>''k''</sub>. Each such cell is obtained from the intersection of [[Half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]], and hence it is a [[convex polygon]]. The [[line segment]]s of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites.  The Voronoi vertices ([[Node (graph theory)|node]]s) are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites.\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet <math display=\"inline\"> X </math> be a [[metric space]] with distance function <math display=\"inline\">d</math>. Let <math display=\"inline\">K</math> be a set of indices and let <math display=\"inline\">(P_k)_{k \\in K}</math> be a [[tuple]] (ordered collection) of nonempty [[subsets]] (the sites) in the space <math display=\"inline\"> X</math>. The Voronoi cell, or Voronoi region,  <math display=\"inline\"> R_k</math>, associated with the site <math display=\"inline\">P_k</math> is the set of all points in <math display=\"inline\">X</math> whose distance to <math display=\"inline\"> P_k</math> is not greater than their distance to the other sites <math display=\"inline\">P_j</math>, where <math display=\"inline\">j</math> is any index different from <math display=\"inline\">k</math>. In other words, if <math display=\"inline\"> d(x,\\, A) = \\inf\\{d(x,\\, a) \\mid a \\in A\\}</math> denotes the distance between the point <math display=\"inline\">x</math> and the subset <math display=\"inline\">A</math>, then\n\n:<math> R_k = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_k) \\leq d(x, P_j)\\; \\text{for all}\\; j \\neq k\\}</math>\n\nThe Voronoi diagram is simply the [[tuple]] of cells <math display=\"inline\">(R_k)_{k \\in K} </math>. In principle, some of the sites can intersect and even coincide (an application is described below for sites representing shops), but usually they are assumed to be disjoint. In addition, infinitely many sites are allowed in the definition (this setting has  applications in [[geometry of numbers]] and [[crystallography]]), but again, in many cases only finitely many sites are considered.\n\nIn the particular case where the space is a [[finite-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], each site is a point, there are finitely many points and all of them are different, then the Voronoi cells are [[convex polytope]]s and they can be represented in a combinatorial way using their vertices, sides, two-dimensional faces, etc. Sometimes the induced combinatorial structure is referred to as the Voronoi diagram. However, the Voronoi cells may not be convex or even connected.\n\nIn the usual Euclidean space,  we can rewrite the formal definition in usual terms. Each Voronoi polygon <math display=\"inline\">R_k</math> is associated with a generator point  <math display=\"inline\">P_k</math>.\nLet <math display=\"inline\">X</math> be the set of all points in the Euclidean space. Let <math display=\"inline\">P_1</math> be a point that generates its Voronoi region  <math display=\"inline\">R_1</math>, <math display=\"inline\">P_2</math> that generates  <math display=\"inline\">R_2</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">P_3</math> that generates  <math display=\"inline\">R_3</math>, and so on. <!--Then,\n\n:<math> R_1 = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_1) \\leq d(x, P_2) \\;\\and\\; d(x, P_1) \\leq d(x, P_3) \\;\\and\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n:<math> R_2 = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_2) \\leq d(x, P_1) \\;\\and\\; d(x, P_2) \\leq d(x, P_3) \\;\\and\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n:...\n--> Then, as expressed by Tran ''et al''<ref name=\"Tran09\">{{cite book |first1=Q.

Suppose we want to estimate the number of customers of a given shop. With all else being equal (price, products, quality of service, etc.), it is reasonable to assume that customers choose their preferred shop simply by distance considerations: they will go to the shop located nearest to them. In this case the Voronoi cell <math>\\scriptstyle R_k</math> of a given shop <math>\\scriptstyle P_k</math> can be used for giving a rough estimate on the number of potential customers going to this shop (which is modeled by a point in our city).\n\nFor most cities, the distance between points can be measured using the familiar\n[[Euclidean distance]]: <math>\\ell_2 = d\\left[\\left(a_1, a_2\\right), \\left(b_1, b_2\\right)\\right] = \\sqrt{\\left(a_1 - b_1\\right)^2 + \\left(a_2 - b_2\\right)^2}</math> or the [[Manhattan distance]]:<math>d\\left[\\left(a_1, a_2\\right), \\left(b_1, b_2\\right)\\right] = \\left|a_1 - b_1\\right| + \\left|a_2 - b_2\\right|</math>. The corresponding Voronoi diagrams look different for different distance metrics.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 382\n | header    = Voronoi diagrams of 20 points under two different metrics\n | header_align = center\n | image1    = Euclidean Voronoi diagram.svg\n | alt1      = Voronoi diagram under Euclidean distance\n | caption1  = [[Euclidean distance]]\n | image2    = Manhattan Voronoi Diagram.svg\n | alt2      = Voronoi diagram under Manhattan distance\n | caption2  = [[Manhattan distance]]\n}}\n\n==Properties==\n* The [[dual graph]] for a Voronoi diagram (in the case of a [[Euclidean space]] with point sites) corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.\n* The [[closest pair of points]] corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram.\n* Assume the setting is the [[Euclidean plane]] and a group of different points is given. Then two points are adjacent on the [[convex hull]] if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side.\n* If the space is a [[normed space]] and the distance to each site is attained (e.g., when a site is a [[compact set]] or a closed ball), then each Voronoi cell can be represented as a union of line segments emanating from the sites.<ref name=Reem_alg>{{harvnb|Reem|2009}}</ref> As shown there, this property does not necessarily hold when the distance is not attained.\n* Under relatively general conditions (the space is a possibly infinite-dimensional [[uniformly convex space]], there can be infinitely many sites of a general form, etc.) Voronoi cells enjoy a certain stability property: a small change in the shapes of the sites, e.g., a change caused by some translation or distortion, yields a small change in the shape of the Voronoi cells. This is the geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams.<ref name=Reem_geo_stable>{{harvnb|Reem|2011}}</ref> As shown there, this property does not hold in general, even if the space is two-dimensional (but non-uniformly convex, and, in particular, non-Euclidean) and the sites are points.\n\n==History and research==\nInformal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to [[Descartes]] in 1644. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] used two-dimensional and three-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850.\nBritish physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] used a Voronoi diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|Broad Street cholera outbreak]] lived closer to the infected [[Soho#Broad Street pump|Broad Street pump]] than to any other water pump.\n\nVoronoi diagrams are named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy|Georgy Feodosievych Voronoy]] who defined and studied the general ''n''-dimensional case in 1908. Voronoi diagrams that are used in [[geophysics]] and [[meteorology]] to analyse spatially distributed data (such as rainfall measurements) are called Thiessen polygons after American meteorologist [[Alfred H. Thiessen]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], such tessellations are also known as [[Wigner\u2013Seitz unit cell]]s. Voronoi tessellations of the [[reciprocal lattice]] of [[momentum|momenta]] are called [[Brillouin zone]]s. For general lattices in [[Lie group]]s,  the cells are simply called [[fundamental domain]]s. In the case of general [[metric space]]s, the cells are often called metric [[fundamental polygon]]s.\nOther equivalent names for this concept (or particular important cases of it): Voronoi polyhedra, Voronoi polygons, domain(s) of influence, Voronoi decomposition, Voronoi tessellation(s), Dirichlet tessellation(s).\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:Coloured Voronoi 3D slice.svg|right|thumb|This is a slice of the Voronoi diagram of a random set of points in a 3D box. In general, a cross section of a 3D Voronoi tessellation is not a 2D Voronoi tessellation itself. (The cells are all [[Convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].)]]\n\nVoronoi tessellations of regular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]]s of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations.\n* A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares). See [https://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/voronoi.html here] for a dynamic visual example.\n* A [[simple cubic lattice]] gives the [[cubic honeycomb]].\n* A [[hexagonal close-packed]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron|trapezo-rhombic dodecahedra]].\n* A [[face-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedra]].\n* A [[body-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[truncated octahedron|truncated octahedra]].\n* Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each other's centers give the [[hexagonal prismatic honeycomb]].\n* Certain body-centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with [[rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron|rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra]].\n\nFor the set of points (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') with ''x'' in a discrete set ''X'' and ''y'' in a discrete set ''Y'', we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers.\n\n==Higher-order Voronoi diagrams==\nAlthough a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in ''S'', an ''n''th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of ''n'' points in ''S'' as its ''n'' nearest neighbors. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space.\n\nHigher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively.  To generate the ''n''<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram from set&nbsp;''S'', start with the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<sup>th</sup>-order diagram and replace each cell generated by ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''X''.\n\n===Farthest-point Voronoi diagram===\nFor a set of ''n'' points the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.\n\nFor a given set of points ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''p''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''p''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>} the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of ''P'' is the farthest point. A point of ''P'' has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the [[convex hull]] of ''P''. Let ''H''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''h''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''h''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''h''<sub>''k''</sub>} be the convex hull of ''P''; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into ''k'' cells, one for each point in ''H'', with the property that a point ''q'' lies in the cell corresponding to a site ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> if and only if d(''q'', ''h''<sub>''i''</sub>) > d(''q'', ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>) for each ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''S'' with ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2260 ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>, where d(''p'', ''q'') is the [[Euclidean distance]] between two points ''p'' and&nbsp;''q''.<ref name=\"berg2008\">{{cite book|year=2008|title=Computational Geometry |isbn=978-3-540-77974-2 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|edition=Third |first1=Mark |last1=de Berg |first2=Marc |last2=van Kreveld |first3=Mark |last3=Overmars |first4=Otfried |last4=Schwarzkopf |authorlink1=Mark de Berg |authorlink2=Marc van Kreveld |authorlink3=Mark Overmars |authorlink4=Otfried Schwarzkopf }} 7.4 Farthest-Point Voronoi Diagrams.

However, in these cases the boundaries of the Voronoi cells may be more complicated than in the Euclidean case, since the equidistant locus for two points may fail to be subspace of codimension 1, even in the two-dimensional case.\n\n[[Image:Approximate Voronoi Diagram.svg|thumb|Approximate Voronoi diagram of a set of points. Notice the blended colors in the fuzzy boundary of the Voronoi cells.]]\nA [[weighted Voronoi diagram]] is the one in which the function of a pair of points to define a Voronoi cell is a distance function modified by multiplicative or additive weights assigned to generator points. In contrast to the case of Voronoi cells defined using a distance which is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], in this case some of the Voronoi cells  may be empty. A [[power diagram]] is a type of Voronoi diagram defined from a set of circles using the [[Power of a point|power distance]]; it can also be thought of as a weighted Voronoi diagram in which a weight defined from the radius of each circle is added to the [[quadrance|squared distance]] from the circle's center.<ref>{{cite book |last=Edelsbrunner|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|chapter=13.6 Power Diagrams|pages=327\u2013328|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=EATCS Monographs on Theoretical Computer Science|title=Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry|volume=10|origyear=1987 |year=2012 |isbn=9783642615689}}.</ref>\n\nThe Voronoi diagram of ''n'' points in ''d''-dimensional space requires <math>\\textstyle O\\left(n^{\\left\\lceil d/2 \\right\\rceil}\\right)</math> storage space.{{clarify | reason = 'Storage space' for what, exactly?|date=November 2016}} Therefore, Voronoi diagrams are often not feasible for ''d''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2.{{clarify | reason = It seems implausible that a modern computer could not easily work with, say, a 3D diagram for reasonable ''n''|date=November 2016}} An alternative is to use [[approximate Voronoi diagram]]s, where the Voronoi cells have a fuzzy boundary, which can be approximated.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Space-efficient approximate Voronoi diagrams |isbn=1581134959 |doi=10.1145/509907.510011 |title=Proceedings of the thiry-fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing |first=Sunil |last=Sunil Arya |first2=Theocharis |last2=Malamatos |first3=David M. |last3=Mount |author3link=David Mount |date=2002 |pages=721\u2013730 }}</ref>\n\nVoronoi diagrams are also related to other geometric structures such as the [[medial axis]] (which has found applications in image segmentation, [[optical character recognition]], and other computational applications), [[straight skeleton]], and [[zone diagram]]s.

Although the tool acts on 3d, the voronoi processing is based on its 2d surface.\n* [http://www.raymondhill.net/voronoi/rhill-voronoi.html rhill voronoi] is as of 2020 the most popular javascript library for 2d voronoi generation, it is open source and has a community of github and npm users, it is also used by multiple other web based tools. The library tries to provide an efficient javascript computation time to allow real time tools developmet. It does not provide svg export, it is rather using canvas. It provides a demo for live [[Lloyd's algorithm]].\n* [https://websvg.github.io/svg_voronoi_gen/ stg voronoi] is a [https://github.com/stg/SVoronoiG github project] with simple web application yet offering interactive viewing of voronoi cells when moving the mouse. It also provides an SVG export.\n* [https://websvg.github.io/voronoi/ websvg voronoi] is a responsive webapp for voronoi editing and exporting in SVG. It also allows to export and import the seeds coordinates. It is 2d based and it differes from the previous mentioned tools by providing a cells retraction operation, which is not based on scale, rather on edges translation. An edge can be removed if it is consumed by its neighboring edges.\n* [http://alexbeutel.com/webgl/voronoi.html A.Beutel voronoi] is using [[WebGL]] and is providing in addition to static viewing, an animated motion of the voronoi cells.\n===Future of Software tools===\nAlthough voronoi is a very old concept, the currently available tools do lack multiple mathematical functions that could add values to these programs. Examples could be usage of a different cost distance than Euclidean, and mainly 3d voronoi algorithms. Although not being software tools themselves, the first reference explains the concept of 3d voronoi and the second is a 3d voronoi library.\n* [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/classes/6.838/S98/meetings/m25/mm.html 3D Voronoi Diagrams and Medial Axis]\n* [http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/about.html Voro++] A c++ library for 3d voronoi calculation\n==See also==\n*[[Natural element method]]\n*[[Natural neighbor interpolation]]\n*[[Nearest-neighbor interpolation]]\n*[[Voronoi pole]]\n*[[Power diagram]]\n*[[Map segmentation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Hoelscher20a\">{{citation\n   |first1=Tonio|last1=H\u00f6lscher\n   |first2=Susanne|last2=Kr\u00f6mker\n   |first3=Hubert|last3=Mara\n   |title=Gedenkschrift f\u00fcr Georgios Despinis\n   |chapter=Der [[Sabouroff head|Kopf Sabouroff]] in Berlin: Zwischen arch\u00e4ologischer Beobachtung und geometrischer Vermessung\n   |publisher=[[Benaki Museum]]\n   |location=Athens, Greece\n   |language=German\n   |date=2020\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hoelscher20b\">{{YouTube|VPqsY4tzwWA|Voronoi Cells & Geodesic Distances - Sabouroff head}}.\n   Analysis using the [[GigaMesh Software Framework]] as described by H\u00f6lscher et al.\n   cf.
