He was very fond of Chhotoma whose husband was Bibhuti, the very first scholar of the village before Girija. Bibhuti changed his religion to Christianity so Chhotoma refused to go with him to City after death of Bibhuti's elder brother, Kalidas, who was a religious person and a critic of Bibhuti's religious transformation. Besides, Girija left his village for higher studies and came back after a long time. All of his villagers believed him to be rich. After few days, everyone came to know about his poor financial condition. His only daughter Bimala was attracted to Block Development Officer Pravakar. As Girijaprasad was not rich, everybody tried to neglect him and helped his only brother Girin who stayed in the same village. Girin was a wealthy person and very clever kind of man. He deprived his elder brother and tried to make relation with Pravakar. But in the end, Girija's daughter Bimala was married to Pravakar instead of Girin's daughter Tia in the intervention of Girin's wife. On the other hand, Udas Kotal a soft-hearted, honest man wanted to learn driving for a better life. He married Laxmimoni to learn driving from his father-in-law. Laxmimoni's father taught him driving and made him an expert driver. Unfortunately, Laxmimoni had some psychological problem and as a result, she committed suicide. Udas became very upset and after few days, he wanted to get married his childhood friend Padma but Padma refused to get married. Day by day Udas became an alcoholic, characterless bohemian kind of person. One day after a quarrel, he hears baseless and incorrect news that Padma was having an affair with the doctor, he goes to murder the doctor with a knife. In the darkness, drunken Udas killed his old mate Padma. As a result, he was convicted and sentenced to death. Doctor left the village.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Uttam Kumar]] as Udas\n*[[Supriya Devi]] as Padma\n*[[Bikash Roy]] as Girija Prasada\n*[[Anil Chatterjee]] as Doctor\n*[[Madhabi Mukherjee]]\n*[[Jahor Roy]]\n*[[Kalipada Mukherjee]]\n*[[Basabi Nandi]]\n*Dhiman Chakraborty\n*[[Molina Devi]] as Atta maa\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe singers of the movie were [[Shyamal Mitra]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Dwijen Bandyopadhyay]], Adhir Bagchi\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0233364}}\n\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:Indian romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:1970s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Indian novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2019}}\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2017}}\n{{Italic title}}\n'''''Bon Palashir Padabali''''' is a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[Romance film|romance]] [[drama Film]] directed and produced by [[Uttam Kumar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vQtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=bon+palashir+padabali&source=bl&ots=FzuR7kIgpu&sig=bC9JmtxM7so4HX6KvBD6s4qttyU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOxqDP1ZrXAhXGN48KHTJ-AGE4FBDoAQgjMAM#v=onepage&q=bon%20palashir%20padabali&f=false|title=Travels of Bollywood Cinema: From Bombay to|last=Anjali Gera Roy, Chua Beng Huat|access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref> It is an adaptation of a 1960 novel by [[Ramapada Chowdhury]].
