For example, he enjoys a symphony concert not so much for the music, but for the atmosphere: \"the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor.\" Later on in the story, he steals money from where he works to support a short escapade in [[New York City]]. Once he exhausts his funds and his father catches wind of what has happened, he commits suicide by jumping in front of a train rather than allow his father to take him back to Pittsburgh.\n\nPaul's teachers and father refer to Paul as a \"case\", representing him at a distance and as an example of someone to be studied, handled, and managed; the term enables Cather to adopt \"the voice of medical authority.\" <ref name=WK>{{cite book|first= Wayne |last= Koestenbaum | title=The Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality and the Mystery of Desire |publisher =Gay Men's Press | date=1994 |pages= 28\u201329|title-link= The Queen's Throat }}</ref> \n\n==Plot summary==\nThe short story \u201c''Paul\u2019s Case,\u201d'' is about a young boy who struggles to fit in at home and in school. The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience soon learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is full of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

The \"whirling\" motions of said snowfall occur several times; as Paul gazes out of the train window on his way to New York, as well as consistently throughout the time he is actually in the city. It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors. Paul's smile in this circumstance displays his cocky attitude and shows that he doesn't care about what the authorities have to say to him.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://englishivbl2b.pbworks.com/w/page/19070348/%22Paul%27s%20Case%22%20--%20Cork%20Terborg,%20Payton%20Laczynski,%20Katie%20Erickson|title=English / \"Paul's Case\" -- Cork Terborg, Payton Laczynski, Katie Erickson|website=englishivbl2b.pbworks.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A different interpretation of Paul's smile arises from the detail where Paul's drawing master claimed there was, \"something sort of haunted about [his smile],\" which is a detail that is often used to support the idea that Paul's smile refers to him having a disability.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''The Basement:''' During the story, Paul sneaks into his home through his basement and reflects on his relationship with his father.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater. This place may have given him the approval he was looking for in his household<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://login.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3387549?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=benefits&searchText=of&searchText=extracurricular&searchText=activities&searchUri=/action/doBasicSearch?searchType=facetSearch&amp;sd=&amp;ed=&amp;Query=benefits+of+extracurricular+activities&amp;pagemark=cGFnZU1hcms9Mg%253D%253D&ab_segments=0/basic_SYC-5152/control&seq=1|title=Marvin K.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is full of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.
