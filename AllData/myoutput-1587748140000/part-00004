Many times in its past, Laurentia has been a separate [[continent]], as it is now in the form of North America, although originally it also included the cratonic areas of [[Greenland]] and also the northwestern part of [[Scotland]], known as the [[Hebridean Terrane]]. During other times in its past, Laurentia has been part of larger continents and [[supercontinents]] and itself consists of many smaller [[terranes]] assembled on a network of Early [[Proterozoic]] [[orogenic]] belts. Small [[microcontinents]] and oceanic islands collided with and sutured onto  the ever-growing Laurentia, and together formed the stable [[Precambrian]] craton seen today.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dalziel |first=I.W.D. |year=1992 |title=On the organization of American Plates in the Neoproterozoic and the breakout of Laurentia |work=GSA Today |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=237\u2013241}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hoffman |first=Paul F. |year=1988 |title=United Plates of America, The Birth of a Craton: Early Proterozoic Assembly and Growth of Laurentia |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=16 |pages=543\u2013603 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.16.050188.002551|bibcode=1988AREPS..16..543H }}</ref>\n\nThe craton is named after the [[Laurentian Shield]], through the [[Laurentian Mountains]], which received their name from the [[Saint Lawrence River]], named after [[Lawrence of Rome]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Graham |first=Joseph |year=2005 |chapter=The Laurentians |title=Naming the Laurentians: A History of Place Names 'up North' |page=15 }}</ref>\n\n==Interior platform==\nIn eastern and central Canada, much of the stable craton is exposed at the surface as the [[Canadian Shield]]; when subsurface extensions are considered, the wider term [[Laurentian Shield]] is more common, not least because large parts of the structure extend outside Canada.
