Often the [[protagonist]] of the play has a [[tragic flaw]], a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. [[Tragedy]] was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', and also [[John Webster]]'s play ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''.<ref name=\"anarchon\" />\n\n===Historical===\n{{Main|History (theatrical genre)}}\n[[File:An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.

They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. [[History]] as a separate genre was popularized by William Shakespeare. Examples of historical plays include [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Demetrius (play)|Demetrius]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]''.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3b2tlWBBUsC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=%22Shakespeare+popularised%22+historical+play | title=The Three Richards: Richard I ... - Google Book Search|publisher=books.google.co.uk|accessdate=2008-06-17|last=|first=| isbn=978-1-85285-521-5| year=2006}}</ref>\n\n===Musical theatre===\n{{Main|Musical theatre}}\nBallad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies.  The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called \u201cThe Disappointment\u201d, however, this play never made it to production.\n\nModern Western musical theatre emerged in the Victorian era, with many structural elements established by the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in Britain and those of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan]] and [[Tony Hart (theater)|Hart]] in America. Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly.  For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs.  When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.\n\nBy the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels.\n\nMusical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include ''Wicked'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof''.\n\n===Theatre of Cruelty===\nThis theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to \u201cby <ref><ref><ref></ref></ref></ref>conditioned thought.\u201d  In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did.\n\nAbove all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication.  Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content.  Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something.  His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective.  Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality.\n\nHis plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany.  Through these performances, he wanted to \u201cmake the causes of suffering audible\u201d, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw.  Much of his work was banned in France at the time.\n\nArtaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II.  For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body.  This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Finter|first1=Helga|last2=Griffin|first2=Matthew|title=Antonin Artaud and the Impossible Theatre: The Legacy of the Theatre of Cruelty|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|pages=15\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Theatre of the Absurd===\nTheatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions.  Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition.  Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them.  This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves.\n\nOne of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language.  Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions.\n\nFamous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Esslin|first1=Martin|title=Theatre of the Absurd|date=2001|isbn=1-4000-7523-8}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"play\" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term \"straight play\" is used in contrast to \"[[musical theatre|musical]]\", which refers to a play based on [[music]], [[dance]], and [[song]]s sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term \"playlet\" is sometimes used.\n\nThe term \"script\" refers to the written text of the play. After the [[front matter]], such as title and author, it conventionally begins with a ''[[dramatis personae]]'': a list presenting each of the main characters of the play by name, followed by a brief characterization (e.g., \"{{smallcaps|Stephano}}, a drunken Butler\".)\n\nFor a musical play ([[opera]], [[light opera]], or [[Musical theatre|musical]]) the term \"[[libretto]]\" is commonly used, instead of \"script\".\n\nA play is usually divided into [[act (drama)|act]]s, similar to what chapters are in a novel. A short play may consist of only a single act, and then is called a \"one-acter\". Acts are subdivided into [[scene (drama)|scene]]s. Acts are numbered, and so are scenes; the scene numbering starts again at 1 for each next act, so {{smallcaps|Act&nbsp;4, Scene&nbsp;3}} may be followed by  {{smallcaps|Act&nbsp;5, Scene&nbsp;1}}. Each scene is set at one specified location, indicated in the script at the start of the scene (e.g., \"{{smallcaps|Scene&nbsp;1}}. Before the cell of {{smallcaps|Prospero}}.\"). Changing locations usually requires changing the [[scenery]], which takes time \u2013 even if merely a painted backdrop \u2013 and can only be done between scenes.\n\nNext to the text to be spoken by the actors, a script contains \"stage directions\" (not to be confused with the use of that term in [[Stage directions|blocking]], the staging of actors with specified movements across the stage). The most common type is for the entering and exiting of actors, e.g. \"[''Exeunt'' {{smallcaps|Caliban, Stephano}}, and {{smallcaps|Trinculo}}.]\" (''[[wikt:exeunt|Exeunt]]'' is the Latin plural of ''exit'', meaning \"[they] leave\".) Other stage directions may indicate the manner of delivery of the text, like \"[Aside]\" or \"[Sings]\", or indicate sounds to be produced off-stage, like \"[Thunder]\".\n\n==See also==\n{{commons|Theatre}}\n* [[Canovaccio]]\n* [[Closet drama]]\n* [[Drama]]\n* [[Dramatis person\u00e6]]\n* [[Playwright]]\n* [[Theatre]]\n* [[History of theatre]]\n* [[Screenplay]]\n* [[Musical theatre]]\n\n===Lists===\n* [[List of basic theatre topics]]\n* [[List of American plays]]\n* [[List of Canadian plays]]\n* [[List of Romanian plays]]\n* [[List of films based on stage plays or musicals]]\n* [[List of plays made into feature films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Wikiversity-inline|Collaborative_play_writing}}\n\n{{Theatre}}\n{{Fiction writing}}\n{{Portal bar|Society|Theatre|Literature}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Play (Theatre)}}\n[[Category:Drama| ]]\n[[Category:Theatre| ]]\n[[Category:Performing arts]]\n[[Category:Plays]]\n[[Category:Fiction forms]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Macbeth (32280144787).jpg|thumb|300px|right|A performance of ''[[Macbeth]]'' (2018)]]\n{{literature}}\nA '''play''' is a work of [[drama]], usually consisting mostly of [[dialogue]] between [[Character (arts)|characters]] and intended for [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] rather than just [[Reading (process)|reading]].
