The Mad Housers are perhaps best known for a hands-on, pragmatic approach to providing shelter to [[homelessness|homeless]] people, in particular through the design, construction and provision of small (6'x8'x10') [https://web.archive.org/web/20071124102705/http://www.madhousers.org/shelter.shtml frame-and-plywood huts]. These shelters, though not meant as permanent housing, provide \"privacy, security, protection from the elements, and stability,\" all of which the organization believes are vital to helping people escape homelessness. Unlike the \"[[sweat equity]]\" required by which some housing programs such as [[Habitat for Humanity]] (where inhabitants are required to take part in the construction of their future dwelling), Mad Houser shelters are provided free of any charge or obligation to their inhabitants. The name \"Mad Housers\" came from the [[Mad Bomber]] in New York.

Their first projects were based on their vision of improving upon other types of marginal housing being erected for the homeless.

One day, a fight broke out between the residents and one person was knifed.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  The Department of Transportation, who owned the land, decided that it was an unacceptable risk to allow the huts to remain.  A debate ensued among the Mad Housers as to what to do about the situation.  Pope wanted to go to the media and publicize the injustice of kicking the people out.  However, they ended up following Finkel's suggestion to not make a big deal out of it and simply move the huts somewhere safe.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  In July 1988, they participated in a demonstration for the homeless at the [[Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"Morris\" />  Since then, they have continued to bring \"the plight of the homeless to public attention\".<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  Then, in 1990, an hour-long documentary aired on 90 TV stations around the nation dramatizing the Mad Houser's work.<ref name=\"Krasner\">Krasner, Mike. \"'The Mad Housers' grapples with issue of homelessness :[ALL Edition]. \" Telegram & Gazette  [Worcester, Mass.] 28  Mar. 1990, D5.

Pope said that the group became more focused on maintaining the current huts.  While they still built huts, they \"became more of a [[landlord]] than a development organization.\"  Frank Jeffers, a longtime member and president of the organization for many years helped develop items such as a [[cogeneration]] power generator out of a lawnmower and a wood stove to heat the huts.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />\nToday the Mad Housers are still very active in providing shelter for the homeless and have panel builds and hut raisings regularly.  They also do site recon trips to find new sites and \"[[winterization]]\" of the huts when they prepare the huts for the impending cold weather.
