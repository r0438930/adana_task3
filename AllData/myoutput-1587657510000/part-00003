{"title_page": "Rhinns of Kells", "text_new": "[[File:RhinnsofKells.jpg|450px|thumb|Corserine and Carlin's Cairn from the trig point on Meaul.]]\n\nThe '''Rhinns of Kells''' are a range of hills in the [[Galloway Hills]] range, part of the [[Southern Uplands]] of [[Scotland]]. The most easterly of  three parallel ridges, they are neighboured to the west by the [[Range of the Awful Hand]] and the [[Dungeon Hills]]. The eastern portion of the [[Minnigaff Hills]] range lies immediately southwest of the range. In total, these four ranges are part of the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. The ridge is located entirely within [[Dumfries and Galloway]], with the base of the western flanks being a western boundary of the county. \n\nAlthough distant, the ridge is paralleled to the east by the [[A713 road]]. This road provides access to the majority of the starting points for walking the ridge. Most commonly, these are Garryhorn Farm (the turnoff a few hundred metres north of [[Carsphairn]]) and Forrest Estate (accessed much further south a few kilometres north of [[St. John's Town of Dalry]]). Unclassified roads, one of which follows the [[Southern Upland Way]], and two others near [[Clatteringshaws Loch]] can be utilised, but are much less common due to the difficult terrain when ascending or descending from the south. <ref>Turnbull R. (2019) Walking the Galloway Hills: 35 Wild Mountain Walks Including the Merrick. Cicerone: Kendal.</ref> Due to the linear nature of the ridge, a full traverse will normally require two modes of transport at either end if to be walked in a day. Shorter, circular rounds from Forrest Lodge taking in the southern section of the ridge are, as a result, more popular. <ref>https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/galloway/corserine.shtml</ref> A bus service by Houston's Minicoaches runs from [[Dalmellington]] to [[Castle Douglas]] via Carsphairn and St. John's Town of Dalry multiple times a day. <ref>https://bustimes.org/services/520-dalmellington-castle-douglas</ref> \n\n===The Hills===\n------------------------------------\nThe hills of the range are the second highest of the Galloway Hills with the highest hill, Corserine, reaching 814m. The terrain is similar to that of the Range of the Awful Hand in that the walking is predominantly along flat grass with occasional boggy sections, however the drops to the west and east are high, steep and often craggy. The ridge south of Corserine, which is named the Rhinns of Kells on [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] maps - ignoring the northern portion, is notably rougher.\n\nFrom north to south (ignoring all satellite ridges other than [[Cairnsgarroch]]) the hills are: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
