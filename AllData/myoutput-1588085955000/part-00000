The Gutenberg Bible is an edition of a 4th century Latin translation of the Bible known as the [[Vulgate]] or common text.\n\n==Saint Jerome==\n[[Saint Jerome]] was a prominent religious figure - a [[Christians|Christian]] priest, confessor, theologian, historian and Doctor of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=10|title=St. Jerome|author=Catholic Online|work=catholic.org}}</ref> He was recognised as a Saint by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Churches]], and the [[Church of England]] and was responsible for a translation of the Bible into Latin: the Vulgate.\n\nMany medieval Vulgate manuscripts included Jerome's epistle number&nbsp;53, to Paulinus bishop of Nola, as a general prologue to the whole Bible. Notably, this letter was printed at the head of the Gutenberg Bible. Jerome's letter promotes the study of each of the books of the Old and New Testaments listed by name (and excluding any mention of the [[deuterocanonical books]]); and its dissemination had the effect of propagating the belief that the whole Vulgate text was Jerome's work despite the fact it is not.\n\n==Creation==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe book was created using a [[movable type|pioneering invention]] that allowed sheets of paper to be printed in large quantities resulting in the same quality as manuscripts. Only 135 copies of the Bible were printed on paper and 45 on [[vellum]]. The fact that such a small number of copies were produced, the innovative procedure used to create it and the quality of the result are features that make Gutenberg and Fust authority figures in the book-making process. Additionally, because it was written in Latin, only an elite audience of aristocrats, merchants and some educated priests could understand it.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001053.htm Read the letter in English]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190723230907/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LIII.html Read the letter with notes in English]\n*{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/3987590/gutenberg-bible-page/|title=See a Page From a Gutenberg Bible in Close-Up|last=Rothman|first=Lily|date=24 August 2015|website=Time|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-25}}\n\n[[Category:Early printed Bibles]]\n[[Category:Latin texts]]\n", "text_old": "{{orphan|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome.jpg|thumb|The epistle in the [[Harry Ransom Center|Ransom Center]] copy of the Gutenberg Bible; there are two columns of text on the page surrounded by a hand-painted border made up of green foliage, colourful flowers and various birds.
