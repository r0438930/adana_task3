Their first single was called \"[[One Step Closer (S Club Juniors song)|One Step Closer]]\". The single was promoted by the television series ''S Club Junior: The Story'' and was released in the UK on 22 April 2002 in a chart battle with the [[Sugababes]] who released their comeback single the same day.<ref name=\"t40\">[http://top40-charts.com/song.php?sid=3861 \"S Club Juniors \u2013 One Step Closer: Charts\"].

Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.\n\nIn late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>\n\n===2007\u20132014: The Saturdays===\n[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]\nSince 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

''[[Headlines!]]'' (2010) was released as the band's first [[Mini album]] and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the [[Irish Album Chart]]. ''Headlines!'' saw release of top ten singles \"[[Missing You (The Saturdays song)|Missing You]]\" and \"[[Higher (The Saturdays song)|Higher]]\" which features guest vocals from [[Flo Rida]], both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with \"Higher\" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart.

Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.\n\nIn late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>\n\n===2007\u20132014: The Saturdays===\n[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]\nSince 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

''[[Wordshaker]]'' (2009) was the band's follow-up studio album and also charted within the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and went on to gain a Silver selling status, with singles \"[[Forever Is Over]]\" and \"[[Ego (The Saturdays song)|Ego]]\" charting within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. ''[[Headlines!]]'' (2010) was released as the band's first [[Mini album]] and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the [[Irish Album Chart]]. ''Headlines!'' saw release of top ten singles \"[[Missing You (The Saturdays song)|Missing You]]\" and \"[[Higher (The Saturdays song)|Higher]]\" which features guest vocals from [[Flo Rida]], both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with \"Higher\" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart. The Saturdays third studio album, ''[[On Your Radar]]'' (2011) contained three highly successful selling singles and two of which\u2014\"[[Notorious (The Saturdays song)|Notorious]]\" and \"[[All Fired Up (The Saturdays song)|All Fired Up]]\" charted within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. \"[[My Heart Takes Over]]\" was also released from ''On Your Radar''.\n\nThe band released another extended play, ''[[Chasing The Saturdays (EP)|Chasing The Saturdays]]'' which was only released in North America.
