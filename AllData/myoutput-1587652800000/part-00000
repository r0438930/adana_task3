This view was widely rejected by medieval scholars, but has found some acceptance in modern times.<ref name=EoQ/>\n\n===== Cupbearers in paradise =====\n\nSome Quranic verses describing the paradise refer to \"immortal boys\" (56:17, 76:19) or \"young men\" (52:24) who serve [[Wine#Islam|wine]] to the [[Blessing#Islam|blessed]]. Although the ''[[tafsir]]'' literature does not interpret this as a homoerotic allusion, the connection was made in other literary genres, mostly humorously.<ref name=EoQ/> For example, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]-era poet [[Abu Nuwas]] wrote:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia|title=Islam|author=Elyse Semerdjian|page=132|editor=Jeffrey S.

Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and ''[[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|karagoz]]'', the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular. Dream interpretation literature declined, the puppet theater was purged of its coarser elements, and homoeroticism began to be regarded as abnormal and shameful.}}</ref> In [[Iran]], several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]] on accusations of homosexuality, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's ''Islamic Penal Code'', enacted in 1991.

Imam Muhsin Hendricks is also considered as the world's first openly queer Imam.  His activism grew since then and the organization became public in 1998.  It soon grew into an international organization with annual international retreats of up to 120 international delegates meeting annually in Cape Town to discuss issues pertaining to LGBTIQ Muslims.  In 2018 after having served the organization for 20 years her resigned after detecting corruption in the organization and being maliciously and wrongfully accused of mismanagement of funds.  He, along with other queer Muslims who left the old Al-Fitrah Foundation founded a new organization in 2018 called Al-Ghurbaah Foundation. Imam Muhsin Hendricks also administers the Compassion-centred Islamic Network (CCI Network) which is a global network that seeks to connect and create a stronger voice for queer Muslims amongst activists, academics, Islamic scholars and religious leaders (Imams).  Currently, the organization's main focus is working with religious leaders (Imams) while serving the needs of the queer Muslim community globally.  Al-Ghurbaah Foundation also runs an inclusive mosque called Masjidul Ghurbaah which is open to anyone who wants to connect spiritually regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or belief.\n\n\n* In November 2012, a prayer room was set up in Paris by gay Islamic scholar and founder of the group 'Homosexual Muslims of France' [[Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed]].

This view was widely rejected by medieval scholars, but has found some acceptance in modern times.<ref name=EoQ/>\n\n===== Cupbearers in paradise =====\n\nSome Quranic verses describing the paradise refer to \"immortal boys\" (56:17, 76:19) or \"young men\" (52:24) who serve [[Wine#Islam|wine]] to the [[Blessing#Islam|blessed]]. Although the ''[[tafsir]]'' literature does not interpret this as a homoerotic allusion, the connection was made in other literary genres, mostly humorously.<ref name=EoQ/> For example, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]-era poet [[Abu Nuwas]] wrote:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia|title=Islam|author=Elyse Semerdjian|page=132|editor=Jeffrey S.

Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and ''[[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|karagoz]]'', the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular. Dream interpretation literature declined, the puppet theater was purged of its coarser elements, and homoeroticism began to be regarded as abnormal and shameful.}}</ref> In [[Iran]], several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]] on accusations of homosexuality, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's ''Islamic Penal Code'', enacted in 1991.

Imam Muhsin Hendricks is also considered as the world's first openly queer Imam.  His activism grew since then and the organization became public in 1998.  It soon grew into an international organization with annual international retreats of up to 120 international delegates meeting annually in Cape Town to discuss issues pertaining to LGBTIQ Muslims.  In 2018 after having served the organization for 20 years her resigned after detecting corruption in the organization and being maliciously and wrongfully accused of mismanagement of funds.  He, along with other queer Muslims who left the old Al-Fitrah Foundation founded a new organization in 2018 called Al-Ghurbaah Foundation. Imam Muhsin Hendricks also administers the Compassion-centred Islamic Network (CCI Network) which is a global network that seeks to connect and create a stronger voice for queer Muslims amongst activists, academics, Islamic scholars and religious leaders (Imams).  Currently, the organization's main focus is working with religious leaders (Imams) while serving the needs of the queer Muslim community globally.  Al-Ghurbaah Foundation also runs an inclusive mosque called Masjidul Ghurbaah which is open to anyone who wants to connect spiritually regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or belief.\n\n\n* In November 2012, a prayer room was set up in Paris by gay Islamic scholar and founder of the group 'Homosexual Muslims of France' [[Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed]].
