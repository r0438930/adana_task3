Early Chinese immigrant worked as gold miners, and later on subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The decline of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China, instability and poverty caused many Chinese, especially from the province of [[Guangdong]], to emigrate overseas in search of a more stable life, and this coincided with the rapid growth of American industry. The Chinese were considered by employers as \"reliable\" workers who would continue working, without complaint, even under destitute conditions.<ref>{{cite book| last=Norton|first=Henry K.|title=The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present|publisher=A.C.

The 1879 Constitution of the [[State of California]] prohibited employment of Chinese people by state and local governments, and by businesses incorporated in California. Also, it delegated power to local governments of California to remove Chinese people from within their borders.<ref>Article XIX of the [https://archives.cdn.sos.ca.gov/collections/1879/archive/1879-constitution.pdf Constitution of the State of California of 1879]</ref><ref>[[James Whitman]], \"Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law\" (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), p. 35</ref> These laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China.<ref name=\"yeefow\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink= |title=An Evidentiary Timeline on the History of Sacramento's Chinatown: 1882 - American Sinophobia, The Chinese Exclusion Act and \"The Driving Out\"|publisher=Friends of the Yee Fow Museum, [[Sacramento, California]]|date=|url=http://www.yeefow.com/past/1882.html |doi=|accessdate=2008-03-24 }}</ref> The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was repealed by the [[Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943]].\n\nAnother key piece of legislation was the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]], which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization on the grounds that they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed [[alien land laws]] that prohibited non-citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an \"unassimilable\" race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), then-[[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] wrote of the Chinese as: \"a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country.

The [[Immigration Act of 1917]] then created an \"Asian Barred Zone\" under [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] influence.\n\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the most significant restrictions on free immigration in U.S. history. The Act excluded Chinese \"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining\" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation.

While the Emergency Quota Act used the [[census of the United States|census]] of 1910, xenophobic fears in the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] community lead to the adoption of the 1890 census, more favorable to [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] (WASP) population, for the uses of the Immigration Act of 1924, which responded to rising immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia.\n\nOne of the goal of this [[National Origins Formula]], established in 1929, was explicitly to keep the status quo distribution of [[ethnicity]], by allocating quotas in proportion to the actual population. The idea was that immigration would not be allowed to change the \"national character\". Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Asians were excluded but residents of nations in the Americas were not restricted, thus making official the racial discrimination in [[List of United States immigration legislation|immigration laws]]. This system was repealed with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].\n\n===Chinese labor and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882===\n{{main|Chinese Exclusion Act}}\nAccording to statistics, between 1820 and 1840, only 11 Chinese people emigrated to the United States. However, many Chinese were living in distress due to the end of the Qing Dynasty. The United States offered a more stable life, thanks to the gold rush in California, the construction of railways, and the resulting large demand for labor. Beginning in 1848, many Chinese chose to immigrate to the US.\n\nIn order to recruit more laborers, the United States and China signed the [[Burlingame Treaty]] in 1868.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/187656110X523717 |first=John |last=Schrecker |title=\"For the Equality of Men - For the Equality of Nations\": Anson Burlingame and China's First Embassy to the United States, 1868. |journal=Journal of American-East Asian Relations |date=March 2010 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201334 |issn=1058-3947}}&nbsp;[https://burlingame.wikispaces.com/file/view/Burlingame+JAEAR.pdf Alternate URL]</ref> The Burlingame Treaty provided several rights, including that Chinese people can freely enter and leave the United States; the right of abode in the United States; and the United States most-favored treatment of Chinese nationals in the United States. The Treaty stimulated immigration for the 20 years between 1853 and 1873, and resulted in the immigration of nearly 105,000 Chinese to the United States by 1880.<ref name=Chin-2013 />\n\n1882 was an election year in California. In order to secure more votes, California politicians adopted a staunch anti-China stance. In Congress, California Republican Senator [[John Franklin Miller (senator)|John Miller]] spoke at length in support of a bill to prohibit further Chinese immigrants, substantially the same as one from the prior session of Congress that had been vetoed by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. Senator Miller submitted a motion to ban the immigration Chinese laborers for 20 years, citing the passage of the 1879 anti-Chinese referendums in California and Nevada by huge margins as proof of popular support.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18820301.2.42 |title=Senator Miller's Great Anti-Chinese Speech |author= |date=March 1, 1882 |newspaper=Daily Alta California |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The motion was discussed in the Senate over the next eight days. All the Senators from western states and most of the southern Democratic Party supported Miller's proposal, strenuously objected to the eastern states senator. After intense debate, the motion eventually passed the Senate by a vote of 29 of 15; it would go on to pass in the House of Representatives on March 23, by 167 votes to 66 votes (55 abstentions).<ref name=Chin-2013 />\n\nPresident [[Chester A. Arthur]] vetoed the bill on April 4, 1882, as it violated the provisions of the [[Angell Treaty]], which restricted but did not ban immigration from China. Congress was unable to overturn the veto, and passed a version of the bill that banned immigration for ten years in lieu of the original twenty-year ban. On May 6, 1882, Miller's proposal was signed by President Arthur, and became the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]].<ref name=Chin-2013>{{cite journal |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/85234407/chinese-exclusion-act-1882 |author=Chin, Philip |title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 |journal=Chinese American Forum |date=January 2013 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=8\u201313}}&nbsp;Direct URLs: [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%201.pdf Part 1] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%202.pdf Part 2] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%203.pdf Part 3]</ref>\n\nAmendments introduced during the debate over the bill prohibited the naturalization of Chinese immigrants.<ref name=Chin-2013 /><ref name=LoC-CEA>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/chinese.html |title=Primary Documents in American History: Chinese Exclusion Act |date= |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> After the initial ten-year ban ended, Chinese Exclusion was extended in 1892 by the [[Geary Act]] and then made permanent in 1902.<ref name=LoC-CEA /> California Governor [[John McDougal]] in 1851 praised the Chinese as \"the most valuable immigrants\" to California.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.csiel.org/Upload/ueditor/files/2016-10-24/C%20.626%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%84%E9%BB%84%E7%A5%B8%E8%AE%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%AC%E6%BA%90_%E6%9C%AC%E8%B4%A8%EF%BC%88%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89-bd4a2d13-b095-42d2-913c-28dd17eb58da.pdf |title=On the Source, Essence of \"Yellow Peril\" Doctrine and Its Latest Hegemony \"Variant\" \u2013 the \"China Threat\" Doctrine: From the Perspective of Historical Mainstream of Sino-Foreign Economic Interactions and Their Inherent Jurisprudential Principles |author=Chen, An |journal=The Journal of World Investment & Trade |volume=13 |date=2012 |pages=1\u201358|doi=10.1163/221190012X621526 }}</ref><!--The origin of this quotation is unclear and it is commented out until it can be confirmed: recently accepted most valuable immigrants, but 30 years later, \"the most valuable immigrants barred from the United States\".<ref>Foreign Affairs,Immigration in a Changing Economy: California's Experience./ Forbidden Workers: Illegal Chinese Immigrants and American Labor.

Also, it delegated power to local governments of California to remove Chinese people from within their borders.<ref>Article XIX of the [https://archives.cdn.sos.ca.gov/collections/1879/archive/1879-constitution.pdf Constitution of the State of California of 1879]</ref><ref>[[James Whitman]], \"Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law\" (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), p. 35</ref> These laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China.<ref name=\"yeefow\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink= |title=An Evidentiary Timeline on the History of Sacramento's Chinatown: 1882 - American Sinophobia, The Chinese Exclusion Act and \"The Driving Out\"|publisher=Friends of the Yee Fow Museum, [[Sacramento, California]]|date=|url=http://www.yeefow.com/past/1882.html |doi=|accessdate=2008-03-24 }}</ref> The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was repealed by the [[Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943]].\n\nAnother key piece of legislation was the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]], which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization on the grounds that they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed [[alien land laws]] that prohibited non-citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an \"unassimilable\" race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), then-[[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] wrote of the Chinese as: \"a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Chin|first=Gabriel J.|title=Harlan, Chinese and Chinese Americans|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/immigr10.htm|publisher=University of Dayton Law School}}</ref>\n\nIn the USA xenophobic fears against the alleged \"Yellow Peril\" led to the implementation of the [[Page Act of 1875]], the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]], expanded ten years later by the [[Geary Act]]. The [[Immigration Act of 1917]] then created an \"Asian Barred Zone\" under [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] influence.\n\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the most significant restrictions on free immigration in U.S. history. The Act excluded Chinese \"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining\" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. Many Chinese were relentlessly beaten just because of their race.<ref name=\"mem\">{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/immig/chinese6.html|title=Exclusion|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=September 1, 2003|accessdate=2010-01-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090810043800/http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/immig/chinese6.html| archivedate=August 10, 2009| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"usn\">[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm usnews.com: The People's Vote: Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328223654/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm |date=March 28, 2007 }}</ref> The few Chinese non-laborers who wished to immigrate had to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to immigrate, which tended to be difficult to prove.<ref name=\"usn\"/>\n\nThe 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]], and then the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], restricted immigration according to national origins. While the Emergency Quota Act used the [[census of the United States|census]] of 1910, xenophobic fears in the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] community lead to the adoption of the 1890 census, more favorable to [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] (WASP) population, for the uses of the Immigration Act of 1924, which responded to rising immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia.\n\nOne of the goal of this [[National Origins Formula]], established in 1929, was explicitly to keep the status quo distribution of [[ethnicity]], by allocating quotas in proportion to the actual population. The idea was that immigration would not be allowed to change the \"national character\". Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Asians were excluded but residents of nations in the Americas were not restricted, thus making official the racial discrimination in [[List of United States immigration legislation|immigration laws]]. This system was repealed with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].\n\n===Chinese labor and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882===\n{{main|Chinese Exclusion Act}}\nAccording to statistics, between 1820 and 1840, only 11 Chinese people emigrated to the United States. However, many Chinese were living in distress due to the end of the Qing Dynasty. The United States offered a more stable life, thanks to the gold rush in California, the construction of railways, and the resulting large demand for labor. Beginning in 1848, many Chinese chose to immigrate to the US.\n\nIn order to recruit more laborers, the United States and China signed the [[Burlingame Treaty]] in 1868.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/187656110X523717 |first=John |last=Schrecker |title=\"For the Equality of Men - For the Equality of Nations\": Anson Burlingame and China's First Embassy to the United States, 1868. |journal=Journal of American-East Asian Relations |date=March 2010 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201334 |issn=1058-3947}}&nbsp;[https://burlingame.wikispaces.com/file/view/Burlingame+JAEAR.pdf Alternate URL]</ref> The Burlingame Treaty provided several rights, including that Chinese people can freely enter and leave the United States; the right of abode in the United States; and the United States most-favored treatment of Chinese nationals in the United States. The Treaty stimulated immigration for the 20 years between 1853 and 1873, and resulted in the immigration of nearly 105,000 Chinese to the United States by 1880.<ref name=Chin-2013 />\n\n1882 was an election year in California. In order to secure more votes, California politicians adopted a staunch anti-China stance. In Congress, California Republican Senator [[John Franklin Miller (senator)|John Miller]] spoke at length in support of a bill to prohibit further Chinese immigrants, substantially the same as one from the prior session of Congress that had been vetoed by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. Senator Miller submitted a motion to ban the immigration Chinese laborers for 20 years, citing the passage of the 1879 anti-Chinese referendums in California and Nevada by huge margins as proof of popular support.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18820301.2.42 |title=Senator Miller's Great Anti-Chinese Speech |author= |date=March 1, 1882 |newspaper=Daily Alta California |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The motion was discussed in the Senate over the next eight days. All the Senators from western states and most of the southern Democratic Party supported Miller's proposal, strenuously objected to the eastern states senator. After intense debate, the motion eventually passed the Senate by a vote of 29 of 15; it would go on to pass in the House of Representatives on March 23, by 167 votes to 66 votes (55 abstentions).<ref name=Chin-2013 />\n\nPresident [[Chester A. Arthur]] vetoed the bill on April 4, 1882, as it violated the provisions of the [[Angell Treaty]], which restricted but did not ban immigration from China. Congress was unable to overturn the veto, and passed a version of the bill that banned immigration for ten years in lieu of the original twenty-year ban. On May 6, 1882, Miller's proposal was signed by President Arthur, and became the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]].<ref name=Chin-2013>{{cite journal |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/85234407/chinese-exclusion-act-1882 |author=Chin, Philip |title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 |journal=Chinese American Forum |date=January 2013 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=8\u201313}}&nbsp;Direct URLs: [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%201.pdf Part 1] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%202.pdf Part 2] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%203.pdf Part 3]</ref>\n\nAmendments introduced during the debate over the bill prohibited the naturalization of Chinese immigrants.<ref name=Chin-2013 /><ref name=LoC-CEA>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/chinese.html |title=Primary Documents in American History: Chinese Exclusion Act |date= |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> After the initial ten-year ban ended, Chinese Exclusion was extended in 1892 by the [[Geary Act]] and then made permanent in 1902.<ref name=LoC-CEA /> California Governor [[John McDougal]] in 1851 praised the Chinese as \"the most valuable immigrants\" to California.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.csiel.org/Upload/ueditor/files/2016-10-24/C%20.626%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%84%E9%BB%84%E7%A5%B8%E8%AE%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%AC%E6%BA%90_%E6%9C%AC%E8%B4%A8%EF%BC%88%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89-bd4a2d13-b095-42d2-913c-28dd17eb58da.pdf |title=On the Source, Essence of \"Yellow Peril\" Doctrine and Its Latest Hegemony \"Variant\" \u2013 the \"China Threat\" Doctrine: From the Perspective of Historical Mainstream of Sino-Foreign Economic Interactions and Their Inherent Jurisprudential Principles |author=Chen, An |journal=The Journal of World Investment & Trade |volume=13 |date=2012 |pages=1\u201358|doi=10.1163/221190012X621526 }}</ref><!--The origin of this quotation is unclear and it is commented out until it can be confirmed: recently accepted most valuable immigrants, but 30 years later, \"the most valuable immigrants barred from the United States\".<ref>Foreign Affairs,Immigration in a Changing Economy: California's Experience./ Forbidden Workers: Illegal Chinese Immigrants and American Labor.
