J. North]] in 1910 as ''Lacustroica whitei''.<ref name=\"Lindsey\" /> The population continued to be assigned to a [[monotypic]] genus ''Lacustroica'',<ref name=Higgins/> or as most closely related to two other species, the rufous-banded (''[[Conopophila rufogularis]]'') and rufous-throated (''[[Conopophila albogularis|C. albogularis]]'') honeyeaters.<ref name=\"Pizzey\" />\n\nThe species was found by [[F. Lawson Whitlock]] in 1903 at [[Lake Austin (Australia)|Lake Austin]] in Western Australia, but no formal description was made.<ref name=\"Serventy\" /> The two specimens he shot and prepared were sent to the Western Australian Museum, about which he received no reply. At the beginning of his later expedition, in 1909, Whitlock killed and skinned a male of the species, recognised as the same he collected in 1903, and located the preparation of a nest by a breeding pair close to the town-site of [[Wiluna, Western Australia|Wiluna]]. Whitlock also noted the location of other nesting sites on his journeys around Wiluna, all of which he found had been removed when he returned to them. He continued to observe the progress of the nest near the main street, that had remained undisrupted, eventually removing the branch that held it for his collection.<ref name=\"Emu1909:4\" />  These specimens were supplied to North for the first accepted description, published the following year.<ref name=\"Serventy\" /><ref name=\"Emu1909:4\" />\n\nThe specific epithet ''whitei'' honours Alfred Henry Edsworth White, the son of ornithologist [[Henry L. White]]. The generic name ''Conopophila'' is derived from the Ancient Greek ''konops'' 'gnat' and ''philos'' '-loving'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling| title=Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird-names|last=Jobling |first=James A. |year=2010 |accessdate = 2020-04-28}}</ref> The image accompanying North's description in ''[[Emu (journal)|Emu]]'' (1910) was captioned with the name 'Alfred Honey-eater'.<ref>''Emu'' vol. 9. plate 15.
