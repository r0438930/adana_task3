The flight was also marketed as [[China Southern Airlines]] Flight 748 (CZ748/CSN748) through a [[codeshare agreement]].<ref name=\"USAToday_2014-03-08\"/>}} was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by [[Malaysia Airlines]] that disappeared on 8&nbsp;March 2014 while flying from [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] to its destination, [[Beijing Capital International Airport]].<ref name=\"USAToday_2014-03-08\" /> The crew of the [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] aircraft last communicated with [[air traffic control]] (ATC) around 38&nbsp;minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the [[South China Sea]]. The aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens minutes later but was tracked by military radar for another hour, deviating westwards from its planned flight path, crossing the [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Andaman Sea]]. It left radar range when 200&nbsp;nautical miles (370&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Penang Island]] in northwestern Peninsular Malaysia. With all 227&nbsp;passengers and 12&nbsp;crew aboard [[Declared death in absentia|presumed dead]], the disappearance of Flight&nbsp;370 was the [[Boeing 777#Accidents and incidents|deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777]] and the deadliest in Malaysia Airlines' history until it was surpassed in both regards by [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Malaysia Airlines Flight&nbsp;17]], which was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine four months later. The combined loss caused significant financial problems for Malaysia Airlines, which was [[nationalization|renationalised]] by the Malaysian government in December 2014.\n\nThe [[Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370|search for the missing airplane]], which became the most costly in aviation history, focused initially on the South China and Andaman seas, before analysis of [[Analysis of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 satellite communications|the aircraft's automated communications]] with an [[Inmarsat]] satellite identified a possible crash site somewhere in the southern [[Indian Ocean]]. The lack of official information in the days immediately after the disappearance prompted fierce criticism from the Chinese public, particularly from relatives of the passengers; most people on board Flight&nbsp;370 were of Chinese origin. Several pieces of marine debris confirmed to be from the aircraft washed ashore in the western Indian Ocean during 2015 and 2016. After a three-year search across {{convert|120,000|km2}} of ocean failed to locate the aircraft, the [[Joint Agency Coordination Centre]] heading the operation suspended their activities in January 2017. A second search launched in January 2018 by the private contractor [[Ocean Infinity]] also ended without success after six months.\n\nThe disappearance of Flight 370 has been dubbed one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time. Relying mostly on analysis of data from the Inmarsat satellite with which the aircraft last communicated, the [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] (ATSB) proposed initially that a [[Uncontrolled decompression#Gradual decompression|hypoxia event]] was the most likely cause given the available evidence, although there has not been any consensus concerning this theory among investigators. At various stages of the investigation, possible [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] scenarios were considered, including crew involvement, and suspicion of the airplane's cargo manifest; many [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 unofficial disappearance theories|unofficial theories]] have also been proposed by the media. The Malaysian [[Ministry of Transport (Malaysia)|Ministry of Transport]]'s final report from July 2018 was inconclusive but highlighted Malaysian air traffic controllers' failures to attempt to communicate with the aircraft shortly after its disappearance. In the absence of a definitive cause of disappearance, air transport industry safety recommendations and regulations citing Flight&nbsp;370 have been intended mostly to prevent a repetition of the circumstances associated with the loss. These include increased battery life on [[underwater locator beacon]]s, lengthening of recording times on [[flight recorder|flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders]], and new standards for aircraft position reporting over the open ocean.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{More footnotes|section|date=February 2019}}\n{{main|Timeline of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370}}\nThe aircraft, a [[Boeing 777#777-200ER|Boeing 777-200ER]] operated by [[Malaysia Airlines]], last made voice contact with [[air traffic control]] at 01:19&nbsp;[[Time in Malaysia|MYT]], 8&nbsp;March (17:19&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], 7&nbsp;March) when it was over the [[South China Sea]], less than an hour after takeoff.

Malaysia released a final report concerning Flight&nbsp;370 in October 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicion over possible motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's [[satellite data unit]] (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25, which was three minutes after the aircraft had left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of [[Sumatra]] and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its [[Fuel starvation|fuel was exhausted]].\n\nWith the loss of all 239 aboard, Flight&nbsp;370 is the [[accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 777 family|second-deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777]] and the second-deadliest incident of Malaysia Airlines' history, second to [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Flight 17]] in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decrease of ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight&nbsp;370 and the downing of Flight&nbsp;17; the airline was re-nationalised by the end of 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search.<!-- supported by the \"Aftermath\" section (\"Information sharing\", \"China\" subsections), per WP:Lead only controversial statements in the lead need inline citations --> Flight&nbsp;370's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including the limited battery life of Underwater Locator Beacons (an issue that had been raised about four years earlier<!-- AF447 was lost almost five years earlier, but the recommendations were made during late 2009, not quite 4.5 years earlier, so four years is more appropriate --> following the loss of [[Air France Flight 447]], but had never been resolved).

communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3&nbsp;F1 satellite, provide the only significant clues to the location of Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section). The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.<ref name=ATSB />{{Rp|16\u201317}}<ref name=\"Telegraph-delays\"/>\n\n==== Technical background ====\n[[File:Inmarsat-3 crop.jpg|thumb|A depiction of an [[Inmarsat#Satellites|Inmarsat-3 series]] satellite.

The first is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT\u2014seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.<ref name=JN-Inmarsat />{{rp|4}}\n\nSince the aircraft did not respond to a ping at 09:15, it can be concluded that at some point between 08:19 and 09:15, the aircraft lost the ability to communicate with the ground station.<ref name=\"Inmarsat(26 March)\"/><ref name=Fox-Inmarsat /><ref name=\"myDCA_20140325\" /> The log-on message sent from the aircraft at 08:19:29 was \"log-on request\"; there are only a few reasons the SDU would transmit this request, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to the aircraft's [[:wiktionary:aircraft attitude|attitude]]<!-- ATTitude NOT ALTitude.

This measure is proportional to twice the distance from the ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure was analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft at the time each of the seven handshakes occurred, and thereby defining seven circles on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance. Those circles were then reduced to arcs by eliminating those parts of each circle that lay outside the aircraft's range.<ref name=ATSB />{{Rp|18}}<ref name=JN-Inmarsat />{{rp|4\u20136}}\n* Burst frequency offset (BFO) \u2013 the difference between the expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by [[Doppler effect|Doppler shifts]] as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure was analysed to determine the aircraft's speed and heading, but multiple combinations of speed and heading can be valid solutions.<ref name=ATSB />{{Rp|18}}<ref name=JN-Inmarsat />{{rp|9\u201311}}\nBy combining the distance between the aircraft and satellite, speed, and heading with aircraft performance constraints (e.g. fuel consumption, possible speeds and altitudes), investigators generated candidate paths that were analysed separately by two methods. The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes (two are further affected by whether the navigation system used magnetic north or true north as a reference), calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes, and compared them with the values recorded from Flight 370. The second method generated paths which had the aircraft's speed and heading adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path and the values recorded from Flight 370.<ref name=ATSB />{{Rp|18, 25\u201328}}<ref name=\"ATSB Flight path update\"/>{{Rp|10\u201311}} A [[probability distribution]] for each method at the BTO arc of the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared; 80% of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO arc of the sixth handshake between 32.5\u00b0S and 38.1\u00b0S, which can be extrapolated to 33.5\u00b0S and 38.3\u00b0S along the BTO arc of the seventh handshake.<ref name=\"ATSB Flight path update\" />{{Rp|12}}\n\n=== Possible in-flight events ===\n\n==== Power interruption ====\n\nThe SATCOM link functioned normally from pre-flight (beginning at 00:00 MYT<!-- exactly -->) until it responded to a ground-to-air ACARS message with an acknowledge message at 01:07. Ground-to-air ACARS messages continued to be transmitted to Flight 370 until Inmarsat's network sent multiple \"Request for Acknowledge\" messages at 02:03, without a response from the aircraft. At some time between 01:07 and 02:03, power was lost to the SDU.

Najib Razak had said that the ACARS system was switched off at 01:07. On 17 March, Malaysian officials said that the system was switched off sometime between 01:07, time of the last ACARS transmission, and 01:37, time of the next expected transmission.<ref name=\"AutoVQ-51\"/><ref name=\"20140319aviationtoday\"/> <br />* Three days after saying that the aircraft was not transporting anything hazardous, Malaysia Airlines' chief executive Ahmad said that potentially dangerous [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium batteries]] were on board.<ref name=20140322minsider/> <br />* MAS chief executive initially claimed that the last voice communication from the aircraft was, \"all right, good night\", with the lack of a call sign fuelling speculation that the flight may have been hijacked.<ref name=\"20140317themalaysiantimes\"/><ref name=\"20140317theguardian\"/> Three weeks later Malaysian authorities published the transcript that indicated the last words were \"Good night Malaysian three seven zero\".<ref name=\"Guardian Transcript\" /><ref name=\"20140401newsaus\"/><ref name=\"AutoVQ-52\"/><ref name=\"BBC_2014-03-31_b\"/>}} The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise, incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders.<ref name=\"20140311nytimes\"/> Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft.<ref name=\"AutoVQ-53\"/>\n\nMalaysia's acting Transport Minister [[Hishammuddin Hussein]], who was also the country's Defence Minister (until May 2018), denied the existence of problems between the participating countries, but academics explained that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts suggested that entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult.<ref name=20140314afp/><ref name=\"20140314guardian\"/> A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort.

On 11&nbsp;March 2014, three days after the aircraft disappeared, British satellite company [[Inmarsat]] (or its partner, [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]]) had provided officials with data suggesting that the aircraft was nowhere near the areas in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea being searched at the time, and that it may have diverted its course through a southern or northern corridor. This information was not acknowledged publicly until it was released by the Malaysian Prime Minister in a press conference on 15&nbsp;March.<ref name=Telegraph-delays /><ref name=\"20140319online\"/> Explaining why information about satellite signals had not been made available earlier, Malaysia Airlines stated that the raw satellite signals needed to be verified and analysed \"so that their significance could be properly understood\" before it could publicly confirm their existence.<ref name=\"MAS press statements 8\u201317 March\"/> Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin claimed that Malaysian and US investigators had immediately discussed the Inmarsat data upon receiving them on 12&nbsp;March, and that they had agreed to send the data to the US for further processing on two separate occasions.

The flight was also marketed as [[China Southern Airlines]] Flight 748 (CZ748/CSN748) through a [[codeshare agreement]].<ref name=\"USAToday_2014-03-08\"/>}} was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by [[Malaysia Airlines]] that disappeared on 8&nbsp;March 2014 while flying from [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] to its destination, [[Beijing Capital International Airport]].<ref name=\"USAToday_2014-03-08\" /> The crew of the [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] aircraft last communicated with [[air traffic control]] (ATC) around 38&nbsp;minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the [[South China Sea]]. The aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens minutes later but was tracked by military radar for another hour, deviating westwards from its planned flight path, crossing the [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Andaman Sea]]. It left radar range when 200&nbsp;nautical miles (370&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Penang Island]] in northwestern Peninsular Malaysia. With all 227&nbsp;passengers and 12&nbsp;crew aboard [[Declared death in absentia|presumed dead]], the disappearance of Flight&nbsp;370 was the [[Boeing 777#Accidents and incidents|deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777]] and the deadliest in Malaysia Airlines' history until it was surpassed in both regards by [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Malaysia Airlines Flight&nbsp;17]], which was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine four months later. The combined loss caused significant financial problems for Malaysia Airlines, which was [[nationalization|renationalised]] by the Malaysian government in December 2014.\n\nThe [[Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370|search for the missing airplane]], which became the most costly in aviation history, focused initially on the South China and Andaman seas, before analysis of [[Analysis of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 satellite communications|the aircraft's automated communications]] with an [[Inmarsat]] satellite identified a possible crash site somewhere in the southern [[Indian Ocean]]. The lack of official information in the days immediately after the disappearance prompted fierce criticism from the Chinese public, particularly from relatives of the passengers; most people on board Flight&nbsp;370 were of Chinese origin. Several pieces of marine debris confirmed to be from the aircraft washed ashore in the western Indian Ocean during 2015 and 2016. After a three-year search across {{convert|120,000|km2}} of ocean failed to locate the aircraft, the [[Joint Agency Coordination Centre]] heading the operation suspended their activities in January 2017. A second search launched in January 2018 by the private contractor [[Ocean Infinity]] also ended without success after six months.\n\nThe disappearance of Flight 370 has been dubbed one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time. Relying mostly on analysis of data from the Inmarsat satellite with which the aircraft last communicated, the [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] (ATSB) proposed initially that a [[Uncontrolled decompression#Gradual decompression|hypoxia event]] was the most likely cause given the available evidence, although there has not been any consensus concerning this theory among investigators. At various stages of the investigation, possible [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] scenarios were considered, including crew involvement, and suspicion of the airplane's cargo manifest; many [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 unofficial disappearance theories|unofficial theories]] have also been proposed by the media. The Malaysian [[Ministry of Transport (Malaysia)|Ministry of Transport]]'s final report from July 2018 was inconclusive but highlighted Malaysian air traffic controllers' failures to attempt to communicate with the aircraft shortly after its disappearance. In the absence of a definitive cause of disappearance, air transport industry safety recommendations and regulations citing Flight&nbsp;370 have been intended mostly to prevent a repetition of the circumstances associated with the loss. These include increased battery life on [[underwater locator beacon]]s, lengthening of recording times on [[flight recorder|flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders]], and new standards for aircraft position reporting over the open ocean.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{More footnotes|section|date=February 2019}}\n{{main|Timeline of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370}}\nThe aircraft, a [[Boeing 777#777-200ER|Boeing 777-200ER]] operated by [[Malaysia Airlines]], last made voice contact with [[air traffic control]] at 01:19&nbsp;[[Time in Malaysia|MYT]], 8&nbsp;March (17:19&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], 7&nbsp;March) when it was over the [[South China Sea]], less than an hour after takeoff.

Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicion over possible motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's [[satellite data unit]] (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25, which was three minutes after the aircraft had left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of [[Sumatra]] and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its [[Fuel starvation|fuel was exhausted]].\n\nWith the loss of all 239 aboard, Flight&nbsp;370 is the [[accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 777 family|second-deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777]] and the second-deadliest incident of Malaysia Airlines' history, second to [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Flight 17]] in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decrease of ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight&nbsp;370 and the downing of Flight&nbsp;17; the airline was re-nationalised by the end of 2014.

communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3&nbsp;F1 satellite, provide the only significant clues to the location of Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section). The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.<ref name=ATSB />{{Rp|16\u201317}}<ref name=\"Telegraph-delays\"/>\n\n==== Technical background ====\n[[File:Inmarsat-3 crop.jpg|thumb|A depiction of an [[Inmarsat#Satellites|Inmarsat-3 series]] satellite.

The first is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT\u2014seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.<ref name=JN-Inmarsat />{{rp|4}}\n\nSince the aircraft did not respond to a ping at 09:15, it can be concluded that at some point between 08:19 and 09:15, the aircraft lost the ability to communicate with the ground station.<ref name=\"Inmarsat(26 March)\"/><ref name=Fox-Inmarsat /><ref name=\"myDCA_20140325\" /> The log-on message sent from the aircraft at 08:19:29 was \"log-on request\"; there are only a few reasons the SDU would transmit this request, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to the aircraft's [[:wiktionary:aircraft attitude|attitude]]<!-- ATTitude NOT ALTitude.

This measure is proportional to twice the distance from the ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure was analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft at the time each of the seven handshakes occurred, and thereby defining seven circles on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance. Those circles were then reduced to arcs by eliminating those parts of each circle that lay outside the aircraft's range.<ref name=ATSB />{{Rp|18}}<ref name=JN-Inmarsat />{{rp|4\u20136}}\n* Burst frequency offset (BFO) \u2013 the difference between the expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by [[Doppler effect|Doppler shifts]] as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure was analysed to determine the aircraft's speed and heading, but multiple combinations of speed and heading can be valid solutions.<ref name=ATSB />{{Rp|18}}<ref name=JN-Inmarsat />{{rp|9\u201311}}\nBy combining the distance between the aircraft and satellite, speed, and heading with aircraft performance constraints (e.g. fuel consumption, possible speeds and altitudes), investigators generated candidate paths that were analysed separately by two methods. The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes (two are further affected by whether the navigation system used magnetic north or true north as a reference), calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes, and compared them with the values recorded from Flight 370. The second method generated paths which had the aircraft's speed and heading adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path and the values recorded from Flight 370.<ref name=ATSB />{{Rp|18, 25\u201328}}<ref name=\"ATSB Flight path update\"/>{{Rp|10\u201311}} A [[probability distribution]] for each method at the BTO arc of the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared; 80% of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO arc of the sixth handshake between 32.5\u00b0S and 38.1\u00b0S, which can be extrapolated to 33.5\u00b0S and 38.3\u00b0S along the BTO arc of the seventh handshake.<ref name=\"ATSB Flight path update\" />{{Rp|12}}\n\n=== Possible in-flight events ===\n\n==== Power interruption ====\n\nThe SATCOM link functioned normally from pre-flight (beginning at 00:00 MYT<!-- exactly -->) until it responded to a ground-to-air ACARS message with an acknowledge message at 01:07. Ground-to-air ACARS messages continued to be transmitted to Flight 370 until Inmarsat's network sent multiple \"Request for Acknowledge\" messages at 02:03, without a response from the aircraft. At some time between 01:07 and 02:03, power was lost to the SDU. At 02:25, the aircraft's SDU sent a \"log-on request\".<ref name=ATSB />{{rp|22}}<ref name=\"Ground log\" />{{Rp|36\u201339}} It is not common for a log-on request to be made in-flight, but it could occur for multiple reasons.

On 11&nbsp;March 2014, three days after the aircraft disappeared, British satellite company [[Inmarsat]] (or its partner, [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]]) had provided officials with data suggesting that the aircraft was nowhere near the areas in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea being searched at the time, and that it may have diverted its course through a southern or northern corridor. This information was not acknowledged publicly until it was released by the Malaysian Prime Minister in a press conference on 15&nbsp;March.<ref name=Telegraph-delays /><ref name=\"20140319online\"/> Explaining why information about satellite signals had not been made available earlier, Malaysia Airlines stated that the raw satellite signals needed to be verified and analysed \"so that their significance could be properly understood\" before it could publicly confirm their existence.<ref name=\"MAS press statements 8\u201317 March\"/> Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin claimed that Malaysian and US investigators had immediately discussed the Inmarsat data upon receiving them on 12&nbsp;March, and that they had agreed to send the data to the US for further processing on two separate occasions.

The programme concludes by noting that ''Ocean Shield'' had spent two months searching {{convert|850|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of ocean, but that it had searched far to the north of the Inmarsat \"hotspot\" on the final arc, at approximately 28&nbsp;degrees south, where the aircraft was most likely to have crashed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where is Flight MH370?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b047czkj|website=BBC Two|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> On 8&nbsp;October 2014, a modified version of the ''Horizon'' programme was broadcast in the US by [[PBS]] as an episode of ''[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA]]'', titled \"Why Planes Vanish\", with a different narrator.<!-- NOTE: While no source could be found explicitly stating it was a modified version of the Horizon program, the credits of NOVA episode (ref) include \"For BBC Where is Flight MH370?\" after which point the credits are almost identical to the ''Horizon episode (not available online except uploaded in violation of copyright, which cannot be a reference per WP's MOS).
