He is of mixed Russian Jewish and Asian heritage. As a teenager, he was a member of the Anti-Fascist Action organization. Spyer immigrated to Israel from Britain in 1991. He earned a PhD in International Relations from the [[London School of Economics]] and a master's degree in Middle East Politics from the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS) in London. From 1992 to 1993, he served in a combat unit of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] - the Barak Armored Brigade - and fought in the [[2006 Lebanon War]] as a reservist. During that war, Spyer narrowly escaped death when his tank was hit by two Kornet missiles, while deployed in a valley beneath the town of Al-Khiam. <ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Jonathan Spyer |url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/author/jonathan-spyer/ |agency=Bloomsbury Publishing }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=28 June 2014 |title=\u05d3\"\u05e8 \u05d2'\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05de\u05e0\u05ea\u05d7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d3\u05d0\u05e2\"\u05e9 - \u05d0\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05db\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd |url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000948956 |work=Globes }}</ref><ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nSpyer resides in [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Jonathan Spyer in Northern Syria.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Spyer posing with [[People's Protection Units|YPG]] fighters in [[Ras al-Ayn]], northeastern [[Syria]].]]\nSpyer is a freelance security analyst and correspondent for IHS Jane's, a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies and the Middle East Forum,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jiss.org.il/en/author/jospyer/|title=Dr. Jonathan Spyer|website=JISS|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Writing Fellows |url=http://www.meforum.org/fellows.php |agency=Middle East Forum }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Writings by Jonathan Spyer |url=http://www.meforum.org/author/Jonathan+Spyer |agency=Middle East Forum }}</ref> and a columnist for ''The Jerusalem Post''.<ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Jonathan Spyer |url=http://www.jpost.com/Author/Jonathan-Spyer |work=The Jerusalem Post }}</ref>\n\nIn the 2010s, Spyer has traveled to Syria and Iraq numerous times, generally for around two-week periods.
