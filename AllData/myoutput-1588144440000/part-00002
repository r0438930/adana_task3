His double A-sided debut single \"[[Anything Is Possible (Will Young song)|Anything Is Possible]]\" / \"[[Evergreen (Westlife song)#Will Young version|Evergreen]]\" was released two weeks after the show's finale and became the fastest-selling debut single in the UK.

Young put his studies on hold in late 2001 to become a contestant on ''Pop Idol''. After winning the competition the following year, he released his debut album ''[[From Now On (Will Young album)|From Now On]]'' (2002) which went straight to number one. ''[[Friday's Child (album)|Friday's Child]]'' (2003) followed and enjoyed greater success, eventually going platinum five times in the UK and spawning three top five singles. His following albums ''[[Keep On]]'' (2005), ''[[Let It Go (Will Young album)|Let It Go]]'' (2008) and ''[[Echoes (Will Young album)|Echoes]]'' (2011) also went multi-platinum and his most recent release ''[[85% Proof]]'' (2015) became his fourth UK number-one album.

The award began in 1998, and was televised on ITV before being dropped in 2006 after disagreements over the phone voting element. Since then it has been an online poll, administered through the Record of the Year website. In 2013, it was axed, signaling the end of the award.\n{{award table}}\n!
