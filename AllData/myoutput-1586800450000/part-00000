It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder\u2013Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.\n\nThe battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen\u2013[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol \u015awierczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. \n\nAfter the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.\n\n==Background==\nIn the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol \u015awierczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gr\u00e4ser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Wei\u00dfer Sch\u00f6ps|Weisser Sch\u00f6ps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Wei\u00dfenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>\n\n\u015awierczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Sch\u00f6rner was concentrating his units (the \"G\u00f6rlitz Group\") in the [[G\u00f6rlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army. His aim was to stop the 1st Front's advance and break through to Berlin to relieve the trapped [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans were pinning their hopes on the idea that the Soviets might be fended off long enough for the city to be surrendered to the Western Allies.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> The concentration of Sch\u00f6rner's units went unnoticed by Soviet and Polish reconnaissance.<ref name=zw/>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Opposing forces===\nGerman forces were composed of elements of the 4th Panzer Army and commanded by the headquarters for the ''Grossdeutschland'' and 57th Armored Corps.  For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}\n\nThe Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000\u201390,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>\n\nOverall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior. Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced, however the German sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers and inexperienced recruits of ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Berlin 1945-a.png|thumb|Berlin operation|alt=Berlin operation]]\n[[File:Battle of Berlin 1945-b.png|thumb|Berlin operation|alt=Berlin operation]]\n[[File:Battle of Bautzen 1945-a.png|thumb|Map of the Battle of Bautzen (1)|alt=Map of the Battle of Bautzen (1)]]\n[[File:Battle of Bautzen 1945-b.png|thumb|Map of the Battle of Bautzen (2)|alt=Map of the Battle of Bautzen (2)]]\n\n===Drive on Dresden===\nOn 21 April, a gap had formed between the Polish infantry units (8th and 9th infantry divisions) and the 1st Armored Corps pushing towards Dresden, and the Polish units which were securing the Muskauer Forst region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The 7th and 10th infantry divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th Infantry Division and the 16th Tank Brigade were in transit in between those two groups.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish units were stretched over a line of {{convert|50|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=zw/> The Germans took the opportunity to push into this gap.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The battle started on 21 April.<ref name=\"zw\"/> In the west, the 20th Panzer Division started its drive on Bautzen, while in the east the 17th Infantry Division  advanced on Niesky and Wei\u00dfenberg, freeing trapped German troops on its way.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> The Germans drove between the Polish Second Army and the [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 52nd Army]] around Bautzen, some {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} north-east of Dresden and {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} west of G\u00f6rlitz, sweeping the Soviet units of the [[48th Rifle Corps]], and driving towards [[Spremberg]].<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Major General [[M.

The main body of the German force was located in the forested region around Lohsa.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans continued their push toward [[K\u00f6nigswartha]] and [[Hoyerswerda]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>\n\n===Polish retreat===\nEventually, \u015awierczewski halted his force's advance on Dresden, and ordered it to pull back and secure the breach.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-132\"/> On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th remained near Dresden. For a while \u015awierczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Konev also sent his chief of staff, General [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov]], and his chief of operations, General [[Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev]], to look at the situation.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> \u015awierczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence.<ref name=\"zw\"/> To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions.<ref name=zw/> The [[14th Guards Rifle Division|Soviet 14th]] and [[95th Guards Rifle Division|95th Guards Rifle Divisions]], as well as the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|4th Guards Tank Corps]], were ordered to attack toward [[Kamenz]], K\u00f6nigswartha and [[Sdier]] to stop the Germans from advancing further north.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\" /> The [[2nd Air Army]] was also assigned to this theater.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the German advance to the southeast of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet [[294th Rifle Division]] was encircled at Wei\u00dfenberg by the ''Brandenburg'' Division.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, large parts of the 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was able to break into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody [[house-to-house fighting|house-to-house combat]]. Several remaining pockets of resistance in the town were cleared during the next days.<ref name=Ahlfen208209/><ref name=B199942-46/> Outside the town the German advance stalled, as their troops were running low on fuel supplies.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The recapture of Bautzen was one of the last successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.<ref name=\"WilliamsonAndrew2003\"/>\n\nBy 25 April, Polish units were able to stabilize a defense on the line Kamenz\u2013[[Kuckau]]\u2013north Bautzen\u2013Spree\u2013[[Spreewiese]]\u2013[[Kreba-Neudorf|Heideanger]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> On that day, [[Hitler]] congratulated Sch\u00f6rner on his \"victory\".<ref name=\"Mcateer2009\"/> The Polish 7th and 10th infantry divisions were ordered to advance toward Sdier-Heideanger.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The 7th and 10th Polish infantry divisions slowly advanced, with the 10th reaching north of [[Uhyst|Spreefurt]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> With the Soviet units on their right flank they also secured a road to K\u00f6nigswartha.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>\n\nThe 9th Division found itself alone at the spearhead of the abandoned Polish push towards Dresden. It received orders to retreat on 26 April.<ref name=as/> Attempting to withdraw quickly and to form back with the main forces, it was intercepted by the Germans and sustained heavy losses.<ref name=zw/> The units were moving with insufficient security, on the assumption that the line of retreat was safe; at the same time the Germans captured Polish orders with details of their planned withdrawal routes.<ref name=zw/> Coordination between the units was also lacking.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> 26th Infantry Regiment from the 9th Division took very heavy casualties (75 percent) in the \"valley of death\" around [[Panschwitz-Kuckau]] and [[Crostwitz]].<ref name=zw/> A Polish [[military hospital]] convoy from the same division was ambushed near [[Horka, Saxony|Horka]], with [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|most of its personnel and wounded executed]] (about 300 casualties). There was only one survivor, chaplain Jan Rdzanek.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"GrzelakSta\u0144czyk1993\"/> The division commander, Colonel [[Aleksander \u0141aski]], was taken captive.<ref name=zw/><ref name=zw/> As a result of these losses, the 9th Division ceased to be an effective force; the remaining personnel were merged into the Soviet [[19th Guards Rifle Division]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>\n\nAccording to some sources, 26 April marks the end of this battle, although less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April.<ref name=zw/> Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> By the end of the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz\u2013[[Dobersch\u00fctz]]\u2013[[Dauban]], and was preparing to launch an offensive toward [[Prague]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Pomnik \u017co\u0142nierzy polskich Crostwitz.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to Polish soldiers in [[Crostwitz]]]]\nBoth sides suffered heavy casualties.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The Polish casualties were particularly severe.<ref name=zw/> In a relatively short time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total).<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead).<ref name=zw/> Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000.<ref name=zw/> According to Polish historian [[Zbigniew Wawer]], this was the most bloody battle that the [[Polish Army]] had been involved in since the [[battle of Bzura]] in 1939.<ref name=zw/>\n\nGerman casualties were significant, but less than the Polish and Soviet ones; contemporary Polish sources estimated German losses at 6,500 personnel, which is now seen as an inflated estimate.<ref name=zw/> The German forces failed in their objective of breaking through the 1st Ukrainian Front and coming to the aid of Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> They managed, however, to inflict very serious casualties on the local Polish and Soviet units and stopped the Polish drive on Dresden (it was still in German hands at the time of the German capitulation on May 9).<ref name=zw/> The successful recapture of Bautzen, Wei\u00dfenberg and surroundings is called one of the last successful German armored counterattacks of the war. Bautzen and surroundings stayed in German hands until [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's capitulation]].

It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder\u2013Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.\n\nThe battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen\u2013[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol \u015awierczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. \n\nAfter the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.\n\n==Background==\nIn the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol \u015awierczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gr\u00e4ser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Wei\u00dfer Sch\u00f6ps|Weisser Sch\u00f6ps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Wei\u00dfenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>\n\n\u015awierczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Sch\u00f6rner was concentrating his units (the \"G\u00f6rlitz Group\") in the [[G\u00f6rlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army.

For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}\n\nThe Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000\u201390,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>\n\nOverall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior.
