In 1909, [[Thomas Common]] translated it as \"Superman\", following the terminology of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1903 stage play ''[[Man and Superman]]''. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons: first, the failure of the English prefix \"super\" to capture the nuance of the German {{lang|de|[[\u00fcber]]}} (though in Latin, its meaning of \"above\" or \"beyond\" is closer to the German); and second, for promoting misidentification of Nietzsche's concept with the comic-book character [[Superman]]. Kaufmann and others preferred to translate {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as \"overman the loser\". A better translation like \"superior humans\" might better fit the concept of Nietzsche as he unfolds his narrative. Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lampert|first=Laurence|title=Nietzsche's Teaching|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}</ref>\n\nThe German prefix {{lang|de|[[\u00fcber]]}} can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached.<ref>''Duden Deutsches Universal W\u00f6rterbuch A\u2013Z,'' s.v. \u00fcber-.</ref> ''Mensch'' refers to a human being, rather than a male specifically. The adjective {{lang|de|\u00fcbermenschlich}} means super-human: beyond human strength or out of proportion to humanity.<ref>\u00dcbermenschlich. PONS.eu Online Dictionary. Retrieved from http://en.pons.eu/german-english/%C3%BCbermenschlich.</ref>\n\n==This-worldliness==\nNietzsche introduces the concept of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of [[Christianity]]: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fulfillment to draw them away from the earth.<ref>Hollingdale, R. J. (1961), page 44 \u2013 English translation of Zarathustra's prologue; \"I love those who do not first seek beyond the stars for reasons to go down and to be sacrifices: but who sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth may one day belong to the Superman\"</ref><ref>Nietzsche, F. (1885) \u2013 p. 4, Original publication \u2013 \"Ich liebe die, welche nicht erst hinter den Sternen einen Grund suchen, unterzugehen und Opfer zu sein: sondern die sich der Erde opfern, dass die Erde einst des \u00dcbermenschen werde.\"</ref>  The turn away from the earth is prompted, he says, by a dissatisfaction with life that causes the sufferer to imagine another world which will fulfill his revenge. The {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} grasps the earthly world with relish and gratitude.\n\nZarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or [[asceticism]]. Zarathustra further links the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|page=61|isbn=978-0-140-44118-5}}</ref>\n\n==Death of God and the creation of new values==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nZarathustra ties the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to the [[God is dead|death of God]]. While the concept of God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts, belief in God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. \"God is dead\" means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values exhausted, the danger of [[nihilism]] looms.\n\nZarathustra presents the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as the creator of new values to banish nihilism. If the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.\n\nIn order to avoid a relapse into [[Platonic idealism]] or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see [[Nietzschean affirmation]]).\n\n==As a goal==\nZarathustra first announces the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as a goal humanity can set for itself. All human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings. The aspiration of a woman would be to give birth to an {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}, for example; her relationships with men would be judged by this standard.<ref>''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', I.18; Lampert, ''Nietzsche's; Rosen, ''Mask of Enlightenment'', 118.</ref>\n\nZarathustra contrasts the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} with the degenerate [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity, an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself.  [[Last man|The last man]] appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a smothering of aspiration antithetical to the spirit of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}.\n\nAccording to [[R\u00fcdiger Safranski]], some commentators associate the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} with a program of [[eugenics]].<ref>Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 262-64, 266\u201368.</ref>  This is most pronounced when considered in the aspect of a goal that humanity sets for itself.  The reduction of all [[psychology]] to [[physiology]] implies, to some, that human beings can be bred for cultural traits. This interpretation of Nietzsche's doctrine focuses more on the future of humanity than on a single cataclysmic individual.  There is no consensus regarding how this aspect of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} relates to the creation of new values.\n\n==Re-embodiment of amoral aristocratic values==\n\nFor [[R\u00fcdiger Safranski]], the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} represents a higher biological type reached through [[artificial selection]] and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential, good and \"evil\", to become an \"artist-tyrant\". In ''Ecce Homo'', Nietzsche vehemently denied any [[idealistic]], [[Democracy|democratic]] or [[humanitarian]] interpretation of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}: \"The word {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} [designates] a type of supreme achievement, as opposed to 'modern' men, 'good' men, [[Christians]], and other [[nihilists]] ... When I whispered into the ears of some people that they were better off looking for a [[Cesare Borgia]] than a [[Percival|Parsifal]], they did not believe their ears.\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', Why I Write Such Good Books, \u00a71)</ref> Safranski argues that the combination of ruthless warrior pride and artistic brilliance that defined the [[Italian Renaissance]] embodied the sense of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} for Nietzsche. According to Safranski, Nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to serve as a Machiavellian bogeyman of the modern Western middle class and its pseudo-Christian egalitarian value system.<ref>Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 365</ref>\n\n==Relation to the eternal recurrence==\nThe {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} shares a place of prominence in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' with another of Nietzsche's key concepts:  the [[Eternal return#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence of the same]]. Several interpretations for this fact have been offered.\n\nLaurence Lampert suggests that the eternal recurrence replaces the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as the object of serious aspiration.<ref>Lampert, ''Nietzsche's Teaching''.</ref>  This is in part due to the fact that even the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} can appear like an other-worldly hope.  The {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} lies in the future \u2014 no historical figures have ever been {{lang|de|\u00dcbermenschen}} \u2014 and so still represents a sort of [[eschatology|eschatological]] redemption in some future time.\n\nStanley Rosen, on the other hand, suggests that the doctrine of eternal return is an [[esotericism|esoteric]] ruse meant to save the concept of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} from the charge of Idealism.<ref>Rosen, ''The Mask of Enlightenment''.</ref>  Rather than positing an as-yet unexperienced perfection, Nietzsche would be the prophet of something that has occurred a countless number of times in the past.\n\nOthers<!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---> maintain that willing the eternal recurrence of the same is a necessary step if the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism.  Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values.  Therefore, it could seem that the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism.  Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism.\n\nStill others<!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---> suggest that one must have the strength of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\n==Nazism==\nThe term {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} was used frequently by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or Germanic master race;<ref name=\"Alexander 2011\">{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=A Contemporary Introduction to Sociology |edition=2nd |year=2011|publisher=Paradigm|isbn=978-1-61205-029-4}}</ref> a [[racism|racial]] version of Nietzsche's {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} became a philosophical foundation for National Socialist ideas.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/nietzsche_crimes/7.html \"Nietzsche inspired Hitler and other killers \u2013 Page 7\"], Court TV Crime Library</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313191954/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html |archive-date=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Nazi notion of the [[master race]] also spawned the idea of \"inferior humans\" (''[[Untermensch]]en'') who should be dominated and enslaved; this term does not originate with Nietzsche, who was critical of both [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche.27s criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|antisemitism and German nationalism]]. In his final years, Nietzsche began to believe that he was in fact Polish, not German, and was quoted as saying, \"I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood\".<ref>[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], \"Ecce Homo: How One Becomes What One Is\" [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecce_Homo.html?id=tVL-Dmg6TlUC]</ref> In defiance of nationalist doctrines, he claimed that he and Germany were great only because of \"Polish blood in their veins\",<ref>[[Henry Louis Mencken]], \"The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\", T.

Nietzsche died long before Hitler's reign, and it was partly Nietzsche's sister [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] who manipulated her brother's words to accommodate the worldview of herself and her husband, [[Bernhard F\u00f6rster]], a prominent German nationalist and antisemite.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://users.utu.fi/hansalmi/forster.html |author=Hannu Salmi |title=Die Sucht nach dem germanischen Ideal |year=1994|language=de}} Also published in ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geschichtswissenschaft'' 6/1994, pp. 485\u2013496</ref> F\u00f6rster founded the ''Deutscher Volksverein'' (German People's League) in 1881 with [[Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg]].<ref>[[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], ''The German Dictatorship'', 1970, pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\n==Anarchism==\nThe thought of Nietzsche had an important [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|influence on anarchist authors]]. Spencer Sunshine writes: \"There were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of 'herds'; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'overman' \u2014 that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, 'Yes' to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values' as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history.\"<ref name=\"anarchonietzche\">{{cite web|url=https://radicalarchives.org/2010/05/18/nietzsche-and-the-anarchists/|title=Spencer Sunshine: \u201cNietzsche and the Anarchists\u201d (2005)|date=18 May 2010|publisher=}}</ref> The influential American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]], in the preface of her famous collection ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', defends both Nietzsche and [[Max Stirner]] from attacks within anarchism when she says \"The most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or personality.

Bookchin says that \"workers must see themselves as human beings, not as class beings; as creative personalities, not as 'proletarians,' as self-affirming individuals, not as 'masses'. . .(the) economic component must be humanized precisely by bringing an 'affinity of friendship' to the work process, by diminishing the role of onerous work in the lives of producers, indeed by a total 'transvaluation of values' (to use Nietzsche's phrase) as it applies to production and consumption as well as social and personal life.\"<ref name=\"anarchonietzche\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The comic-book hero [[Superman]], when [[Jerry Siegel|Jerome \"Jerry\" Siegel]] first created him, was originally a villain modeled on Nietzsche's idea (see \"[[The Reign of the Superman]]\").{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} He was re-invented as a hero by his eventual designer, [[Joe Shuster|Joseph \"Joe\" Shuster]], after which he bore little resemblance to the previous character. However, Superman does find an adversary in the mold of the Nietzschean {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in the recurring arch-villain [[Lex Luthor]],{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} his greatest enemy on Earth. Luthor is preceded, even, by a supervillain resembling Siegel's original concept for Superman bearing the synonymous name of '[[Ultra-Humanite]]'. A direct reference to the term occurs in the episode \"Double Trouble\" of the TV series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]],'' in which a German-speaking character calls the title character \"{{lang|de|verfluchter \u00dcbermensch}}\" (\"cursed Superman\").<ref>{{cite book |first=Gary |last=Grossman |title=Superman: Serial to Cereal |year=1976 |page=67 |location=New York |publisher=Popular Library |isbn=0445040548 }}</ref> In the tenth season of the show ''[[Smallville]]'', an alternate Lionel Luthor refers to Clark as the \"{{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}\".

Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lampert|first=Laurence|title=Nietzsche's Teaching|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}</ref>\n\nThe German prefix {{lang|de|[[\u00fcber]]}} can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached.<ref>''Duden Deutsches Universal W\u00f6rterbuch A\u2013Z,'' s.v. \u00fcber-.</ref> ''Mensch'' refers to a human being, rather than a male specifically.

Retrieved from http://en.pons.eu/german-english/%C3%BCbermenschlich.</ref>\n\n==This-worldliness==\nNietzsche introduces the concept of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of [[Christianity]]: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fulfillment to draw them away from the earth.<ref>Hollingdale, R. J. (1961), page 44 \u2013 English translation of Zarathustra's prologue; \"I love those who do not first seek beyond the stars for reasons to go down and to be sacrifices: but who sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth may one day belong to the Superman\"</ref><ref>Nietzsche, F. (1885) \u2013 p. 4, Original publication \u2013 \"Ich liebe die, welche nicht erst hinter den Sternen einen Grund suchen, unterzugehen und Opfer zu sein: sondern die sich der Erde opfern, dass die Erde einst des \u00dcbermenschen werde.\"</ref>  The turn away from the earth is prompted, he says, by a dissatisfaction with life that causes the sufferer to imagine another world which will fulfill his revenge. The {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} grasps the earthly world with relish and gratitude.\n\nZarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or [[asceticism]]. Zarathustra further links the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|page=61|isbn=978-0-140-44118-5}}</ref>\n\n==Death of God and the creation of new values==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nZarathustra ties the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to the [[God is dead|death of God]]. While the concept of God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts, belief in God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. \"God is dead\" means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values exhausted, the danger of [[nihilism]] looms.\n\nZarathustra presents the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as the creator of new values to banish nihilism. If the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.\n\nIn order to avoid a relapse into [[Platonic idealism]] or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see [[Nietzschean affirmation]]).\n\n==As a goal==\nZarathustra first announces the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as a goal humanity can set for itself. All human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings. The aspiration of a woman would be to give birth to an {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}, for example; her relationships with men would be judged by this standard.<ref>''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', I.18; Lampert, ''Nietzsche's; Rosen, ''Mask of Enlightenment'', 118.</ref>\n\nZarathustra contrasts the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} with the degenerate [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity, an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself.  [[Last man|The last man]] appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a smothering of aspiration antithetical to the spirit of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}.\n\nAccording to [[R\u00fcdiger Safranski]], some commentators associate the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} with a program of [[eugenics]].<ref>Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 262-64, 266\u201368.</ref>  This is most pronounced when considered in the aspect of a goal that humanity sets for itself.  The reduction of all [[psychology]] to [[physiology]] implies, to some, that human beings can be bred for cultural traits. This interpretation of Nietzsche's doctrine focuses more on the future of humanity than on a single cataclysmic individual.  There is no consensus regarding how this aspect of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} relates to the creation of new values.\n\n==Re-embodiment of amoral aristocratic values==\n\nFor [[R\u00fcdiger Safranski]], the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} represents a higher biological type reached through [[artificial selection]] and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential, good and \"evil\", to become an \"artist-tyrant\". In ''Ecce Homo'', Nietzsche vehemently denied any [[idealistic]], [[Democracy|democratic]] or [[humanitarian]] interpretation of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}: \"The word {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} [designates] a type of supreme achievement, as opposed to 'modern' men, 'good' men, [[Christians]], and other [[nihilists]] ... When I whispered into the ears of some people that they were better off looking for a [[Cesare Borgia]] than a [[Percival|Parsifal]], they did not believe their ears.\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', Why I Write Such Good Books, \u00a71)</ref> Safranski argues that the combination of ruthless warrior pride and artistic brilliance that defined the [[Italian Renaissance]] embodied the sense of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} for Nietzsche. According to Safranski, Nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to serve as a Machiavellian bogeyman of the modern Western middle class and its pseudo-Christian egalitarian value system.<ref>Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 365</ref>\n\n==Relation to the eternal recurrence==\nThe {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} shares a place of prominence in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' with another of Nietzsche's key concepts:  the [[Eternal return#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence of the same]]. Several interpretations for this fact have been offered.\n\nLaurence Lampert suggests that the eternal recurrence replaces the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as the object of serious aspiration.<ref>Lampert, ''Nietzsche's Teaching''.</ref>  This is in part due to the fact that even the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} can appear like an other-worldly hope.  The {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} lies in the future \u2014 no historical figures have ever been {{lang|de|\u00dcbermenschen}} \u2014 and so still represents a sort of [[eschatology|eschatological]] redemption in some future time.\n\nStanley Rosen, on the other hand, suggests that the doctrine of eternal return is an [[esotericism|esoteric]] ruse meant to save the concept of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} from the charge of Idealism.<ref>Rosen, ''The Mask of Enlightenment''.</ref>  Rather than positing an as-yet unexperienced perfection, Nietzsche would be the prophet of something that has occurred a countless number of times in the past.\n\nOthers<!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---> maintain that willing the eternal recurrence of the same is a necessary step if the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism.  Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values.  Therefore, it could seem that the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism.  Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism.\n\nStill others<!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---> suggest that one must have the strength of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\n==Nazism==\nThe term {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} was used frequently by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or Germanic master race;<ref name=\"Alexander 2011\">{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=A Contemporary Introduction to Sociology |edition=2nd |year=2011|publisher=Paradigm|isbn=978-1-61205-029-4}}</ref> a [[racism|racial]] version of Nietzsche's {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} became a philosophical foundation for National Socialist ideas.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/nietzsche_crimes/7.html \"Nietzsche inspired Hitler and other killers \u2013 Page 7\"], Court TV Crime Library</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313191954/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html |archive-date=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Nazi notion of the [[master race]] also spawned the idea of \"inferior humans\" (''[[Untermensch]]en'') who should be dominated and enslaved; this term does not originate with Nietzsche, who was critical of both [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche.27s criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|antisemitism and German nationalism]]. In his final years, Nietzsche began to believe that he was in fact Polish, not German, and was quoted as saying, \"I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood\".<ref>[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], \"Ecce Homo: How One Becomes What One Is\" [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecce_Homo.html?id=tVL-Dmg6TlUC]</ref> In defiance of nationalist doctrines, he claimed that he and Germany were great only because of \"Polish blood in their veins\",<ref>[[Henry Louis Mencken]], \"The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\", T.

Nietzsche died long before Hitler's reign, and it was partly Nietzsche's sister [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] who manipulated her brother's words to accommodate the worldview of herself and her husband, [[Bernhard F\u00f6rster]], a prominent German nationalist and antisemite.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://users.utu.fi/hansalmi/forster.html |author=Hannu Salmi |title=Die Sucht nach dem germanischen Ideal |year=1994|language=de}} Also published in ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geschichtswissenschaft'' 6/1994, pp. 485\u2013496</ref> F\u00f6rster founded the ''Deutscher Volksverein'' (German People's League) in 1881 with [[Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg]].<ref>[[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], ''The German Dictatorship'', 1970, pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\n==Anarchism==\nThe thought of Nietzsche had an important [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|influence on anarchist authors]]. Spencer Sunshine writes: \"There were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of 'herds'; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'overman' \u2014 that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, 'Yes' to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values' as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history.\"<ref name=\"anarchonietzche\">{{cite web|url=https://radicalarchives.org/2010/05/18/nietzsche-and-the-anarchists/|title=Spencer Sunshine: \u201cNietzsche and the Anarchists\u201d (2005)|date=18 May 2010|publisher=}}</ref> The influential American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]], in the preface of her famous collection ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', defends both Nietzsche and [[Max Stirner]] from attacks within anarchism when she says \"The most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or personality.

Bookchin says that \"workers must see themselves as human beings, not as class beings; as creative personalities, not as 'proletarians,' as self-affirming individuals, not as 'masses'. . .(the) economic component must be humanized precisely by bringing an 'affinity of friendship' to the work process, by diminishing the role of onerous work in the lives of producers, indeed by a total 'transvaluation of values' (to use Nietzsche's phrase) as it applies to production and consumption as well as social and personal life.\"<ref name=\"anarchonietzche\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The comic-book hero [[Superman]], when [[Jerry Siegel|Jerome \"Jerry\" Siegel]] first created him, was originally a villain modeled on Nietzsche's idea (see \"[[The Reign of the Superman]]\").{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} He was re-invented as a hero by his eventual designer, [[Joe Shuster|Joseph \"Joe\" Shuster]], after which he bore little resemblance to the previous character. However, Superman does find an adversary in the mold of the Nietzschean {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in the recurring arch-villain [[Lex Luthor]],{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} his greatest enemy on Earth. Luthor is preceded, even, by a supervillain resembling Siegel's original concept for Superman bearing the synonymous name of '[[Ultra-Humanite]]'. A direct reference to the term occurs in the episode \"Double Trouble\" of the TV series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]],'' in which a German-speaking character calls the title character \"{{lang|de|verfluchter \u00dcbermensch}}\" (\"cursed Superman\").<ref>{{cite book |first=Gary |last=Grossman |title=Superman: Serial to Cereal |year=1976 |page=67 |location=New York |publisher=Popular Library |isbn=0445040548 }}</ref> In the tenth season of the show ''[[Smallville]]'', an alternate Lionel Luthor refers to Clark as the \"{{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}\".
