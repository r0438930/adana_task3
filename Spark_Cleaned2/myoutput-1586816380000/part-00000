In 1844, at age 15, he left home without permission to go to [[Illinois]]. Two years later he joined the 2nd Illinois Volunteer Regiment and headed to [[Republic of Texas|Texas]] to participate in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. In [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Chamberlain joined the [[regular army]] and became part of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st U.S. Dragoons]]. He fought at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] in February 1847 as well as several other operations in Mexico. In 1849, he was declared a [[desertion|deserter]] and by 1854 he had returned home to Boston to raise a family. He married Mary Keith on July 4, 1855, and they had three children.<ref name=tsha/> \n\nBy his own account, Chamberlain was also involved in some less savory aspects of the Texas\u2013Mexico border disputes. Most notably, he rode for a time with the infamous Glanton gang under the command of [[John Glanton]], which was contracted by Mexican authorities to track and kill hostile [[Apache]]s following the war. The gang became notorious for taking [[scalping|scalps]] under highly questionable circumstances to claim the bounties, and its members were eventually declared outlaws by the Mexican government. Chamberlain's memoirs regarding this period are the only known primary source attesting to the existence of the [[Texian]] known as [[Judge Holden]], Glanton's second-in-command. While Chamberlain and some others escaped, Glanton and a number of his gang were massacred by [[Quechan|Yuma]] Indians near what is now [[Yuma, Arizona]], in April 1850.\n\n==Civil War==\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], after being chief of staff to Brigadier General [[William W. Averell]] and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] of the [[1st Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry|1st Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment]], Chamberlain commanded Camp Parole at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], for a time and also commanded the [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry|5th Massachusetts Colored Cavalry]], an all African-American unit, with the rank of colonel. He was wounded on six different occasions during the war.<ref>Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J., ''Civil War High Commands'', p. 169.
