The Tokugawa and ''daimy\u014d'' ''[[de facto]]'' administered Japan through their system of ''[[Han system|han]]'' (feudal domains) alongside the ''[[de jure]]'' Imperial [[provinces of Japan|provinces]]. The Tokugawa Shogunate saw rapid economic growth and [[urbanization]] in Japan which led to the rise of the [[merchant]] class and ''[[Ukiyo]]'' culture. The Tokugawa Shogunate declined during the ''[[Bakumatsu]]'' (\"Opening of Japan\") period from 1853 and was overthrown by supporters of the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|Imperial Court]] in the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868. The [[Empire of Japan]] was established under the [[Meiji government]] and Tokugawa loyalists continued to fight in the [[Boshin War]] until the defeat of the [[Republic of Ezo]] at the [[Battle of Hakodate]] in June 1869.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Bakumatsu}}\n\nFollowing the [[Sengoku period]] (\"warring states period\"), the central government had been largely re-established by [[Oda Nobunaga]] during the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].<ref name=\"nussbaum978\"/>\n\n[[Edo society|Society in the Tokugawa period]], unlike in previous shogunates, was supposedly based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' (lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of [[samurai]], with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimy\u014d'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimy\u014d'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local rulers. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts that did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants, ranging from simple local disturbances to much larger rebellions. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA 2017 study found that peasant rebellions and collective desertion (\"flight\") lowered tax rates and inhibited state growth in the Tokugawa shogunate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paik|first=Christopher|last2=Steele|first2=Abbey|last3=Tanaka|first3=Seiki|title=Constraining the Samurai: Rebellion and Taxation in Early Modern Japan|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=61|issue=2|pages=352\u2013370|doi=10.1093/isq/sqx008|year=2017|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137080/1/Binder3.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-19th century, an alliance of several of the more powerful ''daimy\u014d'', along with the titular [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], succeeded in overthrowing the shogunate after the [[Boshin War]], culminating in the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The Tokugawa shogunate came to an official end in 1868 with the resignation of the 15th Tokugawa shogun'','' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], leading to the \"restoration\" ([[:ja:\u738b\u653f\u5fa9\u53e4 (\u65e5\u672c)|\u738b\u653f\u5fa9\u53e4]], ''\u014csei fukko'') of imperial rule. Notwithstanding its eventual overthrow in favor of the more modernized, less feudal form of governance of the Meiji Restoration, the Tokugawa shogunate oversaw the longest period of peace and stability in Japan's history, lasting well over 260 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Government==\n\n===Shogunate and domains===<!-- The article O-Ie S\u014dd\u014d links to this section. If you change the title of this section, kindly consider also changing the link (the on-screen text is ''bakuhan'') in O-Ie S\u014dd\u014d. -->\n\nThe ''bakuhan taisei'' ({{lang|ja|\u5e55\u85e9\u4f53\u5236}}) was the [[feudal]] political system in the [[Edo period]] of [[Japan]]. {{anchor|bakufu}}''Baku'' is an abbreviation of ''bakufu'', meaning \"military government\"\u2014that is, the shogunate. The ''[[Han (Japan)|han]]'' were the domains headed by ''daimy\u014d''.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nVassals held inherited lands and provided military service and homage to their lords. The ''bakuhan taisei'' split feudal power between the shogunate in Edo and provincial domains throughout Japan. Provinces had a degree of sovereignty and were allowed an independent administration of the han in exchange for loyalty to the ''sh\u014dgun'', who was responsible for foreign relations and national security. The ''sh\u014dgun'' and lords were all ''daimy\u014ds'': feudal lords with their own bureaucracies, policies, and territories. The ''sh\u014dgun'' also administered the most powerful ''han'', the hereditary fief of the House of Tokugawa. Each level of government administered its own system of [[taxation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Edo P2.jpg|thumb|[[Edo Castle]], 17th century]]\n\nThe emperor, nominally a religious leader, held no real power; this was vested in the ''sh\u014dgun''. The shogunate had the power to discard, annex, and transform domains. The ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' system of alternative residence required each ''daimy\u014d'' to reside in alternate years between the han and the court in Edo. During their absences from Edo, it was also required that they leave family as hostages until their return. The huge expenditure ''sankin-k\u014dtai'' imposed on each han helped centralize aristocratic alliances and ensured loyalty to the ''sh\u014dgun'' as each representative doubled as a potential hostage.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nTokugawa's descendants further ensured loyalty by maintaining a dogmatic insistence on loyalty to the ''sh\u014dgun''. ''[[Fudai daimy\u014d]]'' were hereditary vassals of Ieyasu, as well as of his descendants. ''[[Tozama daimy\u014d|Tozama]]'' (\"outsiders\") became vassals of Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara. ''[[Shinpan]]'' (\"relatives\") were collaterals of Tokugawa Hidetada. Early in the Edo period, the shogunate viewed the ''tozama'' as the least likely to be loyal; over time, strategic marriages and the entrenchment of the system made the ''tozama'' less likely to rebel. In the end, it was the great ''tozama'' of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]], [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Province|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] and [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], and to a lesser extent [[Hizen]], that brought down the shogunate. These four states are called the Four Western Clans, or [[Satchotohi]] for short.<ref>Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA826&dq= \"''Satchotohi''\"], pp. 826\u2013827.</ref>\n\nThe number of ''han'' (roughly 250) fluctuated throughout the Edo period. They were ranked by size, which was measured as the number of ''[[koku]]'' of rice that the domain produced each year. One ''koku'' was the amount of rice necessary to feed one adult male for one year. The minimum number for a ''daimy\u014d'' was ten thousand ''koku''; the largest, apart from the ''sh\u014dgun'', was a million.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Relations with the Emperor===\n\n[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|Social class during the Shogunate with the Emperor as the nominal ruler]]\n\nRegardless of the political title of the Emperor, the ''sh\u014dguns'' of the Tokugawa family controlled Japan.<ref>Jansen 2002, pp. 144\u2013148.</ref> The {{nihongo|administration|\u4f53\u5236|taisei}} of Japan was a task given by the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]] to the Tokugawa family, which returned to the court in the [[Meiji Restoration]]. While the Emperor officially had the prerogative of appointing the ''sh\u014dgun'', he had virtually no say in state affairs. The shogunate appointed a liaison, the ''[[Kyoto Shoshidai]]'' (''Shogun's Representative in Kyoto''), to deal with the Emperor, court and nobility.\n\nTowards the end of the shogunate, however, after centuries of the Emperor having very little say in state affairs and being secluded in his [[Kyoto Imperial Palace|Kyoto palace]], and in the wake of the reigning ''sh\u014dgun'', [[Tokugawa Iemochi]], marrying the sister of [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] (r. 1846\u20131867), in 1862, the Imperial Court in Kyoto began to enjoy increased political influence.<ref>Keene, Donald ''Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852\u20131912'' (2005, Columbia University Press) p. 62</ref> The Emperor would occasionally be consulted on various policies and the shogun even made a visit to Kyoto to visit the Emperor.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Shogun and foreign trade===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Grote partij bij het opperhoofd van Dejima.jpg|thumb|Dutch trading post in [[Dejima]], c. 1805]]\nForeign affairs and trade were monopolized by the ''shogunate'', yielding a huge profit. Foreign trade was also permitted to the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and the [[Tsushima Fuch\u016b Domain|Tsushima domain]]s. [[Rice]] was the main trading product of [[Japan]] during this time. [[Isolationism]] was the foreign policy of Japan and trade was strictly controlled.  Merchants were outsiders to the [[social hierarchy]] of Japan and were thought to be greedy.\n\nThe visits of the [[Nanban trade|Nanban]] ships from [[Portugal]] were at first the main vector of trade exchanges, followed by the addition of Dutch, English and sometimes Spanish ships.\n\nFrom 1603 onward, Japan started to participate actively in foreign trade. In 1615, an embassy and trade mission under [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] was sent across the Pacific to [[Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain) on the Japanese-built galleon [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']]. Until 1635, the Shogun issued numerous permits for the so-called \"[[red seal ships]]\" destined for the Asian trade.\n\nAfter 1635 and the introduction of [[Sakoku|Seclusion laws]], inbound ships were only allowed from [[China]], [[Korea]], and the [[Netherlands]].\n\n===Shogun and Christianity===\n{{Main|Kirishitan}}\n[[File:Christian-Prisoners-Edo-Tokugawa.png|thumb|Christian prisoners in Edo, 17th century]]\nFollowers of [[Christianity]] first began appearing in Japan during the 16th century. [[Oda Nobunaga]] embraced Christianity and the Western technology that was imported with it, such as the musket. He also saw it as a tool he could use to suppress Buddhist forces.<ref>Chie Nakane and Shinzaburou Oishi (1990). ''Tokugawa Japan \u2013 The Social and Economic Antecedents of Modern Japan''. University of Tokyo Press. pp.12.</ref>\n \nThough Christianity was allowed to grow until the 1610s, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] soon began to see it as a growing threat to the stability of the shogunate. As ''\u014cgosho'' (\"Cloistered ''Sh\u014dgun''\"),<ref>Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA738&dq= \"''Ogosho''\"] at p. 738.</ref> he influenced the implementation of laws that banned the practice of Christianity. His successors followed suit, compounding upon Ieyasu's laws. The ban of Christianity is often linked with the creation of the Seclusion laws, or [[Sakoku]], in the 1630s.<ref>Chie Nakane and Shinzaburou Oishi (1990). ''Tokugawa Japan: The Social and Economic Antecedents of Modern Japan''. University of Tokyo Press. pp.24\u201328.</ref>\n\n==Institutions of the shogunate==\n\n===R\u014dj\u016b and wakadoshiyori===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe ''[[r\u014dj\u016b]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u8001\u4e2d}}) were the senior members of the shogunate. They supervised the [[\u014dmetsuke]], [[machi-bugy\u014d]], {{ill|ongokubugy\u014d|ja|\u9060\u56fd\u5949\u884c}} (\u9060\u56fd\u5949\u884c) and other officials, oversaw relations with the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]], [[kuge]] (members of the nobility), daimy\u014d, Buddhist [[temple]]s and [[Shinto shrine]]s, and attended to matters like divisions of [[fief]]s. Normally, four or five men held the office, and one was on duty for a month at a time on a rotating basis. They conferred on especially important matters. In the administrative reforms of 1867 ([[Kei\u014d Reforms]]), the office was eliminated in favor of a bureaucratic system with ministers for the interior, finance, foreign relations, army, and navy.\n\n[[File:SakuradaGate2.jpg|thumb|Sakuradamon Gate of [[Edo Castle]] where [[Ii Naosuke]] was assassinated in 1860]]\nIn principle, the requirements for appointment to the office of r\u014dj\u016b were to be a ''[[fudai daimy\u014d]]'' and to have a fief assessed at {{val|50000}} ''[[koku]]'' or more. However, there were exceptions to both criteria. Many appointees came from the offices close to the ''sh\u014dgun'', such as ''{{ill|soba y\u014dnin|ja|\u5074\u7528\u4eba}}'' (\u5074\u7528\u4eba), [[Kyoto Shoshidai]], and [[Osaka j\u014ddai]].\n\nIrregularly, the ''sh\u014dguns'' appointed a ''r\u014dj\u016b'' to the position of ''[[tair\u014d]]'' (great elder). The office was limited to members of the [[Ii clan|Ii]], [[Sakai clan|Sakai]], [[Doi clan|Doi]], and [[Hotta clan]]s, but [[Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu]] was given the status of tair\u014d as well. Among the most famous was [[Ii Naosuke]], who was assassinated in 1860 outside the Sakuradamon Gate of [[Edo Castle]] ([[Sakuradamon Incident (1860)|Sakuradamon incident]]).\n\nThe ''[[wakadoshiyori]]'' were next in status below the r\u014dj\u016b. An outgrowth of the early six-man ''[[rokuninsh\u016b]]'' (\u516d\u4eba\u8846, 1633\u20131649), the office took its name and final form in 1662, but with four members. Their primary responsibility was management of the affairs of the [[hatamoto]] and [[gokenin]], the direct vassals of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nSome ''sh\u014dguns'' appointed a ''soba y\u014dnin''. This person acted as a liaison between the ''sh\u014dgun'' and the ''r\u014dj\u016b''. The ''soba y\u014dnin'' increased in importance during the time of the fifth ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]], when a wakadoshiyori, [[Inaba Masayasu]], assassinated [[Hotta Masatoshi]], the ''tair\u014d''. Fearing for his personal safety, Tsunayoshi moved the ''r\u014dj\u016b'' to a more distant part of the castle. Some of the most famous ''soba y\u014dnin'' were [[Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu]] and [[Tanuma Okitsugu]].\n\n===\u014cmetsuke and metsuke===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe ''\u014dmetsuke'' and ''[[metsuke]]'' were officials who reported to the ''r\u014dj\u016b'' and ''wakadoshiyori''. The five ''\u014dmetsuke'' were in charge of monitoring the affairs of the ''daimy\u014ds'', ''kuge'' and imperial court. They were in charge of discovering any threat of rebellion. Early in the Edo period, ''daimy\u014ds'' such as [[Yagy\u016b Munefuyu]] held the office. Soon, however, it fell to ''[[hatamoto]]'' with rankings of 5,000 ''koku'' or more. To give them authority in their dealings with ''daimy\u014ds'', they were often ranked at 10,000 ''koku'' and given the title of ''[[Kokushi (official)|kami]]'' (an ancient title, typically signifying the governor of a [[Provinces of Japan|province]]) such as ''Bizen-no-kami''.\n\nAs time progressed, the function of the ''\u014dmetsuke'' evolved into one of passing orders from the shogunate to the ''daimy\u014ds'', and of administering to ceremonies within Edo Castle. They also took on additional responsibilities such as supervising religious affairs and controlling firearms. The ''metsuke'', reporting to the ''wakadoshiyori'', oversaw the affairs of the vassals of the ''sh\u014dgun''. They were the police force for the thousands of hatamoto and [[gokenin]] who were concentrated in Edo. Individual han had their own ''metsuke'' who similarly policed their samurai.\n\n===San-bugy\u014d===\nThe ''san-[[bugy\u014d]]'' (\"three administrators\") were the ''jisha'', ''kanj\u014d'', and ''[[machi-bugy\u014d]]'', which oversaw [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temples]] and [[Shinto shrine|shrines]], accounting, and the cities, respectively. The ''[[jisha-bugy\u014d]]'' had the highest status of the three. They oversaw the administration of Buddhist temples (''ji'') and Shinto shrines (''sha''), many of which held fiefs. Also, they heard lawsuits from several land holdings outside the eight [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] provinces. The appointments normally went to ''daimy\u014ds''; [[\u014coka Tadasuke]] was an exception, though he later became a ''daimy\u014d''.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe ''[[kanj\u014d-bugy\u014d]]'' were next in status. The four holders of this office reported to the ''r\u014dj\u016b''.

Their roles included mayor, chief of the police (and, later, also of the fire department), and judge in criminal and civil matters not involving samurai. Two (briefly, three) men, normally hatamoto, held the office, and alternated by month.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThree Edo ''machi bugy\u014d'' have become famous through ''[[jidaigeki]]'' (period films): [[\u014coka Tadasuke]] and [[T\u014dyama Kagemoto]] (Kinshir\u014d) as heroes, and [[Torii Y\u014dz\u014d]] ([[:ja:\u9ce5\u5c45\u8000\u8535]]) as a villain.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Tenry\u014d, gundai and daikan===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe ''san-bugy\u014d'' together sat on a council called the ''[[hy\u014dj\u014dsho]]''. In this capacity, they were responsible for administering the ''tenry\u014d'', supervising the ''gundai'' ([[:ja:\u90e1\u4ee3|\u90e1\u4ee3]]), the ''daikan'' ([[:ja:\u4ee3\u5b98|\u4ee3\u5b98]]) and the ''kura bugy\u014d'' ([[:ja:\u8535\u5949\u884c|\u8535\u5949\u884c]]), as well as hearing cases involving samurai.\n\nThe shogun directly held lands in various parts of Japan. These were known as ''shihaisho'' (\u652f\u914d\u6240); since the Meiji period, the term ''tenry\u014d'' ([[:ja:\u5929\u9818|\u5929\u9818]], \"Emperor's land\") has become synonymous.<ref>Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA9610&dq= \"''Tenry\u014d''\"], p. 961.</ref> In addition to the territory that Ieyasu held prior to the Battle of Sekigahara, this included lands he gained in that battle and lands gained as a result of the [[Siege of Osaka|Summer and Winter Sieges of Osaka]]. By the end of the seventeenth century, the shogun's landholdings had reached four million koku. Such major cities as Nagasaki and Osaka, and [[mining|mine]]s, including the [[Sado Province|Sado]] [[gold mine]], also fell into this category.\n\n===Gaikoku bugy\u014d===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe ''[[gaikoku bugy\u014d]]'' were administrators appointed between 1858 and 1868.

It is at the end of the [[Edo period]] and preceded the Meiji era. The major ideological and political factions during this period were divided into the pro-imperialist ''[[Ishin Shishi]]'' ([[nationalist]] [[Patriotism|patriots]]) and the shogunate forces, including the elite [[shinsengumi]] (\"newly selected corps\") swordsmen.\n\nAlthough these two groups were the most visible powers, many other factions attempted to use the chaos of the Bakumatsu era to seize personal power.<ref name=\"SHINSENGUMI\">Shinsengumi, The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps, Romulus, Hillsborough, Tuttle Publishing, 2005</ref> Furthermore, there were two other main driving forces for dissent; first, growing resentment of ''[[tozama daimy\u014d]]s'', and second, growing [[anti-Western sentiment]] following the arrival of [[Matthew C. Perry]]. The first related to those lords who had fought against Tokugawa forces at [[Sekigahara]] (in 1600) and had from that point on been exiled permanently from all powerful positions within the shogunate. The second was to be expressed in the phrase ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (\"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\"). The end for the Bakumatsu was the [[Boshin War]], notably the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]], when pro-shogunate forces were defeated.<ref name=\"LS\">Ravina, Mark (2004).''Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori''.

The Tokugawa and ''daimy\u014d'' ''[[de facto]]'' administered Japan through their system of ''[[Han system|han]]'' (feudal domains) alongside the ''[[de jure]]'' Imperial [[provinces of Japan|provinces]]. The Tokugawa Shogunate saw rapid economic growth and [[urbanization]] in Japan which led to the rise of the [[merchant]] class and ''[[Ukiyo]]'' culture. The Tokugawa Shogunate declined during the ''[[Bakumatsu]]'' (\"Opening of Japan\") period from 1853 and was overthrown by supporters of the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|Imperial Court]] in the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868. The [[Empire of Japan]] was established under the [[Meiji government]] and Tokugawa loyalists continued to fight in the [[Boshin War]] until the defeat of the [[Republic of Ezo]] at the [[Battle of Hakodate]] in June 1869.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Bakumatsu}}\n\nFollowing the [[Sengoku period]] (\"warring states period\"), the central government had been largely re-established by [[Oda Nobunaga]] during the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].<ref name=\"nussbaum978\"/>\n\n[[Edo society|Society in the Tokugawa period]], unlike in previous shogunates, was supposedly based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' (lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of [[samurai]], with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimy\u014d'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimy\u014d'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local rulers. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts that did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants, ranging from simple local disturbances to much larger rebellions. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA 2017 study found that peasant rebellions and collective desertion (\"flight\") lowered tax rates and inhibited state growth in the Tokugawa shogunate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paik|first=Christopher|last2=Steele|first2=Abbey|last3=Tanaka|first3=Seiki|title=Constraining the Samurai: Rebellion and Taxation in Early Modern Japan|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=61|issue=2|pages=352\u2013370|doi=10.1093/isq/sqx008|year=2017|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137080/1/Binder3.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-19th century, an alliance of several of the more powerful ''daimy\u014d'', along with the titular [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], succeeded in overthrowing the shogunate after the [[Boshin War]], culminating in the [[Meiji Restoration]].

The ''bakuhan taisei'' split feudal power between the shogunate in Edo and provincial domains throughout Japan. Provinces had a degree of sovereignty and were allowed an independent administration of the han in exchange for loyalty to the ''sh\u014dgun'', who was responsible for foreign relations and national security. The ''sh\u014dgun'' and lords were all ''daimy\u014ds'': feudal lords with their own bureaucracies, policies, and territories. The ''sh\u014dgun'' also administered the most powerful ''han'', the hereditary fief of the House of Tokugawa. Each level of government administered its own system of [[taxation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Edo P2.jpg|thumb|[[Edo Castle]], 17th century]]\n\nThe emperor, nominally a religious leader, held no real power; this was vested in the ''sh\u014dgun''. The shogunate had the power to discard, annex, and transform domains. The ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' system of alternative residence required each ''daimy\u014d'' to reside in alternate years between the han and the court in Edo. During their absences from Edo, it was also required that they leave family as hostages until their return. The huge expenditure ''sankin-k\u014dtai'' imposed on each han helped centralize aristocratic alliances and ensured loyalty to the ''sh\u014dgun'' as each representative doubled as a potential hostage.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nTokugawa's descendants further ensured loyalty by maintaining a dogmatic insistence on loyalty to the ''sh\u014dgun''. ''[[Fudai daimy\u014d]]'' were hereditary vassals of Ieyasu, as well as of his descendants. ''[[Tozama daimy\u014d|Tozama]]'' (\"outsiders\") became vassals of Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara. ''[[Shinpan]]'' (\"relatives\") were collaterals of Tokugawa Hidetada. Early in the Edo period, the shogunate viewed the ''tozama'' as the least likely to be loyal; over time, strategic marriages and the entrenchment of the system made the ''tozama'' less likely to rebel. In the end, it was the great ''tozama'' of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]], [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Province|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] and [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], and to a lesser extent [[Hizen]], that brought down the shogunate. These four states are called the Four Western Clans, or [[Satchotohi]] for short.<ref>Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA826&dq= \"''Satchotohi''\"], pp. 826\u2013827.</ref>\n\nThe number of ''han'' (roughly 250) fluctuated throughout the Edo period. They were ranked by size, which was measured as the number of ''[[koku]]'' of rice that the domain produced each year. One ''koku'' was the amount of rice necessary to feed one adult male for one year. The minimum number for a ''daimy\u014d'' was ten thousand ''koku''; the largest, apart from the ''sh\u014dgun'', was a million.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Relations with the Emperor===\n\n[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|Social class during the Shogunate with the Emperor as the nominal ruler]]\n\nRegardless of the political title of the Emperor, the ''sh\u014dguns'' of the Tokugawa family controlled Japan.<ref>Jansen 2002, pp. 144\u2013148.</ref> The {{nihongo|administration|\u4f53\u5236|taisei}} of Japan was a task given by the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]] to the Tokugawa family, which returned to the court in the [[Meiji Restoration]]. While the Emperor officially had the prerogative of appointing the ''sh\u014dgun'', he had virtually no say in state affairs. The shogunate appointed a liaison, the ''[[Kyoto Shoshidai]]'' (''Shogun's Representative in Kyoto''), to deal with the Emperor, court and nobility.\n\nTowards the end of the shogunate, however, after centuries of the Emperor having very little say in state affairs and being secluded in his [[Kyoto Imperial Palace|Kyoto palace]], and in the wake of the reigning ''sh\u014dgun'', [[Tokugawa Iemochi]], marrying the sister of [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] (r. 1846\u20131867), in 1862, the Imperial Court in Kyoto began to enjoy increased political influence.<ref>Keene, Donald ''Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852\u20131912'' (2005, Columbia University Press) p. 62</ref> The Emperor would occasionally be consulted on various policies and the shogun even made a visit to Kyoto to visit the Emperor.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Shogun and foreign trade===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Grote partij bij het opperhoofd van Dejima.jpg|thumb|Dutch trading post in [[Dejima]], c. 1805]]\nForeign affairs and trade were monopolized by the ''shogunate'', yielding a huge profit. Foreign trade was also permitted to the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and the [[Tsushima Fuch\u016b Domain|Tsushima domain]]s. [[Rice]] was the main trading product of [[Japan]] during this time. [[Isolationism]] was the foreign policy of Japan and trade was strictly controlled.  Merchants were outsiders to the [[social hierarchy]] of Japan and were thought to be greedy.\n\nThe visits of the [[Nanban trade|Nanban]] ships from [[Portugal]] were at first the main vector of trade exchanges, followed by the addition of Dutch, English and sometimes Spanish ships.\n\nFrom 1603 onward, Japan started to participate actively in foreign trade. In 1615, an embassy and trade mission under [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] was sent across the Pacific to [[Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain) on the Japanese-built galleon [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']]. Until 1635, the Shogun issued numerous permits for the so-called \"[[red seal ships]]\" destined for the Asian trade.\n\nAfter 1635 and the introduction of [[Sakoku|Seclusion laws]], inbound ships were only allowed from [[China]], [[Korea]], and the [[Netherlands]].\n\n===Shogun and Christianity===\n{{Main|Kirishitan}}\n[[File:Christian-Prisoners-Edo-Tokugawa.png|thumb|Christian prisoners in Edo, 17th century]]\nFollowers of [[Christianity]] first began appearing in Japan during the 16th century. [[Oda Nobunaga]] embraced Christianity and the Western technology that was imported with it, such as the musket. He also saw it as a tool he could use to suppress Buddhist forces.<ref>Chie Nakane and Shinzaburou Oishi (1990). ''Tokugawa Japan \u2013 The Social and Economic Antecedents of Modern Japan''. University of Tokyo Press. pp.12.</ref>\n \nThough Christianity was allowed to grow until the 1610s, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] soon began to see it as a growing threat to the stability of the shogunate. As ''\u014cgosho'' (\"Cloistered ''Sh\u014dgun''\"),<ref>Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA738&dq= \"''Ogosho''\"] at p. 738.</ref> he influenced the implementation of laws that banned the practice of Christianity. His successors followed suit, compounding upon Ieyasu's laws. The ban of Christianity is often linked with the creation of the Seclusion laws, or [[Sakoku]], in the 1630s.<ref>Chie Nakane and Shinzaburou Oishi (1990). ''Tokugawa Japan: The Social and Economic Antecedents of Modern Japan''. University of Tokyo Press. pp.24\u201328.</ref>\n\n==Institutions of the shogunate==\n\n===R\u014dj\u016b and wakadoshiyori===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe ''[[r\u014dj\u016b]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u8001\u4e2d}}) were the senior members of the shogunate. They supervised the [[\u014dmetsuke]], [[machi-bugy\u014d]], {{ill|ongokubugy\u014d|ja|\u9060\u56fd\u5949\u884c}} (\u9060\u56fd\u5949\u884c) and other officials, oversaw relations with the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]], [[kuge]] (members of the nobility), daimy\u014d, Buddhist [[temple]]s and [[Shinto shrine]]s, and attended to matters like divisions of [[fief]]s. Normally, four or five men held the office, and one was on duty for a month at a time on a rotating basis. They conferred on especially important matters. In the administrative reforms of 1867 ([[Kei\u014d Reforms]]), the office was eliminated in favor of a bureaucratic system with ministers for the interior, finance, foreign relations, army, and navy.\n\n[[File:SakuradaGate2.jpg|thumb|Sakuradamon Gate of [[Edo Castle]] where [[Ii Naosuke]] was assassinated in 1860]]\nIn principle, the requirements for appointment to the office of r\u014dj\u016b were to be a ''[[fudai daimy\u014d]]'' and to have a fief assessed at {{val|50000}} ''[[koku]]'' or more. However, there were exceptions to both criteria. Many appointees came from the offices close to the ''sh\u014dgun'', such as ''{{ill|soba y\u014dnin|ja|\u5074\u7528\u4eba}}'' (\u5074\u7528\u4eba), [[Kyoto Shoshidai]], and [[Osaka j\u014ddai]].\n\nIrregularly, the ''sh\u014dguns'' appointed a ''r\u014dj\u016b'' to the position of ''[[tair\u014d]]'' (great elder). The office was limited to members of the [[Ii clan|Ii]], [[Sakai clan|Sakai]], [[Doi clan|Doi]], and [[Hotta clan]]s, but [[Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu]] was given the status of tair\u014d as well. Among the most famous was [[Ii Naosuke]], who was assassinated in 1860 outside the Sakuradamon Gate of [[Edo Castle]] ([[Sakuradamon Incident (1860)|Sakuradamon incident]]).\n\nThe ''[[wakadoshiyori]]'' were next in status below the r\u014dj\u016b. An outgrowth of the early six-man ''[[rokuninsh\u016b]]'' (\u516d\u4eba\u8846, 1633\u20131649), the office took its name and final form in 1662, but with four members. Their primary responsibility was management of the affairs of the [[hatamoto]] and [[gokenin]], the direct vassals of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nSome ''sh\u014dguns'' appointed a ''soba y\u014dnin''. This person acted as a liaison between the ''sh\u014dgun'' and the ''r\u014dj\u016b''. The ''soba y\u014dnin'' increased in importance during the time of the fifth ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]], when a wakadoshiyori, [[Inaba Masayasu]], assassinated [[Hotta Masatoshi]], the ''tair\u014d''. Fearing for his personal safety, Tsunayoshi moved the ''r\u014dj\u016b'' to a more distant part of the castle. Some of the most famous ''soba y\u014dnin'' were [[Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu]] and [[Tanuma Okitsugu]].\n\n===\u014cmetsuke and metsuke===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe ''\u014dmetsuke'' and ''[[metsuke]]'' were officials who reported to the ''r\u014dj\u016b'' and ''wakadoshiyori''. The five ''\u014dmetsuke'' were in charge of monitoring the affairs of the ''daimy\u014ds'', ''kuge'' and imperial court. They were in charge of discovering any threat of rebellion. Early in the Edo period, ''daimy\u014ds'' such as [[Yagy\u016b Munefuyu]] held the office. Soon, however, it fell to ''[[hatamoto]]'' with rankings of 5,000 ''koku'' or more. To give them authority in their dealings with ''daimy\u014ds'', they were often ranked at 10,000 ''koku'' and given the title of ''[[Kokushi (official)|kami]]'' (an ancient title, typically signifying the governor of a [[Provinces of Japan|province]]) such as ''Bizen-no-kami''.\n\nAs time progressed, the function of the ''\u014dmetsuke'' evolved into one of passing orders from the shogunate to the ''daimy\u014ds'', and of administering to ceremonies within Edo Castle. They also took on additional responsibilities such as supervising religious affairs and controlling firearms. The ''metsuke'', reporting to the ''wakadoshiyori'', oversaw the affairs of the vassals of the ''sh\u014dgun''. They were the police force for the thousands of hatamoto and [[gokenin]] who were concentrated in Edo. Individual han had their own ''metsuke'' who similarly policed their samurai.\n\n===San-bugy\u014d===\nThe ''san-[[bugy\u014d]]'' (\"three administrators\") were the ''jisha'', ''kanj\u014d'', and ''[[machi-bugy\u014d]]'', which oversaw [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temples]] and [[Shinto shrine|shrines]], accounting, and the cities, respectively. The ''[[jisha-bugy\u014d]]'' had the highest status of the three. They oversaw the administration of Buddhist temples (''ji'') and Shinto shrines (''sha''), many of which held fiefs. Also, they heard lawsuits from several land holdings outside the eight [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] provinces. The appointments normally went to ''daimy\u014ds''; [[\u014coka Tadasuke]] was an exception, though he later became a ''daimy\u014d''.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe ''[[kanj\u014d-bugy\u014d]]'' were next in status. The four holders of this office reported to the ''r\u014dj\u016b''. They were responsible for the finances of the shogunate.<ref>Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA473&dq= \"''Kanj\u014d bugy\u014d''\"] at p. 473.</ref>\n\nThe ''machi-bugy\u014d'' were the chief city administrators of Edo and other cities. Their roles included mayor, chief of the police (and, later, also of the fire department), and judge in criminal and civil matters not involving samurai. Two (briefly, three) men, normally hatamoto, held the office, and alternated by month.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThree Edo ''machi bugy\u014d'' have become famous through ''[[jidaigeki]]'' (period films): [[\u014coka Tadasuke]] and [[T\u014dyama Kagemoto]] (Kinshir\u014d) as heroes, and [[Torii Y\u014dz\u014d]] ([[:ja:\u9ce5\u5c45\u8000\u8535]]) as a villain.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Tenry\u014d, gundai and daikan===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe ''san-bugy\u014d'' together sat on a council called the ''[[hy\u014dj\u014dsho]]''. In this capacity, they were responsible for administering the ''tenry\u014d'', supervising the ''gundai'' ([[:ja:\u90e1\u4ee3|\u90e1\u4ee3]]), the ''daikan'' ([[:ja:\u4ee3\u5b98|\u4ee3\u5b98]]) and the ''kura bugy\u014d'' ([[:ja:\u8535\u5949\u884c|\u8535\u5949\u884c]]), as well as hearing cases involving samurai.\n\nThe shogun directly held lands in various parts of Japan. These were known as ''shihaisho'' (\u652f\u914d\u6240); since the Meiji period, the term ''tenry\u014d'' ([[:ja:\u5929\u9818|\u5929\u9818]], \"Emperor's land\") has become synonymous.<ref>Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA9610&dq= \"''Tenry\u014d''\"], p. 961.</ref> In addition to the territory that Ieyasu held prior to the Battle of Sekigahara, this included lands he gained in that battle and lands gained as a result of the [[Siege of Osaka|Summer and Winter Sieges of Osaka]]. By the end of the seventeenth century, the shogun's landholdings had reached four million koku. Such major cities as Nagasaki and Osaka, and [[mining|mine]]s, including the [[Sado Province|Sado]] [[gold mine]], also fell into this category.\n\n===Gaikoku bugy\u014d===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe ''[[gaikoku bugy\u014d]]'' were administrators appointed between 1858 and 1868. They were charged with overseeing trade and diplomatic relations with foreign countries, and were based in the [[treaty ports]] of Nagasaki and Kanagawa (Yokohama).\n\n==Late Tokugawa shogunate (1853\u20131867)==\n{{main|Bakumatsu}}\n[[File:Satsuma-samurai-during-boshin-war-period.jpg|thumb|[[Samurai]] of the [[Shimazu clan]]]]\nThe late Tokugawa shogunate ({{lang-ja|\u5e55\u672b}} ''Bakumatsu'') was the period between 1853 and 1867, during which Japan ended its [[isolationist foreign policy]] called ''[[sakoku]]'' and modernized from a [[feudal]] shogunate to the [[Meiji period|Meiji government]]. It is at the end of the [[Edo period]] and preceded the Meiji era. The major ideological and political factions during this period were divided into the pro-imperialist ''[[Ishin Shishi]]'' ([[nationalist]] [[Patriotism|patriots]]) and the shogunate forces, including the elite [[shinsengumi]] (\"newly selected corps\") swordsmen.\n\nAlthough these two groups were the most visible powers, many other factions attempted to use the chaos of the Bakumatsu era to seize personal power.<ref name=\"SHINSENGUMI\">Shinsengumi, The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps, Romulus, Hillsborough, Tuttle Publishing, 2005</ref> Furthermore, there were two other main driving forces for dissent; first, growing resentment of ''[[tozama daimy\u014d]]s'', and second, growing [[anti-Western sentiment]] following the arrival of [[Matthew C. Perry]]. The first related to those lords who had fought against Tokugawa forces at [[Sekigahara]] (in 1600) and had from that point on been exiled permanently from all powerful positions within the shogunate. The second was to be expressed in the phrase ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (\"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\"). The end for the Bakumatsu was the [[Boshin War]], notably the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]], when pro-shogunate forces were defeated.<ref name=\"LS\">Ravina, Mark (2004).''Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori''.
