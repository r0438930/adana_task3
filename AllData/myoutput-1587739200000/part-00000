The common themes among them identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the means of production and that capitalist social relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism. In ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' (1880), [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself, but rather would be the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and communication by the [[Capitalist state|bourgeois state]].

''Imperialism and World Economy''. London: Merlin. p. 158</ref>\n\nAfter the October Revolution, Lenin used the term positively. In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of [[war communism]] and again during the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] to further central control and develop the productive forces: <blockquote>Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward.

For example, the prominent anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] in an article from 1935 titled \"There Is No Communism in Russia\" said of the Soviet Union: <blockquote>Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revoltlib.com/?id=649|title=There Is No Communism in Russia|author=Emma Goldman|date=1935|work=RevoltLib}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen speaking about [[Marxism]], [[Murray Bookchin]] said the following: <blockquote>Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement \u2014 notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described 'socialism' as 'nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people'.

At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. At worse, these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionH5#sech510|title=An Anarchist FAQ - H.5 What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?

One major tendency of the [[Left communism#Russian left communism|1918 Russian communist left]] criticised the re-employment of [[authoritarian]] capitalist relations and methods of production. \n\nAs [[Valerian Osinsky]] in particular argued, \"one-man management\" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/brinton/1970/workers-control/02.htm|title=The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control: The State and Counter-Revolution|author=Maurice Brinton|date=1970|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref> and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production \u2014 [[Taylorism]] converted workers into the appendages of machines and [[piece work]] imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling [[petty bourgeois]] values into workers. \n\nIn sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. This tendency within the 1918 Left Communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of [[Marx's critique of alienation]].<ref>Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967. 'Soviet state capitalism? The history of an idea', ''Survey'' 62, January, pp. 58-71.</ref>\n\nThese criticisms were revived on the left of the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)|Russian Communist Party]] after the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Congress]] in 1921, which introduced the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP). Many members of the [[Workers' Opposition]] and the [[Decists]] (both later banned) and two new underground Left Communist groups, [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class.<ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\"/><ref>EH Carr, ''The Interregnum 1923-1924'', London, 1954, p80</ref> The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.<ref>Marshall Shatz {{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |title=\"Makhaevism after Machajski\" |accessdate=2014-04-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132629/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mensheviks and orthodox Marxists ===\n{{Marxism}}\nImmediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, [[Karl Kautsky]] said: {{quote|It is only the old feudal large landed property which exists no longer. Conditions in Russia were ripe for its abolition but they were not ripe for the abolition of capitalism. Capitalism is now once again celebrating a resurrection, but in forms that are more oppressive and harrowing for the proletariat than of old. \n\nInstead of assuming higher industrialised forms, private capitalism has assumed the most wretched and shabby forms of black marketeering and money speculation. Industrial capitalism has developed to become state capitalism. Formerly state officials and officials from private capital were critical, often very hostile towards each other. \n\nConsequently the working man found that his advantage lay with one or the other in turn. Today the state bureaucracy and capitalist bureaucracy are merged into one\u2014that is the upshot of the great socialist revolution brought about by the Bolsheviks. It constitutes the most oppressive of all despotisms that Russia has ever had to suffer.<ref>Kautsky, K. 1919 [1983]. Terrorism and Communism. Cited from P.

King]</ref>}}\n\nAfter 1929, exiled [[Mensheviks]] such as [[Fyodor Dan]] began to argue that Stalin's Russia constituted a state capitalist society.<ref>Liebich, A. 1987. 'Marxism and totalitarianism: Rudolf Hilferding and the Mensheviks', ''Dissent'' 34, Spring, pp. 223-40</ref> In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the [[Catholic Church]]'s.<ref>State capitalism: the wages system under new management / Adam Buick and John Crump. Basingstoke : Macmillan, 1986. {{ISBN|0-333-36775-8}}</ref> As John O'Neill notes: {{quote| Whatever other merits or problems their theories had, in arguing that the Russian revolution was from the outset a capitalist revolution they avoided the ad hoc and post hoc nature of more recent Maoist- and Trotskyist-inspired accounts of state capitalism, which start from the assumption that the Bolshevik revolution inaugurated a socialist economy that at some later stage degenerated into capitalism.<ref>STATE CAPITALISM - THE WAGES SYSTEM UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT - BUICK, A, CRUMP, J; ONEILL, J; POLITICAL QUARTERLY 59 (3): 398-399 JUL-SEP 1988</ref>}}\n\nWriting in the Menshevik journal ''Socialist Courier'' on 25 April 25, [[Rudolf Hilferding]] rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that as practiced in the Soviet Union it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital.

After [[World War II]], [[Orthodox Trotskyism|most Trotskyists]] accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being [[deformed workers' states]]. However, alternative opinions of the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a [[New Class]] theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, [[Cuba]], [[China]] and other self-proclaimed [[socialist states]].\n\nThe discussion goes back to internal debates in the [[Left Opposition]] during the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Ante Ciliga]], a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many Left Oppositionists to a theory of state capitalism influenced by [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers Group and other Left Communist factions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ante|last=Ciliga|title=Au pays du grand mensonge|year=1938}}</ref><ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\">{{cite web|first=Michael S.|last=Fox|url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |title=Ante Ciliga, Trotskii and State Capitalism: Theory, Tactics and Reevaluation during the Purge Era, 1935-1939 |accessdate=2009-10-27 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132653/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Philippe Bourrinet, \"[http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/ciliga.htm An Ambiguous Journey]\"</ref> \n\nOn release and returning to activity in the [[International Left Opposition]], Ciliga \"was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles\".<ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\" /> [[George Orwell]], who was an [[anti-Stalinist left]]ist like Ciliga, used the term in his ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).\n\nAfter 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the [[Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency]] of [[C. L. R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]s alongside readings of Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|early humanist writings]]. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWA0AAAAIAAJ&q= ''State-capitalism and World Revolution by Johnson-Forest''], Socialist Workers Party, 1950.</ref> \n\nAnother is that of [[Tony Cliff]], associated with the [[International Socialist Tendency]] and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones.<ref>Aufheben [http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 Cliff and the [[neo-Trotskyist]] theory of the USSR as state capitalist] in What Was The USSR?</ref> A relatively recent text by [[Stephen Resnick]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]], ''Class Theory and History'', explores what they term state capitalism in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.\n\nOther left-wing theories regarding Soviet-style societies include [[bureaucratic collectivism]], [[deformed workers' state]]s, [[degenerated workers' state]]s and [[new class]].\n\n=== Use by later left communists and council communists ===\nThe [[left communist]] and [[council communist]] traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist. [[Otto R\u00fchle]], a major German left communist, developed this idea from the 1920s and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist [[Anton Pannekoek]], for instance in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm \"State Capitalism and Dictatorship\"] (1936).\n\n=== Use by Maoists and anti-revisionists ===\nFrom 1956 to the late 1970s, the [[Communist Party of China]] and their [[Maoist]] or [[anti-revisionist]] adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled \"socialist\" states.<ref>[http://www.mltranslations.org/Ireland/ico.htm ''The Economics of Revisionism''] by the Irish Communist Organisation, 1967.</ref> This was involved in the ideological [[Sino-Soviet Split]].\n\nAfter [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, amidst the supporters of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]], most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the Communist Party of China which likewise distanced itself from these former [[Fraternal party|fraternal]] groups. The related theory of [[Hoxhaism]] was developed in 1978, largely by [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Socialist Albanian]] President [[Enver Hoxha]], who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] economic policies.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm ''Imperialism and the Revolution''] by Enver Hoxha, 1978.</ref>\n\nMost current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being state capitalist from a certain point in their history onwards\u2014most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and anti-revisionists also sometimes use the term [[social imperialism]] to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence\u2014their phrase, \"socialist in words, imperialist in deeds\" denotes this.\n\n== Use by liberal economists ==\n{{economic liberalism sidebar}}\n[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|Murray Rothbard advanced a [[right-libertarian]] analysis of state capitalism]]\n[[Murray Rothbard]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] philosopher, uses the term interchangeably with the term [[state monopoly capitalism]] and uses it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|first = Murray|last = Rothbard|authorlink = Murray Rothbard|contribution = A Future of Peace and Capitalism|editor = James H.

The explanation why is given by the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who states: <blockquote>The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism \u2014 until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name. The most recent slogan is \"State Capitalism.\" It is not commonly realized that this covers nothing more than what used to be called Planned Economy and State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, Planned Economy, and State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the \"classic\" ideal of egalitarian Socialism.<ref>{{cite book|first = Ludwig|last = Von Mises|authorlink = Ludwig Von Mises|title = Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis|publisher = LibertyClassics|place = Indianapolis|year = 1979|isbn = 0-913966-63-0|url = https://archive.org/details/socialismeconomi00vonm|accessdate = 31 May 2007|url-access = registration}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Use by Italian Fascists ==\n[[File:Mussolini biografia.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Benito Mussolini]] claimed that the modern phase of capitalism is [[state socialism]] \"turned on its head\"]]\nOn economic issues, [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]] claimed in 1933 that were Fascism to follow the modern phase of capitalism, its path would \"lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head.

An example of this would be the [[military\u2013industrial complex]] in which autonomous [[entrepreneurial]] firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets.\n\nBoth the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who in his book ''Imperialism and World Economy'' thought that advanced, [[imperialist]] countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.\n\nState capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for [[national security]]. These may involve private investment as well. For example, a government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include [[Neste]], [[Equinor]] and [[OMV]].\n\nThere are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite's political power, which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism's [[creative destruction]], of the threat of revolution and of any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill equipped to inspire innovation.\n\n== In European studies ==\nSeveral European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the [[European Union]]. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on ''The Futures of European Capitalism'', in which she divides modern European capitalism in three groups, namely market, managed and state. Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-[[corporatist]] model. \n\nThe author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism.<ref>{{cite book|first = Vivien|last = Schmidt|authorlink = Vivien A.

London: Routledge.</ref>\n\n== State monopoly capitalism ==\nThe theory of [[state monopoly capitalism]] was initially a [[neo-Stalinist]] doctrine popularised after [[World War II]]. Lenin had claimed in 1916 that [[World War I]] had transformed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism into [[monopoly capitalism]], but he did not publish any extensive theory about the topic. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or [[Oligopoly|oligopolistic]] businesses from competition by smaller firms.<ref>Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought</ref> \n\nThe main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]] position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial [[oligarchy]] or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership.\n\nState monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin's definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in [[neo-Trotskyist]] theories of state capitalism as well as in [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.\n\n=== Political implications ===\n{{quote|Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries.| [[Che Guevara]], 1965<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/02/24.htm At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria] by Che Guevara, Delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria - on February 24, 1965</ref>}}\nThe strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a people's democratic alliance under the leadership of the communist party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called monopoly for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the anti-monopoly alliance.\n\n=== Neo-Trotskyist theory ===\nIn neo-Trotskyist theory, such an alliance was rejected as being based either on a false strategy of [[popular front]]s, or on political [[opportunism]], said to be incompatible either with a [[permanent revolution]] or with the principle of independent [[working class]] political action.\n\nThe [[State (polity)|state]] in Soviet-type societies was redefined by the neo-Trotskyists as being also state-monopoly capitalist. There was no difference between the West and the East in this regard. Consequently, some kind of anti-bureaucratic revolution was said to be required, but different Trotskyist groups quarreled about what form such a revolution would need to take, or could take.\n\nSome Trotskyists believed the anti-bureaucratic revolution would happen spontaneously, inevitably and naturally, others believed it needed to be organised\u2014the aim being to establish a society owned and operated by the working class. According to the neo-Trotskyists, the communist party could not play its leading role because it did not represent the interests of the working class.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nWhen Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that \"under capitalism anarchy of production reigns\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/works/1949/varga.htm The Case of Eugene Varga] Raya Dunayevskaya 1949</ref>\n\nCritics of the stamocap theory (e.g. [[Ernest Mandel]] and [[Leo Kofler]]) claimed the following:\n* Stamocap theory wrongly implied that the state could somehow overrule inter-capitalist [[competition]], the laws of motion of capitalism and market forces generally, supposedly cancelling out the operation of the [[law of value]]. \n* Stamocap theory lacked any sophisticated account of the class basis of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the real linkages between governments and elites. It postulated a monolithic structure of [[wikt:domination|domination]] which in reality did not exist in that way.\n* Stamocap theory failed to explain the rise of [[neoliberal]] ideology in the business class, which claims precisely that an important social goal should be a reduction of the state's influence in the economy. \n* Stamocap theory failed to show clearly what the difference was between a socialist state and a bourgeois state, except that in a socialist state the communist party, or rather its central committee, played the leading political role. In that case, the class-content of the state itself was defined purely in terms of the policy of the ruling political party or its central committee.\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n* ''[[WALL-E]]'' has the \"Buy n' Large\" corporation, which acted as the ''[[de facto]]'' and possibly ''[[de jure]]'' government in the decades before and after the evacuation of Earth.\n* The Druuge, an alien race in ''[[Star Control]]'', are governed by the Crimson Corporation which owns the Druuge home planet and everything on it. All Druuge are employees and/or shareholders of this corporation and Druuge who lose their jobs are immediately executed for stealing the planet's air, owned by the company, by breathing it.\n\n== Current forms in the 21st century ==\nState capitalism is distinguished from capitalist [[mixed economies]] where the state [[State interventionism|intervenes]] in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates [[business]]es for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed-market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as [[corporation]]s, companies or business enterprises.\n\n=== Mainland China ===\nMany analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century.<ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives], by Vahan Janjigian, forbes.com, Mar. 22 2010.</ref><ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/gadyepstein/2010/08/31/the-winners-and-losers-in-chinese-capitalism/ The Winners And Losers In Chinese Capitalism], by Gady Epstein, forbes.com, Aug. 31 2010.</ref><ref>''The Economist'' (2012). \"State Capitalism: The Visible Hand\".

They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power.\n\nIn his article \"We're All State Capitalists Now\", British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at [[Harvard University]] [[Niall Ferguson]] warns against \"an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into 'market capitalist' and 'state capitalist' camps.

The common themes among them identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the means of production and that capitalist social relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism. In ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' (1880), [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself, but rather would be the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and communication by the [[Capitalist state|bourgeois state]].

In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of [[war communism]] and again during the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] to further central control and develop the productive forces: <blockquote>Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward.

For example, the prominent anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] in an article from 1935 titled \"There Is No Communism in Russia\" said of the Soviet Union: <blockquote>Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revoltlib.com/?id=649|title=There Is No Communism in Russia|author=Emma Goldman|date=1935|work=RevoltLib}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen speaking about [[Marxism]], [[Murray Bookchin]] said the following: <blockquote>Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement \u2014 notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described 'socialism' as 'nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people'.

At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. At worse, these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionH5#sech510|title=An Anarchist FAQ - H.5 What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?

One major tendency of the [[Left communism#Russian left communism|1918 Russian communist left]] criticised the re-employment of [[authoritarian]] capitalist relations and methods of production. \n\nAs [[Valerian Osinsky]] in particular argued, \"one-man management\" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/brinton/1970/workers-control/02.htm|title=The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control: The State and Counter-Revolution|author=Maurice Brinton|date=1970|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref> and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production \u2014 [[Taylorism]] converted workers into the appendages of machines and [[piece work]] imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling [[petty bourgeois]] values into workers. \n\nIn sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. This tendency within the 1918 Left Communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of [[Marx's critique of alienation]].<ref>Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967.

Many members of the [[Workers' Opposition]] and the [[Decists]] (both later banned) and two new underground Left Communist groups, [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class.<ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\"/><ref>EH Carr, ''The Interregnum 1923-1924'', London, 1954, p80</ref> The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.<ref>Marshall Shatz {{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |title=\"Makhaevism after Machajski\" |accessdate=2014-04-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132629/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mensheviks and orthodox Marxists ===\n{{Marxism}}\nImmediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, [[Karl Kautsky]] said: {{quote|It is only the old feudal large landed property which exists no longer. Conditions in Russia were ripe for its abolition but they were not ripe for the abolition of capitalism. Capitalism is now once again celebrating a resurrection, but in forms that are more oppressive and harrowing for the proletariat than of old. \n\nInstead of assuming higher industrialised forms, private capitalism has assumed the most wretched and shabby forms of black marketeering and money speculation. Industrial capitalism has developed to become state capitalism. Formerly state officials and officials from private capital were critical, often very hostile towards each other. \n\nConsequently the working man found that his advantage lay with one or the other in turn. Today the state bureaucracy and capitalist bureaucracy are merged into one\u2014that is the upshot of the great socialist revolution brought about by the Bolsheviks. It constitutes the most oppressive of all despotisms that Russia has ever had to suffer.<ref>Kautsky, K. 1919 [1983]. Terrorism and Communism. Cited from P.

'Marxism and totalitarianism: Rudolf Hilferding and the Mensheviks', ''Dissent'' 34, Spring, pp. 223-40</ref> In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the [[Catholic Church]]'s.<ref>State capitalism: the wages system under new management / Adam Buick and John Crump. Basingstoke : Macmillan, 1986. {{ISBN|0-333-36775-8}}</ref> As John O'Neill notes: {{quote| Whatever other merits or problems their theories had, in arguing that the Russian revolution was from the outset a capitalist revolution they avoided the ad hoc and post hoc nature of more recent Maoist- and Trotskyist-inspired accounts of state capitalism, which start from the assumption that the Bolshevik revolution inaugurated a socialist economy that at some later stage degenerated into capitalism.<ref>STATE CAPITALISM - THE WAGES SYSTEM UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT - BUICK, A, CRUMP, J; ONEILL, J; POLITICAL QUARTERLY 59 (3): 398-399 JUL-SEP 1988</ref>}}\n\nWriting in the Menshevik journal ''Socialist Courier'' on 25 April 25, [[Rudolf Hilferding]] rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that as practiced in the Soviet Union it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital.

After [[World War II]], [[Orthodox Trotskyism|most Trotskyists]] accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being [[deformed workers' states]]. However, alternative opinions of the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a [[New Class]] theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, [[Cuba]], [[China]] and other self-proclaimed [[socialist states]].\n\nThe discussion goes back to internal debates in the [[Left Opposition]] during the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Ante Ciliga]], a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many Left Oppositionists to a theory of state capitalism influenced by [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers Group and other Left Communist factions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ante|last=Ciliga|title=Au pays du grand mensonge|year=1938}}</ref><ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\">{{cite web|first=Michael S.|last=Fox|url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |title=Ante Ciliga, Trotskii and State Capitalism: Theory, Tactics and Reevaluation during the Purge Era, 1935-1939 |accessdate=2009-10-27 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132653/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Philippe Bourrinet, \"[http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/ciliga.htm An Ambiguous Journey]\"</ref> \n\nOn release and returning to activity in the [[International Left Opposition]], Ciliga \"was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles\".<ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\" /> [[George Orwell]], who was an [[anti-Stalinist left]]ist like Ciliga, used the term in his ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).\n\nAfter 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the [[Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency]] of [[C. L. R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]s alongside readings of Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|early humanist writings]]. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWA0AAAAIAAJ&q= ''State-capitalism and World Revolution by Johnson-Forest''], Socialist Workers Party, 1950.</ref> \n\nAnother is that of [[Tony Cliff]], associated with the [[International Socialist Tendency]] and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones.<ref>Aufheben [http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 Cliff and the [[neo-Trotskyist]] theory of the USSR as state capitalist] in What Was The USSR?</ref> A relatively recent text by [[Stephen Resnick]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]], ''Class Theory and History'', explores what they term state capitalism in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.\n\nOther left-wing theories regarding Soviet-style societies include [[bureaucratic collectivism]], [[deformed workers' state]]s, [[degenerated workers' state]]s and [[new class]].\n\n=== Use by later left communists and council communists ===\nThe [[left communist]] and [[council communist]] traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist. [[Otto R\u00fchle]], a major German left communist, developed this idea from the 1920s and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist [[Anton Pannekoek]], for instance in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm \"State Capitalism and Dictatorship\"] (1936).\n\n=== Use by Maoists and anti-revisionists ===\nFrom 1956 to the late 1970s, the [[Communist Party of China]] and their [[Maoist]] or [[anti-revisionist]] adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled \"socialist\" states.<ref>[http://www.mltranslations.org/Ireland/ico.htm ''The Economics of Revisionism''] by the Irish Communist Organisation, 1967.</ref> This was involved in the ideological [[Sino-Soviet Split]].\n\nAfter [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, amidst the supporters of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]], most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the Communist Party of China which likewise distanced itself from these former [[Fraternal party|fraternal]] groups. The related theory of [[Hoxhaism]] was developed in 1978, largely by [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Socialist Albanian]] President [[Enver Hoxha]], who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] economic policies.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm ''Imperialism and the Revolution''] by Enver Hoxha, 1978.</ref>\n\nMost current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being state capitalist from a certain point in their history onwards\u2014most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and anti-revisionists also sometimes use the term [[social imperialism]] to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence\u2014their phrase, \"socialist in words, imperialist in deeds\" denotes this.\n\n== Use by liberal economists ==\n{{economic liberalism sidebar}}\n[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|Murray Rothbard advanced a [[right-libertarian]] analysis of state capitalism]]\n[[Murray Rothbard]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] philosopher, uses the term interchangeably with the term [[state monopoly capitalism]] and uses it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|first = Murray|last = Rothbard|authorlink = Murray Rothbard|contribution = A Future of Peace and Capitalism|editor = James H.

This usage dates from the 1960s, when [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] described the post-New Deal economy of the United States as \"state capitalism\". More recently, [[Andrei Illarionov]], former economic adviser to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], resigned in December 2005, protesting Russia's \"embracement of state capitalism\".<ref>{{cite news | last = Andrei | first = Illarionov | authorlink = Andrei Illarionov | title = When the state means business | work = International Herald and Tribune| date = 2006-01-25| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/25/opinion/edandrei.php}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the term is not used by [[classical liberals]] to describe the public ownership of the means of production. The explanation why is given by the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who states: <blockquote>The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism \u2014 until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name. The most recent slogan is \"State Capitalism.\" It is not commonly realized that this covers nothing more than what used to be called Planned Economy and State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, Planned Economy, and State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the \"classic\" ideal of egalitarian Socialism.<ref>{{cite book|first = Ludwig|last = Von Mises|authorlink = Ludwig Von Mises|title = Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis|publisher = LibertyClassics|place = Indianapolis|year = 1979|isbn = 0-913966-63-0|url = https://archive.org/details/socialismeconomi00vonm|accessdate = 31 May 2007|url-access = registration}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Use by Italian Fascists ==\n[[File:Mussolini biografia.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Benito Mussolini]] claimed that the modern phase of capitalism is [[state socialism]] \"turned on its head\"]]\nOn economic issues, [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]] claimed in 1933 that were Fascism to follow the modern phase of capitalism, its path would \"lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head.

An example of this would be the [[military\u2013industrial complex]] in which autonomous [[entrepreneurial]] firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets.\n\nBoth the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who in his book ''Imperialism and World Economy'' thought that advanced, [[imperialist]] countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.\n\nState capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for [[national security]]. These may involve private investment as well. For example, a government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include [[Neste]], [[Equinor]] and [[OMV]].\n\nThere are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite's political power, which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism's [[creative destruction]], of the threat of revolution and of any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill equipped to inspire innovation.\n\n== In European studies ==\nSeveral European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the [[European Union]]. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on ''The Futures of European Capitalism'', in which she divides modern European capitalism in three groups, namely market, managed and state. Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-[[corporatist]] model. \n\nThe author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism.<ref>{{cite book|first = Vivien|last = Schmidt|authorlink = Vivien A.

Wolff]] and [[Stephen Resnick]] identify state capitalism as the dominant class system throughout the history of the Soviet Union.<ref>Resnick, Stephen & Wolff, Richard (2002) Class Theory and History: Capitalism and Communism in the U.S.S.R. London: Routledge.</ref>\n\n== State monopoly capitalism ==\nThe theory of [[state monopoly capitalism]] was initially a [[neo-Stalinist]] doctrine popularised after [[World War II]]. Lenin had claimed in 1916 that [[World War I]] had transformed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism into [[monopoly capitalism]], but he did not publish any extensive theory about the topic. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or [[Oligopoly|oligopolistic]] businesses from competition by smaller firms.<ref>Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought</ref> \n\nThe main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]] position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial [[oligarchy]] or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership.\n\nState monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin's definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in [[neo-Trotskyist]] theories of state capitalism as well as in [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.\n\n=== Political implications ===\n{{quote|Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries.| [[Che Guevara]], 1965<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/02/24.htm At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria] by Che Guevara, Delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria - on February 24, 1965</ref>}}\nThe strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a people's democratic alliance under the leadership of the communist party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called monopoly for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the anti-monopoly alliance.\n\n=== Neo-Trotskyist theory ===\nIn neo-Trotskyist theory, such an alliance was rejected as being based either on a false strategy of [[popular front]]s, or on political [[opportunism]], said to be incompatible either with a [[permanent revolution]] or with the principle of independent [[working class]] political action.\n\nThe [[State (polity)|state]] in Soviet-type societies was redefined by the neo-Trotskyists as being also state-monopoly capitalist. There was no difference between the West and the East in this regard. Consequently, some kind of anti-bureaucratic revolution was said to be required, but different Trotskyist groups quarreled about what form such a revolution would need to take, or could take.\n\nSome Trotskyists believed the anti-bureaucratic revolution would happen spontaneously, inevitably and naturally, others believed it needed to be organised\u2014the aim being to establish a society owned and operated by the working class. According to the neo-Trotskyists, the communist party could not play its leading role because it did not represent the interests of the working class.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nWhen Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that \"under capitalism anarchy of production reigns\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/works/1949/varga.htm The Case of Eugene Varga] Raya Dunayevskaya 1949</ref>\n\nCritics of the stamocap theory (e.g. [[Ernest Mandel]] and [[Leo Kofler]]) claimed the following:\n* Stamocap theory wrongly implied that the state could somehow overrule inter-capitalist [[competition]], the laws of motion of capitalism and market forces generally, supposedly cancelling out the operation of the [[law of value]]. \n* Stamocap theory lacked any sophisticated account of the class basis of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the real linkages between governments and elites. It postulated a monolithic structure of [[wikt:domination|domination]] which in reality did not exist in that way.\n* Stamocap theory failed to explain the rise of [[neoliberal]] ideology in the business class, which claims precisely that an important social goal should be a reduction of the state's influence in the economy. \n* Stamocap theory failed to show clearly what the difference was between a socialist state and a bourgeois state, except that in a socialist state the communist party, or rather its central committee, played the leading political role. In that case, the class-content of the state itself was defined purely in terms of the policy of the ruling political party or its central committee.\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n* ''[[WALL-E]]'' has the \"Buy n' Large\" corporation, which acted as the ''[[de facto]]'' and possibly ''[[de jure]]'' government in the decades before and after the evacuation of Earth.\n* The Druuge, an alien race in ''[[Star Control]]'', are governed by the Crimson Corporation which owns the Druuge home planet and everything on it. All Druuge are employees and/or shareholders of this corporation and Druuge who lose their jobs are immediately executed for stealing the planet's air, owned by the company, by breathing it.\n\n== Current forms in the 21st century ==\nState capitalism is distinguished from capitalist [[mixed economies]] where the state [[State interventionism|intervenes]] in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates [[business]]es for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed-market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as [[corporation]]s, companies or business enterprises.\n\n=== Mainland China ===\nMany analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century.<ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives], by Vahan Janjigian, forbes.com, Mar. 22 2010.</ref><ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/gadyepstein/2010/08/31/the-winners-and-losers-in-chinese-capitalism/ The Winners And Losers In Chinese Capitalism], by Gady Epstein, forbes.com, Aug. 31 2010.</ref><ref>''The Economist'' (2012). \"State Capitalism: The Visible Hand\".

They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power.\n\nIn his article \"We're All State Capitalists Now\", British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at [[Harvard University]] [[Niall Ferguson]] warns against \"an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into 'market capitalist' and 'state capitalist' camps.
