Episodes regularly featured music by Danny Thomas, guest stars and occasionally other cast members as part of the plot.\n\nIn March 1953, [[Danny Thomas]] first signed the contract for the show with ABC and chose [[Desilu Productions|Desilu Studios]] to film it using its [[Multiple-camera setup|three-camera method]].<ref name=andrews>''The I Love Lucy Book'' by Bart Andrews (revised and updated Broadway Books trade paperback edition, 2001), {{ISBN|0-385-19033-6}}, p. 116</ref> Two proposed titles during preproduction were ''The Children's Hour''<ref>{{cite book |title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History |url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein |url-access=registration |last=Weiner |first=Ed |author2=Editors of TV Guide  |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096914-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein/page/173 173] }}</ref> and ''Here Comes Daddy''.<ref name=\"andrews\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Danny thomas sherry jackson.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Thomas with television daughter Terry ([[Sherry Jackson]])]]\nThomas played the role of Danny Williams, a successful comedian and nightclub entertainer at the Copa Club, based on the iconic New York City nightclub the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. [[Jean Hagen]] played his serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson, and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show's premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with his family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on her own. She often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved her family. \n\n[[Louise Beavers]] made several appearances during this era as the Williams' maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple's arguments. [[Nana Bryant]] often appeared as Margaret's kind mother, of whom Danny and the children were fond, but Margaret, who had been raised by her aunt and uncle because of her mother often being away on stage tours, was not as warm to her mother. (Bryant died in late 1955, and rather than the character being recast, she simply disappeared. When Louise Beavers became ill in 1955, [[Amanda Randolph]] assumed the role of Louise.)\n\n===Series changes===\nFor its first four years,\"Make Room For Daddy\"on ABC (retitled \"The Danny Thomas Show\"starting in the Fall of 1957 on CBS) garnered decent ratings, but failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. Shortly after the third season finished filming, Jean Hagen left the show over dissatisfaction with her role and frequent clashes with Danny Thomas. Thomas was upset with her for leaving, and felt the show would not last without her. However, he decided to push on. At the start of the fourth season, Both Thomas and producer [[Sheldon Leonard]] were faced with a serious dilemma\u2014how to explain Hagen's absence. To have \"Danny\" and \"Margaret\" divorce in that era would have been unacceptable to television audiences, so it was explained that Margaret had died suddenly off-screen. It was a risky move because until this time, no character on a TV situation comedy had died.\n\nDanny now was a widower juggling a performing career while raising two children on his own. He had Louise and his friends often looking after the children while he was touring. He decided to move them to a boarding school, but later relented and the family moved into a new apartment. During the fourth season, Danny dated a few other women and nearly got engaged to a widowed singer until he found out she did not like children. By season's end, the ratings had suffered and it was decided that a wife and mother was needed to complete the family unit.\n\nIn a four-part story arc that began airing in April 1957, son Rusty fell ill with the [[measles]] and Danny hired Kathy O'Hara ([[Marjorie Lord]]), a young Irish nurse, to look after him. Kathy was a widow with a little girl (played by Lelani Sorenson). Danny and Kathy became fast friends and, not surprisingly, Danny quickly fell in love with her, as did the kids. In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series, which proved to be fortunate. In the spring of 1957, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling the series, CBS picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.\n\nThe show, now titled \"The Danny Thomas Show\" made its CBS debut on Monday, October 7, 1957 at 9:00 inheriting the time slot vacated by ''I Love Lucy''. The fifth-season premiere episode, \"Lose Me In Las Vegas,\" had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy's daughter. Lelani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show's ratings dramatically increased.<ref>[http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm ClassicTVHits.com TV Ratings: 1957-1958]</ref> At the end of its fifth season, ''The Danny Thomas Show'' posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.\n\nIn the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14\u201316.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.\n\nIn the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Danny Thomas Jean Hagen Make Room for Daddy 1953.JPG|thumb|150px|Danny and Margaret Williams]]\n[[File:Milton berle angela cartright rusty hamer.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Milton Berle]] spends some time with Linda and Rusty after  Danny and he quit show business.]]\n* [[Danny Thomas]] as Danny Williams\n* [[Jean Hagen]] as Margaret Williams (1953&ndash;1956)\n* [[Marjorie Lord]] as Kathy \"Clancey\" O'Hara Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Rusty Hamer]] as Rusty Williams\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sherry Jackson]] as Terry Williams (1953&ndash;1958)\n* Penney Parker as Terry Williams (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Louise (1953&ndash;1955)\n* [[Amanda Randolph]] as Louise (1955&ndash;1964)\n\n===Supporting===\n[[File:Danny Thomas show hans conried 1964.jpg|thumb|150px|Uncle Tonoose (Hans Conried) gets a lecture from his older brother, Tufik (played by Danny Thomas).]]\nThe supporting cast included:\n* [[Sid Melton]] as Charlie Halper\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as Bunny Halper (1961&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sheldon Leonard]] as Phil Brokaw (1957&ndash;1961)\n* [[Ben Lessy]] as Benny (1953&ndash;1959)\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Liz O'Neal (1955&ndash;1957)\n* [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]] as Pat Hannigan (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] as Jesse Leeds (1953&ndash;1957)\n\n===Notable guest stars===\n[[Hans Conried]] had frequent guest appearances as Danny's eccentric [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] \"Uncle Tonoose\".

Other notable guest stars included band leader and musician [[Harry James]], who appeared in the episode \"The Trumpet Player\", child pianist [[Ginny Tiu]] playing Li Chow in \"The Chinese Doll\" and the legendary [[Jimmy Durante]], who appeared as himself in the episode \"Danny and Durante\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Danny Thomas Show episodes}}\n{{:List of The Danny Thomas Show episodes}}\n\n==Theme song==\nThe theme music was various versions (changing over the years) of the traditional Irish song, \"[[Danny Boy]]\".\n\n==Spin-off and crossovers==\nThe series was responsible for the creation of another long-running sitcom, ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. In the seventh season, Danny Thomas is arrested by [[Sheriff Andy Taylor]] (Andy Griffith) and detained in the small town of [[Mayberry]] in an episode titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\". The episode aired on February 15, 1960, and ''The Andy Griffith Show'' premiered later that year on October 3.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639971/ ''The Danny Thomas Show'', \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\"]</ref>\n\nThe series also [[Fictional crossover|crossed over]] to several other series, including ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''<ref>[http://www.poobala.com/lucyanddanny.html ''The Danny Thomas Show/Make Room For Daddy and I Love Lucy/The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour'']</ref> and ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0616273/ ''The Joey Bishop Show'',\"This Is Your Life\"]</ref>\n\n[[Morey Amsterdam]] guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' in the episode \"The Women Behind the Jokes\".\n\nSome episodes featured [[Bill Dana]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez (character)|Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez]], which led to the spin-off series ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''. Danny Thomas played himself in one episode.\n\n==Sequel==\n[[File:Make Room for Granddaddy cast 1970.JPG|thumb|180px|The cast for ''Make Room for Granddaddy'']]\n[[File:Diana Ross Roosevelt Grier Danny Thomas Make Room for Granddaddy 1971.JPG|thumb|180px|Guest star [[Diana Ross]] with Roosevelt Grier and Thomas in 1971]]\n\nThe show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.\n\nABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>\n<!-- \n===Episode list for ''Make Room for Granddaddy''===\n# \"Make Room for Grandson\" / 1970.09.23\n# \"The Return of Barney Shaker\" / 1970.09.30\n# \"This Granddaddy Is Rated X\" / 1970.10.07\n# \"'''The Great Emancipator'''\" / 1970.10.14\n# \"'''A Time for Loving'''\" / 1970.10.21\n# \"'''Is This Trip Necessary?'''\" / 1970.10.28\n# \"'''Teaching Linda to Drive'''\" / 1970.11.04\n# \"'''Tonoose the Exile'''\" / 1970.11.11\n# \"'''A Hamburger for Frank'''\" / 1970.11.18\n# \"'''The Arrangement'''\" / 1970.11.25\n# \"'''He Did It His Way'''\" / 1970.12.02\n# \"'''Women of the World, Unite'''\" / 1970.12.16\n# \"'''The Teen Idol'''\" / 1970.12.30\n# \"'''Cheating the Cheater'''\" / 1971.01.06\n# \"'''The Horrible Horoscope'''\" / 1971.01.13\n# \"'''Lucy and the Lecher'''\" / 1971.01.21\n# \"'''Of Mice and Mini'''\" / 1971.01.28\n# \"'''Will the Real Diana Please Stand Up?'''\" / 1971.02.04\n# \"'''Over Thirty Is Out'''\" / 1971.02.11\n# \"'''Karate Kate'''\" / 1971.02.18\n# \"'''The Greatest Ear in the Business'''\" / 1971.02.25\n# \"'''The Big Hang-Up'''\" / 1971.03.04\n# \"'''The Arm Wrestle'''\" / 1971.03.11\n# \"'''Monument for Uncle Tonoose'''\" / 1971.03.18\n -->\n\n== Reruns ==\nReruns of the show( Using the original title \"Make Room For Daddy) were aired weekdays on NBC from October 4, 1960 to March 26, 1965.The episodes shown were from season one through season nine).CBS aired primetime repeats April 19 through September 6, 1965, on Monday nights at 9:30 p.m ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]]).

In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series, which proved to be fortunate. In the spring of 1957, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling the series, CBS picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.\n\nThe show, now titled \"The Danny Thomas Show\" made its CBS debut on Monday, October 7, 1957 at 9:00 inheriting the time slot vacated by ''I Love Lucy''. The fifth-season premiere episode, \"Lose Me In Las Vegas,\" had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy's daughter. Lelani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show's ratings dramatically increased.<ref>[http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm ClassicTVHits.com TV Ratings: 1957-1958]</ref> At the end of its fifth season, ''The Danny Thomas Show'' posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.\n\nIn the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14\u201316.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.\n\nIn the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Danny Thomas Jean Hagen Make Room for Daddy 1953.JPG|thumb|150px|Danny and Margaret Williams]]\n[[File:Milton berle angela cartright rusty hamer.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Milton Berle]] spends some time with Linda and Rusty after  Danny and he quit show business.]]\n* [[Danny Thomas]] as Danny Williams\n* [[Jean Hagen]] as Margaret Williams (1953&ndash;1956)\n* [[Marjorie Lord]] as Kathy \"Clancey\" O'Hara Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Rusty Hamer]] as Rusty Williams\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sherry Jackson]] as Terry Williams (1953&ndash;1958)\n* Penney Parker as Terry Williams (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Louise (1953&ndash;1955)\n* [[Amanda Randolph]] as Louise (1955&ndash;1964)\n\n===Supporting===\n[[File:Danny Thomas show hans conried 1964.jpg|thumb|150px|Uncle Tonoose (Hans Conried) gets a lecture from his older brother, Tufik (played by Danny Thomas).]]\nThe supporting cast included:\n* [[Sid Melton]] as Charlie Halper\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as Bunny Halper (1961&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sheldon Leonard]] as Phil Brokaw (1957&ndash;1961)\n* [[Ben Lessy]] as Benny (1953&ndash;1959)\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Liz O'Neal (1955&ndash;1957)\n* [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]] as Pat Hannigan (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] as Jesse Leeds (1953&ndash;1957)\n\n===Notable guest stars===\n[[Hans Conried]] had frequent guest appearances as Danny's eccentric [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] \"Uncle Tonoose\".

In the seventh season, Danny Thomas is arrested by [[Sheriff Andy Taylor]] (Andy Griffith) and detained in the small town of [[Mayberry]] in an episode titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\". The episode aired on February 15, 1960, and ''The Andy Griffith Show'' premiered later that year on October 3.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639971/ ''The Danny Thomas Show'', \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\"]</ref>\n\nThe series also [[Fictional crossover|crossed over]] to several other series, including ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''<ref>[http://www.poobala.com/lucyanddanny.html ''The Danny Thomas Show/Make Room For Daddy and I Love Lucy/The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour'']</ref> and ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0616273/ ''The Joey Bishop Show'',\"This Is Your Life\"]</ref>\n\n[[Morey Amsterdam]] guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' in the episode \"The Women Behind the Jokes\".\n\nSome episodes featured [[Bill Dana]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez (character)|Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez]], which led to the spin-off series ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''. Danny Thomas played himself in one episode.\n\n==Sequel==\n[[File:Make Room for Granddaddy cast 1970.JPG|thumb|180px|The cast for ''Make Room for Granddaddy'']]\n[[File:Diana Ross Roosevelt Grier Danny Thomas Make Room for Granddaddy 1971.JPG|thumb|180px|Guest star [[Diana Ross]] with Roosevelt Grier and Thomas in 1971]]\n\nThe show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.\n\nABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>\n<!-- \n===Episode list for ''Make Room for Granddaddy''===\n# \"Make Room for Grandson\" / 1970.09.23\n# \"The Return of Barney Shaker\" / 1970.09.30\n# \"This Granddaddy Is Rated X\" / 1970.10.07\n# \"'''The Great Emancipator'''\" / 1970.10.14\n# \"'''A Time for Loving'''\" / 1970.10.21\n# \"'''Is This Trip Necessary?'''\" / 1970.10.28\n# \"'''Teaching Linda to Drive'''\" / 1970.11.04\n# \"'''Tonoose the Exile'''\" / 1970.11.11\n# \"'''A Hamburger for Frank'''\" / 1970.11.18\n# \"'''The Arrangement'''\" / 1970.11.25\n# \"'''He Did It His Way'''\" / 1970.12.02\n# \"'''Women of the World, Unite'''\" / 1970.12.16\n# \"'''The Teen Idol'''\" / 1970.12.30\n# \"'''Cheating the Cheater'''\" / 1971.01.06\n# \"'''The Horrible Horoscope'''\" / 1971.01.13\n# \"'''Lucy and the Lecher'''\" / 1971.01.21\n# \"'''Of Mice and Mini'''\" / 1971.01.28\n# \"'''Will the Real Diana Please Stand Up?'''\" / 1971.02.04\n# \"'''Over Thirty Is Out'''\" / 1971.02.11\n# \"'''Karate Kate'''\" / 1971.02.18\n# \"'''The Greatest Ear in the Business'''\" / 1971.02.25\n# \"'''The Big Hang-Up'''\" / 1971.03.04\n# \"'''The Arm Wrestle'''\" / 1971.03.11\n# \"'''Monument for Uncle Tonoose'''\" / 1971.03.18\n -->\n\n== Reruns ==\nReruns of the show( Using the original title \"Make Room For Daddy) were aired weekdays on NBC from October 4, 1960 to March 26, 1965.The episodes shown were from season one through season nine).CBS aired primetime repeats April 19 through September 6, 1965, on Monday nights at 9:30 p.m ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]]).
