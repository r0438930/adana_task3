The film stars [[Jessica Harper]] as an American ballet student who transfers to a prestigious dance academy in Germany but realizes, after a series of brutal murders, that the academy is a front for a supernatural conspiracy. It also features [[Stefania Casini]], [[Flavio Bucci]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Alida Valli]], [[Udo Kier]] and [[Joan Bennett]], in her final film role.\n\nThe film is the first of the trilogy Argento refers to as ''[[The Three Mothers]]'', which also comprises ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007). ''Suspiria'' has become one of Argento's most successful feature films, receiving critical acclaim for its visual and stylistic flair, use of vibrant colors and its [[Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)|score]] by Argento and the [[progressive rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]].\n\n''Suspiria'' was nominated for two [[Saturn Awards]]: [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Bennett in 1978, and Best DVD Classic Film Release, in 2002. It has become a [[cult following|cult classic]], and is recognised as an influential film in the [[horror film|horror genre]]. It served as the inspiration for a 2018 [[Suspiria (2018 film)|film of the same title]], directed by [[Luca Guadagnino]].\n\n==Plot==\nSuzy Bannion, a young American ballet student, arrives during a torrential downpour to study at the [[co-ed]] Freiburg Dance Academy, a prestigious German dance school. She encounters another student, Patricia, fleeing in terror. Suzy is refused entry to the school and forced to stay in town until the next morning. Patricia takes refuge at a friend's apartment and reveals something sinister is happening at the school. She is ambushed by a shadowy figure with demonic hands who slashes her repeatedly with a knife, drags her to the roof of the apartment building, hangs her with a noose and throws her through the building's [[skylight]]. Patricia's friend is impaled and killed by falling debris after trying to alert other tenants to the murder.\n\nThe next morning, Suzy returns to the school, where she meets Miss Tanner, a head instructor, and Madame Blanc, the school's deputy headmistress. Tanner introduces Suzy to her roommate, Olga, and fellow student Sara. Later, Suzy has an unsettling encounter with one of the school's matrons and Blanc's nephew, Albert, before losing consciousness during a dance class. When Suzy regains consciousness, she finds Olga has thrown her out of her apartment, forcing her to stay at the school. However, Sara is in the next-door room and the girls become friends.\n\nWhile the students are preparing for supper one night, [[maggot]]s suddenly rain down from the ceiling, forcing the students to sleep in one of the dance studios. During the night, a woman enters the room but is obscured by a curtain hung around the room's perimeter; Sara is frightened by her hoarse and labored breathing.\n\nThe school's blind pianist, Daniel, is abruptly fired by Miss Tanner when his [[German Shepherd]] bites Albert. That night, Daniel is stalked by an unseen force while walking through a plaza; his dog turns on him and rips his throat out.\n\nAt the school, Sara tells Suzy that <em>she</em> was the one on the intercom refusing her entry the night Patricia was murdered. She says that Patricia was behaving strangely before her death and that some notes she left are missing. Suddenly, Suzy loses consciousness and Sara is forced to flee when an unseen assailant enters the room. The assailant pursues Sara through the school and corners her in the attic. She escapes through a small window but lands in a pit of [[Barbed tape|razor wire]] which entangles her, allowing her pursuer to kill her by slashing her throat.\n\nWhen Suzy questions her about Sara's disappearance the next morning, Tanner tells her that Sara has run away. Suspicious, Suzy contacts Sara's friend and former psychiatrist, Frank Mandel.\nHe reveals that the school was established by a Greek [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]], Helena Markos, who was allegedly a [[witch]]. Suzy also consults Professor Milius, a professor of the [[occult]]. He reveals that a coven of witches will perish without their leader, from whom they draw their power.\n\nWhen Suzy returns to the school, she finds everyone has left to attend the [[Bolshoi Ballet]]. She follows the sound of footsteps to Blanc's office. Remembering that Patricia uttered the words ''secret'' and ''iris'' the night she was killed, Suzy discovers a hidden door which she opens by turning the blue iris on a mural in Blanc's office.\n\nSuzy enters the corridor and finds the instructors, led by Blanc, plotting her demise. Albert alerts a servant, Pavlo, to Suzy's presence. As Suzy flees, she discovers Sara's disfigured corpse and hides in another room. She notices the woman with the hoarse breathing is asleep in the room with her and quickly deduces she is Helena Markos. As she tries to flee, Markos awakens and taunts Suzy before [[Necromancy|reanimating Sara's mutilated corpse]] to murder her. Flashes of lightning inadvertently reveal Markos's silhouette, and Suzy impales her through the neck with a decorative glass peacock quill. Markos's death causes Sara's possessed corpse to vanish.\n\nAs Suzy flees, the school crumbles  and she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, Pavlo and the rest of the coven perish without Markos. Suzy escapes into the night while the school is consumed by fire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Susanna \"Suzy\" Bannion\n* [[Stefania Casini]] as Sara Simms\n* [[Flavio Bucci]] as Daniel\n* [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]] as Mark ([[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in the English release by [[Gregory Snegoff]])\n* [[Alida Valli]] as Miss Tanner\n* [[Joan Bennett]] as Madame Blanc\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Dr. Frank Mandel (dubbed by Frank von Kugelgen)\n* [[Barbara Magnolfi]] as Olga Ivanova (dubbed by [[Carolyn De Fonseca]])\n* [[Eva Ax\u00e9n]] as Patricia \"Pat\" Hingle\n* [[Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler]] as Professor Milius (dubbed by [[Geoffrey Copleston]])\n* [[Susanna Javicoli]] as Sonia\n* [[Franca Scagnetti]] as Cook\n* Giuseppe Transocchi as Pavlo\n* Jacopo Mariani as Albert\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Professor Verdegast\n* Margherita Horowitz as Teacher\n* [[Ted Rusoff]] as Police Inspector (dubbing in the English release)\n* Lela Svasta as Mater Suspiriorum/Helena Markos (uncredited)\n* [[Dario Argento]] as Narrator (uncredited) (dubbed by William Kiehl) (uncredited)}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nArgento based ''Suspiria'' in part on [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s essay ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'' (1845).{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=146}}{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=88}} Critic Maitland McDonagh notes: \"In Argento's reading [of the material], the three mothers generate/inhabit a cinematic world informed by [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] archetypal imagery, each holding sway over a particular city.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=29}} Argento said the idea for the film came to him after a trip through several European cities, including [[Lyon]], [[Prague]], and [[Turin]].<ref name=25th>{{cite av media|title=Suspiria 25th Anniversary|year=2001|people=Hertz, Gary (director)|display-authors=etal|publisher=Anchor Bay Entertainment|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330950/}}</ref> He became fascinated by the \"Magic Triangle,\" a point where the countries of France, Germany, and Switzerland meet; this is where [[Rudolf Steiner]], a controversial social reformer and [[occult]]ist, founded an [[anthroposophic]] community.<ref name=25th/> Commenting on witchcraft and the occult, Argento stated: \"There's very little to joke about.

The [[production design]] and [[cinematography]] emphasize vivid [[primary color]]s, particularly red, creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting, emphasized by the use of [[imbibition]] [[Technicolor]] prints. Commenting on the film's lush colors, Argento said: <blockquote>\"We were trying to reproduce the colour of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937 film)|Snow White]]''; it has been said from the beginning that Technicolor lacked subdued shades, [and] was without nuances\u2014like cut-out cartoons.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}</blockquote>\n\nThe imbibition process, used for ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), is much more vivid in its color rendition than emulsion-based release prints, therefore enhancing the nightmarish qualities of the film Argento intended to evoke.<ref name=25th/> It was one of the final feature films to be processed in Technicolor, using the last remaining machine in Rome. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/arts/dario-argentos-suspiria-visual-aural-masterwork/ |title=Dario Argento's Suspiria: A Visual and Aural Masterwork | publisher = Indiana Public Media |date=2009-05-21 |accessdate=2017-12-18|author=jrhodes}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\n====Dubbing====\nIn the ''Suspiria: 25th Anniversary'' documentary, Harper commented on the fact that the actors' dialogue was not properly recorded, but was dubbed through [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recording]]\u2014common practice in Italian filmmaking at the time.<ref name=25th/> Part of the reason was, she said, that each actor spoke their native language (for instance, Harper, Valli, and Bennett spoke [[English language|English]]; Casini, Bos\u00e9, Valli, and Bucci spoke Italian; and several others spoke [[German language|German]]), and as each actor generally knew what the other was saying anyway, they each responded with their lines as if they had understood the other. Argento also expressed disappointment over the fact that Harper's voice, which he liked, was not heard in the Italian market because she was dubbed in Italian by another actress. The dubbing was overseen by [[Ted Rusoff]], a prolific [[Voice Over Artist|voiceover artist]] based in Rome who supervised English-language dubbing for numerous European genre films including Argento's follow-up to ''Suspiria'', [[Inferno (1980 film)|''Inferno'']].\n\n====Musical score====\n{{Main|Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)}}\nThe Italian [[Progressive rock|prog-rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] composed most of the film's [[Film score|score]] in collaboration with Argento himself.<ref name=25th/> Goblin had scored Argento's earlier film ''[[Deep Red]]'' as well as several subsequent films following ''Suspiria''. In the film's opening credits, they are referred to as \"The Goblins\".<ref name=25th/> Like [[Ennio Morricone]]'s compositions for [[Sergio Leone]], Goblin's score for ''Suspiria'' was created before the film was shot.<ref name=\"25th\" /> It has been reused in multiple [[Hong Kong]] films, including [[Yuen Woo-ping]]'s [[Hong Kong martial arts film|martial arts film]] ''[[Dance of the Drunk Mantis]]'' (1979) and [[Tsui Hark]]'s horror-comedy ''[[We're Going to Eat You]]'' (1980).\n\nThe main title theme was named as one of the best songs released between 1977\u201379 in the book ''[[The Pitchfork 500|The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present]]'', compiled by influential music website [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]].

Several albums have also used the title, including [[Suspiria (Darkwell album)|an album by gothic metal band Darkwell]], [[Suspiria (Miranda Sex Garden album)|an album by Darkwave band Miranda Sex Garden]] and ''Suspiria de Profundis'' by [[Die Form]], which can also be regarded as inspired by Thomas De Quincey's work of the same title. The film's music has also been imitated and sampled by various artists, including [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] in the track \"Psalm 69\" from their album ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs]]'', [[Cage Kennylz]] on \"Weather People\" and [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]] on \"Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know\". The American death metal band Infester included a sample from the film in their song, \"Chamber of Reunion\", from their album ''To the Depths, In Degradation'' (1994). The [[Houston]], [[Texas]]-based Two Star Symphony Orchestra included a track titled \"Goblin Attack\" on their 2004 CD ''Danse Macabre: Constant Companion'' that features a strings rendition of the ''Suspiria'' theme; the track's title also appears to be a reference to the band Goblin. [[The 69 Eyes]] have a song called \"Suspiria Snow White\" on their album ''[[Back in Blood (The 69 Eyes album)|Back in Blood]]'' (2009).\n\nA section of the soundtrack cue \"Markos\" was incorporated into the  Australian radiophonic work ''What's Rangoon to You is Grafton to Me'', conceived and written by radio presenter and author [[Russell Guy]], co-narrated by Guy and former ABC-TV newsreader [[James Dibble]], and co-produced by Guy and Graham Wyatt. It was originally broadcast in 1978 on the ABC's \"youth\" radio station 2JJ aka Double Jay (the Sydney-based AM-band precursor to the current [[Triple J]] network).\n\nIn books by [[Simon R. Green]], mentions are often made of a \"Black Forest Dance Academy\" in Germany, a place where witches and [[Satanism|Satanists]] gather, a possible reference to ''Suspiria''.\n\n''Suspiria'' is featured in the documentary film ''[[Terror in the Aisles]]'' (1984). In the comedy-drama film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007), ''Suspiria'' is considered by the title character to be the goriest film ever made, until she is shown ''[[The Wizard of Gore]]'' and changes her mind, saying it is actually gorier than ''Suspiria''. The film is also mentioned in the episode \"The Seminar\" of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' (season 7), Kirby Reed's horror film collection in the horror film ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011), and in [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]\u2019s ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' where a character watches ''Suspiria'' on television.\n\n==Related works==\n===Subsequent films===\n''Suspiria'' is the first of a trilogy of films by Argento, referred to as \"[[The Three Mothers]]\".{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=73}} The trilogy centers around three witches, or \"Mothers of Sorrow\" who unleash evil from three locations in the world.{{sfn|Cooper|2012|pages=87\u201392}} In ''Suspiria'', Helena Marcos is ''Mater Suspiriorum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Sighs\") in [[Freiburg]].{{sfn|Cooper|2012|pages=88\u20139}} Argento's 1980 film ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' focuses on ''Mater Tenebrarum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Darkness\"), in [[New York City]].{{Sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}} The final installment in the trilogy, ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007), focuses on ''Mater Lachrymarum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Tears\") in Rome.{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}\n\nFilm scholar L. Andrew Cooper notes \"Aesthetic experience is arguably the ultimate source of 'meaning' in all of Argento's films, but ''Suspiria'' and the other films of the Three Mothers trilogy...take their emphasis on aesthetics further by self-consciously connecting their irrational worlds to nineteenth-century romanticism and the aestheticism that grew out of it.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=88}}\n\n===Unfilmed remake===\nIt was announced through [[MTV]] in 2008 that a remake of ''Suspiria'' was in production, to be directed by [[David Gordon Green]], who directed films such as ''[[Undertow (2004 film)|Undertow]]'' and ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/03/05/david-gordon-green-confirms-suspiria-remake/ |title=David Gordon Green Confirms 'Suspiria' Remake |first=Shawn |last=Adler |date=5 March 2008 |website=MTV |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> The announcement was met with hostility by some,<ref name=\"lostinthemultiplex.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lostinthemultiplex.com/newsreel/item/230-please-leave-suspiria-alone.html |title=Please Leave Suspiria Alone |last=Brigden |first=Charlie |work=lostinthemultiplex.com |access-date=5 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120181426/http://www.lostinthemultiplex.com/newsreel/item/230-please-leave-suspiria-alone.html |archive-date=20 November 2012}}</ref> including Argento himself.<ref name=\"riff.is/tv\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9Zd3kMK7g |title=Interview with Dario Argento after his masterclass |last=\u00deorvalds|first=Esther|work=riff.is/tv |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> The film was to be produced by Italian production company First Sun.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/17315/ |title='Suspiria' Remake to Shoot in 2010 | publisher =Bloody Disgusting |date=8 September 2009 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> In August 2008, it was reported that [[Natalie Portman]] and Annette Savitch's Handsome Charlie Films were set to produce the remake, and that Portman would play the lead role.<ref name=\"BDNews\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/13203/ |title=Update #2: Natalie Portman to Topline 'Suspiria' Remake! | publisher =Bloody Disgusting |date=6 August 2008 |work=Bloody Disgusting |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> The project was also announced to be produced by Marco Morabito and [[Luca Guadagnino]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.badtaste.it/articoli/suspiria-2010-producer-yes-shooting-starting-and-no-there-wont-be-marilyn-manson |title=Suspiria 2010, the producer: \"Yes the shooting is starting and no, there won't be Marilyn Manson\" |publisher = BadTaste.it - Il nuovo gusto del cinema! |last=Berni |first=Andrea Francesco |date=10 July 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> After a period of no news in which it was thought that the remake attempt had failed, Green said in August 2011 that he was still trying to remake the film.<ref name=\"lostinthemultiplex.com\"/> It was announced on 15 May 2012 that actress [[Isabelle Fuhrman]] would be cast as the lead.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/55628/hunger-games-and-orphan-star-isabelle-fuhrman-set-suspiria |title=The Hunger Games and Orphan Star Isabelle Fuhrman Set for Suspiria |date=15 May 2012 |work=Dread Central |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Later that year, however, the planned remake was put on hold.

The film stars [[Jessica Harper]] as an American ballet student who transfers to a prestigious dance academy in Germany but realizes, after a series of brutal murders, that the academy is a front for a supernatural conspiracy. It also features [[Stefania Casini]], [[Flavio Bucci]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Alida Valli]], [[Udo Kier]] and [[Joan Bennett]], in her final film role.\n\nThe film is the first of the trilogy Argento refers to as ''[[The Three Mothers]]'', which also comprises ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007). ''Suspiria'' has become one of Argento's most successful feature films, receiving critical acclaim for its visual and stylistic flair, use of vibrant colors and its [[Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)|score]] by Argento and the [[progressive rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]].\n\n''Suspiria'' was nominated for two [[Saturn Awards]]: [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Bennett in 1978, and Best DVD Classic Film Release, in 2002. It has become a [[cult classic]], and is recognised as an influential film in the [[horror film|horror genre]]. It served as the inspiration for a 2018 [[Suspiria (2018 film)|film of the same title]], directed by [[Luca Guadagnino]].\n\n==Plot==\nSuzy Bannion, a young American ballet student, arrives during a torrential downpour to study at the [[co-ed]] Freiburg Dance Academy, a prestigious German dance school. She encounters another student, Patricia, fleeing in terror. Suzy is refused entry to the school and forced to stay in town until the next morning. Patricia takes refuge at a friend's apartment and reveals something sinister is happening at the school. She is ambushed by a shadowy figure with demonic hands who slashes her repeatedly with a knife, drags her to the roof of the apartment building, hangs her with a noose and throws her through the building's [[skylight]]. Patricia's friend is impaled and killed by falling debris after trying to alert other tenants to the murder.\n\nThe next morning, Suzy returns to the school, where she meets Miss Tanner, a head instructor, and Madame Blanc, the school's deputy headmistress. Tanner introduces Suzy to her roommate, Olga, and fellow student Sara. Later, Suzy has an unsettling encounter with one of the school's matrons and Blanc's nephew, Albert, before losing consciousness during a dance class. When Suzy regains consciousness, she finds Olga has thrown her out of her apartment, forcing her to stay at the school. However, Sara is in the next-door room and the girls become friends.\n\nWhile the students are preparing for supper one night, [[maggot]]s suddenly rain down from the ceiling, forcing the students to sleep in one of the dance studios. During the night, a woman enters the room but is obscured by a curtain hung around the room's perimeter; Sara is frightened by her hoarse and labored breathing.\n\nThe school's blind pianist, Daniel, is abruptly fired by Miss Tanner when his [[German Shepherd]] bites Albert. That night, Daniel is stalked by an unseen force while walking through a plaza; his dog turns on him and rips his throat out.\n\nAt the school, Sara tells Suzy that <em>she</em> was the one on the intercom refusing her entry the night Patricia was murdered. She says that Patricia was behaving strangely before her death and that some notes she left are missing. Suddenly, Suzy loses consciousness and Sara is forced to flee when an unseen assailant enters the room. The assailant pursues Sara through the school and corners her in the attic. She escapes through a small window but lands in a pit of [[Barbed tape|razor wire]] which entangles her, allowing her pursuer to kill her by slashing her throat.\n\nWhen Suzy questions her about Sara's disappearance the next morning, Tanner tells her that Sara has run away. Suspicious, Suzy contacts Sara's friend and former psychiatrist, Frank Mandel.\nHe reveals that the school was established by a Greek [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]], Helena Markos, who was allegedly a [[witch]]. Suzy also consults Professor Milius, a professor of the [[occult]]. He reveals that a coven of witches will perish without their leader, from whom they draw their power.\n\nWhen Suzy returns to the school, she finds everyone has left to attend the [[Bolshoi Ballet]]. She follows the sound of footsteps to Blanc's office. Remembering that Patricia uttered the words ''secret'' and ''iris'' the night she was killed, Suzy discovers a hidden door which she opens by turning the blue iris on a mural in Blanc's office.\n\nSuzy enters the corridor and finds the instructors, led by Blanc, plotting her demise. Albert alerts a servant, Pavlo, to Suzy's presence. As Suzy flees, she discovers Sara's disfigured corpse and hides in another room. She notices the woman with the hoarse breathing is asleep in the room with her and quickly deduces she is Helena Markos. As she tries to flee, Markos awakens and taunts Suzy before [[Necromancy|reanimating Sara's mutilated corpse]] to murder her. Flashes of lightning inadvertently reveal Markos's silhouette, and Suzy impales her through the neck with a decorative glass peacock quill. Markos's death causes Sara's possessed corpse to vanish.\n\nAs Suzy flees, the school crumbles  and she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, Pavlo and the rest of the coven perish without Markos. Suzy escapes into the night while the school is consumed by fire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Susanna \"Suzy\" Bannion\n* [[Stefania Casini]] as Sara Simms\n* [[Flavio Bucci]] as Daniel\n* [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]] as Mark ([[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in the English release by [[Gregory Snegoff]])\n* [[Alida Valli]] as Miss Tanner\n* [[Joan Bennett]] as Madame Blanc\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Dr. Frank Mandel (dubbed by Frank von Kugelgen)\n* [[Barbara Magnolfi]] as Olga Ivanova (dubbed by [[Carolyn De Fonseca]])\n* [[Eva Ax\u00e9n]] as Patricia \"Pat\" Hingle\n* [[Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler]] as Professor Milius (dubbed by [[Geoffrey Copleston]])\n* [[Susanna Javicoli]] as Sonia\n* [[Franca Scagnetti]] as Cook\n* Giuseppe Transocchi as Pavlo\n* Jacopo Mariani as Albert\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Professor Verdegast\n* Margherita Horowitz as Teacher\n* [[Ted Rusoff]] as Police Inspector (dubbing in the English release)\n* Lela Svasta as Mater Suspiriorum/Helena Markos (uncredited)\n* [[Dario Argento]] as Narrator (uncredited) (dubbed by William Kiehl) (uncredited)}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nArgento based ''Suspiria'' in part on [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s essay ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'' (1845).{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=146}}{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=88}} Critic Maitland McDonagh notes: \"In Argento's reading [of the material], the three mothers generate/inhabit a cinematic world informed by [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] archetypal imagery, each holding sway over a particular city.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=29}} Argento said the idea for the film came to him after a trip through several European cities, including [[Lyon]], [[Prague]], and [[Turin]].<ref name=25th>{{cite av media|title=Suspiria 25th Anniversary|year=2001|people=Hertz, Gary (director)|display-authors=etal|publisher=Anchor Bay Entertainment|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330950/}}</ref> He became fascinated by the \"Magic Triangle,\" a point where the countries of France, Germany, and Switzerland meet; this is where [[Rudolf Steiner]], a controversial social reformer and [[occult]]ist, founded an [[anthroposophic]] community.<ref name=25th/> Commenting on witchcraft and the occult, Argento stated: \"There's very little to joke about.

The [[production design]] and [[cinematography]] emphasize vivid [[primary color]]s, particularly red, creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting, emphasized by the use of [[imbibition]] [[Technicolor]] prints. Commenting on the film's lush colors, Argento said: <blockquote>\"We were trying to reproduce the colour of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937 film)|Snow White]]''; it has been said from the beginning that Technicolor lacked subdued shades, [and] was without nuances\u2014like cut-out cartoons.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}</blockquote>\n\nThe imbibition process, used for ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), is much more vivid in its color rendition than emulsion-based release prints, therefore enhancing the nightmarish qualities of the film Argento intended to evoke.<ref name=25th/> It was one of the final feature films to be processed in Technicolor, using the last remaining machine in Rome. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/arts/dario-argentos-suspiria-visual-aural-masterwork/ |title=Dario Argento's Suspiria: A Visual and Aural Masterwork | publisher = Indiana Public Media |date=2009-05-21 |accessdate=2017-12-18|author=jrhodes}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\n====Dubbing====\nIn the ''Suspiria: 25th Anniversary'' documentary, Harper commented on the fact that the actors' dialogue was not properly recorded, but was dubbed through [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recording]]\u2014common practice in Italian filmmaking at the time.<ref name=25th/> Part of the reason was, she said, that each actor spoke their native language (for instance, Harper, Valli, and Bennett spoke [[English language|English]]; Casini, Bos\u00e9, Valli, and Bucci spoke Italian; and several others spoke [[German language|German]]), and as each actor generally knew what the other was saying anyway, they each responded with their lines as if they had understood the other. Argento also expressed disappointment over the fact that Harper's voice, which he liked, was not heard in the Italian market because she was dubbed in Italian by another actress. The dubbing was overseen by [[Ted Rusoff]], a prolific [[Voice Over Artist|voiceover artist]] based in Rome who supervised English-language dubbing for numerous European genre films including Argento's follow-up to ''Suspiria'', [[Inferno (1980 film)|''Inferno'']].\n\n====Musical score====\n{{Main|Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)}}\nThe Italian [[Progressive rock|prog-rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] composed most of the film's [[Film score|score]] in collaboration with Argento himself.<ref name=25th/> Goblin had scored Argento's earlier film ''[[Deep Red]]'' as well as several subsequent films following ''Suspiria''.

Several albums have also used the title, including [[Suspiria (Darkwell album)|an album by gothic metal band Darkwell]], [[Suspiria (Miranda Sex Garden album)|an album by Darkwave band Miranda Sex Garden]] and ''Suspiria de Profundis'' by [[Die Form]], which can also be regarded as inspired by Thomas De Quincey's work of the same title. The film's music has also been imitated and sampled by various artists, including [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] in the track \"Psalm 69\" from their album ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs]]'', [[Cage Kennylz]] on \"Weather People\" and [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]] on \"Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know\". The American death metal band Infester included a sample from the film in their song, \"Chamber of Reunion\", from their album ''To the Depths, In Degradation'' (1994). The [[Houston]], [[Texas]]-based Two Star Symphony Orchestra included a track titled \"Goblin Attack\" on their 2004 CD ''Danse Macabre: Constant Companion'' that features a strings rendition of the ''Suspiria'' theme; the track's title also appears to be a reference to the band Goblin. [[The 69 Eyes]] have a song called \"Suspiria Snow White\" on their album ''[[Back in Blood (The 69 Eyes album)|Back in Blood]]'' (2009).\n\nA section of the soundtrack cue \"Markos\" was incorporated into the  Australian radiophonic work ''What's Rangoon to You is Grafton to Me'', conceived and written by radio presenter and author [[Russell Guy]], co-narrated by Guy and former ABC-TV newsreader [[James Dibble]], and co-produced by Guy and Graham Wyatt. It was originally broadcast in 1978 on the ABC's \"youth\" radio station 2JJ aka Double Jay (the Sydney-based AM-band precursor to the current [[Triple J]] network).\n\nIn books by [[Simon R. Green]], mentions are often made of a \"Black Forest Dance Academy\" in Germany, a place where witches and [[Satanism|Satanists]] gather, a possible reference to ''Suspiria''.\n\n''Suspiria'' is featured in the documentary film ''[[Terror in the Aisles]]'' (1984). In the comedy-drama film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007), ''Suspiria'' is considered by the title character to be the goriest film ever made, until she is shown ''[[The Wizard of Gore]]'' and changes her mind, saying it is actually gorier than ''Suspiria''. The film is also mentioned in the episode \"The Seminar\" of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' (season 7), Kirby Reed's horror film collection in the horror film ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011), and in [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]\u2019s ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' where a character watches ''Suspiria'' on television.\n\n==Related works==\n===Subsequent films===\n''Suspiria'' is the first of a trilogy of films by Argento, referred to as \"[[The Three Mothers]]\".{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=73}} The trilogy centers around three witches, or \"Mothers of Sorrow\" who unleash evil from three locations in the world.{{sfn|Cooper|2012|pages=87\u201392}} In ''Suspiria'', Helena Marcos is ''Mater Suspiriorum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Sighs\") in [[Freiburg]].{{sfn|Cooper|2012|pages=88\u20139}} Argento's 1980 film ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' focuses on ''Mater Tenebrarum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Darkness\"), in [[New York City]].{{Sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}} The final installment in the trilogy, ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007), focuses on ''Mater Lachrymarum'' ({{literal translation}} Latin: \"Mother of Tears\") in Rome.{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}\n\nFilm scholar L. Andrew Cooper notes \"Aesthetic experience is arguably the ultimate source of 'meaning' in all of Argento's films, but ''Suspiria'' and the other films of the Three Mothers trilogy...take their emphasis on aesthetics further by self-consciously connecting their irrational worlds to nineteenth-century romanticism and the aestheticism that grew out of it.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=88}}\n\n===Unfilmed remake===\nIt was announced through [[MTV]] in 2008 that a remake of ''Suspiria'' was in production, to be directed by [[David Gordon Green]], who directed films such as ''[[Undertow (2004 film)|Undertow]]'' and ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/03/05/david-gordon-green-confirms-suspiria-remake/ |title=David Gordon Green Confirms 'Suspiria' Remake |first=Shawn |last=Adler |date=5 March 2008 |website=MTV |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> The announcement was met with hostility by some,<ref name=\"lostinthemultiplex.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lostinthemultiplex.com/newsreel/item/230-please-leave-suspiria-alone.html |title=Please Leave Suspiria Alone |last=Brigden |first=Charlie |work=lostinthemultiplex.com |access-date=5 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120181426/http://www.lostinthemultiplex.com/newsreel/item/230-please-leave-suspiria-alone.html |archive-date=20 November 2012}}</ref> including Argento himself.<ref name=\"riff.is/tv\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9Zd3kMK7g |title=Interview with Dario Argento after his masterclass |last=\u00deorvalds|first=Esther|work=riff.is/tv |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> The film was to be produced by Italian production company First Sun.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/17315/ |title='Suspiria' Remake to Shoot in 2010 | publisher =Bloody Disgusting |date=8 September 2009 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> In August 2008, it was reported that [[Natalie Portman]] and Annette Savitch's Handsome Charlie Films were set to produce the remake, and that Portman would play the lead role.<ref name=\"BDNews\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/13203/ |title=Update #2: Natalie Portman to Topline 'Suspiria' Remake! | publisher =Bloody Disgusting |date=6 August 2008 |work=Bloody Disgusting |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> The project was also announced to be produced by Marco Morabito and [[Luca Guadagnino]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.badtaste.it/articoli/suspiria-2010-producer-yes-shooting-starting-and-no-there-wont-be-marilyn-manson |title=Suspiria 2010, the producer: \"Yes the shooting is starting and no, there won't be Marilyn Manson\" |publisher = BadTaste.it - Il nuovo gusto del cinema! |last=Berni |first=Andrea Francesco |date=10 July 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> After a period of no news in which it was thought that the remake attempt had failed, Green said in August 2011 that he was still trying to remake the film.<ref name=\"lostinthemultiplex.com\"/> It was announced on 15 May 2012 that actress [[Isabelle Fuhrman]] would be cast as the lead.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/55628/hunger-games-and-orphan-star-isabelle-fuhrman-set-suspiria |title=The Hunger Games and Orphan Star Isabelle Fuhrman Set for Suspiria |date=15 May 2012 |work=Dread Central |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Later that year, however, the planned remake was put on hold.
