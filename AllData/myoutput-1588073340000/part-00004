The purpose of the Scout Movement is to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities.\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, the movement grew to encompass three major age groups for boys ([[Cub Scout]], [[Scout (Scouting)|Boy Scout]], [[Rover Scout]]) and, in 1910, a new organization, [[Girl Guides]], was created for girls ([[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownie Guide]], [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout]], [[Ranger (Girl Guide)|Ranger Guide]]). It is one of several worldwide [[youth organization]]s.\n\nIn 1906 and 1907 [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], a [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]] in the [[British Army]], wrote a book for boys about [[reconnaissance]] and {{not a typo|scouting|reason=intentionally uncapitalized, the activity, not the movement}}. This book, ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', was based on his earlier books about military scouting, with influence and support of [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] (Chief of Scouts in British Africa), [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] of the [[Woodcraft Indians]], [[William Alexander Smith (Boys' Brigade)|William Alexander Smith]] of the [[Boys' Brigade]], and his publisher [[Cyril Arthur Pearson|Pearson]]. In mid-1907 Baden-Powell held a [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camp]] on [[Brownsea Island]] in England to test ideas for his book. This camp and the publication of  ''Scouting for Boys'' (London, 1908) are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement.\n\n[[File:Leaders welcoming boy into Mexico Scouting.jpg|thumb|Leaders welcome a boy into Scouting, March 2010, Mexico City, Mexico]]\nThe movement employs the [[Scout method]], a programme of informal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities, including [[camping]], [[woodcraft]], [[List of water sports|aquatics]], [[hiking]], [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and [[sport]]s. Another widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform, by intent hiding all differences of social standing in a country and making for equality, with [[neckerchief]] and [[campaign hat]] or comparable headwear. Distinctive uniform insignia include the [[fleur-de-lis]] and the [[trefoil]], as well as [[Scout badge|badges]] and other patches.\n\nThe two largest umbrella organizations are the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] (WOSM), for boys-only and co-educational organizations, and the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS), primarily for girls-only organizations but also accepting co-educational organizations. The year 2007 marked the [[Scouting 2007 Centenary|centenary of Scouting]] worldwide, and member organizations planned events to celebrate the occasion.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Scout stone Brownsea.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|''Stone on [[Brownsea Island]] commemorating the [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|first Scout camp]]'']]\nThe trigger for the Scouting movement was the 1908 publication of ''Scouting for Boys'' written by [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]].<ref name=\"bp1908\">{{cite book |ref={{sfnRef |Baden-Powell |1908}} |last=Baden-Powell |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell |title=Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship |publisher=H.

He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, from all parts of society, to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic [[Woodcraft Folk]]; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.<ref name=\"woodfolk\">{{cite web |year=2006 |url=http://www.troop97.net/scout_like.htm| title=Scout-like Organizations |publisher=Troop 97 |accessdate=December 5, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAspects of Scouting practice have been criticized as too [[militarism|militaristic]].<ref name=\"militarism\">{{cite web |last=Foster |first=Rev.

By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting has been able to find acceptance in a wide variety of cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. [[frontier]] experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that [[Native Americans in the United States|American native peoples]] are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the [[India]]n subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, [[Akela (Scouting)|Akela]] (whose name was also appropriated for the [[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Webelos]]), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.<ref name=\"Kipling\">{{cite web|url=http://www.authorama.com/jungle-book-1.html|title=The Jungle Book|last=Kipling|first=Rudyard|work=Mowgli's Brothers|publisher=Authorama|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Scouting\" seems to have been inspired by the important and [[romanticism|romantic]] role played by military scouts performing reconnaissance in the wars of the time. In fact, Baden-Powell wrote his original military training book, ''Aids To Scouting'', because he saw the need for the improved training of British military-enlisted scouts, particularly in initiative, self-reliance, and observational skills. The book's popularity with young boys surprised him. As he adapted the book as ''Scouting for Boys'', it seems natural that the movement adopted the names ''Scouting'' and ''Boy Scouts.''<ref name=\"surprise\">{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Johnny |year=2006 |url=http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/sfb.htm |title=''Scouting for Boys'' \u2013 the Influences, the Means, the Process and its Success |publisher=Scouting Milestones |accessdate=December 5, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614024123/http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/sfb.htm|archivedate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n\"Duty to [[God]]\" is a principle of Scouting, though it is applied differently in various countries.<ref name=\"faqs\">{{cite web |year=1998 |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-11.html |title=What was Baden-Powell's position on God and Religion in Scouting? |publisher=Faqs |accessdate=December 3, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"inquiry\">{{cite web|last=Baden-Powell |first=Robert |year=1912 |url=http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |title=Baden-Powell on Religion |publisher=Inquiry.net |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115192441/http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2006 }}</ref> The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) take a strong position, excluding [[atheism|atheists]].<ref name=\"duty\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp |work=BSA Legal Issues |title=Duty to God |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509074048/http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}</ref> [[The Scout Association]] in the United Kingdom permits variations to its Promise, in order to accommodate different religious obligations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2005/1_5.htm#rule_1.1|title= Rule 1.1: Variations to the wording of the Promises|accessdate= December 23, 2009|publisher= The Scout Association|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202131520/http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2005/1_5.htm#rule_1.1|archivedate= December 2, 2008|df= mdy-all}}</ref> While for example in the predominantly atheist [[Czech Republic]] the Scout oath doesn't mention God altogether with the organization being strictly irreligious,<ref>\u0160togr, Josef, ed.

WOSM describes Scouting as \"a voluntary nonpolitical educational movement for young people open to all without distinction of origin, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[creed]], in accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by the Founder\".<ref name=\"constitution\"/> It is the goal of Scouting \"to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities.\"<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nThe principles of Scouting describe a code of behavior for all members, and characterize the movement. The Scout method is a progressive system designed to achieve these goals, comprising seven elements: [[Scout Law|law]] and [[Scout Promise|promise]], learning by doing, team system, symbolic framework, personal progression, nature, and adult support.<ref name=\"Educational System\">{{cite web|year=1998 |url=http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/3899/34684/file/ScoutEducSyst_E.pdf |title=Scouting: An Educational System |publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |page=19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316202248/http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/3899/34684/file/ScoutEducSyst_E.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2007 }}</ref> While community service is a major element of both the WOSM and WAGGGS programs, WAGGGS includes it as an extra element of the Scout method: service in the community.<ref name=\"constitutionWAGGGS\">{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/grab/1109/1/1ConstitutionbookletEnglish.pdf |title=Constitution Booklet |publisher=World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts |accessdate=September 15, 2007 |page=Article 6b}}</ref>\n\nThe Scout Law and Promise embody the joint values of the Scouting movement worldwide, and bind all Scouting associations together. The emphasis on \"learning by doing\" provides experiences and hands-on orientation as a practical method of learning and building [[self-esteem|self-confidence]]. Small groups build unity, camaraderie, and a close-knit fraternal atmosphere. These experiences, along with an emphasis on trustworthiness and personal honor, help to develop [[Responsibility assumption|responsibility]], [[moral character|character]], [[self (psychology)|self-reliance]], self-confidence, reliability, and [[preparedness|readiness]]; which eventually lead to [[collaboration]] and [[leadership]]. A program with a variety of progressive and attractive activities expands a Scout's horizon and bonds the Scout even more to the group. Activities and games provide an enjoyable way to develop skills such as [[dexterity]]. In an outdoor setting, they also provide contact with the natural environment.<ref name=\"goodturn\"/>\n\nSince the birth of Scouting, Scouts worldwide have taken a Scout Promise to live up to ideals of the movement, and subscribe to the Scout Law. The form of the promise and laws have varied slightly by country and over time, but must fulfil the requirements of the WOSM to qualify a National Scout Association for membership.<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nThe [[Scout Motto]], 'Be Prepared', has been used in various languages by millions of Scouts since 1907.

Uniform shirts are now frequently blue, orange, red or green and shorts are frequently replaced by long trousers all year or only under cold weather.\n\nWhile designed for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams to make them ideal for use in makeshift stretchers\u2014Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the [[campaign hat]]s or Leaders' [[Wood Badge]]s could be used as emergency [[tourniquets]], or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry.

In the United States and the [[Philippines]], university students might join the co-ed service [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] [[Alpha Phi Omega]]. In the United Kingdom, university students might join the [[Student Scout and Guide Organisation]], and after graduation, the [[Scout and Guide Graduate Association]].\n\nScout units are usually operated by adult volunteers, such as parents and carers, former Scouts, students, and community leaders, including teachers and religious leaders. [[Scout Leader]]ship positions are often divided into 'uniform' and 'lay' positions. Uniformed leaders have received formal training, such as the [[Wood Badge]], and have received a warrant for a rank within the organization. Lay members commonly hold part-time roles such as meeting helpers, committee members and advisors, though there are a small number of full-time lay professionals.<ref name=\"trooporg\">{{cite web |date=April 2000 |url=http://scoutmaster.org/usscouts/boyscouts/bstroop.asp |title=Troop Organization |publisher=US Scouts.org |accessdate=July 26, 2006}}, p. 2\u201315</ref>\n\nA unit has uniformed positions\u2014such as the Scoutmaster and assistants\u2014whose titles vary among countries.

The purpose of the Scout Movement is to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities.\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, the movement grew to encompass three major age groups for boys ([[Cub Scout]], [[Scout (Scouting)|Boy Scout]], [[Rover Scout]]) and, in 1910, a new organization, [[Girl Guides]], was created for girls ([[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownie Guide]], [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout]], [[Ranger (Girl Guide)|Ranger Guide]]). It is one of several worldwide [[youth organization]]s.\n\nIn 1906 and 1907 [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], a [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]] in the [[British Army]], wrote a book for boys about [[reconnaissance]] and {{not a typo|scouting|reason=intentionally uncapitalized, the activity, not the movement}}. This book, ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', was based on his earlier books about military scouting, with influence and support of [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] (Chief of Scouts in British Africa), [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] of the [[Woodcraft Indians]], [[William Alexander Smith (Boys' Brigade)|William Alexander Smith]] of the [[Boys' Brigade]], and his publisher [[Cyril Arthur Pearson|Pearson]]. In mid-1907 Baden-Powell held a [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camp]] on [[Brownsea Island]] in England to test ideas for his book. This camp and the publication of  ''Scouting for Boys'' (London, 1908) are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement.\n\n[[File:Leaders welcoming boy into Mexico Scouting.jpg|thumb|Leaders welcome a boy into Scouting, March 2010, Mexico City, Mexico]]\nThe movement employs the [[Scout method]], a programme of informal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities, including [[camping]], [[woodcraft]], [[List of water sports|aquatics]], [[hiking]], [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and [[sport]]s. Another widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform, by intent hiding all differences of social standing in a country and making for equality, with [[neckerchief]] and [[campaign hat]] or comparable headwear. Distinctive uniform insignia include the [[fleur-de-lis]] and the [[trefoil]], as well as [[Scout badge|badges]] and other patches.\n\nThe two largest umbrella organizations are the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] (WOSM), for boys-only and co-educational organizations, and the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS), primarily for girls-only organizations but also accepting co-educational organizations. The year 2007 marked the [[Scouting 2007 Centenary|centenary of Scouting]] worldwide, and member organizations planned events to celebrate the occasion.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Scout stone Brownsea.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|''Stone on [[Brownsea Island]] commemorating the [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|first Scout camp]]'']]\nThe trigger for the Scouting movement was the 1908 publication of ''Scouting for Boys'' written by [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]].<ref name=\"bp1908\">{{cite book |ref={{sfnRef |Baden-Powell |1908}} |last=Baden-Powell |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell |title=Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship |publisher=H.

In 1909 [[Chile]] was the first country outside the British dominions to have a Scouting organization recognized by Baden-Powell. The first Scout rally, held in 1909 at [[the Crystal Palace]] in London, attracted 10,000 boys and a number of girls.

The first [[Cub Scout]] and [[Rover Scout]] programs were in place by the late 1910s. They operated independently until they obtained official recognition from their home country's Scouting organization. In the United States, attempts at Cub programs began as early as 1911, but official recognition was not obtained until 1930.<ref name=\"scoutbase\"/><ref name=\"cubusahist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/~pack215/hist-cshistory.html |title=The Evolution of Cubbing, A 90 Year Chronology |publisher=Cubbing through the Decades |accessdate=July 22, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930174432/http://www.geocities.com/~pack215/hist-cshistory.html|archivedate=September 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"roverworld\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/rovers.htm |title=Rover Scouts&nbsp;\u2013 Scouting For Men |publisher=Scouting Milestones |accessdate=July 22, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614023143/http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/rovers.htm|archivedate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Vazken Andr\u00e9assian HoMenEtMen-Sgaoudagan doghantsk Konstantinobolis 1918.jpg|thumb|upright|First procession of [[Homenetmen|Armenian Scouts]] in Constantinople in 1918]]\nGirls wanted to become part of the movement almost as soon as it began. Baden-Powell and his sister [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] introduced the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]] in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the [[Crystal Palace Rally]]. In 1914, she started Rosebuds\u2014later renamed [[Brownies (Girl Guides)|Brownies]]\u2014for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife [[Olave Baden-Powell]], who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups did exist. By the 1990s, two-thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.<ref name=\"SRTW1990\">{{cite book |year=1990 |title=Scouting 'round the World.

Early [[Scoutmaster]] training camps were held in London and [[Yorkshire]] in 1910 and 1911. Baden-Powell wanted the training to be as practical as possible to encourage other adults to take leadership roles, so the [[Wood Badge]] course was developed to recognize adult leadership training.

He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, from all parts of society, to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic [[Woodcraft Folk]]; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.<ref name=\"woodfolk\">{{cite web |year=2006 |url=http://www.troop97.net/scout_like.htm| title=Scout-like Organizations |publisher=Troop 97 |accessdate=December 5, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAspects of Scouting practice have been criticized as too [[militarism|militaristic]].<ref name=\"militarism\">{{cite web |last=Foster |first=Rev.

By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting has been able to find acceptance in a wide variety of cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. [[frontier]] experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that [[Native Americans in the United States|American native peoples]] are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the [[India]]n subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, [[Akela (Scouting)|Akela]] (whose name was also appropriated for the [[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Webelos]]), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.<ref name=\"Kipling\">{{cite web|url=http://www.authorama.com/jungle-book-1.html|title=The Jungle Book|last=Kipling|first=Rudyard|work=Mowgli's Brothers|publisher=Authorama|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Scouting\" seems to have been inspired by the important and [[romanticism|romantic]] role played by military scouts performing reconnaissance in the wars of the time. In fact, Baden-Powell wrote his original military training book, ''Aids To Scouting'', because he saw the need for the improved training of British military-enlisted scouts, particularly in initiative, self-reliance, and observational skills. The book's popularity with young boys surprised him. As he adapted the book as ''Scouting for Boys'', it seems natural that the movement adopted the names ''Scouting'' and ''Boy Scouts.''<ref name=\"surprise\">{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Johnny |year=2006 |url=http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/sfb.htm |title=''Scouting for Boys'' \u2013 the Influences, the Means, the Process and its Success |publisher=Scouting Milestones |accessdate=December 5, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614024123/http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/sfb.htm|archivedate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n\"Duty to [[God]]\" is a principle of Scouting, though it is applied differently in various countries.<ref name=\"faqs\">{{cite web |year=1998 |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-11.html |title=What was Baden-Powell's position on God and Religion in Scouting? |publisher=Faqs |accessdate=December 3, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"inquiry\">{{cite web|last=Baden-Powell |first=Robert |year=1912 |url=http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |title=Baden-Powell on Religion |publisher=Inquiry.net |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115192441/http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2006 }}</ref> The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) take a strong position, excluding [[atheism|atheists]].<ref name=\"duty\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp |work=BSA Legal Issues |title=Duty to God |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509074048/http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}</ref> [[The Scout Association]] in the United Kingdom permits variations to its Promise, in order to accommodate different religious obligations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2005/1_5.htm#rule_1.1|title= Rule 1.1: Variations to the wording of the Promises|accessdate= December 23, 2009|publisher= The Scout Association|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202131520/http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2005/1_5.htm#rule_1.1|archivedate= December 2, 2008|df= mdy-all}}</ref> While for example in the predominantly atheist [[Czech Republic]] the Scout oath doesn't mention God altogether with the organization being strictly irreligious,<ref>\u0160togr, Josef, ed.

WOSM describes Scouting as \"a voluntary nonpolitical educational movement for young people open to all without distinction of origin, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[creed]], in accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by the Founder\".<ref name=\"constitution\"/> It is the goal of Scouting \"to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities.\"<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nThe principles of Scouting describe a code of behavior for all members, and characterize the movement. The Scout method is a progressive system designed to achieve these goals, comprising seven elements: [[Scout Law|law]] and [[Scout Promise|promise]], learning by doing, team system, symbolic framework, personal progression, nature, and adult support.<ref name=\"Educational System\">{{cite web|year=1998 |url=http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/3899/34684/file/ScoutEducSyst_E.pdf |title=Scouting: An Educational System |publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |page=19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316202248/http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/3899/34684/file/ScoutEducSyst_E.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2007 }}</ref> While community service is a major element of both the WOSM and WAGGGS programs, WAGGGS includes it as an extra element of the Scout method: service in the community.<ref name=\"constitutionWAGGGS\">{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/grab/1109/1/1ConstitutionbookletEnglish.pdf |title=Constitution Booklet |publisher=World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts |accessdate=September 15, 2007 |page=Article 6b}}</ref>\n\nThe Scout Law and Promise embody the joint values of the Scouting movement worldwide, and bind all Scouting associations together. The emphasis on \"learning by doing\" provides experiences and hands-on orientation as a practical method of learning and building [[self-esteem|self-confidence]]. Small groups build unity, camaraderie, and a close-knit fraternal atmosphere. These experiences, along with an emphasis on trustworthiness and personal honor, help to develop [[Responsibility assumption|responsibility]], [[moral character|character]], [[self (psychology)|self-reliance]], self-confidence, reliability, and [[preparedness|readiness]]; which eventually lead to [[collaboration]] and [[leadership]]. A program with a variety of progressive and attractive activities expands a Scout's horizon and bonds the Scout even more to the group. Activities and games provide an enjoyable way to develop skills such as [[dexterity]]. In an outdoor setting, they also provide contact with the natural environment.<ref name=\"goodturn\"/>\n\nSince the birth of Scouting, Scouts worldwide have taken a Scout Promise to live up to ideals of the movement, and subscribe to the Scout Law. The form of the promise and laws have varied slightly by country and over time, but must fulfil the requirements of the WOSM to qualify a National Scout Association for membership.<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nThe [[Scout Motto]], 'Be Prepared', has been used in various languages by millions of Scouts since 1907.

In the words of Baden-Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree, it \"hides all differences of social standing in a country and makes for equality; but, more important still, it covers differences of country and race and creed, and makes all feel that they are members with one another of the one great brotherhood\".<ref name=\"uniform\">{{cite web |last=Wade |first=E.K. |year=1957 |url=http://pinetreeweb.com/wade12.htm |title=27 Years With Baden-Powell |work=Why the Uniform?, ch 12 |publisher=Pinetree.web |accessdate=July 24, 2006}}</ref> The original uniform, still widely recognized, consisted of a [[khaki]] button-up shirt, shorts, and a broad-brimmed [[campaign hat]]. Baden-Powell also wore shorts, because he believed that being dressed like a Scout helped to reduce the age-imposed distance between adult and youth. Uniform shirts are now frequently blue, orange, red or green and shorts are frequently replaced by long trousers all year or only under cold weather.\n\nWhile designed for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams to make them ideal for use in makeshift stretchers\u2014Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the [[campaign hat]]s or Leaders' [[Wood Badge]]s could be used as emergency [[tourniquets]], or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. [[Neckerchief]]s were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their [[garters]] for [[shock cord]] where necessary.<ref name=\"uniform\"/>\n\nDistinctive insignia for all are Scout uniforms, recognized and worn the world over, include the Wood Badge and the World Membership Badge. Scouting has two internationally known symbols: the [[trefoil]] is used by members of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS) and the [[Fleur-de-lis in Scouting|fleur-de-lis]] by member organizations of the WOSM and most other Scouting organizations.<ref name=\"fleurwosm\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scout.org/en/about_scouting/facts_figures/baden_powell/b_p_gallery/scout_emblem |title=World Scout Emblem |publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207120057/http://scout.org/en/about_scouting/facts_figures/baden_powell/b_p_gallery/scout_emblem |archivedate=February 7, 2009  }}</ref><ref name=\"worldtrefoil\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/resources/photos/54 |title=The World Trefoil |publisher=World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts |accessdate=December 7, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231034510/http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/resources/photos/54 |archivedate = December 31, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[swastika]] was used as an early symbol by the [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts Association]] of the United Kingdom and others.

[[Scout Leader]]ship positions are often divided into 'uniform' and 'lay' positions. Uniformed leaders have received formal training, such as the [[Wood Badge]], and have received a warrant for a rank within the organization.

About half of the remaining 172&nbsp;Scouting organizations are only local or national oriented.

Although Scouting was introduced to Africa by British officials as a way to strengthen their rule, the values they based Scouting on helped to challenge the legitimacy of [[British imperialism]]. Likewise, African Scouts used the Scout Law's principle that a Scout is a brother to all other Scouts to collectively claim full imperial citizenship.<ref name=\"movement\">{{cite web |last=Foster |first=Rev.
