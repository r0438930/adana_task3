It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020. The series will also air the following day on [[The CW]], as well as be available on The CW's digital platforms. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were featured in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", establishing ''Stargirl'' as existing on [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|a parallel Earth to the Arrowverse series]].\n\n==Premise==\nHigh school sophomore [[Courtney Whitmore]] discovers a powerful cosmic staff, and after learning that her step-father [[Pat Dugan]] used to be a hero sidekick, becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n<!-- Order per https://cwtvpr.com/the-cw/shows/dcs-stargirl/about and other actors sourced as main until opening credits are revealed -->\n* [[Brec Bassinger]] as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]]:<br />A high school sophomore who discovers a powerful cosmic staff and becomes the hero Stargirl.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> She is the leader of the new [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Bassinger did not look at the previous portrayals of the character by [[Britt Irvin]] on ''[[Smallville]]'' or [[Sarah Grey]] on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' because they were depicted as \"older, more mature version[s]\" of Stargirl.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Sarah Schechter]], and Melissa Carter (who is co-showrunner with Johns).<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /><ref name=\"The CW\" /> Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] as the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role. On why Bassinger was perfect for the role, Johns said, \"Immediately... I knew she was Courtney. She has the humor, she has the enthusiasm, the energy, the innate optimism, and Brec really embodies who Stargirl is\".<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In November 2018, the following roles were cast: Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]],<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]], and Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> The next month, [[Joy Osmanski]] was cast as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]], [[Neil Hopkins]] was cast as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \u201cCrusher\u201d Crock / Sportsmaster]], and [[Nelson Lee]] was cast as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]], members of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In January 2019, [[Luke Wilson]] was cast as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> Cameron Gellman joined the cast as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]] the next month,<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> along with [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]],<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Trae Romano as Mike Dugan,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> and Hunter Sansone as Cameron.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"SansoneCWBio\" /> In February 2019, Jake Austin Walker was cast as Henry King Jr. and Meg Delacy was cast as Cindy Burman, rounding out the cast.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" /><ref name=\"WalkerCWBio\" />\n\nIn December 2018, the following members of the [[Justice Society of America]] were cast, all recurring roles: [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]],<ref name=\"McHale\" /> [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]],<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" /> Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]],<ref name=\"Stapf\" /> and [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]].<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> In April 2019, Hina Khan was cast in an undisclosed role said to be a principal.<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had begun by March 14, 2019,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> with [[Glen Winter]] directing the pilot.<ref name=\"Winter\" /> Scott Peck was a director of photography on the series.<ref name=\"PeckDP\" /> Filming occurs throughout the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], including: [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Virginia\u2013Highland]], [[Duluth, Georgia|Duluth]], [[Lithia Springs, Georgia|Lithia Springs]], [[Dallas, Georgia|Dallas]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> [[Marietta Square]], [[West End, Atlanta|West End]], [[Westlake High School (Georgia)|Westlake High School]], the Atlanta Center for Medical Research,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Campbell Middle School, [[Paulding County, Georgia|Paulding County]], [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]], [[Arbor Place]] Mall, [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming3\" /> [[Mableton, Georgia|Mableton]], and [[Douglas County High School (Douglasville, Georgia)|Douglas County High School]].<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming4\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn June 2019, [[Pinar Toprak]] revealed she would be composing for the series.<ref name=\"Toprak\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Stargirl'' is scheduled to begin airing on DC Universe on May 18, 2020.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series was originally intended to begin airing on May 11, 2020.<ref name=\"OriginalReleaseDate\" /> In November 2019, it was announced that [[The CW]] would broadcast each episode the day after it premieres on the streaming service, with each episode available to stream on The CW's online platforms after its broadcast.<ref name=\"The CW\" /> It will start airing on The CW on May 19, 2020, at 8 pm.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series will air in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] on DC Universe.<ref name=\"DCUniverse4K\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nOn December 7, 2019, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"FirstTrailer\" />\n\n==Arrowverse==\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)}}\nStargirl and her team were briefly introduced in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" in January 2020.

In April 2020, Johns said, \"right now the main concern is making sure that this show is great, that these characters are great, that they have their own stories and they get the proper screen time and the proper episodes to develop on their own. So hopefully in the future we can do something fun, but the first season is all about making sure that ''Stargirl'' is the best show it can possibly be.\" Bassinger added that there had already been preliminary discussion about crossing over with ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and she was hopeful to be able to crossover with [[Melissa Benoist]] on ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Dominic |title=Geoff Johns To Write & Produce

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Sarah Schechter]], and Melissa Carter (who is co-showrunner with Johns).<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /><ref name=\"The CW\" /> Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] as the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role. On why Bassinger was perfect for the role, Johns said, \"Immediately... I knew she was Courtney. She has the humor, she has the enthusiasm, the energy, the innate optimism, and Brec really embodies who Stargirl is\".<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In November 2018, the following roles were cast: Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]],<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]], and Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> The next month, [[Joy Osmanski]] was cast as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]], [[Neil Hopkins]] was cast as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \u201cCrusher\u201d Crock / Sportsmaster]], and [[Nelson Lee]] was cast as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]], members of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In January 2019, [[Luke Wilson]] was cast as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> Cameron Gellman joined the cast as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]] the next month,<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> along with [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]],<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Trae Romano as Mike Dugan,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> and Hunter Sansone as Cameron.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"SansoneCWBio\" /> In February 2019, Jake Austin Walker was cast as Henry King Jr. and Meg Delacy was cast as Cindy Burman, rounding out the cast.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" /><ref name=\"WalkerCWBio\" />\n\nIn December 2018, the following members of the [[Justice Society of America]] were cast, all recurring roles: [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]],<ref name=\"McHale\" /> [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]],<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" /> Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]],<ref name=\"Stapf\" /> and [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]].<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> In April 2019, Hina Khan was cast in an undisclosed role said to be a principal.<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had begun by March 14, 2019,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> with [[Glen Winter]] directing the pilot.<ref name=\"Winter\" /> Scott Peck was a director of photography on the series.<ref name=\"PeckDP\" /> Filming occurs throughout the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], including: [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Virginia\u2013Highland]], [[Duluth, Georgia|Duluth]], [[Lithia Springs, Georgia|Lithia Springs]], [[Dallas, Georgia|Dallas]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> [[Marietta Square]], [[West End, Atlanta|West End]], [[Westlake High School (Georgia)|Westlake High School]], the Atlanta Center for Medical Research,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Campbell Middle School, [[Paulding County, Georgia|Paulding County]], [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]], [[Arbor Place]] Mall, [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming3\" /> [[Mableton, Georgia|Mableton]], and [[Douglas County High School (Douglasville, Georgia)|Douglas County High School]].<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming4\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn June 2019, [[Pinar Toprak]] revealed she would be composing for the series.<ref name=\"Toprak\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Stargirl'' is scheduled to begin airing on DC Universe on May 18, 2020.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series was originally intended to begin airing on May 11, 2020.<ref name=\"OriginalReleaseDate\" /> In November 2019, it was announced that [[The CW]] would broadcast each episode the day after it premieres on the streaming service, with each episode available to stream on The CW's online platforms after its broadcast.<ref name=\"The CW\" /> It will start airing on The CW on May 19, 2020, at 8 pm.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series will air in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] on DC Universe.<ref name=\"DCUniverse4K\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nOn December 7, 2019, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"FirstTrailer\" />\n\n==Arrowverse==\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)}}\nStargirl and her team were briefly introduced in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" in January 2020.

In April 2020, Johns said, \"right now the main concern is making sure that this show is great, that these characters are great, that they have their own stories and they get the proper screen time and the proper episodes to develop on their own. So hopefully in the future we can do something fun, but the first season is all about making sure that ''Stargirl'' is the best show it can possibly be.\" Bassinger added that there had already been preliminary discussion about crossing over with ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and she was hopeful to be able to crossover with [[Melissa Benoist]] on ''[[Supergirl (TV
