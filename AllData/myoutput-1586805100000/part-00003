Carrie reports this to Saul ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), along with the fact that the Russian government is now possessing the flight recorder.  Saul makes inquiries via the Russian ambassador Victor Makarov ([[Elya Baskin]]) as to what is Russia's price to give back the recorder.  Saul infers from the ambassador's cryptic responses that they have the recorder but are not interested in trading it.\n\nA disastrous meeting between President Hayes ([[Sam Trammell]]) and Ambassador Rashad ([[Samrat Chakrabarti]]) from Pakistan only increases the likelihood of nuclear conflict between the countries.  Wellington ([[Linus Roache]]) takes Rashad aside and, in order to de-escalate the situation, suggests that Pakistan release the U.S. special ops team that was arrested in Kohat.\n\nJalal (Elham Ehsas) plots an attack on the United States, against the advice of his second-in-command Balach (Seear Kohi).  Jalal orders that a car be filled with explosives which will be driven into the target.  Not satisfied with Balach's loyalty, Jalal commands that Balach himself will drive the car and die a martyr, else his family will be killed.\n\nCarrie is accosted by Yevgeny ([[Costa Ronin]]) after searching his now-empty apartment.   Yevgeny makes her an offer:  the only thing more valuable to Russia than the flight recorder is the identity of a double agent that Saul has placed very highly inside the Kremlin.   Carrie then goes to the CIA station in Kabul and turns herself in.   After a brief interrogation, Carrie demands a lawyer.   She is immediately arrested and put on a plane to be extradited to the United States.\n\nJenna ([[Andrea Deck]]) travels to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to greet the special ops team when they are released.  Balach, sitting in the car loaded with explosives, records a final message to his family on his phone.  He drives at high speed towards his target, which is the bus containing the special ops soldiers.  Border guards open fire on the car, attempting to stop him, but he crashes into the bus, triggering an explosion.\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was directed by [[Michael Offer]] and co-written by executive producers Patrick Harbinson and [[Chip Johannessen]].\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* [https://www.sho.com/homeland/season/8/episode/10/designated-driver \"Designated Driver\"] at [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]\n* {{IMDb episode|8355896|Designated Driver}}\n\n{{Homeland}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Designated Driver (''Homeland'')}}\n[[Category:2020 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Homeland (season 8) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Designated Driver\n| series       = [[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]\n| image        =\n| caption      = \n| season       = 8\n| episode      = 10\n| airdate      = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n| writer       = [[Chip Johannessen]]<br/>Patrick Harbinson\n| director     = [[Michael Offer]]\n| producer     = \n| guests       =\n*[[Sam Trammell]] as President Ben Hayes\n*Cliff Chamberlain as Mike Dunne\n*[[Andrea Deck]] as Jenna Bragg\n*Jason Tottenham as Alan Yager\n*Mohammad Amiri as Arman\n*Elham Ehsas as Jalal Haqqani\n*Seear Kohi as Balach\n*[[Karen Pittman]] as Vanessa Kroll\n*[[Elya Baskin]] as Victor Makarov\n*Michael Rabe as Chief Mechanic Worley\n*[[Samrat Chakrabarti]] as Ambassador Rashad\n*[[Hugh Dancy]] as John Zabel\n| production   = 8WAH10\n| length       = 57 minutes\n| season_article = Homeland (season 8)\n| episode_list = List of Homeland episodes\n| prev         = [[In Full Flight (Homeland)|In Full Flight]]\n| next         = \n}}\n\n\"'''Designated Driver'''\" is the tenth episode of the eighth season of the American television drama series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', and the 94th episode overall.
