The current members consist of:\n* [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]] - The Chinese heroine with wind-based powers.\n* [[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]] - The Korean-American former Hulk and supergenius.\n* [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent and Io]] - South Korean heroine and her magical bear.\n* [[Luna Snow]] - South Korean K-Pop idol with ice-based powers.\n* [[Shang-Chi]] - The Master of Kung-Fu.\n* [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] - The Korean-American [[Spider-Man]] ally.\n* [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] - The mystical sword wielding Chinese hero.\n* [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]] - The Filipina water manipulator.\n* [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]] - South Korean super spy and the last of the [[kumiho]].\n\nThe [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] Pakistani-American superheroine [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]] was offered membership along with the other Protectors but left to rejoin her original team [[Champions (2016 team)|the Champions]] in New York before she could accept the offer.  M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced android created by Jimmy and the Atlas foundation, briefly joined the team under the guise of the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (deity) |Pele]].  The Immortal Monkey King [[Sun Wukong]] of the Ascendants briefly assisted the team as well.\n\nWhen most of the Agents are summoned to the portal city of Pan, they are introduced to the current [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]], Raz Malhotra, who is informally recruited into Atlas by Amadeus when rejecting Mike Nguyen's offer to become Pan's protectors.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\nThe group was formed in Spring 1958 by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent [[Jimmy Woo]] to rescue President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] from the villainous [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]. Woo first recruits [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] and [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]]. He then tries to recruit [[Namora]], who declines but tells Woo where to find a broken but potentially useful robot named [[M-11 (comics)|M-11]]. While Marvel Boy fixes M-11, Woo asks [[Jann of the Jungle]] to take Marvel Boy to extend an invitation to [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Ken Hale)|Gorilla-Man]], who accepts Woo's offer. The group quickly rescues President Eisenhower and remains together for six months until the federal government, deciding the public is not ready for such a group, disbands it and classifies information about it.\n\nYears later, Woo, by now a high-ranking agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], attempts a secret raid of a group identified as the Atlas Foundation. Going [[AWOL]] and taking several other willing agents with him, Woo invades an Atlas location, resulting in all of the recruits being killed. Woo himself is critically burned and loses his higher brain functions. Gorilla-Man, by now also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, gives the organization a record of the 1950s team, of which S.H.I.E.L.D. had no knowledge, and rescues Woo with the aid of M-11 and Marvel Boy, who can only restore Woo to his 1958 self. Namora, whom the group believed dead, is located by the Agents and joins the group. The team learns M-11 is a [[double agent]] for the Yellow Claw, and that Venus is one of the legendary [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s given flesh, not the Venus/[[Aphrodite]] of mythological legend.\n\nUsing M-11 as a beacon, the heroes find the Yellow Claw, who reveals his true identity, Plan Chu, an almost immortal [[Mongol]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] who claims he orchestrated each of his battles with Woo only to establish Woo's worthiness to marry Suwan and succeed him as khan. Chu created Atlas to put Woo again in the spotlight. Woo accepts his destiny, takes over Atlas hoping to turn it into a force for good, and the Yellow Claw, having found his heir, appears to commit suicide. The team resurfaces in [[New York City]], where together with [[Spider-Man]], they defeat Temple of Atlas splinter cells still loyal to the Yellow Claw.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Family]]'' #4</ref> \n\nThey later work as a resistance cell against the [[Secret Invasion|invasion of Earth]] by the shapeshifting aliens the [[Skrulls]].<ref name= resistance /> Following the Skrulls' defeat and the [[Dark Reign (comics)|rise]] of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to power, the Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of \"supervillains.\" They attack [[Fort Knox]] and steal the gold reserve, which Osborn had planned on using to finance a secret weapons system.<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign: New Nation]]'' one-shot</ref>\n\nThe Agents of Atlas encounter (and battle) the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1\u20134</ref> the X-Men,<ref>''X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1\u20132</ref> fight Norman Osborn's [[Thunderbolts (comics) |Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #139\u2013140</ref> and later investigate an abandoned Thule Society headquarters during the events of ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]''.\n\n[[File:New Agents of Atlas.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The New Agents of Atlas.  Art by Jung-Geun Yoon.]] \nDuring the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' event, while Jimmy offers his Protectors teammates ([[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] and [[Kamala Kahn|Ms. Marvel]]) membership to Atlas, they are suddenly alerted by the news of [[War of the Realms|Malekith's invasion of Earth]].   Most of the New Agents of Atlas head to [[Seoul]] while Ms. Marvel joins the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] in New York.  The Agents defend Seoul from Malekith's ally Queen Sindr and her Fire Goblin forces from [[Muspelheim]] with help from the Korean heroes [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]], [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent, Io]] and [[Luna Snow]].<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After Sindr threatens to summon a volcano in the middle of the city and kill millions of innocents, Brawn teleports Atlas and their new allies away from the battle, allowing Sindr to peacefully annex [[South Korea]].  Brawn eventually summons the Chinese heroes [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] and [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]], [[Philippines|Filipina]] heroine [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]] and the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] goddess of Fire and Volcanoes [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] from [[Shanghai]] to help assist in the fight against Sindr.  The newly summoned heroes are less than pleased for being taken out of their previous battle, but Pele quickly puts a stop to the infighting, warning the group that Sindr plans to melt the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice caps]] if they don't work together.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After formulating a plan, Brawn confronts Sindr and her forces directly while Aero, Wave and Luna use Sindr's Black Bifrost to travel to the [[Arctic]] to decrease its temperature with their powers; the remaining members are teleported to Atlas' ally [[Sun Wukong]] of the Ascendants in Northern China where Shang-Chi begins training the remaining members for their final fight.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref>  As planned by Brawn, the Queen of Cinders and her forces arrive in Northern China with a captured Brawn, only to be taken by surprise by the Agents; Pele reveals herself to be M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced Atlas Android, who then absorbs Sindr's energy and self-destructs, weakening her.  With Shang-Chi's training the group defeats her, although at the cost of Sun Wukong sacrificing himself.  Despite being given the chance by Jimmy to surrender, Sindr flees using the Black Bifrost, only for the Agents to follow her with Brawn's teleporter, where they help [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat her and her remaining forces at the [[Great Wall of China]] near [[Beijing]].  After Malekith's defeat, the Agents are seen in [[Shanghai]] looking on while the captured Fire Goblins are escorted back to Muspelheim.  Jimmy quietly congratulates his new agents.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #4. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nShortly after the ''War of the Realms'' event, a few members of the new agents are in [[Madripoor]] fighting one of Sindr's remaining Fire Dragons, where they encounter Isaac Ikeda, the self-proclaimed \"Protector of Pan\", who uses his technologically advanced weaponry to slay the dragon and teleports away with its corpse.  Afterwards, the team goes their separate ways, only to find the cities they are each residing in engulfed in a white light, which Amadeus recognizes as Ikeda's teleportation technology.  The reunited agents along with [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]] discover the cities they were in (along with other Asian, Pacific and [[Ethnic enclave|predominantly Asian cities outside of Asia]]) have been merged and connected together with portals made from Ikeda's technology.  Mike Nguyen of the Big Nguyen Company reveals himself to be behind the newly merged city, \"Pan\", which he states for 24 hours would allow every citizen to easily explore each other's respective cities without any political and economic restrictions.  Shortly after the announcement, Pan is suddenly beset by [[Wyvern|wyverns]], which the agents, Giant-Man and Ikeda fight off.<ref name=\"AoA 3-1\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics</ref>  Concurrently, the original agents are sent by Jimmy to a temple in [[Thailand]] to rescue [[List_of_Avengers_members#Infiltrators|Avenger X]] from General Nurong and his forces.  During the mission, the group encounters Nurong's master, a dragon named Mr. Thong, who reveals himself to be an enemy of Mr. Lao.  Thong mocks the group as being pawns for Lao and warns them of the upcoming ''Clash of Dragons''.<ref name=\"AoA 3-1\" />  After fighting off the wyverns, the new agents are praised by Nguyen for their heroics and offers to enlist the agents as Pan's protectors along with Ikeda.  Amadeus is suspicious of Nguyen and Ikeda, believing that Atlas is being used for publicity.  Amadeus and Luna later have a confrontation with several armed members of the Pan Guard, who attempt to arrest a group of Madripoorian refugees that Amadeus and Luna rescued from [[Sea serpents|sea serpents]] for illegally trespassing into Pan. The rescue, fight with the Pan guard and subsequent kiss between Amadeus and Luna is broadcast by Nguyen as an attempt to sell Pan Passes to spectators,<ref name=\"AoA 3-2\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #2. Marvel Comics</ref> much to Amadeus' and Luna's embarrassment and anger.  After the Atlas agents and Ikeda team up with the Pan Guard to save the refugees from the serpents, Nguyen clears up the misunderstanding, claiming that the Madripoorians had been out of range during Pan's activation and the Pan Guard mistakenly believed they were trespassing with help from the serpents; Nguyen has the refugees escorted to the Pan Grand Hotel as special guests.  When Amadeus summons the team to the Atlas secret bunker in Seoul, they are unexpectedly joined by Ikeda.  When Ikeda is interrogated by the team about his and Nguyen's motives, Issac explains that he was hired by Nguyen due to his expertise in fighting dragons, but offers little about Nguyen.  Isacc has his own suspicions of Mike and suggests that the Atlas agents to join him as Pan's protectors as it would be easier for them to gather information about the Big Nguyen Company on the inside.  Despite some misgivings, the team agrees and go their separate ways to different Pan sectors.  Unbeknownst to the agents, their actions are being monitored by Jimmy and Mr. Lao, with the latter believing the new team isn't ready to be trusted yet.<ref name=\"AoA 3-3\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #3. Marvel Comics</ref>  The team makes several discoveries during their investigations: Brawn, Silk and White Fox realize that the central hub of Pan doesn't correspond with any known location on Earth, which Amadeus deduces is in another dimension, as well as the sound of roaring dragons emerging from Nguyen's tower during nighttime; while searching for the apparently absent Jimmy Woo, Shang-Chi and Crescent infiltrate his office in Mumbai where Shang discovers a photograph of Jimmy and Nguyen shaking hands.<ref name=\"AoA 3-4\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #4. Marvel Comics</ref>  While Shang-Chi relays this to Amadeus, he also uncovers a laptop that broadcasts the sound of a dragon's roar from Nguyen's tower in the Heart of Pan.  While Brawn, Silk, Sword Master and White Fox break into Nguyen's tower and discover a sea serpent imprisoned in a lab, Shang-Chi and Crescent discover a secret tunnel in Jimmy's office that takes them to the Atlas Foundation's headquarters in the Pan sector of San Francisco, where they come face to face with Jimmy and Mr. Lao, who introduces himself to the Atlas agents.  Nguyen denies that he and Jimmy are in league with each other, other than signing nonagression treaty between Atlas and Pan, which the agents just violated.  Nguyen explains that since dragon scales contain magical properties associated with portals and teleportation, the imprisoned dragon was having its scales harvested to supply Pan's portal and teleportation technology.  Suspecting the serpent's identity, Lao and Jimmy order to agents to free her lest awakening the wrath every dragon on the planet, while Nguyen and Ikeda argue that releasing the dragon will cause the portals to collapse, displacing every citizen and refugee that had settled in the portal-city.  Before a decision can be made, a massive storm begins engulfing the city.  While Ikeda reveals that the imprisoned dragon, which he captured a year ago for terrorizing the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], is from [[Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe#Regions_and_countries|Atlantis]], an enraged [[Namor]] emerges from the waters off of Pan's coast and [[Atlantis_Attacks#Atlantis_Attacks_(2020)|begins invading the city]].<ref name=\"AoA 3-5\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #5. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Atlantis_Attacks#Atlantis_Attacks_(2020)|Atlantis Attacks]]'' storyline, the New Agents of Atlas fight off Namor when he attempts to reclaim the sacred dragon of Atlantis from Pan.  Before retreating, Namor gives them one day to return the dragon or else face the wrath of Atlantis.  After the skirmish, Jimmy formally introduces the original and new teams to each other.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #1</ref>  Jimmy proceeds to deploy the agents to help bolster Pan's defenses, with Namora, Venus, Wave and Aero being sent on a diplomatic mission to Atlantis.  Wary of Namora's familial relationship with Namor, Brawn discretely orders Shang-Chi and Sword Master to spy on her.  After Brawn, Uranian, and 3-D Man are able to successfully able to replicate the dragon's magic with M-11's generator, Atlas releases the dragon who promptly returns back to Atlantis.  However upon arriving at the underwater kingdom, the dragon goes berserk and beings attacking.  After Atlantis' scientists discover the source of the dragon's behavior to be an implant embedded in its scales, Namor accuses Brawn to be behind the deception and immediately flies to Pan for revenge, where he viciously assaults Brawn and attacks Nguyen's tower.  After the Pan Guard and Brawn are able to push Namor's assault back to the ocean, Nguyen reveals that he has recruited the Sirenas, the longtime enemies of Atlantis, to help defend Pan.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #2</ref>  With help from the Sirenas, Namor is eventually overpowered and imprisoned.  During a meeting between the Agents of Atlas, the Pan Guard and the Sirenas, a disagreement erupts when Nguyen and the Sirenas' leader Sea Hunter propose to launch a retaliatory attack Atlantis.  Namora accuses the Sirenas of treachery, revealing the dragon's implant to be made from Sirena tech.  After Namora and Carina of the Sirenas recount their people's history, the group finds itself torn between protecting Pan, attacking or defending Atlantis. The disagreement eventually escalates into trading blows when several members within the group take sides between the Atlanteans and the Sirenas. During the commotion, Namor is able to break free from his prison.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #3</ref>\n\n==Temple of Atlas==\nAs part of a [[viral marketing]] strategy to promote the series, fans could participate in an [[alternate reality game]] centered around the \"Temple of Atlas\" [[weblog]] on Marvel's website. There, readers received weekly prose excerpts of the exploits of Jimmy Woo and his team, and were given \"missions\" from the Temple's curator, the mysterious \"Mr. Lao\". The goal was to discover each week's keyword by following textual clues Lao would post on the messageboards of such comic book [[webzines]] as ''[[Newsarama]]'' and ''[[Comic Book Resources]]''. They, along with [[IGN.com]] and ''[[Comics Bulletin]]'', would also feature fake news posts that players would be led toward, containing more clues for finding keywords. Anagrams were regular, and on several occasions one keyword had to be taken \"into the field\" by going to a local comic shop and saying the phrase to the staff in order to receive a keyword in response. On two occasions, players were required to attend a [[Heroes Convention]] and the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] [[Comic-Con International]] to find keywords.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the [[Marvel Adventures]]: Avengers universe, a time travel story involved a 1958 version of the Agents of Atlas that found [[Captain America]] frozen in ice. The special was written by Jeff Parker and penciled by Leonard Kirk, same creative team as the Agents of Atlas miniseries.\n\n==In other media==\n* The Agents of Atlas appeared in ''[[Lego Marvel Superheroes 2]]'' as [[downloadable content|DLC]] (downloadable content).

M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced android created by Jimmy and the Atlas foundation, briefly joined the team under the guise of the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (deity) |Pele]].  The Immortal Monkey King [[Sun Wukong]] of the Ascendants briefly assisted the team as well.\n\nWhen most of the Agents are summoned to the portal city of Pan, they are introduced to the current [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]], Raz Malhotra, who is informally recruited into Atlas by Amadeus when rejecting Mike Nguyen's offer to become Pan's protectors.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\nThe group was formed in Spring 1958 by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent [[Jimmy Woo]] to rescue President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] from the villainous [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]. Woo first recruits [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] and [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]]. He then tries to recruit [[Namora]], who declines but tells Woo where to find a broken but potentially useful robot named [[M-11 (comics)|M-11]]. While Marvel Boy fixes M-11, Woo asks [[Jann of the Jungle]] to take Marvel Boy to extend an invitation to [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Ken Hale)|Gorilla-Man]], who accepts Woo's offer. The group quickly rescues President Eisenhower and remains together for six months until the federal government, deciding the public is not ready for such a group, disbands it and classifies information about it.\n\nYears later, Woo, by now a high-ranking agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], attempts a secret raid of a group identified as the Atlas Foundation. Going [[AWOL]] and taking several other willing agents with him, Woo invades an Atlas location, resulting in all of the recruits being killed. Woo himself is critically burned and loses his higher brain functions. Gorilla-Man, by now also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, gives the organization a record of the 1950s team, of which S.H.I.E.L.D. had no knowledge, and rescues Woo with the aid of M-11 and Marvel Boy, who can only restore Woo to his 1958 self. Namora, whom the group believed dead, is located by the Agents and joins the group. The team learns M-11 is a [[double agent]] for the Yellow Claw, and that Venus is one of the legendary [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s given flesh, not the Venus/[[Aphrodite]] of mythological legend.\n\nUsing M-11 as a beacon, the heroes find the Yellow Claw, who reveals his true identity, Plan Chu, an almost immortal [[Mongol]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] who claims he orchestrated each of his battles with Woo only to establish Woo's worthiness to marry Suwan and succeed him as khan. Chu created Atlas to put Woo again in the spotlight. Woo accepts his destiny, takes over Atlas hoping to turn it into a force for good, and the Yellow Claw, having found his heir, appears to commit suicide. The team resurfaces in [[New York City]], where together with [[Spider-Man]], they defeat Temple of Atlas splinter cells still loyal to the Yellow Claw.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Family]]'' #4</ref> \n\nThey later work as a resistance cell against the [[Secret Invasion|invasion of Earth]] by the shapeshifting aliens the [[Skrulls]].<ref name= resistance /> Following the Skrulls' defeat and the [[Dark Reign (comics)|rise]] of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to power, the Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of \"supervillains.\" They attack [[Fort Knox]] and steal the gold reserve, which Osborn had planned on using to finance a secret weapons system.<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign: New Nation]]'' one-shot</ref>\n\nThe Agents of Atlas encounter (and battle) the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1\u20134</ref> the X-Men,<ref>''X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1\u20132</ref> fight Norman Osborn's [[Thunderbolts (comics) |Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #139\u2013140</ref> and later investigate an abandoned Thule Society headquarters during the events of ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]''.\n\n[[File:New Agents of Atlas.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The New Agents of Atlas.  Art by Jung-Geun Yoon.]] \nDuring the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' event, while Jimmy offers his Protectors teammates ([[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] and [[Kamala Kahn|Ms. Marvel]]) membership to Atlas, they are suddenly alerted by the news of [[War of the Realms|Malekith's invasion of Earth]].   Most of the New Agents of Atlas head to [[Seoul]] while Ms. Marvel joins the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] in New York.  The Agents defend Seoul from Malekith's ally Queen Sindr and her Fire Goblin forces from [[Muspelheim]] with help from the Korean heroes [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]], [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent, Io]] and [[Luna Snow]].<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After Sindr threatens to summon a volcano in the middle of the city and kill millions of innocents, Brawn teleports Atlas and their new allies away from the battle, allowing Sindr to peacefully annex [[South Korea]].  Brawn eventually summons the Chinese heroes [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] and [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]], [[Philippines|Filipina]] heroine [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]] and the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] goddess of Fire and Volcanoes [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] from [[Shanghai]] to help assist in the fight against Sindr.  The newly summoned heroes are less than pleased for being taken out of their previous battle, but Pele quickly puts a stop to the infighting, warning the group that Sindr plans to melt the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice caps]] if they don't work together.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After formulating a plan, Brawn confronts Sindr and her forces directly while Aero, Wave and Luna use Sindr's Black Bifrost to travel to the [[Arctic]] to decrease its temperature with their powers; the remaining members are teleported to Atlas' ally [[Sun Wukong]] of the Ascendants in Northern China where Shang-Chi begins training the remaining members for their final fight.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref>  As planned by Brawn, the Queen of Cinders and her forces arrive in Northern China with a captured Brawn, only to be taken by surprise by the Agents; Pele reveals herself to be M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced Atlas Android, who then absorbs Sindr's energy and self-destructs, weakening her.  With Shang-Chi's training the group defeats her, although at the cost of Sun Wukong sacrificing himself.  Despite being given the chance by Jimmy to surrender, Sindr flees using the Black Bifrost, only for the Agents to follow her with Brawn's teleporter, where they help [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat her and her remaining forces at the [[Great Wall of China]] near [[Beijing]].  After Malekith's defeat, the Agents are seen in [[Shanghai]] looking on while the captured Fire Goblins are escorted back to Muspelheim.  Jimmy quietly congratulates his new agents.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #4. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nShortly after the ''War of the Realms'' event, a few members of the new agents are in [[Madripoor]] fighting one of Sindr's remaining Fire Dragons, where they encounter Isaac Ikeda, the self-proclaimed \"Protector of Pan\", who uses his technologically advanced weaponry to slay the dragon and teleports away with its corpse.  Afterwards, the team goes their separate ways, only to find the cities they are each residing in engulfed in a white light, which Amadeus recognizes as Ikeda's teleportation technology.  The reunited agents along with [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]] discover the cities they were in (along with other Asian, Pacific and [[Ethnic enclave|predominantly Asian cities outside of Asia]]) have been merged and connected together with portals made from Ikeda's technology.  Mike Nguyen of the Big Nguyen Company reveals himself to be behind the newly merged city, \"Pan\", which he states for 24 hours would allow every citizen to easily explore each other's respective cities without any political and economic restrictions.  Shortly after the announcement, Pan is suddenly beset by [[Wyvern|wyverns]], which the agents, Giant-Man and Ikeda fight off.<ref name=\"AoA 3-1\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics</ref>  Concurrently, the original agents are sent by Jimmy to a temple in [[Thailand]] to rescue [[List_of_Avengers_members#Infiltrators|Avenger X]] from General Nurong and his forces.  During the mission, the group encounters Nurong's master, a dragon named Mr. Thong, who reveals himself to be an enemy of Mr. Lao.  Thong mocks the group as being pawns for Lao and warns them of the upcoming ''Clash of Dragons''.<ref name=\"AoA 3-1\" />  After fighting off the wyverns, the new agents are praised by Nguyen for their heroics and offers to enlist the agents as Pan's protectors along with Ikeda.  Amadeus is suspicious of Nguyen and Ikeda, believing that Atlas is being used for publicity.  Amadeus and Luna later have a confrontation with several armed members of the Pan Guard, who attempt to arrest a group of Madripoorian refugees that Amadeus and Luna rescued from [[Sea serpents|sea serpents]] for illegally trespassing into Pan. The rescue, fight with the Pan guard and subsequent kiss between Amadeus and Luna is broadcast by Nguyen as an attempt to sell Pan Passes to spectators,<ref name=\"AoA 3-2\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #2. Marvel Comics</ref> much to Amadeus' and Luna's embarrassment and anger.  After the Atlas agents and Ikeda team up with the Pan Guard to save the refugees from the serpents, Nguyen clears up the misunderstanding, claiming that the Madripoorians had been out of range during Pan's activation and the Pan Guard mistakenly believed they were trespassing with help from the serpents; Nguyen has the refugees escorted to the Pan Grand Hotel as special guests.  When Amadeus summons the team to the Atlas secret bunker in Seoul, they are unexpectedly joined by Ikeda.  When Ikeda is interrogated by the team about his and Nguyen's motives, Issac explains that he was hired by Nguyen due to his expertise in fighting dragons, but offers little about Nguyen.  Isacc has his own suspicions of Mike and suggests that the Atlas agents to join him as Pan's protectors as it would be easier for them to gather information about the Big Nguyen Company on the inside.  Despite some misgivings, the team agrees and go their separate ways to different Pan sectors.  Unbeknownst to the agents, their actions are being monitored by Jimmy and Mr. Lao, with the latter believing the new team isn't ready to be trusted yet.<ref name=\"AoA 3-3\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #3. Marvel Comics</ref>  The team makes several discoveries during their investigations: Brawn, Silk and White Fox realize that the central hub of Pan doesn't correspond with any known location on Earth, which Amadeus deduces is in another dimension, as well as the sound of roaring dragons emerging from Nguyen's tower during nighttime; while searching for the apparently absent Jimmy Woo, Shang-Chi and Crescent infiltrate his office in Mumbai where Shang discovers a photograph of Jimmy and Nguyen shaking hands.<ref name=\"AoA 3-4\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #4. Marvel Comics</ref>  While Shang-Chi relays this to Amadeus, he also uncovers a laptop that broadcasts the sound of a dragon's roar from Nguyen's tower in the Heart of Pan.  While Brawn, Silk, Sword Master and White Fox break into Nguyen's tower and discover a sea serpent imprisoned in a lab, Shang-Chi and Crescent discover a secret tunnel in Jimmy's office that takes them to the Atlas Foundation's headquarters in the Pan sector of San Francisco, where they come face to face with Jimmy and Mr. Lao, who introduces himself to the Atlas agents.  Nguyen denies that he and Jimmy are in league with each other, other than signing nonagression treaty between Atlas and Pan, which the agents just violated.  Nguyen explains that since dragon scales contain magical properties associated with portals and teleportation, the imprisoned dragon was having its scales harvested to supply Pan's portal and teleportation technology.  Suspecting the serpent's identity, Lao and Jimmy order to agents to free her lest awakening the wrath every dragon on the planet, while Nguyen and Ikeda argue that releasing the dragon will cause the portals to collapse, displacing every citizen and refugee that had settled in the portal-city.  Before a decision can be made, a massive storm begins engulfing the city.  While Ikeda reveals that the imprisoned dragon, which he captured a year ago for terrorizing the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], is from [[Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe#Regions_and_countries|Atlantis]], an enraged [[Namor]] emerges from the waters off of Pan's coast and [[Atlantis_Attacks#Atlantis_Attacks_(2020)|begins invading the city]].<ref name=\"AoA 3-5\">''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #5. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Atlantis_Attacks#Atlantis_Attacks_(2020)|Atlantis Attacks]]'' storyline, the New Agents of Atlas fight off Namor when he attempts to reclaim the sacred dragon of Atlantis from Pan.  Before retreating, Namor gives them one day to return the dragon or else face the wrath of Atlantis.  After the skirmish, Jimmy formally introduces the original and new teams to each other.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #1</ref>  Jimmy proceeds to deploy the agents to help bolster Pan's defenses, with Namora, Venus, Wave and Aero being sent on a diplomatic mission to Atlantis.  Wary of Namora's familial relationship with Namor, Brawn discretely orders Shang-Chi and Sword Master to spy on her.  After Brawn, Uranian, and 3-D Man are able to successfully able to replicate the dragon's magic with M-11's generator, Atlas releases the dragon who promptly returns back to Atlantis.  However upon arriving at the underwater kingdom, the dragon goes berserk and beings attacking.  After Atlantis' scientists discover the source of the dragon's behavior to be an implant embedded in its scales, Namor accuses Brawn to be behind the deception and immediately flies to Pan for revenge, where he viciously assaults Brawn and attacks Nguyen's tower.  After the Pan Guard and Brawn are able to push Namor's assault back to the ocean, Nguyen reveals that he has recruited the Sirenas, the longtime enemies of Atlantis, to help defend Pan.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #2</ref>  With help from the Sirenas, Namor is eventually overpowered and imprisoned.  During a meeting between the Agents of Atlas, the Pan Guard and the Sirenas, a disagreement erupts when Nguyen and the Sirenas' leader Sea Hunter propose to launch a retaliatory attack Atlantis.  Namora accuses the Sirenas of treachery, revealing the dragon's implant to be made from Sirena tech.  After Namora and Carina of the Sirenas recount their people's history, the group finds itself torn between protecting Pan, attacking or defending Atlantis. The disagreement eventually escalates into trading blows when several members within the group take sides between the Atlanteans and the Sirenas. During the commotion, Namor is able to break free from his prison.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' Vol 1 #3</ref>\n\n==Temple of Atlas==\nAs part of a [[viral marketing]] strategy to promote the series, fans could participate in an [[alternate reality game]] centered around the \"Temple of Atlas\" [[weblog]] on Marvel's website. There, readers received weekly prose excerpts of the exploits of Jimmy Woo and his team, and were given \"missions\" from the Temple's curator, the mysterious \"Mr. Lao\". The goal was to discover each week's keyword by following textual clues Lao would post on the messageboards of such comic book [[webzines]] as ''[[Newsarama]]'' and ''[[Comic Book Resources]]''. They, along with [[IGN.com]] and ''[[Comics Bulletin]]'', would also feature fake news posts that players would be led toward, containing more clues for finding keywords. Anagrams were regular, and on several occasions one keyword had to be taken \"into the field\" by going to a local comic shop and saying the phrase to the staff in order to receive a keyword in response. On two occasions, players were required to attend a [[Heroes Convention]] and the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] [[Comic-Con International]] to find keywords.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the [[Marvel Adventures]]: Avengers universe, a time travel story involved a 1958 version of the Agents of Atlas that found [[Captain America]] frozen in ice. The special was written by Jeff Parker and penciled by Leonard Kirk, same creative team as the Agents of Atlas miniseries.\n\n==In other media==\n* The Agents of Atlas appeared in ''[[Lego Marvel Superheroes 2]]'' as [[downloadable content|DLC]] (downloadable content).
