Their language is also called [[Nuxalk language|Nuxalk]]. Their tribal government is the [[Nuxalk Nation]].\n\n==Name and tribes/groups==\nThe name \"Bella Coola\", often used in academic writing, is not preferred by the Nuxalk; it is a derivation of the neighbouring coastal [[Heiltsuk]] people's name for the Nuxalk, ''b\u1e37\u0301x\u02b7l\u00e1'' (rendered ''plxwla'' in Nuxalk orthography), meaning \"stranger\".\n\nThe Nuxalk peoples, known today collectively as '''Nuxalkmc''', are made up of lineages representing several ancestral villages within their territory. From Kimsquit, known as ''Sutslhm'' in the Nuxalk language, come the Sutslhmc. From the '''[[Dean River]]''' come the Nutl'lmc, as well as lineages from the upper Dean River.  From ''[[South Bentinck Arm]]'' (Ats'aaxlh) come the Talyumc of [[Tallheo, British Columbia|Tallheo]], from the villages at the Nuwikw, Talyu and Asiiqw rivers. From '''Kwalhna'''/'''Kwatna''', [[Kwatna Inlet]], come the Kwalhnmc, from several villages. From [[King Island (British Columbia)|King Island]] (Ista) come the Istamc, and from the [[Bella Coola River]] (Nuxalk) come the Nuxalk-mc, from some [[list of Nuxalk villages|twenty five Nuxalk villages]] extending all the way up to [[Stuie|Stuwic]] and beyond up both the [[Atnarko]] and [[Talchako River|Talchako]] rivers.  These were all gathered in their current location in the [[Bella Coola Valley]] (Nuxalk) by a combination of negotiation with Chief Pootlass and through government pressure, settling together based on cultural and linguistic similarities, reinforced by a large number of marriages arranged to ease the transition. As all these communities now resided on the Nuxalk river, they took the collective name of Nuxalkmc, and their language has also come to be knows as ItNuxalkmc.
