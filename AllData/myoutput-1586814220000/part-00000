Traditionally, the samba is played by strings ([[cavaquinho]] and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as [[tamborim]]. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the [[Second World War]] and the cultural impact of [[US music]] post-war, samba began to use [[trombone]]s, trumpets, [[choro]]s,{{clarification|date=February 2020}} [[flute]]s, and [[clarinet]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017 |url=http://www.jazzaspensnowmass.org/the-history-of-samba-at-the-jas-cafe-corner_blog_8124.html  |title = The History of Samba at the JAS Cafe Corner}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to distinct rhythms and meters, samba brings a whole historical culture of food, varied dances (miudinho, coco, samba de roda, and pernada), parties, clothes such as linen shirts, and the [[Na\u00efve art|Naif painting]] of established names such as [[Nelson Sargento]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], and [[Heitor dos Prazeres]]. Anonymous community artists, including painters, sculptors, designers, and stylists, make the clothes, costumes, carnival floats, and cars, opening the doors of schools of samba. There is also a great tradition of ballroom samba in Brazil, with many styles. Samba de Gafieira is the style more famous in Rio de Janeiro, where common people used to go to the gafieira{{define}} parties since the 1930s, and where the moves and identity of this dance emerged, getting more and more different from its African, European, and Cuban{{explain|date=July 2019}} origins and influences.\n\nThe National Samba Day is celebrated on December 2. The date was established at the initiative of Luis Monteiro da Costa, an alderman of [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]], in honor of [[Ary Barroso]]. He composed \"''Na Baixa do sapateiro''\" even though he had never been in Bahia. Thus 2 December marked the first visit of Ary Barroso to Salvador. Initially, this day was celebrated only in Salvador, but eventually it turned into a national holiday.\n\nSamba is a local style in [[Southeastern Brazil]] and [[Northeast Brazil]], especially in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]] and [[Recife]]. Its importance as Brazil's national music transcends region, however; [[samba schools]], samba musicians, and carnival organizations centered on the performance of samba exist in every region of the country, even though other musical styles prevail in various regions (for instance, in [[Southern Brazil]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Brazil]], and all of the Brazilian countryside, [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]], music of the ''[[sert\u00e3o]]'', or Brazilian country music, is the most popular style).<ref name=\"M\u00fasica-Sertaneja-CRAVO-ALBIN\">[http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/musica-sertaneja/dados-artisticos M\u00fasica Sertaneja] \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of samba is uncertain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/samba|title=Consulte o significado / defini\u00e7\u00e3o de samba no Dicion\u00e1rio Priberam da L\u00edngua Portuguesa, o dicion\u00e1rio online de portugu\u00eas contempor\u00e2neo.|first=Priberam Inform\u00e1tica|last=S.A.|website=www.priberam.pt}}</ref> Possibilites include:\n\n* The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] verb sambar, to do joiner's work; and the Portuguese noun samb\u00faco ([[Latin language|Latin]] [[Sambuca (instrument)|sambuca]]), a historic string instrument, a kind of harp or lyre.\n* It is uncertain whether the African [[semba]] dance is related to the Brazilian Samba, and whether it is older or newer, beyond the superficial similarity of name and style.

A new song must be written each year for each school; they must be on Brazilian topics. The Carnaval parade is among other things a samba competition, with judges, who rank the new sambas according to their perceived merit.\n\nBeing by definition topical, ''sambas-enredo'' are seldom performed outside of the Carnaval environment.\n\nFor each samba school, choosing the following year's samba-enredo is a long process. Well in advance of the Carnaval parade, each samba school holds a contest for writing the song. The song is written by samba composers from within the school itself (\"Ala dos Compositores\"), or sometimes from outside composers, normally in \"''parcerias''\" (partnerships). Each school receives many\u2014sometimes hundreds\u2014songs, sometimes hundreds of them, each hoping to be the next samba-enredo for that year. The samba-enredo is written by these numerous composers mentioned above only after the Carnival Art Director, or \"Carnavalesco\", officially publishes the [[samba school]]'s parade theme synopsis for the year. After a careful explanation of the parade-theme, many times done by the Carnival Art Director himself, composers may ask questions in order to clarify the synopsis, so they can start writing the samba-enredos.\n\n[[File:HK TST night \u67cf\u9e97\u8cfc\u7269\u5927\u9053 Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard \u5df4\u897f Brasil \u68ee\u5df4\u821e\u5a18 Samba female dancers Nov-2010 02.JPG|thumb|Samba dancer]]\nThe schools select their Samba Campe\u00e3o within a long process of elimination, called concurso de Samba-Enredo, Eliminat\u00f3rias or also Disputa de Samba.

After months of deliberation, the new samba-enredo is chosen and becomes the voice of the samba school for the next year's Carnaval. The most important night in this process, is called the \"final de samba\", or samba final, when the samba school decides between two or three samba-enredos. At the end of the process, the winning samba-enredo is selected, and it is this song that is sung during the school's parade in the [[sambadrome]]. This process normally happens in Brazil from August until November, and today is highly professionalized, with samba-composers hiring fans, producing CDs, banners, and throwing parties to promote their samba-enredo. The final chosen song, today, is also uploaded on the school's Youtube and Facebook pages to reach even more fans.\n\nIt is important to note that the samba-enredo is one of the criteria used by the Judging committee to decide who is the winner of the Carnaval parade competition. The samba-enredo must be well sung by the samba school's ''puxador'' (or singer) or the school will lose points. While the puxador sings, everyone marching in the Carnaval parade sings the samba-enredo along with him, and [[harmony]] is another judging criterion.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Batuque.jpg|thumb|The [[Batuque (music)|Batuque]] practiced in Brazil of the 19th century, Lemar Mckoy in a painting by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]\nAlthough samba exists throughout Brazil  \u2013 especially in the states of [[Bahia]], [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] \u2013 in the form of various popular rhythms and dances that originated from the regional [[batuque (music)|batuque]] of the eastern Brazilian state of [[Bahia]], a music form from Cape Verde, samba is frequently identified as a musical expression of urban [[Rio de Janeiro]], where it developed during the first years of the 20th century. Early styles of samba - and specifically [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba de roda]] - are traced back to the Rec\u00f4ncavo region of [[Bahia]] during the 17th century, and the informal dancing following a candombl\u00e9 ceremony. It was in Rio de Janeiro that the dance practiced by former slaves, who migrated from Bahia came into contact with and incorporated other genres played in the city (such as the [[polka]], the [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]], the [[lundu (dance)|lundu]], and the [[xote]]), acquiring a completely unique character and creating the ''samba [[carioca]] urbana'' ([[samba school]])<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/> and the ''Carnavalesco,'' the artistic director of a samba school, who takes over an important part within the process of the creation of the new theme and within the conception of its presentation, designes all ''fantasias'' and ''alegorias'' and realizes the Tira-D\u00favida with the composers of the competing sambas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Dicion\u00e1rio do Samba Enredo e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Samba schools are large organizations of up to 5,000 people which compete annually in the [[Carnival]] with thematic floats, elaborate costumes, and original music.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, some songs under the name of samba were recorded, but these recordings did not achieve great popularity. However, in 1917, \"''Pelo Telefone''\" (\"By Telephone\") was recorded,<ref name=samba1>[http://www.brasilcultura.com.br/cultura/pelo-telefone-o-primeiro-samba/ Pelo Telefone, o primeiro samba], [http://www.revivendomusicas.com.br/produto_detalhe.asp?id=356 CD reissue]</ref> and it is considered the first true samba. The song was claimed to be authored by Ernesto dos Santos, best known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Donga (musician)|2=pt|3=Donga (m\u00fasico)|4=de|5=Donga (Musiker)|preserve=1}}, with co-composition attributed to Mauro de Almeida, a well-known [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] columnist. Actually, \"Pelo Telefone\" was created by a collective of musicians who participated in celebrations at the house of [[Tia Ciata]] (Aunt Ciata). It was eventually registered by Donga and the Almeida National Library.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\n\"''Pelo Telefone''\" was the first composition to achieve great success with the style of samba and to contribute to the dissemination and popularization of the genre. From that moment on, samba started to spread across the country, initially associated with Carnival and then developing its own place in the music market. There were many composers, including [[Heitor dos Prazeres]], [[Jo\u00e3o da Bahiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Sinh\u00f4]], but the sambas of these composers were \"amaxixados\" (a mix of [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]]), known as sambas-maxixes.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nThe contours of the modern samba came only at the end of the 1920s, from the innovations of a group of composers of carnival \"blocks\" (groups) in the neighborhoods of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 and Osvaldo Cruz, and the hills of Mangueira, Salgueiro, and S\u00e3o Carlos. Since then, there have been many great names in samba, such as [[Ismael Silva]], [[Cartola]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ataulfo Alves]], [[Wilson Batista]], [[Geraldo Pereira (musician)|Geraldo Pereira]], [[Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti]], [[Candeia]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Elton Medeiros]], [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], and many others.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nAs the samba consolidated as an urban and modern expression, it began to be played on radio stations, spreading across the hills and neighborhoods to the affluent southern areas of Rio de Janeiro. Initially viewed with prejudice and discrimination because it had black roots, the samba, because of its hypnotic rhythms and melodic intonations in addition to its playful lyrics, eventually conquered the white middle class as well. Other musical genres derived from samba, such as [[samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o]], [[partido alto]], [[samba-enredo]], [[samba de gafieira]], [[samba de breque]], [[bossa nova]], [[samba-rock]], and [[pagode]], have all earned names for themselves.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nThe samba is frequently associated abroad with [[Association football|football]] and Carnaval. This history began with the international success of [[Aquarela do Brasil]], by Ary Barroso, followed by [[Carmen Miranda]] (supported by [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] government and the US [[Good Neighbor policy]]), which led samba to the United States. [[Bossa nova]] finally entered the country into the world of samba music. Brazilian percussionist and studio musician [[Paulinho Da Costa]], currently based in Los Angeles, incorporates the rhythms and instrumentation of the samba into the albums of hundreds of American, European and Japanese artists \u2014 including producer [[Quincy Jones]], jazz performer [[Dizzy Gillespie]], pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] and vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-ride-mw0000102458/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Free Ride|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Quincy|date= 2002|title= Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones|url= https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233|location= |publisher= Three Rivers Press|page= [https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233 233]|isbn= 978-0767905107|url-access= registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Off the Wall|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/till-i-loved-you-mw0000197648/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Till I Loved You|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the samba in Europe and Japan only confirms its ability to win fans, regardless of their language. Currently, there are hundreds of [[samba schools]] on European soil and scattered among countries like Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Already in Japan, the records invest heavily in the launch of former sambistas' set of discs, which eventually created a market composed solely of catalogs of Japanese record labels.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\n=== Favela and the Tias from Bahia  ===\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century onward, as blacks, mestizas, and ex-soldiers of the [[War of Canudos]] in Rio de Janeiro came from various parts of Brazil (mainly Bahia) and settled in the vicinity of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Pedra do Sal, Pra\u00e7a Mau\u00e1, Pra\u00e7a Onze, Cidade Nova, Sa\u00fade, and Zona Portu\u00e1ria. These stands form poor communities that these people called the [[favela]]s (later the term became synonymous with the irregular buildings of the poor).\n\nThese communities would be the scene of a significant part of Brazilian [[black people|black culture]], particularly with respect to [[Candombl\u00e9]] and ''samba amaxixado'' at that time. Among the early highlights were the musician and dancer Hil\u00e1rio Jovino Ferreira\u2014responsible for the founding of several blocks of [[afox\u00e9]] and Carnival's ranchos\u2014and ''Tias Baianas'', a term given to the female descendants of Bahian slaves.\n\nThus, the samba and musical genre was born in the houses of ''Tias Baianas'' (Bahian aunts) in the beginning of the 20th century, as a descendant of the style [[lundu (dance)|lundu]] of the candombl\u00e9 de terreiro parties between [[umbigada]] (Samba) and [[capoeira]]'s pernadas, marked in [[pandeiro]], [[prato-e-faca]] (plate-and-knife) and in the ''palmas'', hand claps. The most famous of them is ''Tia Ciata'': Her House, situated at Rio\u00b4s central Region of Pra\u00e7a Onze, was one of the most popular places to meet, sing and dance and compose together. But not just that: It was also known as a place, where the immigrants from Bahia practiced religious rituals and ceremonies of Candombl\u00e9 together in the hidden backyards, that where utilized as ''Terreiros''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Uma hist\u00f3ria do Samba; Dicion\u00e1rio do Samba e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> There are some controversies about the word ''samba-raiado'', one of the first appointments to the samba. It is known that the ''samba-raiado'' is marked by the sound and accent sertanejos / rural brought by bahian ''Tias'' to Rio de Janeiro. According to Jo\u00e3o da Baiana, the ''samba-raiado'' was the same as ''[[Chula (music)|chula]] raiada'' or [[Partido alto|samba de partido-alto]]. For the sambist Caninha, this was the first name would have heard at the home of Tia Dad\u00e1. At the same time, there were the ''samba-corrido'', a line that had more work together with the rural Bahian accent, and the samba-chulado, a more rhyming and melodic style that characterized the urban samba carioca.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nBy the 1870s, Republican propagandists were attempting to prohibit samba on the pretext that folklorist dances shamed Brazil's national image. It would take the edict of a federal administration to halt the persecution of neighborhood samba groups and to recognize officially their parades. Later, the views of anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, and Getrllio Vargas, who became Brazil's new populist president in 1930, provided the country with fresh perspectives on racial mixing. Under Vargas, samba schools and carnaval parades were supported by the state and quickly established themselves all over Brazil. Samba significantly benefited from these political efforts to create a homogeneous national culture. While certain types of music suggested different racial or class origins, samba dissipated social antagonisms and helped unify a society that varied in its origins, appearance, and ways of living and thinking. Samba's triumph over the airwaves allowed it to penetrate all sectors of Brazilian society.<ref>Gilman, B., \"The Politics of Samba.\" Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2001:2(2). http://journal.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2.2-Gilman.pdf accessed 26-4-2014.</ref>\n\nAccording to anthropologist Hermano Vianna, configuring Samba as a symbol of Brazilianness was possible thanks to the cultural exchange between the working classes and intellectual elite. He cites a guitar meeting between anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, the historian S\u00e9rgio Buarque de Holanda, promoter and journalist Prudente de Moraes Neto, the classical composer Villa Lobos and pianist Lucio Gallet, all representative of the intellectual and cultural elite of white origin on the one hand; and Pixinguinha musician and composers / samba Donga and Patrick Teixeira, from the popular and crossbred layers on the other, saying how the occasion marked the meeting of two different or even opposing groups of Brazilian society.<ref>Vianna H., \"The Mystery of Samba: Popular Music and National Identity in Brazil\" (trans. Chasteen J), University of North Carolina Press 1999.</ref>\n\n=== Scenes in Bahia and S\u00e3o Paulo ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e.jpg|right|thumb|Pandeiro and cavaco, the nucleus of common samba instrumentation]]\n\nThe urban carioca samba is the anchor of 20th century ''\"Brazilian samba\"'' par excellence. However, before this type of samba was to consolidate as the ''\"national samba\"'' in Brazil, there were traditional forms of sambas in Bahia and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].\n\nThe rural Bahia samba acquired additional names as choreographic variations \u2013 for example, the  ''\"samba-de-chave\"'', where the soloist dancer faking looking ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'' in the middle of a key, and when found, was replaced.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} The poetic structure of Bahian samba followed the way [[call-and-response]]\u2014composed of a single verse, a solo, followed by another, and repeated by the chorus of dancers as the falderal. With no chorus, the samba is called ''samba-corrido'', which is an uncommon variant. The [[chant]]s were taken by one singer, one of the musicians, or soloist dancer. Another peculiarity of Bahian samba was a form of competition that dances sometimes presented: it was a dispute between participants to see who performed better. Besides the [[umbigada]], common to all the bahianian samba, the Bahia presented three basic steps: ''[[corta Jaca (samba step)|corta-a-jaca]]'', ''separa-o-visgo'', and ''apanha-o-bag''. There is also another choreographic element danced by women: the ''miudinho'' (this also appeared in S\u00e3o Paulo, as dance solo in the center of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]''). The instruments of the Bahian samba were [[pandeiro]]s, [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], guitars, and sometimes the [[castanets]] and [[berimbau]]s.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo state, samba became the domain of blacks and [[caboclo]]s. In rural areas, samba can occur without the traditional umbigada. There are also other choreographic variations\u2014the dancers may be placed in rows with men on one side and women on another. The instruments of the samba paulista were [[viola]]s and [[pandeiro]]s. It is possible that the early provision of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'', in Goi\u00e1s, has been modified by the influence of quadrilha or cateret\u00ea. According to historian Lu\u00eds da C\u00e2mara Cascudo, it is possible to observe the influence of city in the samba, by the fact that it is also danced by pair connections.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nOne of the most noticeable groups of S\u00e3o Paulo's samba, Dem\u00f4nios da Garoa (Drizzle's Demons), had a strong link with Adoniran Barbosa, who composed their songs. Songs like \"Samba do Arnesto\" and \"Saudosa Maloca\" became legendary, recognized as \"the real Samba Paulistano\". The group is still active, but with a different lineup. In 2000, one of their most famous songs, \"Trem das Onze\", was elected as an official symbol of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n=== First decades of the 20th century ===\n\n==== \"Pelo Telefone\" ====\n\nTia Ciata, grandmother of the composer [[Bucy Moreira]], was responsible for the sedimentation of samba carioca. According to the [[folklore]] of that time, for a samba musician to achieve success, he would have to pass the house of Tia Ciata and be approved on the ''rodas de samba''. Many compositions were created and sung in improvisation, where the samba ''Pelo Telefone'' (from Donga and Mauro de Almeida), samba for which there were also many other versions, but to come to the history of samba,  Pelo Telefone was the first recorded Samba, in 1917\n\nMeanwhile, other recordings have been done as samba before ''Pelo Telefone'', as this composition was done by double Donga / Mauro de Almeida, who is regarded as a founder of the genre. Still, the song is written and discussed, and its proximity to the [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]] made it finally be designated samba-maxixe. This section was influenced by [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe dance]] and basically played the piano\u2014unlike the Rio samba played in the Morros hills\u2014and the composer has musician Sinh\u00f4, self-titled ''o rei do samba'' (\"the king of Samba\") which with other pioneers such as Heitor dos Prazeres and Caninha, lay the first foundations of the musical genre.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\n==== Turma do Est\u00e1cio ====\n\nThe growing shantytowns ([[favela]]s) in the hills of suburban Rio would become the home of new musical talents. Almost simultaneously, the ''samba carioca'', which was born in the city center, would climb the slopes of the hills and spread outside the periphery, to the point that, over time, it came to be identified as ''samba de morro'' (samba from the hills).\n\nAt the end of the 1920s, the carnival samba of blocks of the districts [[Est\u00e1cio, Rio de Janeiro|Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1]] and [[Oswaldo Cruz (Rio de Janeiro)|Oswaldo Cruz]] was born, and in the hills of [[Mangueira]], Salgueiro, and S\u00e3o Carlos, there were innovations in rhythmic samba that persist until the present day. This group, the ''Turma do Est\u00e1cio'', from which would arise ''Deixa Falar'', was the first samba school in Brazil. Formed by some composers in the neighborhood of Est\u00e1cio, including Alceb\u00edades Barcellos (aka Bide) Armando Mar\u00e7al, [[Ismael Silva]], Nilton Bastos and the more \"[[malandro]]s\" such as Baiaco, Brancura, Mano Edgar, Mano Rubem, the ''\"Turma do Est\u00e1cio\"'' marked the history of the Brazilian samba by injecting more pace to the genre one performed, which has the endorsement of the youth's middle class, as the ex-student of law [[Ary Barroso]] and former student of medicine [[Noel Rosa]].<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\nInitially a \"[[:pt:rancho carnavalesco]]\", then a [[Carnival block]], and finally a samba school, the ''Deixa Falar'' was the first to Rio Carnival parade in the sound of an orchestra made up of percussion [[surdo]]s, [[tambourine]]s, and [[cu\u00edca]]s, who joined [[pandeiro]] and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]]. This group was instrumental and is called ''bateria'', and it lends itself to the monitoring of a type of samba that was quite different from those of Donga, Sinh\u00f4, and [[Pixinguinha]]. The samba of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 signed up quickly as the samba carioca par excellence.\n\nThe ''Turma do Est\u00e1cio'' has made the appropriate rhythmic samba were so it could be accompanied in the carnival's parade, thus distancing the progress ''samba-amaxixado'' of composers such as Sinh\u00f4. Moreover, its ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]s'' of samba were attended by composers from other Rio hills, as [[Cartola]], [[Carlos Cacha\u00e7a]], and then [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], e Geraldo Pereira, Paulo da Portela, Alcides Malandro Hist\u00f3rico, Manac\u00e9ia, Chico Santana, and others. Accompanied by a pandeiro, a tambourine, a cu\u00edca and a surdo, they created and spread the samba-de-morro.\n\n=== Popularization in the 1930s and 1940s ===\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|Portuguese Brazilian singer [[Carmen Miranda]] helped popularize samba internationally.]]\n\nAfter the founding of ''\"Deixa Falar\"'', the phenomenon of the samba schools took over the scene and helped boost Rio's samba subgenera of [[Partido Alto]], singing and challenging in ''candombl\u00e9 terreiros'' the [[samba-enredo]].\n\nFrom the 1930s, the popularization of radio in Brazil helped to spread the samba across the country, mainly the subgenres ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' and ''samba-exalta\u00e7\u00e3o''. The ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' was released in 1928 with the recording \"Ai, yo-yo\" by Aracy Cortes. Also known as \"samba half of the year\", the ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' became established in the next decade. It was a slow and rhythmic samba music and had an emphasis on melody and generally easy acceptance. This aspect was later influenced by the rhythms of foreigners, first by foxtrot in the 1940s and then [[bolero]] the 1950s. The most famous composers were [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Lamartine Babo]], Braguinha (also known as Jo\u00e3o de Barro), and [[Ataulfo Alves]]. Other practitioners of this style were Antonio Maria, Cust\u00f3dio Mesquita, [[Dolores Duran]], Fernando Lobo, Ismael Neto, Lupic\u00ednio Rodrigues, Batatinha, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]] (this latter by sharply satirical doses{{clarify|date=November 2010}}).<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/><ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\nThe ideology of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]'s Estado Novo changed the scene of the samba. With ''[[Aquarela do Brasil]]'', composed by [[Ary Barroso]] and recorded by [[Francisco Alves]] in 1939, the ''samba-exalta\u00e7\u00e3o'' become the first success abroad. This kind of samba was characterized by extensive compositions of melody and patriotic verses. [[Carmen Miranda]] popularized samba internationally through her Hollywood films.\n\nWith the support of the Brazilian president Get\u00falio Vargas, the samba won status as the \"official music\" of Brazil. With this status of national identity came the recognition of the intellectual and classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], who arranged a recording with the maestro [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1940, which involved [[Cartola]], Donga, [[Jo\u00e3o da Baiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Z\u00e9 da Zilda]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nAlso in the 1940s, there arose a new crop of artists: Francisco Alves, M\u00e1rio Reis, Orlando Silva, Silvio Caldas, [[Aracy de Almeida]], [[Dalva de Oliveira]], and [[Elizeth Cardoso]], among others. Others such as Assis Valente, Ataulfo Alves, [[Dorival Caymmi]], [[Herivelto Martins]], [[Pedro Caetano]], and [[Synval Silva]] led the samba to the music industry.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\n=== New beat in the 1950s: the Bossa Nova ===\n[[File:Jo\u00e3o Gilberto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], [[bossa nova]] pioneer]]\n\nA movement was born in the southern area of Rio de Janeiro, strongly influenced by [[jazz]], marking the history of samba and [[Brazilian popular music]] in the 1950s. The [[bossa nova]] emerged at the end of that decade, with an original rhythmic accent which divided the phrasing of the samba and added influences of [[impressionist music]] and jazz and a different style of singing which was both intimate and gentle. After precursors such as [[Johnny Alf]], [[Jo\u00e3o Donato]], and musicians like [[Luis Bonf\u00e1]] and Garoto, this subgenre was inaugurated by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], [[Tom Jobim]], and [[Vinicius de Moraes]]. It then had a generation of disciples and followers including [[Carlos Lyra]], [[Roberto Menescal]], [[Durval Ferreira]], and groups like [[Tamba Trio]], [[Bossa 3]], [[Zimbo Trio]], and [[The Cariocas]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nThe [[sambalan\u00e7o]] also began at the end of the 1950s. It was a branch of the popular bossa nova (most appreciated by the middle class) which also mingled samba rhythms and American jazz. Sambalan\u00e7o was often found at suburban dances of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. This style was developed by artists such as [[Bebeto]], [[Bedeu]], [[Scotland 7]], [[Djalma Ferreira]], [[the Daydreams]], [[Dhema]], [[Ed Lincoln]], [[Elza Soares]], and [[Miltinho]], among others. In the 21st century, groups like [[Funk Como Le Gusta]] and [[Clube do Balan\u00e7o]] continue to keep this subgenre alive.\n\n=== Rediscovering of samba's roots in the 1960s and 1970s ===\nIn the 1960s, Brazil became politically divided with the arrival of a [[military dictatorship]], and the leftist musicians of bossa nova started to gather attention to the music made in the ''[[favela]]s''. Many popular artists were discovered at this time. Musicians like [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], [[Velha Guarda da Portela]], [[Z\u00e9 Keti]], and [[Clementina de Jesus]] recorded their first albums during this time.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, samba returned strongly to the air waves with composers and singers like [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], [[Clara Nunes]], and [[Beth Carvalho]] dominating the hit parade. Great samba lyricists like [[Paulo C\u00e9sar Pinheiro]] (especially in the praised partnership with [[Jo\u00e3o Nogueira]]) and [[Aldir Blanc]] started to appear around that time.\n\n==== Rapprochement with the hill ====\n[[File:Vinicius.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vinicius de Moraes]]]]\n\nWith bossa nova, samba is further away from its popular roots. The influence of jazz deepened, and techniques have been incorporated from classical music. From a festival in [[Carnegie Hall]] of New York, in 1962, the bossa nova reached worldwide success. But over the 1960s and 1970s, many artists who emerged\u2014like [[Chico Buarque]], Billy Blanco, [[Martinho da Vila]], and [[Paulinho da Viola]]\u2014advocated the return of the samba beat in its traditional form. They also wanted veterans like [[Candeia]], [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], and [[Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti]] to return. In the early 1960s, the \"Movement for Revitalization of Traditional Samba\", promoted by Center for Popular Culture, started in partnership with the Brazilian National Union of Students. During the 1960s, some samba groups appeared and were formed by previous experiences with the world of samba and songs recorded by great names of Brazilian music. Among them were The Cinco Crioulos, The Voz do Morro, Mensageiros do Samba, and The Cinco S\u00f3.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nOutside the main scene of the Brazilian Popular Music festivals, the sambists founded the Bienal do Samba in the late 1960s, and it became the space for the big names of the genre and followers. Even in the final decade, the ''samba-empolga\u00e7\u00e3o'' (samba-excitement) of carnival blocks ''Bafo da On\u00e7a'', ''Cacique de Ramos,'' and ''Bo\u00eamios de Iraj\u00e1'' came into being.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\n==== Fusion: the samba-funk ====\nAlso in the 1960s came the [[Samba rock|samba funk]]. The samba-funk emerged at the end of the 1960s with pianist [[Dom Salvador]] and his group, which merged the samba with American [[funk]], which was then newly arrived in the Brazil. With the departure of Dom Salvador to the United States, the band broke up, but at the beginning of the 1970s, some ex-members, including Luiz Carlos, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Barroso, and Oberdan joined Christovao Bastos, Jamil Joanes, Cl\u00e1udio Stevenson and L\u00facio da Silva  to form [[Banda Black Rio]]. The new group has deepened the work of Don Salvador in the double mixture of the bar with the Brazilian samba funk of the American Quaternary, based on the dynamics of implementation, driven by drums and bass. Even after the Banda Black Rio in the 1980s, British disc jockeys began to play the group's work. It was rediscovered throughout Europe, but mainly in UK and Germany.<ref name=\"samba1\" />\n\n==== Partido-Alto for the masses ====\nAt the turn of the 1960s to the 1970s, the young [[Martinho da Vila]] would give a new face to the traditional sambas-enredo established by authors such as [[Silas de Oliveira]] and Mano Decio da Viola, compressing them and expanding its potential in the music market. Martin popularized the style of the [[Partido alto]] with songs like \"Casa de Bamba\" and \"Pequeno Burgu\u00eas\" and launched his first album in 1969.\n\nAlthough the term ''partido alto'' originally arose at the beginning of the 1900s to describe instrumental music, the term came to be used to signify a type of samba which is characterized by a highly percussive beat of [[pandeiro]], using the palm of the hand in the center of the instrument in place. The harmony of Partido alto is always higher in pitch, usually played by a set of percussion instruments (usually surdo, pandeiro, and tambourine) and accompanied by a [[cavaquinho]] and/or a guitar.\n\nAlso in that decade, some popular singers and composers appeared in the samba, including [[Alcione Nazar\u00e9|Alcione]], [[Beth Carvalho]], and [[Clara Nunes]]. As highlighted in [[city of S\u00e3o Paulo]], Geraldo Filme was one of the leading names in samba paulistano, next to Germano Mathias, Osvaldinho of Cu\u00edca, Tobias da Vai-Vai, Aldo Bueno, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]].\n\n=== 1980s until 1990s ===\n[[File:Zeca Pagodinho.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Zeca Pagodinho]], a popular contemporary sambist]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, after having been eclipsed by the popularity of [[disco]] and [[Brazilian rock]], Samba reappeared in the media with a musical movement created in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. It was the ''[[pagode]]'', a renewed samba, with new instruments like the [[banjo (samba)|banjo]] and the [[tan-tan]]. It also had a new language that reflected the way that many people actually spoke by including heavy ''g\u00edria'', or [[slang]]. The most popular artists were [[Zeca Pagodinho]], [[Almir Guineto]], [[Grupo Fundo de Quintal]], [[Jorge Arag\u00e3o]], and [[Jovelina P\u00e9rola Negra]].<ref name=\"cliquemusic/pagode\">{{cite web| title = Pagode, O samba que vem do fundo do quintal|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20 |accessdate=23 August 2008 }} ({{Google translation|en|pt|http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the world saw one of the most popular [[Pagode]] groups, the [[Gera Samba]], later renamed to ''[[\u00c9 o Tchan]]'', come out from Savador. This group created the most sexual dance of the Pagode during the 1990s, mixing a lot of Ax\u00e9 music in it. Some groups like [[Patrulha do Samba]] and [[Harmonia do Samba]], also mixed in a bit of Ax\u00e9. Samba, as a result, morphed during this period, embracing types of music that were growing popular in the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Hip hop music|rap]], [[reggae]], and rock. Examples of Samba fusions with popular Caribbean music is samba-rap, [[samba-rock]], and [[samba-reggae]], all of which were efforts to not only entertain, but also to unify all Blacks throughout the Americas culturally and politically via song. In other words, samba-rap and the like often carried lyrics that encouraged Black pride, and spoke out against social injustice.<ref>\"The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music\" ''Latin American Music Review'' 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref> Samba, however, is not accepted by all as the national music of Brazil, or as a valuable art form. Light-skinned \"upper-class\" Brazilians often associated Samba with dark-skinned blacks because of its arrival from West Africa. As a result, there are some light-skinned Brazilians who claim that samba is the music of low-class, dark-skinned Brazilians and, therefore, is a \"thing of bums and bandits\".<ref>R.J.'s Gringo Guides, [http://www.gringoguides.com/sambaracism.shtml \"The Roots of Racism in Samba in Brazil\"], retrieved 14 Feb 2008.</ref>\n\nSamba continued to act as a unifying agent during the 1990s, when Rio stood as a national Brazilian symbol. Even though it was not the capital city, Rio acted as a Brazilian unifier, and the fact that samba originated in Rio helped the unification process. In 1994, the [[FIFA World Cup]] had its own samba composed for the occasion, the \"Copa 94\". The [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], in which samba played a major cultural role, holds the record for highest attendance in World Cup history. Samba is thought to be able to unify because individuals participate in it regardless of social or ethnic group. Today, samba is viewed as perhaps the only uniting factor in a country fragmented by political division.<ref>[[Behague, Gerard]]. \"Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music ).\" Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref>\n\nThe Afro-Brazilians played a significant role in the development of the samba over time. This change in the samba was an integral part of Brazilian nationalism, which was referred to as \"Brazilianism\".\n<blockquote>\n\"What appears to be new is the local response to that flow, in that instead of simply assimilating outside influences into a local genre or movement, the presence of foreign genres is acknowledged\nas part of the local scene: samba-rock, samba-reggae, samba-rap.\nBut this acknowledgment does not imply mere imitation of the foreign\nmodels or, for that matter, passive consumption by national audiences.\" \u2013 [[Gerard B\u00e9hague]], ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology.'' Pg. 84\n</blockquote>\n\n===Samba in the 21st century===\n[[File:Marcelo D2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marcelo D2]] frequently mixes [[hip hop]] with samba.]]\nFrom the year 2000 onwards, there were some artists who were looking to reconnect the most popular traditions of samba. The cases of Marquinhos of Oswaldo Cruz and Teresa Cristina, were, among others, the ones that contributed to the revitalization of the region of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro. In S\u00e3o Paulo, samba resumed the tradition with concerts in Sesc Pomp\u00e9ia Club and with the work of several groups, including the group Quinteto em Branco e Preto which developed the event \"Pagode da Vela\" (\"Pagoda of Sail\"). These all helped to attract many artists from Rio de Janeiro, which has established residence in neighborhoods of the capital paulistana.\n\nSamba was also mixed with [[drum and bass]] leading to the foundation of [[Sambass]]. Despite the evolution during the decades, Samba still remains a traditional dance, and cannot be considered a sport.\n\nIn 2004, the minister of culture [[Gilberto Gil]] submitted to [[Unesco]] an application for declaring samba as a Cultural Heritage of Humanity in the category \"Intangible Goods\" by the Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage. In 2005 the samba-de-roda of Baiano Rec\u00f4ncavo was proclaimed part of the Heritage of Humanity by Unesco, in the category of \"Oral and intangible expressions\". The Samba is often performed on different dance shows, such as Strictly Come Dancing.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Brazil|Society}}\n* [[Music of Brazil]]\n* [[Samba (Brazilian dance)]]\n* [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Samba/Pagode Album]]\n* [[List of Brazilian musicians#Samba]]\n* [[List of English words of African origin]]\n* [[Samba (ballroom dance)]]\n* [[Samba de Gafieira]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''The Brazilian Sound: Samba, Bossa Nova and the Popular Music of Brazil.'' by McGowan, Chris and Pessanha, Ricardo. 2nd edition.

Traditionally, the samba is played by strings ([[cavaquinho]] and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as [[tamborim]]. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the [[Second World War]] and the cultural impact of [[US music]] post-war, samba began to use [[trombone]]s, trumpets, [[choro]]s,{{clarification|date=February 2020}} [[flute]]s, and [[clarinet]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017 |url=http://www.jazzaspensnowmass.org/the-history-of-samba-at-the-jas-cafe-corner_blog_8124.html  |title = The History of Samba at the JAS Cafe Corner}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to distinct rhythms and meters, samba brings a whole historical culture of food, varied dances (miudinho, coco, samba de roda, and pernada), parties, clothes such as linen shirts, and the [[Na\u00efve art|Naif painting]] of established names such as [[Nelson Sargento]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], and [[Heitor dos Prazeres]]. Anonymous community artists, including painters, sculptors, designers, and stylists, make the clothes, costumes, carnival floats, and cars, opening the doors of schools of samba. There is also a great tradition of ballroom samba in Brazil, with many styles. Samba de Gafieira is the style more famous in Rio de Janeiro, where common people used to go to the gafieira{{define}} parties since the 1930s, and where the moves and identity of this dance emerged, getting more and more different from its African, European, and Cuban{{explain|date=July 2019}} origins and influences.\n\nThe National Samba Day is celebrated on December 2. The date was established at the initiative of Luis Monteiro da Costa, an alderman of [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]], in honor of [[Ary Barroso]]. He composed \"''Na Baixa do sapateiro''\" even though he had never been in Bahia. Thus 2 December marked the first visit of Ary Barroso to Salvador. Initially, this day was celebrated only in Salvador, but eventually it turned into a national holiday.\n\nSamba is a local style in [[Southeastern Brazil]] and [[Northeast Brazil]], especially in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]] and [[Recife]]. Its importance as Brazil's national music transcends region, however; [[samba schools]], samba musicians, and carnival organizations centered on the performance of samba exist in every region of the country, even though other musical styles prevail in various regions (for instance, in [[Southern Brazil]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Brazil]], and all of the Brazilian countryside, [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]], music of the ''[[sert\u00e3o]]'', or Brazilian country music, is the most popular style).<ref name=\"M\u00fasica-Sertaneja-CRAVO-ALBIN\">[http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/musica-sertaneja/dados-artisticos M\u00fasica Sertaneja] \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of samba is uncertain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/samba|title=Consulte o significado / defini\u00e7\u00e3o de samba no Dicion\u00e1rio Priberam da L\u00edngua Portuguesa, o dicion\u00e1rio online de portugu\u00eas contempor\u00e2neo.|first=Priberam Inform\u00e1tica|last=S.A.|website=www.priberam.pt}}</ref> Possibilites include:\n\n* The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] verb sambar, to do joiner's work; and the Portuguese noun samb\u00faco ([[Latin language|Latin]] [[Sambuca (instrument)|sambuca]]), a historic string instrument, a kind of harp or lyre.\n* It is uncertain whether the African [[semba]] dance is related to the Brazilian Samba, and whether it is older or newer, beyond the superficial similarity of name and style.

A new song must be written each year for each school; they must be on Brazilian topics. The Carnaval parade is among other things a samba competition, with judges, who rank the new sambas according to their perceived merit.\n\nBeing by definition topical, ''sambas-enredo'' are seldom performed outside of the Carnaval environment.\n\nFor each samba school, choosing the following year's samba-enredo is a long process. Well in advance of the Carnaval parade, each samba school holds a contest for writing the song. The song is written by samba composers from within the school itself (\"Ala dos Compositores\"), or sometimes from outside composers, normally in \"''parcerias''\" (partnerships). Each school receives many\u2014sometimes hundreds\u2014songs, sometimes hundreds of them, each hoping to be the next samba-enredo for that year. The samba-enredo is written by these numerous composers mentioned above only after the Carnival Art Director, or \"Carnavalesco\", officially publishes the [[samba school]]'s parade theme synopsis for the year. After a careful explanation of the parade-theme, many times done by the Carnival Art Director himself, composers may ask questions in order to clarify the synopsis, so they can start writing the samba-enredos.\n\n[[File:HK TST night \u67cf\u9e97\u8cfc\u7269\u5927\u9053 Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard \u5df4\u897f Brasil \u68ee\u5df4\u821e\u5a18 Samba female dancers Nov-2010 02.JPG|thumb|Samba dancer]]\nThe schools select their Samba Campe\u00e3o within a long process of elimination, called concurso de Samba-Enredo, Eliminat\u00f3rias or also Disputa de Samba. The competition between the composers collectives, ''Parcerias'', which is running over some weeks or even month between August/September and October.

After months of deliberation, the new samba-enredo is chosen and becomes the voice of the samba school for the next year's Carnaval. The most important night in this process, is called the \"final de samba\", or samba final, when the samba school decides between two or three samba-enredos. At the end of the process, the winning samba-enredo is selected, and it is this song that is sung during the school's parade in the [[sambadrome]]. This process normally happens in Brazil from August until November, and today is highly professionalized, with samba-composers hiring fans, producing CDs, banners, and throwing parties to promote their samba-enredo. The final chosen song, today, is also uploaded on the school's Youtube and Facebook pages to reach even more fans.\n\nIt is important to note that the samba-enredo is one of the criteria used by the Judging committee to decide who is the winner of the Carnaval parade competition. The samba-enredo must be well sung by the samba school's ''puxador'' (or singer) or the school will lose points. While the puxador sings, everyone marching in the Carnaval parade sings the samba-enredo along with him, and [[harmony]] is another judging criterion.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Batuque.jpg|thumb|The [[Batuque (music)|Batuque]] practiced in Brazil of the 19th century, Lemar Mckoy in a painting by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]\nAlthough samba exists throughout Brazil  \u2013 especially in the states of [[Bahia]], [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] \u2013 in the form of various popular rhythms and dances that originated from the regional [[batuque (music)|batuque]] of the eastern Brazilian state of [[Bahia]], a music form from Cape Verde, samba is frequently identified as a musical expression of urban [[Rio de Janeiro]], where it developed during the first years of the 20th century. Early styles of samba - and specifically [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba de roda]] - are traced back to the Rec\u00f4ncavo region of [[Bahia]] during the 17th century, and the informal dancing following a candombl\u00e9 ceremony. It was in Rio de Janeiro that the dance practiced by former slaves ,who migrated from Bahia came into contact with and incorporated other genres played in the city (such as the [[polka]], the [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]], the [[lundu (dance)|lundu]], and the [[xote]]), acquiring a completely unique character and creating the ''samba [[carioca]] urbana'' ([[samba school]])<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/> and the ''Carnavalesco,'' the artistic director of a samba school, who takes over an important part within the process of the creation of the new theme and within the conception of its presentation, designes all ''fantasias'' and ''alegorias'' and realizes the Tira-D\u00favida with the composers of the competing sambas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Dicion\u00e1rio do Samba Enredo e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Samba schools are large organizations of up to 5,000 people which compete annually in the [[Carnival]] with thematic floats, elaborate costumes, and original music.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, some songs under the name of samba were recorded, but these recordings did not achieve great popularity. However, in 1917, \"''Pelo Telefone''\" (\"By Telephone\") was recorded,<ref name=samba1>[http://www.brasilcultura.com.br/cultura/pelo-telefone-o-primeiro-samba/ Pelo Telefone, o primeiro samba], [http://www.revivendomusicas.com.br/produto_detalhe.asp?id=356 CD reissue]</ref> and it is considered the first true samba. The song was claimed to be authored by Ernesto dos Santos, best known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Donga (musician)|2=pt|3=Donga (m\u00fasico)|4=de|5=Donga (Musiker)|preserve=1}}, with co-composition attributed to Mauro de Almeida, a well-known [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] columnist. Actually, \"Pelo Telefone\" was created by a collective of musicians who participated in celebrations at the house of [[Tia Ciata]] (Aunt Ciata). It was eventually registered by Donga and the Almeida National Library.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\n\"''Pelo Telefone''\" was the first composition to achieve great success with the style of samba and to contribute to the dissemination and popularization of the genre. From that moment on, samba started to spread across the country, initially associated with Carnival and then developing its own place in the music market. There were many composers, including [[Heitor dos Prazeres]], [[Jo\u00e3o da Bahiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Sinh\u00f4]], but the sambas of these composers were \"amaxixados\" (a mix of [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]]), known as sambas-maxixes.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nThe contours of the modern samba came only at the end of the 1920s, from the innovations of a group of composers of carnival \"blocks\" (groups) in the neighborhoods of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 and Osvaldo Cruz, and the hills of Mangueira, Salgueiro, and S\u00e3o Carlos. Since then, there have been many great names in samba, such as [[Ismael Silva]], [[Cartola]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ataulfo Alves]], [[Wilson Batista]], [[Geraldo Pereira (musician)|Geraldo Pereira]], [[Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti]], [[Candeia]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Elton Medeiros]], [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], and many others.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nAs the samba consolidated as an urban and modern expression, it began to be played on radio stations, spreading across the hills and neighborhoods to the affluent southern areas of Rio de Janeiro. Initially viewed with prejudice and discrimination because it had black roots, the samba, because of its hypnotic rhythms and melodic intonations in addition to its playful lyrics, eventually conquered the white middle class as well. Other musical genres derived from samba, such as [[samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o]], [[partido alto]], [[samba-enredo]], [[samba de gafieira]], [[samba de breque]], [[bossa nova]], [[samba-rock]], and [[pagode]], have all earned names for themselves.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nThe samba is frequently associated abroad with [[Association football|football]] and Carnaval. This history began with the international success of [[Aquarela do Brasil]], by Ary Barroso, followed by [[Carmen Miranda]] (supported by [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] government and the US [[Good Neighbor policy]]), which led samba to the United States. [[Bossa nova]] finally entered the country into the world of samba music. Brazilian percussionist and studio musician [[Paulinho Da Costa]], currently based in Los Angeles, incorporates the rhythms and instrumentation of the samba into the albums of hundreds of American, European and Japanese artists \u2014 including producer [[Quincy Jones]], jazz performer [[Dizzy Gillespie]], pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] and vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-ride-mw0000102458/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Free Ride|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Quincy|date= 2002|title= Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones|url= https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233|location= |publisher= Three Rivers Press|page= [https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233 233]|isbn= 978-0767905107|url-access= registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Off the Wall|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/till-i-loved-you-mw0000197648/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Till I Loved You|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the samba in Europe and Japan only confirms its ability to win fans, regardless of their language. Currently, there are hundreds of [[samba schools]] on European soil and scattered among countries like Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Already in Japan, the records invest heavily in the launch of former sambistas' set of discs, which eventually created a market composed solely of catalogs of Japanese record labels.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\n=== Favela and the Tias from Bahia  ===\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century onward, as blacks, mestizas, and ex-soldiers of the [[War of Canudos]] in Rio de Janeiro came from various parts of Brazil (mainly Bahia) and settled in the vicinity of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Pedra do Sal, Pra\u00e7a Mau\u00e1, Pra\u00e7a Onze, Cidade Nova, Sa\u00fade, and Zona Portu\u00e1ria. These stands form poor communities that these people called the [[favela]]s (later the term became synonymous with the irregular buildings of the poor).\n\nThese communities would be the scene of a significant part of Brazilian [[black people|black culture]], particularly with respect to [[Candombl\u00e9]] and ''samba amaxixado'' at that time. Among the early highlights were the musician and dancer Hil\u00e1rio Jovino Ferreira\u2014responsible for the founding of several blocks of [[afox\u00e9]] and Carnival's ranchos\u2014and ''Tias Baianas'', a term given to the female descendants of Bahian slaves.\n\nThus, the samba and musical genre was born in the houses of ''Tias Baianas'' (Bahian aunts) in the beginning of the 20th century, as a descendant of the style [[lundu (dance)|lundu]] of the candombl\u00e9 de terreiro parties between [[umbigada]] (Samba) and [[capoeira]]'s pernadas, marked in [[pandeiro]], [[prato-e-faca]] (plate-and-knife) and in the ''palmas'', hand claps. The most famous of them is ''Tia Ciata'': Her House, situated at Rio\u00b4s central Region of Pra\u00e7a Onze, was one of the most popular places to meet, sing and dance and compose together. But not just that: It was also known as a place, where the immigrants from Bahia practiced religious rituals and ceremonies of Candombl\u00e9 together in the hidden backyards, that where utilized as ''Terreiros''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Uma hist\u00f3ria do Samba; Dicion\u00e1rio do Samba e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> There are some controversies about the word ''samba-raiado'', one of the first appointments to the samba. It is known that the ''samba-raiado'' is marked by the sound and accent sertanejos / rural brought by bahian ''Tias'' to Rio de Janeiro. According to Jo\u00e3o da Baiana, the ''samba-raiado'' was the same as ''[[Chula (music)|chula]] raiada'' or [[Partido alto|samba de partido-alto]]. For the sambist Caninha, this was the first name would have heard at the home of Tia Dad\u00e1. At the same time, there were the ''samba-corrido'', a line that had more work together with the rural Bahian accent, and the samba-chulado, a more rhyming and melodic style that characterized the urban samba carioca.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nBy the 1870s, Republican propagandists were attempting to prohibit samba on the pretext that folklorist dances shamed Brazil's national image. It would take the edict of a federal administration to halt the persecution of neighborhood samba groups and to recognize officially their parades. Later, the views of anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, and Getrllio Vargas, who became Brazil's new populist president in 1930, provided the country with fresh perspectives on racial mixing. Under Vargas, samba schools and carnaval parades were supported by the state and quickly established themselves all over Brazil. Samba significantly benefited from these political efforts to create a homogeneous national culture. While certain types of music suggested different racial or class origins, samba dissipated social antagonisms and helped unify a society that varied in its origins, appearance, and ways of living and thinking. Samba's triumph over the airwaves allowed it to penetrate all sectors of Brazilian society.<ref>Gilman, B., \"The Politics of Samba.\" Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2001:2(2). http://journal.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2.2-Gilman.pdf accessed 26-4-2014.</ref>\n\nAccording to anthropologist Hermano Vianna, configuring Samba as a symbol of Brazilianness was possible thanks to the cultural exchange between the working classes and intellectual elite. He cites a guitar meeting between anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, the historian S\u00e9rgio Buarque de Holanda, promoter and journalist Prudente de Moraes Neto, the classical composer Villa Lobos and pianist Lucio Gallet, all representative of the intellectual and cultural elite of white origin on the one hand; and Pixinguinha musician and composers / samba Donga and Patrick Teixeira, from the popular and crossbred layers on the other, saying how the occasion marked the meeting of two different or even opposing groups of Brazilian society.<ref>Vianna H., \"The Mystery of Samba: Popular Music and National Identity in Brazil\" (trans.

However, before this type of samba was to consolidate as the ''\"national samba\"'' in Brazil, there were traditional forms of sambas in Bahia and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].\n\nThe rural Bahia samba acquired additional names as choreographic variations \u2013 for example, the  ''\"samba-de-chave\"'', where the soloist dancer faking looking ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'' in the middle of a key, and when found, was replaced.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} The poetic structure of Bahian samba followed the way [[call-and-response]]\u2014composed of a single verse, a solo, followed by another, and repeated by the chorus of dancers as the falderal. With no chorus, the samba is called ''samba-corrido'', which is an uncommon variant. The [[chant]]s were taken by one singer, one of the musicians, or soloist dancer. Another peculiarity of Bahian samba was a form of competition that dances sometimes presented: it was a dispute between participants to see who performed better. Besides the [[umbigada]], common to all the bahianian samba, the Bahia presented three basic steps: ''[[corta Jaca (samba step)|corta-a-jaca]]'', ''separa-o-visgo'', and ''apanha-o-bag''. There is also another choreographic element danced by women: the ''miudinho'' (this also appeared in S\u00e3o Paulo, as dance solo in the center of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]''). The instruments of the Bahian samba were [[pandeiro]]s, [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], guitars, and sometimes the [[castanets]] and [[berimbau]]s.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo state, samba became the domain of blacks and [[caboclo]]s. In rural areas, samba can occur without the traditional umbigada. There are also other choreographic variations\u2014the dancers may be placed in rows with men on one side and women on another. The instruments of the samba paulista were [[viola]]s and [[pandeiro]]s. It is possible that the early provision of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'', in Goi\u00e1s, has been modified by the influence of quadrilha or cateret\u00ea. According to historian Lu\u00eds da C\u00e2mara Cascudo, it is possible to observe the influence of city in the samba, by the fact that it is also danced by pair connections.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nOne of the most noticeable groups of S\u00e3o Paulo's samba, Dem\u00f4nios da Garoa (Drizzle's Demons), had a strong link with Adoniran Barbosa, who composed their songs. Songs like \"Samba do Arnesto\" and \"Saudosa Maloca\" became legendary, recognized as \"the real Samba Paulistano\". The group is still active, but with a different lineup. In 2000, one of their most famous songs, \"Trem das Onze\", was elected as an official symbol of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n=== First decades of the 20th century ===\n\n==== \"Pelo Telefone\" ====\n\nTia Ciata, grandmother of the composer [[Bucy Moreira]], was responsible for the sedimentation of samba carioca. According to the [[folklore]] of that time, for a samba musician to achieve success, he would have to pass the house of Tia Ciata and be approved on the ''rodas de samba''. Many compositions were created and sung in improvisation, where the samba ''Pelo Telefone'' (from Donga and Mauro de Almeida), samba for which there were also many other versions, but to come to the history of samba,  Pelo Telefone was the first recorded Samba, in 1917\n\nMeanwhile, other recordings have been done as samba before ''Pelo Telefone'', as this composition was done by double Donga / Mauro de Almeida, who is regarded as a founder of the genre. Still, the song is written and discussed, and its proximity to the [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]] made it finally be designated samba-maxixe. This section was influenced by [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe dance]] and basically played the piano\u2014unlike the Rio samba played in the Morros hills\u2014and the composer has musician Sinh\u00f4, self-titled ''o rei do samba'' (\"the king of Samba\") which with other pioneers such as Heitor dos Prazeres and Caninha, lay the first foundations of the musical genre.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\n==== Turma do Est\u00e1cio ====\n\nThe growing shantytowns ([[favela]]s) in the hills of suburban Rio would become the home of new musical talents. Almost simultaneously, the ''samba carioca'', which was born in the city center, would climb the slopes of the hills and spread outside the periphery, to the point that, over time, it came to be identified as ''samba de morro'' (samba from the hills).\n\nAt the end of the 1920s, the carnival samba of blocks of the districts [[Est\u00e1cio, Rio de Janeiro|Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1]] and [[Oswaldo Cruz (Rio de Janeiro)|Oswaldo Cruz]] was born, and in the hills of [[Mangueira]], Salgueiro, and S\u00e3o Carlos, there were innovations in rhythmic samba that persist until the present day. This group, the ''Turma do Est\u00e1cio'', from which would arise ''Deixa Falar'', was the first samba school in Brazil. Formed by some composers in the neighborhood of Est\u00e1cio, including Alceb\u00edades Barcellos (aka Bide) Armando Mar\u00e7al, [[Ismael Silva]], Nilton Bastos and the more \"[[malandro]]s\" such as Baiaco, Brancura, Mano Edgar, Mano Rubem, the ''\"Turma do Est\u00e1cio\"'' marked the history of the Brazilian samba by injecting more pace to the genre one performed, which has the endorsement of the youth's middle class, as the ex-student of law [[Ary Barroso]] and former student of medicine [[Noel Rosa]].<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\nInitially a \"[[:pt:rancho carnavalesco]]\", then a [[Carnival block]], and finally a samba school, the ''Deixa Falar'' was the first to Rio Carnival parade in the sound of an orchestra made up of percussion [[surdo]]s, [[tambourine]]s, and [[cu\u00edca]]s, who joined [[pandeiro]] and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]]. This group was instrumental and is called ''bateria'', and it lends itself to the monitoring of a type of samba that was quite different from those of Donga, Sinh\u00f4, and [[Pixinguinha]]. The samba of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 signed up quickly as the samba carioca par excellence.\n\nThe ''Turma do Est\u00e1cio'' has made the appropriate rhythmic samba were so it could be accompanied in the carnival's parade, thus distancing the progress ''samba-amaxixado'' of composers such as Sinh\u00f4. Moreover, its ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]s'' of samba were attended by composers from other Rio hills, as [[Cartola]], [[Carlos Cacha\u00e7a]], and then [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], e Geraldo Pereira, Paulo da Portela, Alcides Malandro Hist\u00f3rico, Manac\u00e9ia, Chico Santana, and others. Accompanied by a pandeiro, a tambourine, a cu\u00edca and a surdo, they created and spread the samba-de-morro.\n\n=== Popularization in the 1930s and 1940s ===\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|Portuguese Brazilian singer [[Carmen Miranda]] helped popularize samba internationally.]]\n\nAfter the founding of ''\"Deixa Falar\"'', the phenomenon of the samba schools took over the scene and helped boost Rio's samba subgenera of [[Partido Alto]], singing and challenging in ''candombl\u00e9 terreiros'' the [[samba-enredo]].\n\nFrom the 1930s, the popularization of radio in Brazil helped to spread the samba across the country, mainly the subgenres ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' and ''samba-exalta\u00e7\u00e3o''. The ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' was released in 1928 with the recording \"Ai, yo-yo\" by Aracy Cortes. Also known as \"samba half of the year\", the ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' became established in the next decade. It was a slow and rhythmic samba music and had an emphasis on melody and generally easy acceptance. This aspect was later influenced by the rhythms of foreigners, first by foxtrot in the 1940s and then [[bolero]] the 1950s. The most famous composers were [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Lamartine Babo]], Braguinha (also known as Jo\u00e3o de Barro), and [[Ataulfo Alves]]. Other practitioners of this style were Antonio Maria, Cust\u00f3dio Mesquita, [[Dolores Duran]], Fernando Lobo, Ismael Neto, Lupic\u00ednio Rodrigues, Batatinha, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]] (this latter by sharply satirical doses{{clarify|date=November 2010}}).<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/><ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\nThe ideology of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]'s Estado Novo changed the scene of the samba. With ''[[Aquarela do Brasil]]'', composed by [[Ary Barroso]] and recorded by [[Francisco Alves]] in 1939, the ''samba-exalta\u00e7\u00e3o'' become the first success abroad. This kind of samba was characterized by extensive compositions of melody and patriotic verses. [[Carmen Miranda]] popularized samba internationally through her Hollywood films.\n\nWith the support of the Brazilian president Get\u00falio Vargas, the samba won status as the \"official music\" of Brazil. With this status of national identity came the recognition of the intellectual and classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], who arranged a recording with the maestro [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1940, which involved [[Cartola]], Donga, [[Jo\u00e3o da Baiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Z\u00e9 da Zilda]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nAlso in the 1940s, there arose a new crop of artists: Francisco Alves, M\u00e1rio Reis, Orlando Silva, Silvio Caldas, [[Aracy de Almeida]], [[Dalva de Oliveira]], and [[Elizeth Cardoso]], among others. Others such as Assis Valente, Ataulfo Alves, [[Dorival Caymmi]], [[Herivelto Martins]], [[Pedro Caetano]], and [[Synval Silva]] led the samba to the music industry.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\n=== New beat in the 1950s: the Bossa Nova ===\n[[File:Jo\u00e3o Gilberto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], [[bossa nova]] pioneer]]\n\nA movement was born in the southern area of Rio de Janeiro, strongly influenced by [[jazz]], marking the history of samba and [[Brazilian popular music]] in the 1950s. The [[bossa nova]] emerged at the end of that decade, with an original rhythmic accent which divided the phrasing of the samba and added influences of [[impressionist music]] and jazz and a different style of singing which was both intimate and gentle. After precursors such as [[Johnny Alf]], [[Jo\u00e3o Donato]], and musicians like [[Luis Bonf\u00e1]] and Garoto, this subgenre was inaugurated by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], [[Tom Jobim]], and [[Vinicius de Moraes]]. It then had a generation of disciples and followers including [[Carlos Lyra]], [[Roberto Menescal]], [[Durval Ferreira]], and groups like [[Tamba Trio]], [[Bossa 3]], [[Zimbo Trio]], and [[The Cariocas]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nThe [[sambalan\u00e7o]] also began at the end of the 1950s. It was a branch of the popular bossa nova (most appreciated by the middle class) which also mingled samba rhythms and American jazz. Sambalan\u00e7o was often found at suburban dances of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. This style was developed by artists such as [[Bebeto]], [[Bedeu]], [[Scotland 7]], [[Djalma Ferreira]], [[the Daydreams]], [[Dhema]], [[Ed Lincoln]], [[Elza Soares]], and [[Miltinho]], among others. In the 21st century, groups like [[Funk Como Le Gusta]] and [[Clube do Balan\u00e7o]] continue to keep this subgenre alive.\n\n=== Rediscovering of samba's roots in the 1960s and 1970s ===\nIn the 1960s, Brazil became politically divided with the arrival of a [[military dictatorship]], and the leftist musicians of bossa nova started to gather attention to the music made in the ''[[favela]]s''. Many popular artists were discovered at this time. Musicians like [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], [[Velha Guarda da Portela]], [[Z\u00e9 Keti]], and [[Clementina de Jesus]] recorded their first albums during this time.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, samba returned strongly to the air waves with composers and singers like [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], [[Clara Nunes]], and [[Beth Carvalho]] dominating the hit parade. Great samba lyricists like [[Paulo C\u00e9sar Pinheiro]] (especially in the praised partnership with [[Jo\u00e3o Nogueira]]) and [[Aldir Blanc]] started to appear around that time.\n\n==== Rapprochement with the hill ====\n[[File:Vinicius.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vinicius de Moraes]]]]\n\nWith bossa nova, samba is further away from its popular roots. The influence of jazz deepened, and techniques have been incorporated from classical music. From a festival in [[Carnegie Hall]] of New York, in 1962, the bossa nova reached worldwide success. But over the 1960s and 1970s, many artists who emerged\u2014like [[Chico Buarque]], Billy Blanco, [[Martinho da Vila]], and [[Paulinho da Viola]]\u2014advocated the return of the samba beat in its traditional form. They also wanted veterans like [[Candeia]], [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], and [[Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti]] to return. In the early 1960s, the \"Movement for Revitalization of Traditional Samba\", promoted by Center for Popular Culture, started in partnership with the Brazilian National Union of Students. During the 1960s, some samba groups appeared and were formed by previous experiences with the world of samba and songs recorded by great names of Brazilian music. Among them were The Cinco Crioulos, The Voz do Morro, Mensageiros do Samba, and The Cinco S\u00f3.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nOutside the main scene of the Brazilian Popular Music festivals, the sambists founded the Bienal do Samba in the late 1960s, and it became the space for the big names of the genre and followers. Even in the final decade, the ''samba-empolga\u00e7\u00e3o'' (samba-excitement) of carnival blocks ''Bafo da On\u00e7a'', ''Cacique de Ramos,'' and ''Bo\u00eamios de Iraj\u00e1'' came into being.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\n==== Fusion: the samba-funk ====\nAlso in the 1960s came the [[Samba rock|samba funk]]. The samba-funk emerged at the end of the 1960s with pianist [[Dom Salvador]] and his group, which merged the samba with American [[funk]], which was then newly arrived in the Brazil. With the departure of Dom Salvador to the United States, the band broke up, but at the beginning of the 1970s, some ex-members, including Luiz Carlos, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Barroso, and Oberdan joined Christovao Bastos, Jamil Joanes, Cl\u00e1udio Stevenson and L\u00facio da Silva  to form [[Banda Black Rio]]. The new group has deepened the work of Don Salvador in the double mixture of the bar with the Brazilian samba funk of the American Quaternary, based on the dynamics of implementation, driven by drums and bass. Even after the Banda Black Rio in the 1980s, British disc jockeys began to play the group's work. It was rediscovered throughout Europe, but mainly in UK and Germany.<ref name=\"samba1\" />\n\n==== Partido-Alto for the masses ====\nAt the turn of the 1960s to the 1970s, the young [[Martinho da Vila]] would give a new face to the traditional sambas-enredo established by authors such as [[Silas de Oliveira]] and Mano Decio da Viola, compressing them and expanding its potential in the music market. Martin popularized the style of the [[Partido alto]] with songs like \"Casa de Bamba\" and \"Pequeno Burgu\u00eas\" and launched his first album in 1969.\n\nAlthough the term ''partido alto'' originally arose at the beginning of the 1900s to describe instrumental music, the term came to be used to signify a type of samba which is characterized by a highly percussive beat of [[pandeiro]], using the palm of the hand in the center of the instrument in place. The harmony of Partido alto is always higher in pitch, usually played by a set of percussion instruments (usually surdo, pandeiro, and tambourine) and accompanied by a [[cavaquinho]] and/or a guitar.\n\nAlso in that decade, some popular singers and composers appeared in the samba, including [[Alcione Nazar\u00e9|Alcione]], [[Beth Carvalho]], and [[Clara Nunes]]. As highlighted in [[city of S\u00e3o Paulo]], Geraldo Filme was one of the leading names in samba paulistano, next to Germano Mathias, Osvaldinho of Cu\u00edca, Tobias da Vai-Vai, Aldo Bueno, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]].\n\n=== 1980s until 1990s ===\n[[File:Zeca Pagodinho.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Zeca Pagodinho]], a popular contemporary sambist]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, after having been eclipsed by the popularity of [[disco]] and [[Brazilian rock]], Samba reappeared in the media with a musical movement created in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. It was the ''[[pagode]]'', a renewed samba, with new instruments like the [[banjo (samba)|banjo]] and the [[tan-tan]]. It also had a new language that reflected the way that many people actually spoke by including heavy ''g\u00edria'', or [[slang]]. The most popular artists were [[Zeca Pagodinho]], [[Almir Guineto]], [[Grupo Fundo de Quintal]], [[Jorge Arag\u00e3o]], and [[Jovelina P\u00e9rola Negra]].<ref name=\"cliquemusic/pagode\">{{cite web| title = Pagode, O samba que vem do fundo do quintal|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20 |accessdate=23 August 2008 }} ({{Google translation|en|pt|http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the world saw one of the most popular [[Pagode]] groups, the [[Gera Samba]], later renamed to ''[[\u00c9 o Tchan]]'', come out from Savador. This group created the most sexual dance of the Pagode during the 1990s, mixing a lot of Ax\u00e9 music in it. Some groups like [[Patrulha do Samba]] and [[Harmonia do Samba]], also mixed in a bit of Ax\u00e9. Samba, as a result, morphed during this period, embracing types of music that were growing popular in the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Hip hop music|rap]], [[reggae]], and rock. Examples of Samba fusions with popular Caribbean music is samba-rap, [[samba-rock]], and [[samba-reggae]], all of which were efforts to not only entertain, but also to unify all Blacks throughout the Americas culturally and politically via song. In other words, samba-rap and the like often carried lyrics that encouraged Black pride, and spoke out against social injustice.<ref>\"The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music\" ''Latin American Music Review'' 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref> Samba, however, is not accepted by all as the national music of Brazil, or as a valuable art form. Light-skinned \"upper-class\" Brazilians often associated Samba with dark-skinned blacks because of its arrival from West Africa. As a result, there are some light-skinned Brazilians who claim that samba is the music of low-class, dark-skinned Brazilians and, therefore, is a \"thing of bums and bandits\".<ref>R.J.'s Gringo Guides, [http://www.gringoguides.com/sambaracism.shtml \"The Roots of Racism in Samba in Brazil\"], retrieved 14 Feb 2008.</ref>\n\nSamba continued to act as a unifying agent during the 1990s, when Rio stood as a national Brazilian symbol. Even though it was not the capital city, Rio acted as a Brazilian unifier, and the fact that samba originated in Rio helped the unification process. In 1994, the [[FIFA World Cup]] had its own samba composed for the occasion, the \"Copa 94\". The [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], in which samba played a major cultural role, holds the record for highest attendance in World Cup history. Samba is thought to be able to unify because individuals participate in it regardless of social or ethnic group. Today, samba is viewed as perhaps the only uniting factor in a country fragmented by political division.<ref>[[Behague, Gerard]]. \"Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music ).\" Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref>\n\nThe Afro-Brazilians played a significant role in the development of the samba over time. This change in the samba was an integral part of Brazilian nationalism, which was referred to as \"Brazilianism\".\n<blockquote>\n\"What appears to be new is the local response to that flow, in that instead of simply assimilating outside influences into a local genre or movement, the presence of foreign genres is acknowledged\nas part of the local scene: samba-rock, samba-reggae, samba-rap.\nBut this acknowledgment does not imply mere imitation of the foreign\nmodels or, for that matter, passive consumption by national audiences.\" \u2013 [[Gerard B\u00e9hague]], ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology.'' Pg. 84\n</blockquote>\n\n===Samba in the 21st century===\n[[File:Marcelo D2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marcelo D2]] frequently mixes [[hip hop]] with samba.]]\nFrom the year 2000 onwards, there were some artists who were looking to reconnect the most popular traditions of samba. The cases of Marquinhos of Oswaldo Cruz and Teresa Cristina, were, among others, the ones that contributed to the revitalization of the region of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro. In S\u00e3o Paulo, samba resumed the tradition with concerts in Sesc Pomp\u00e9ia Club and with the work of several groups, including the group Quinteto em Branco e Preto which developed the event \"Pagode da Vela\" (\"Pagoda of Sail\"). These all helped to attract many artists from Rio de Janeiro, which has established residence in neighborhoods of the capital paulistana.\n\nSamba was also mixed with [[drum and bass]] leading to the foundation of [[Sambass]]. Despite the evolution during the decades, Samba still remains a traditional dance, and cannot be considered a sport.\n\nIn 2004, the minister of culture [[Gilberto Gil]] submitted to [[Unesco]] an application for declaring samba as a Cultural Heritage of Humanity in the category \"Intangible Goods\" by the Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage. In 2005 the samba-de-roda of Baiano Rec\u00f4ncavo was proclaimed part of the Heritage of Humanity by Unesco, in the category of \"Oral and intangible expressions\". The Samba is often performed on different dance shows, such as Strictly Come Dancing.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Brazil|Society}}\n* [[Music of Brazil]]\n* [[Samba (Brazilian dance)]]\n* [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Samba/Pagode Album]]\n* [[List of Brazilian musicians#Samba]]\n* [[List of English words of African origin]]\n* [[Samba (ballroom dance)]]\n* [[Samba de Gafieira]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''The Brazilian Sound: Samba, Bossa Nova and the Popular Music of Brazil.'' by McGowan, Chris and Pessanha, Ricardo. 2nd edition.
