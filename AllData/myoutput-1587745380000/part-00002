Taking advice from his friend Rick Lagados, Steven bribes cable installer Ernie \"Chip\" Douglas into giving him free movie channels. Chip gets Steven to hang out with him the next day and makes him one of his \"preferred customers\". Chip takes Steven to the city's central [[satellite dish]], where he confides to Steven about being raised on television due to the frequent absences of his single mother. Chip soon proves to be intrusive as he crashes a basketball game between Steven and his friends and leaves several messages on Steven's answering machine. Following a passionate knight battle between Chip and Steven at [[Medieval Times]], Steven finds that Chip has secretly installed an expensive [[home theater system]] in his living room as a gift in return for Steven's friendship. Although Steven declines the gift, he agrees to host a party attended by Chip's other preferred customers before having the system returned. In the fervor the party, Steven sleeps with a young guest, whom Chip reveals the next morning to have been a prostitute that he had hired specifically for Steven. Upon this revelation, Steven angrily ejects Chip from his apartment.\n\nTo make amends, Chip tracks down Robin, who is dating another man. A disguised Chip severely beats the man in a restaurant bathroom and tells him to stay away from Robin. He later upgrades Robin's cable, ostensibly as a gift from Steven. Robin decides to get back together with Steven as a result. However, when Chip informs Steven of his role in reuniting him with Robin, Steven politely ends his relationship with Chip. Devastated, Chip sets out on a series of vengeful acts. He gets Steven arrested for possession of the stolen property and mocks him through a prison visitation window. After being released on [[bail]], Steven is further embarrassed when Chip attends dinner with his family and Robin. Following a sexualized version of the game ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', Steven openly berates Chip and punches him. The next day, Steven is fired from his job when Chip transmits a privately-recorded conversation, in which Steven insults his boss, onto the company's computers.\n\nRick investigates Chip at Steven's request and finds that Chip was fired from the cable company for [[stalking]] customers, and uses the names of television characters as aliases such as Chip Douglas from ''[[My Three Sons]]'' and Larry Tate from ''[[Bewitched]]''. Chip calls Steven that night, telling him he is paying Robin a visit. After visiting Robin's empty apartment, Steven tracks them down to the satellite dish, where Chip holds Robin hostage in a rainstorm. After a physical altercation and a chase, Steven is able to save Robin. As the police arrive, Chip apologizes to Steven for being a bad friend. Chip, proclaiming that he must \"kill the babysitter\" to prevent others from becoming like him, dives backward from the top of a ladder above the satellite dish, falling onto it and knocking out the television signal to the entire city. Chip survives the fall with an injured back, and bids Steven farewell before being hauled away in a rescue helicopter. When one of the paramedics addresses him as \"buddy\", Chip asks the paramedic if he is truly his buddy, to which the paramedic replies \"Yeah, sure you are\", causing Chip to smile deviously.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Steven M.

Carrey, Apatow and Stiller liked the setup of \"somebody who is really smart with technology invading somebody's life\", and opted to add [[slapstick]] and darker tones, changing into a satire of thrillers such as ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'', ''[[Unlawful Entry (film)|Unlawful Entry]]'' and ''[[The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (film)|The Hand That Rocks the Cradle]]''.

After being released on [[bail]], Steven is further embarrassed when Chip attends dinner with his family and Robin. Following a sexualized version of the game ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', Steven openly berates Chip and punches him. The next day, Steven is fired from his job when Chip transmits a privately-recorded conversation, in which Steven insults his boss, onto the company's computers.\n\nRick investigates Chip at Steven's request and finds that Chip was fired from the cable company for [[stalking]] customers, and uses the names of television characters as aliases such as Chip Douglas from ''[[My Three Sons]]'' and Larry Tate from ''[[Bewitched]]''. Chip calls Steven that night, telling him he is paying Robin a visit. After visiting Robin's empty apartment, Steven tracks them down to the satellite dish, where Chip holds Robin hostage in a rainstorm. After a physical altercation and a chase, Steven is able to save Robin. As the police arrive, Chip apologizes to Steven for being a bad friend. Chip, proclaiming that he must \"kill the babysitter\" to prevent others from becoming like him, dives backward from the top of a ladder above the satellite dish, falling onto it and knocking out the television signal to the entire city. Chip survives the fall with an injured back, and bids Steven farewell before being hauled away in a rescue helicopter. When one of the paramedics addresses him as \"buddy\", Chip asks the paramedic if he is truly his buddy, to which the paramedic replies \"Yeah, sure you are\", causing Chip to smile deviously.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Steven M.
