It was here in the first century, [[Thomas the Apostle]] arrived to preach the [[gospel]] to the Jewish community. Some of the Jews and locals became followers of Jesus of [[Nazareth]]. They were known as [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Malabar Nasrani]] people and their church as Malankara Church.  They followed a unique [[Hebrew]]-[[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] tradition which included several Jewish elements and Indian customs.\n\nIn Malankara (Kerala) St. Thomas did not appoint any bishops, but an elder (Mooppen in [[Malayalam]]) was selected to lead the people. The parish leader was called Edavaka Mooppen and the church as a whole had a Malankara Mooppen. This was the tradition until 1653.\n\nThe Malayalam versions of the Canons of the [[Synod of Diamper]]<ref>Five of the Malayalam versions were available in 1952.</ref> use these titles throughout the report except in three places where they use the Latin word ''archidiaconus''.<ref>Daniel, K.

The Malaylam name ''Jathikku Karthavian'', given by some historians was not used in the Malayalam version of the canons.\n\nAfter the great swearing in 1653 it became necessary to appoint a bishop. For this purpose a special chair was made and the first bishop of Malankara church was enthroned. This throne used for this consecration of Mar Thoma I, is in the possession of the [[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]] and is kept at [[Tiruvalla]]. It has been used in the installation of every Mar Thoma Metropolitan, to this day, so that the continuity of the throne of Mar Thoma is ensured. This was the throne used for the consecration of Mar Thoma II.\n\n==Early life==\n[[Kuravilangad]] is a town located in the [[Kottayam]] district of [[Kerala]], [[South India]]. The town is situated in the [[Meenachil]] Taluk, about {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Kottayam]]. [[Pakalomattom family]] was one of the oldest families at [[Kuravilangad]]. The second Mar Thoma was born at Parampbil house of this family.\n\n==Consecration==\nThe leaders of the [[Malankara Church]] selected a nephew (brother's son) of [[Mar Thoma I]] as his successor. He was consecrated by [[Mar Thoma I]] and the Antiochean patriarchal delegate [[Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel]] who was the archbishop of Jerusalem. He was the second Mar Thoma who ascended the throne of Malankara church. When [[Mar Thoma I]] died on 25 April 1670 Mar Thoma II, took charge of the [[Malankara Church]].\n\n==Visits by foreign bishops==\nFour foreign bishops from [[Syria]] arrived in [[Kerala]] during his lifetime. Journey from one country to another was not that easy on those days. So none of them were able to return. to their home land. While they were there in Kerala, they were not able to do much except teaching Syriac and consecrating bishops if they were invited. People called them ''Muthappen'' (elder father).\n\n[[Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel]], of [[Antioch]] who arrived in [[Kerala]] in 1665, was the Syriac Orthodox Metropolitan of [[Jerusalem]]. He was the one who consecrated Mar Thoma I. After the consecration of Mar Thoma II, he spent a retired life. He died on 27 April 1671 or 1681 and was laid to rest at St. Thomas church, [[North Paravur]].\n\n''Mar Anthraos'' and three of his brothers from middle east arrived at [[Mulanthuruthy]] church in 1678. Later on they moved to various churches and arrived at [[St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral, Puthencavu]] (near [[Chengannur]]). On 29 February 1692 while visiting Kallada, he went to the nearby river and was drowned. Two of his brothers went back to [[Mulanthuruthy]] and raised families there. Descendants of one of them later established the [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]].<ref>Souvenir published by Puthencavu St.Mary's Orthodox Cathedral, pp. 209\u2013211.</ref>\n\n[[Eldho Mor Baselios]] and Mar Ivanios Episcopa arrived at [[Kothamangalam]] on 14 September 1685. Soon after the arrival Mar Baselious raised Mar Ivanios as Metropolitan (archbishop) with the title Mar Ivanios Hidayatulla. After a few days on 29 September 1685 Mar Baselious died and was buried at [[Marthoma Cheriapally Kothamangalam]]. He is venerated as a great saint and celebrations are held annually in many churches in Malankara.\n \n''Mar Ivanios Hidayuttulla'' who came with Mar [[Baselios Yeldo]] Maphriyano, was consecrated as metropolitan in September 1685. He consecrated [[Mar Thoma III]] and [[Mar Thoma IV]]. He died on 13 August 1693 and was buried at [[Mulanthuruthy Marthoman Church]].\n\n==Church administration==\n[[Synod of Diamper]] was held in 1599. By the time of Mar Thoma II, became the Metropolitan of malankara in 1670, many of the Syriac practices were already reintroduced into [[Malankara Church]]. The use of western calendar, baptismal fonts and having pulpits are some of them.  During his time priests were encouraged to marry.\n\n==Last days==\nThe Metropolitans visiting a parish stayed in the balcony room of the church. On 14 April 1686 while Mar Thoma II was at Niranam church, there occurred a [[thunderstorm]]. Mar Thoma was struck by lightning and dead.
