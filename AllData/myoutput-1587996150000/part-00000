The brook is named after [[William Pymme]], a local landowner.\n\nThe trail goes from [[Monken Hadley Common|Hadley Green]] to [[Tottenham Hale]], where the trail connects with the [[Lea Valley Walk]]. Most of the first half of the trail, as far as [[Arnos Park]], runs beside  [[Pymmes Brook]], but after that the brook is only encountered intermittently as much of the brook passes through private land which is not open to the public.

Together with the [[London Loop]], it then drops through [[Monken Hadley Common]] to [[Charles_Jack#Death_and_legacy|Jack's Lake]], to meet another link from [[Cockfosters tube station]].  Pymmes Brook proper starts here as it flows out from Jack's Lake.  The trail detours through [[Victoria Recreation Ground, New Barnet|Victoria Recreation Ground]], where Pymmes Brook is joined with [[Shirebourne brook]], then follows a short street section to rejoin the brook at [[East Barnet|East Barnet Village]].  It then runs beside the brook through [[Oak Hill Park (Barnet)|Oak Hill Park]] and [[Brunswick Park]] to the halfway point in [[Arnos_Grove#Arnos_Park|Arnos Park]], with a link to [[Arnos Grove tube station]]. It is also where Pymmes Brook is joined by Bounds Green Brook. The trail then leaves the brook to pass through [[Broomfield Park, Palmers Green|Broomfield Park]] and [[Palmers Green]]. It crosses over the [[New River (London)|New River]] at Oakthorpe Road, then the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]], to divert through two new public open spaces - Bowes Meadow and Tile Kiln Lane Open Space - where Pymmes Brook can be followed again. The trail recrosses the North Circular Road onto Silver Street, [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]], where the path enters the gardens of [[Millfield House]]. From here the trail leads to [[Pymmes Park]] and another brookside section, then to Fore Street, where the brook flows underground to merge with [[Salmons Brook]] to the south of [[Angel Road]]. As of 2018, the trail must temporarily follow public throughfares for a short distance, but will eventually take a new route when access to the brook is opened up in the [[Meridian Water]] development.  Finally, the trail passes through [[Tottenham Marshes]], beside Pymmes Brook and past [[Stonebridge Lock]] on the [[Lee Navigation]], to reach the point where the brook joins the [[River Lea]]. The trail connects with the [[Lea Valley Walk]] at [[Tottenham Lock]], with a link to [[Tottenham Hale station]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pymmes Brook Trail |url=https://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Pymmes+Brook+Trail |website=The Long Distance Walkers Association |accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Pymmes Brook Trail, Jacks Lake.JPG|<!-- Beech Hill Lake, I used to live on Beech Hill, but I only know the \"lake\" as -->Jack's Lake on Monken Hadley Common\nFile:Pymmes Brook in Arnos Park.JPG|Pymmes Brook in Arnos Park\nFile:Pymmes Brook Trail, Broomfield Park lake.JPG|Broomfield Park lake\nFile:Millfield House.jpg|Millfield House\nFile:Stonebridge Lock and River Lea.JPG|Stonebridge Lock on the Lee Navigation\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pymme's Brook}}\n* [http://www.bertuchi.co.uk/pymmesbrook.html  Pymmes Brook Trail]\n*[https://www.colinsaunders.org.uk/pymmes-brook-trail/ Pymmes Brook Trail official guide]\n*[https://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Pymmes+Brook+Trail Pymmes Brook Trail on the [[LDWA]] website]\n\n{{Long-distance footpaths in London}}\n\n{{Coord|51|35|17.17|N|0|3|29.42|W|scale:6250_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Footpaths in London]]\n[[Category:River Lea]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:Pymmes Park Trail.JPG|thumbnail|Pymmes Brook Trail sign]]\nThe '''Pymmes Brook Trail''' is located in the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] and [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and is just under {{convert|13|miles|km}} long.
