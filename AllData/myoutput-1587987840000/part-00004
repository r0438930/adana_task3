That year, Freud invited Jung to visit him in Vienna.  The two men, it is said, were greatly attracted to each other, and they talked continuously for thirteen hours.  This led to a professional relationship in which they corresponded on a weekly basis, for a period of six years.<ref name=\"Hall-Nordby\" >{{Cite book | author1=Hall, Calvin S. | author2=Nordby, Vernon J. | title=A Primer of Jungian Psychology | location=New York | publisher=Meridian | year=1999 | isbn=0-452-01186-8 | url=https://archive.org/details/primerofjungianp00hall_0 }}</ref>\n\n[[Carl Jung]]'s contributions in psychodynamic psychology include:\n#The psyche tends toward wholeness.\n#The self is composed of the ego, the personal unconscious, the [[collective unconscious]].<ref>[http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2002/jungwork.htm niu.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626044516/http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2002/jungwork.htm |date=2007-06-26 }} Outline of the Major Points in Carl Jung's Contributions to Psychology</ref> The collective unconscious contains the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] which manifest in ways particular to each individual.\n#[[Jungian archetypes|Archetypes]] are composed of dynamic tensions and arise spontaneously in the individual and collective psyche.

Bowlby's inspiration came from reading the work of [[Konrad Lorenz]], the famous Nobel Prize\u2013winning founder of the field of [[ethology]] or animal behaviour.  In particular Bowlby was struck by the phenomenon of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]], which Lorenz had studied in birds, and he saw the possibility that infants might imprint on their mother in a similar way.  Along with his student [[Mary Ainsworth]] he studied infant behaviour, and developed what he called [[attachment theory]]. He rejected Freud's ideas of damage caused by frustrated impulses, in favour of the idea that [[maternal deprivation]] is a major cause of disturbed development and later psychological problems. Later he realised that infants need a stable, safe person or persons to provide a feeling of security from which they can venture out and explore.  Many other workers in the field have since carried out experiments on infants and on animals which seem to confirm and refine this idea.<ref name = Bretherton/>\n\nBowlby's [[attachment theory]] is widely considered to be the basis of most current research, and to have put the field formerly known as psychoanalysis on a more scientifically based, experimentally testable, footing.<ref name = Bretherton>Inge Bretherton: [http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/online/inge_origins.pdf The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth]</ref> Bowlby's work led to a major change in hospital practice in the UK, where children admitted to hospital had not been allowed visits from parents during their stay.  Contact with parents was said to unsettle the children and interfere with ward routine. Today, parents are encouraged to stay with their children in UK hospitals, or visit whenever they want.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Current developments==\nAt present, psychodynamics is an evolving multi-disciplinary field which analyses and studies human thought process, response patterns, and influences. Research in this field provides insights into a number of areas, including:\n\n#Understanding and anticipating the range of specific conscious and unconscious responses to specific sensory inputs, as images, colors, textures, sounds, etc. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n#Utilizing the communicative nature of movement and primal physiological gestures to affect and study specific mind-body states. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n#Examining the capacity for the mind and senses to directly affect physiological response and biological change. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n*In [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]], patients become increasingly aware of dynamic conflicts and tensions that are manifesting as a symptom or challenge in their lives. Together with the clinician, patients are assisted to bring conflicting aspects of their self into awareness, and through time, begin to integrate the conflicting parts and resolve aspects of the tension. This is talked about in different ways in each of the psychodynamic psychological theories, but all share the common goal of attempting to describe the dynamic nature of the tension between conflicting parts, assist the client in coming to terms with the tension, and begin the process of integration and healing. This is as opposed to simply evaluating previously unexamined beliefs, as is advocated for in, for example, [[reflective practice]].\n*Cognitive psychodynamics is a blend of traditional psychodynamic concepts with [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Horowitz | first = Mardi, J. | title = Cognitive Psychodynamics \u2013 from Conflict to Character | publisher = Wiley | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-471-11772-2}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ernst Wilhelm von Br\u00fccke|Br\u00fccke, Ernst Wilhelm]]\n* [[Cathexis]]\n* [[Object relations theory]]\n* [[Reaction formation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brown, Junius Flagg & Menninger, Karl Augustus (1940).

The superego refers to the repository of an individual's moral values, divided into the conscience - the internalization of a society's rules and regulations - and the ego-ideal - the internalization of one's goals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson |display-authors=etal |first=Neil, R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Person Education|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/453 453\u2013454]|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/453}}</ref>   Hence, the basic psychodynamic model focuses on the dynamic interactions between the id, ego, and superego.<ref name=\"Ahles\" >{{Cite book| last = Ahles | first = Scott, R. | title = Our Inner World: A Guide to Psychodynamics and Psychotherapy | pages = (1\u20132) | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8018-7836-5 }}</ref> Psychodynamics, subsequently, attempts to explain or interpret behaviour or mental states in terms of innate [[emotion]]al forces or processes.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ernst willhelm von bruecke.jpeg|upright|thumb|[[Ernst von Br\u00fccke]], early developer of psychodynamics.]]\n\nFreud used the term psychodynamics to describe the processes of the [[mind]] as flows of [[psychological energy]] ([[libido]]) in an organically complex [[brain]].<ref name=\"Bowlby\" /> The idea for this came from his first year adviser, [[Ernst von Br\u00fccke]] at the [[University of Vienna]], who held the view that all living organisms, including humans, are basically energy-systems to which the principle of the conservation of energy applies.<ref name=\"iep\">{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/ | title=Sigmund Freud (1856\u20141939) | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=2013-05-26 | author=Stephen P.

Thanks to Freud's singular genius, he was to discover some twenty years later that the [[laws of dynamics]] could be applied to man's personality as well as to his body.  When he made his discovery Freud proceeded to create a ''dynamic psychology''.  A '''dynamic psychology''' is one that studies the transformations and exchanges of [[energy]] within the [[Personality psychology|personality]].

That year, Freud invited Jung to visit him in Vienna.  The two men, it is said, were greatly attracted to each other, and they talked continuously for thirteen hours.  This led to a professional relationship in which they corresponded on a weekly basis, for a period of six years.<ref name=\"Hall-Nordby\" >{{Cite book | author1=Hall, Calvin S. | author2=Nordby, Vernon J. | title=A Primer of Jungian Psychology | location=New York | publisher=Meridian | year=1999 | isbn=0-452-01186-8 | url=https://archive.org/details/primerofjungianp00hall_0 }}</ref>\n\n[[Carl Jung]]'s contributions in psychodynamic psychology include:\n#The psyche tends toward wholeness.\n#The self is composed of the ego, the personal unconscious, the [[collective unconscious]].<ref>[http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2002/jungwork.htm niu.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626044516/http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2002/jungwork.htm |date=2007-06-26 }} Outline of the Major Points in Carl Jung's Contributions to Psychology</ref> The collective unconscious contains the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] which manifest in ways particular to each individual.\n#[[Jungian archetypes|Archetypes]] are composed of dynamic tensions and arise spontaneously in the individual and collective psyche.

Bowlby's inspiration came from reading the work of [[Konrad Lorenz]], the famous Nobel Prize\u2013winning founder of the field of [[ethology]] or animal behaviour.  In particular Bowlby was struck by the phenomenon of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]], which Lorenz had studied in birds, and he saw the possibility that infants might imprint on their mother in a similar way.  Along with his student [[Mary Ainsworth]] he studied infant behaviour, and developed what he called [[attachment theory]]. He rejected Freud's ideas of damage caused by frustrated impulses, in favour of the idea that [[maternal deprivation]] is a major cause of disturbed development and later psychological problems. Later he realised that infants need a stable, safe person or persons to provide a feeling of security from which they can venture out and explore.  Many other workers in the field have since carried out experiments on infants and on animals which seem to confirm and refine this idea.<ref name = Bretherton/>\n\nBowlby's [[attachment theory]] is widely considered to be the basis of most current research, and to have put the field formerly known as psychoanalysis on a more scientifically based, experimentally testable, footing.<ref name = Bretherton>Inge Bretherton: [http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/online/inge_origins.pdf The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth]</ref> Bowlby's work led to a major change in hospital practice in the UK, where children admitted to hospital had not been allowed visits from parents during their stay.  Contact with parents was said to unsettle the children and interfere with ward routine. Today, parents are encouraged to stay with their children in UK hospitals, or visit whenever they want.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Current developments==\nAt present, psychodynamics is an evolving multi-disciplinary field which analyses and studies human thought process, response patterns, and influences. Research in this field provides insights into a number of areas, including:\n\n#Understanding and anticipating the range of specific conscious and unconscious responses to specific sensory inputs, as images, colors, textures, sounds, etc. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n#Utilizing the communicative nature of movement and primal physiological gestures to affect and study specific mind-body states. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n#Examining the capacity for the mind and senses to directly affect physiological response and biological change. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n*In [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]], patients become increasingly aware of dynamic conflicts and tensions that are manifesting as a symptom or challenge in their lives. Together with the clinician, patients are assisted to bring conflicting aspects of their self into awareness, and through time, begin to integrate the conflicting parts and resolve aspects of the tension. This is talked about in different ways in each of the psychodynamic psychological theories, but all share the common goal of attempting to describe the dynamic nature of the tension between conflicting parts, assist the client in coming to terms with the tension, and begin the process of integration and healing. This is as opposed to simply evaluating previously unexamined beliefs, as is advocated for in, for example, [[reflective practice]].\n*Cognitive psychodynamics is a blend of traditional psychodynamic concepts with [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Horowitz | first = Mardi, J. | title = Cognitive Psychodynamics \u2013 from Conflict to Character | publisher = Wiley | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-471-11772-2}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ernst Wilhelm von Br\u00fccke|Br\u00fccke, Ernst Wilhelm]]\n* [[Cathexis]]\n* [[Object relations theory]]\n* [[Reaction formation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brown, Junius Flagg & Menninger, Karl Augustus (1940).
