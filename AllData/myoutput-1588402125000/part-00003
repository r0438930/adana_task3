It is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] composed of the [[President of India]] and the two houses: the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States) and the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of the People). The President in his role as head of legislature has full powers to summon and prorogue either house of Parliament or to dissolve Lok Sabha. The president can exercise these powers only upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] and his [[Union Council of Ministers]].\n\nThose elected or nominated (by the President) to either house of Parliament are referred to as [[Member of parliament (India)|Members of Parliament]] (MP). The [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|Members of Parliament, Lok Sabha]] are [[direct election|directly elected]] by the Indian public voting in [[Single-member district]]s and the [[Member of parliament, Rajya Sabha|Members of Parliament, Rajya Sabha]] are elected by the [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|members]] of all [[Vidhan Sabha|State Legislative Assembly]] by [[proportional representation]]. The Parliament has a sanctioned strength of 543 in Lok Sabha and 245 in Rajya Sabha including the 12 nominees from the expertise of different fields of science, culture, art and history. The Parliament meets at [[Parliament House (India)|Sansad Bhavan]] in [[New Delhi]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Imperial Legislative Council|Constituent Assembly of India}}\nThe Constituent Assembly of India was elected to write the Constitution of India.

It was designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] and [[Herbert Baker]], who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi by British government. The construction of buildings took six years and the opening ceremony was performed on 18 January 1927 by the then [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy and Governor-General of India]], [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]]. The construction costs for the building were {{INRConvert|8.3|m}}. The parliament is {{convert|560|ft|order=flip}} in diameter and covers an area of {{convert|6|acre|order=flip}}.

Surrounding these three chambers is the four-storeyed circular structure providing accommodations for ministers, chairmen, parliamentary committees, party offices, important offices of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats, and also the offices of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. The Central Hall is circular in shape and the dome is {{convert|98|ft|order=flip}} in diameter. It is a place of historical importance. The [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] was framed in the Central Hall. The Central Hall was originally used in the library of the erstwhile Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States. In 1946, it was converted and refurbished into [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] Hall. At present, the Central Hall is used for holding joint sittings of both the houses of parliament and also used for address by the President in the commencement of first session after each [[Lok Sabha#Lok Sabha general elections|general election]].\n\n===Proposal for a new building===\nA new Parliament building may replace the existing complex.

It is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] composed of the [[President of India]] and the two houses: the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States) and the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of the People). The President in his role as head of legislature has full powers to summon and prorogue either house of Parliament or to dissolve Lok Sabha. The president can exercise these powers only upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] and his [[Union Council of Ministers]].\n\nThose elected or nominated (by the President) to either house of Parliament are referred to as [[Member of parliament (India)|Members of Parliament]] (MP).

It was designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] and [[Herbert Baker]], who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi by British government. The construction of buildings took six years and the opening ceremony was performed on 18 January 1927 by the then [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy and Governor-General of India]], [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]]. The construction costs for the building were {{INRConvert|8.3|m}}. The parliament is {{convert|560|ft|order=flip}} in diameter and covers an area of {{convert|6|acre|order=flip}}.

The Central Hall is circular in shape and the dome is {{convert|98|ft|order=flip}} in diameter. It is a place of historical importance. The [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] was framed in the Central Hall. The Central Hall was originally used in the library of the erstwhile Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States. In 1946, it was converted and refurbished into [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] Hall. At present, the Central Hall is used for holding joint sittings of both the houses of parliament and also used for address by the President in the commencement of first session after each [[Lok Sabha#Lok Sabha general elections|general election]].\n\n===Proposal for a new building===\nA new Parliament building may replace the existing complex.
