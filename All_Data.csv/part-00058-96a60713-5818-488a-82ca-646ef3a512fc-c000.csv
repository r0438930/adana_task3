== Description ==
The legend of the bottomless hole started on February 21, 1997, when a man identifying himself as Mel Waters appeared as a guest on ''Coast to Coast AM'' with [[Art Bell]]. Waters claimed that he owned rural property nine miles west of [[Ellensburg, Washington|Ellensburg]] in [[Kittitas County, Washington|Kittitas County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] that contained a mysterious hole. According to Bell's interviews with Waters, the hole had infinite depth and the ability to restore dead animals to life. Waters claimed to have measured the hole's depth to be more than 80,000 feet by using a fishing line and a weight. According to Waters, the hole's magical properties prompted US \"federal agents\" to seize the land and fund his relocation to [[Australia]].<ref name=\" DR\" />

Waters made guest appearances on Bell's show in 1997, 2000, and 2002. Rebroadcasts of those appearances have helped create what's been described as a \"modern, rural myth\".

Local news reporters who investigated the claims found no public records of anyone named Mel Waters ever residing in, or owning property in Kittitas County. According to [[Washington State Department of Natural Resources|State Department of Natural Resources]] geologist Jack Powell, the hole does not exist and is geologically impossible. A hole of the depth claimed \"would collapse into itself under the tremendous pressure and heat from the surrounding strata,\" said Powell. Powell said an ordinary old mine shaft on private property was probably the inspiration for the stories and commented that Mel's Hole had established itself as a legend \"based on no evidence at all\".<ref name=\"DR\">{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Mike|title=Getting to the bottom of Mel's Hole|url=http://www.dailyrecordnews.com/news/getting-to-the-bottom-of-mel-s-hole/article_d72b6a68-7ac2-11e1-b3ce-001a4bcf887a.html|website=Daily Record|publisher=Washington Daily Record|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>

According to [[Washington State Department of Natural Resources|State Department of Natural Resources]] geologist Jack Powell, the hole does not exist and is geologically impossible. A hole of the depth claimed \"would collapse into itself under the tremendous pressure and heat from the surrounding strata,\" said Powell. Powell said an ordinary old mine shaft on private property was probably the inspiration for the stories, and commented that Mel's Hole had established itself as a legend \"based on no evidence at all\".<ref name=\"DR\">{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Mike|title=Getting to the bottom of Mel's Hole|url=http://www.dailyrecordnews.com/news/getting-to-the-bottom-of-mel-s-hole/article_d72b6a68-7ac2-11e1-b3ce-001a4bcf887a.html|website=Daily Record|publisher=Washington Daily Record|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>

== \"Aspects of Mel's Hole\" art exhibit ==
An art exhibition, \"Aspects of Mel's Hole: Artists Respond to a Paranormal Land Event Occurring in Radiospace,\" curated by ''[[LA Weekly]]'' art critic Doug Harvey, was presented at the Grand Central Art Center in [[Santa Ana, California]] in 2008. The show featured works by 41 artists and collectives, many created specifically for the exhibition, including works by Albert Cuellar, Charles Schneider, [[Marnie Weber]], [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]], [[Jeffrey Vallance]], Georganne Deen, [[Paul Laffoley]], [[The Firesign Theatre]], [[Gary Panter]], [[The Center for Land Use Interpretation]], James Hayward, Cathy Ward, Eric Wright and [[Craig Stecyk]]. The GCAC published a hardbound 146-page catalog in conjunction with the exhibit, containing contributions from all the artists, plus essays by Harvey, psychoanalyst Judy Spence, science author [[Margaret Wertheim]], Hannah Miller, Brian Tucker, Christine Wertheim, Mike Mcgee and the Rev. Ethan Acres.<ref name=OCWeekly>{{cite web|last=Stacy|first=Greg|title=Getting to the Bottom of Mel's Hole at the Grand Central Art Center|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2008-10-02/culture/mels-hole-grand-central-art-center/full/|work=Thursday, Oct 2 2008|publisher=OCWeekly|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>

[[Image:ITM example 2007-06-05.jpg|right|300px|thumb|ITM coordinates on an OSi map from 2006. In this example the easting and the northing are separated by a comma.]]
[[Image:ITM map of Ireland.svg|right|300px|thumb|An illustration of ITM coordinates over a map of Ireland. Eastings are on the top/bottom. Northings are on the right/left.]]
'''Irish Transverse Mercator''' ('''ITM''') is the [[geographic coordinate system]] for Ireland. It was implemented jointly by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] (OSi) and the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] (OSNI) in 2001. The name is derived from the [[Transverse Mercator]] projection it uses and the fact that it is optimised for the island of Ireland.

==History==
The older [[Irish grid reference system]] required GPS measurements to be \"translated\" (using [[Coordinate system#Transformations|co-ordinate transformations]]). The more precise the GPS measurements were, the more the translation process introduced inaccuracies.

While the existing [[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]] co-ordinate system partly fulfilled the requirement for direct GPS compatibility it had some drawbacks, including varying levels of distortion across the island due to the central meridian being at the west coast of Ireland.

The new system needed to satisfy various criteria: GPS compatibility, map distortion for the whole island of Ireland had to be minimal, it was to be [[Map projection#Conformal|conformal]] and backward compatible with existing mapping. A customised Transverse Mercator projection was chosen.

ITM and the older more established Irish Grid will (initially at least) be used in parallel. As a result ITM coordinates had to be obviously different so users would not confuse the two. This was done by shifting the ITM false origin further into the Atlantic and thereby creating substantially different co-ordinate numbers for any given location.

While OSi and OSNI intend to supply map information in the older Irish Grid format into the future, the Irish Institution of Surveyors has recommended that ITM be adopted as soon as possible as the preferred official co-ordinate system for Ireland.

==Examples==

An ITM co-ordinate is generally given as a pair of two six-digit numbers (excluding any digits behind a [[decimal point]] which may be used in very precise surveying). The first number is always the [[easting]] and the second is the [[northing]]. The easting and northing are in metres from the false [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].

The ITM co-ordinate for the [[Spire of Dublin]] on [[O'Connell Street]] is:

:715830, 734697

The first figure is the easting and means that the location is 715,830 metres east from the false origin (along the [[X axis]]). The second figure is the northing and puts the location 734,697 metres north of the false origin (along the [[Y axis]])

The equivalent Irish Grid co-ordinate for the same location is:

:315904, 234671

The Spire of Dublin example provides a [[Position fixing|fix]] for a location that is accurate to 1 metre. With ITM it is possible to give a more accurate co-ordinate for a given location by using a decimal point after the initial six figure easting and northing.

The ITM co-ordinate for the passive GPS station at the OSi office is:

:E 709885.081m, N 736167.699m

This ITM co-ordinate has three digits behind the decimal point which gives a fix for a location with millimetre accuracy. Also notice how the easting in this example is indicated with an “E” and likewise an “N” for the northing. The fact that the co-ordinate is in metres is indicated by the lowercase m.

With ITM there is no provision for using [[Myriad (unit of area)|myriad]] letters and truncated coordinates as there is with the Irish Grid.
Every co-ordinate must be given with at least a six-digit easting and northing from the false origin.

[[Image:ITM map of Ireland.svg|right|300px|thumb|An illustration of ITM coordinates over a map of Ireland. Eastings are on the top/bottom. Northings are on the right/left.]]
'''Irish Transverse Mercator''' ('''ITM''') is the [[geographic coordinate system]] for Ireland. It was implemented jointly by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] (OSi) and the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] (OSNI) in 2001. The name is derived from the [[Transverse Mercator]] projection it uses and the fact that it is optimised for the island of Ireland.

==History==
The older [[Irish grid reference system]] required GPS measurements to be \"translated\" (using [[Coordinate system#Transformations|co-ordinate transformations]]). The more precise the GPS measurements were, the more the translation process introduced inaccuracies.

While the existing [[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]] co-ordinate system partly fulfilled the requirement for direct GPS compatibility it had some drawbacks, including varying levels of distortion across the island due to the central meridian being at the west coast of Ireland.

The new system needed to satisfy various criteria: GPS compatibility, map distortion for the whole island of Ireland had to be minimal, it was to be [[Map projection#Conformal|conformal]] and backward compatible with existing mapping. A customised Transverse Mercator projection was chosen.

ITM and the older more established Irish Grid will (initially at least) be used in parallel. As a result ITM coordinates had to be obviously different so users would not confuse the two. This was done by shifting the ITM false origin further into the Atlantic and thereby creating substantially different co-ordinate numbers for any given location.

While OSi and OSNI intend to supply map information in the older Irish Grid format into the future, the Irish Institution of Surveyors has recommended that ITM be adopted as soon as possible as the preferred official co-ordinate system for Ireland.

==Examples==

An ITM co-ordinate is generally given as a pair of two six-digit numbers (excluding any digits behind a [[decimal point]] which may be used in very precise surveying). The first number is always the [[easting]] and the second is the [[northing]]. The easting and northing are in metres from the false [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].

The ITM co-ordinate for the [[Spire of Dublin]] on [[O'Connell Street]] is:

:715830, 734697

The first figure is the easting and means that the location is 715,830 metres east from the false origin (along the [[X axis]]). The second figure is the northing and puts the location 734,697 metres north of the false origin (along the [[Y axis]])

The equivalent Irish Grid co-ordinate for the same location is:

:315904, 234671

The Spire of Dublin example provides a [[Position fixing|fix]] for a location that is accurate to 1 metre. With ITM it is possible to give a more accurate co-ordinate for a given location by using a decimal point after the initial six figure easting and northing.

The ITM co-ordinate for the passive GPS station at the OSi office is:

:E 709885.081m, N 736167.699m

This ITM co-ordinate has three digits behind the decimal point which gives a fix for a location with millimetre accuracy. Also notice how the easting in this example is indicated with an “E” and likewise an “N” for the northing. The fact that the co-ordinate is in metres is indicated by the lowercase m.

With ITM there is no provision for using [[Myriad (unit of area)|myriad]] letters and truncated coordinates as there is with the Irish Grid.
Every co-ordinate must be given with at least a six digit easting and northing from the false origin.

'''Alonso Cano''' or '''Alonzo Cano'''  (19 March 1601{{snd}}3 September 1667)  was a Spanish painter, architect and sculptor born in [[Granada]].<ref name=\"newadvent.org\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03250d.htm Alonso Cano] – [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:Alonso Cano - Saint John the Evangelist's Vision of Jerusalem - WGA04003.jpg|thumb|180px|Saint John the Evangelist's Vision of Jerusalem]]
He learned architecture from his father, [[Miguel Cano]];<ref name=\"newadvent.org\" /> painting in the academy of [[Juan del Castillo]],<ref name=\"newadvent.org\" /> and from [[Francisco Pacheco]] the teacher of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]; and sculpture from [[Juan Martínez Montañés]]. As a sculptor, his most famous works are the ''Madonna and Child'' in the church of [[Lebrija]] (also called ''Nebrija''), and the colossal figures of San Pedro and San Pablo.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\" /><ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Cano, Alonzo|volume=5|page=189}}</ref>

He was made first royal architect, painter to [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], and instructor to the prince, [[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias]]. The King gave him the church preferment of a canon of the [[Granada Cathedral]] (1652),<ref name=\"newadvent.org\" /> in order to take up a position as chief architect of the cathedral, where his main achievement in architecture was the façade, designed at the end of his life and erected to his design after his death.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

He was notorious for his ungovernable temper; and it is said that once he risked his life by committing the then capital offence of dashing to pieces the statue of a [[saint]], when in a rage with the purchaser who begrudged the price he demanded.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref name=\"newadvent.org\" /> According to another story, he found his house robbed after coming home one evening, his wife murdered, and his Italian servant fled. Notwithstanding the presumption against the fugitive, the magistrates condemned Cano, because he was of a jealous temper.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Upon this he fled to [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], but afterwards returned to [[Madrid]], where he was put to the torture, which he endured without incriminating himself, and the king received him into favour.<ref>Anonymous, \"[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Alonso_Cano_%28Retrato%29 Alonso Cano]\" in ''[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Retratos_de_Espa%C3%B1oles_ilustres Retratos de Españoles ilustres con un epítome de sus vidas]'', 1791.</ref>

After the death of his wife he took [[Holy Orders]]<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> as a protection from further prosecution, but still continued his professional pursuits. He died in 1667. In his last moments, when the priest held to him a [[crucifix]], he told him to take it away; according to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', this was because the priest gave the Sacrament to [[conversos]].<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> Probably this version is spurious as many others about his life and temperament.

[[File:2010-10-30 Wikipedia Bodensee Treffen Übersicht.jpg|thumb|A thumbnail view of multiple images]]
'''Thumbnails''' are reduced-size versions of [[Image|pictures]] or [[video]]s, used to help in recognizing and organizing them, serving the same role for images as a normal text [[index (publishing)|index]] does for words. In the age of [[digital image]]s, visual [[search engine]]s and image-organizing programs normally use thumbnails, as do most modern operating systems or desktop environments, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[KDE]] ([[Linux]]) and [[GNOME]] ([[Linux]]). On web pages, they also avoid the need to download larger files unnecessarily.

==Implementation==

Thumbnails are ideally implemented on web pages as separate, smaller copies of the original image, in part because one purpose of a thumbnail image on a web page is to reduce [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and download time. Some web designers produce thumbnails with [[HTML element|HTML]] or client-side scripting that makes the user's browser shrink the picture, rather than use a smaller copy of the image. This results in no saved bandwidth, and the visual quality of browser resizing is usually less than ideal.
Displaying a significant part of the picture instead of the full frame can allow the use of a smaller thumbnail while maintaining recognizability. For example, when thumbnailing a full-body [[portrait]] of a person, it may be better to show the face slightly reduced than an indistinct figure. However, this may mislead the viewer about what the image contains, so is more suited to artistic presentations than searching or catalogue browsing.

In 2002, the court in the US case ''[[Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation]]'' ruled that it was [[fair use]] for [[Internet]] search engines to use thumbnail images to help web users find what they seek.

The use of the word \"thumbnail\" in the specific context of computer images as 'a small graphical representation, as of a larger graphic, a page layout, etc.' appears to have been first used in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Random House Word of the Day\"/>

*[[DeviantArt]] automatically produces thumbnails that are maximum 150 pixels in the long dimension.
*[[Flickr]] automatically produces thumbnails that are a maximum 240 pixels in the long dimension, or smaller 75×75 pixels. It also applies [[unsharp mask]] to them.
*[[Picasa]] automatically produces thumbnails that are a maximum 144 pixels in the long dimension, or 160×160 pixels album thumbnails.

The term ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' is sometimes used to describe an image that is smaller than the original, larger than a thumbnail, but no more than 250 pixels in the long dimension.

==Thumbnail sketches==

[[File:Moaisvxd.jpg|thumb|Thumbnail sketches of [[Moai]]]]

[[Art director]]s, [[storyboard artist]]s and [[graphic design]]ers, as well as other kinds of visual artists, use the term \"thumbnail sketch\" to describe a small drawing on paper (usually part of a group) used to explore multiple ideas quickly. Thumbnail sketches are similar to [[doodle]]s, but may include as  much detail as a small [[Pencil sketching|sketch]]. A “comprehensive” thumbnail sketch of a printed project, more or less to final size, is often referred to as a “comp”, and can be highly detailed with production information.

*[[Flickr]] automatically produces thumbnails that are a maximum 240 pixels in the long dimension, or smaller 75×75 pixels. It also applies [[unsharp mask]] to them.
*[[Picasa]] automatically produces thumbnails that are a maximum 144 pixels in the long dimension, or 160×160 pixels album thumbnails.

The term ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' is sometimes used to describe an image that is smaller than the original, larger than a thumbnail, but no more than 250 pixels in the long dimension.

==Thumbnail sketches==

[[File:Moaisvxd.jpg|thumb|Thumbnail sketches of [[Moai]]]]

[[Art director]]s, [[storyboard artist]]s and [[graphic design]]ers, as well as other kinds of visual artists, use the term \"thumbnail sketch\" to describe a small drawing on paper (usually part of a group) used to explore multiple ideas quickly. Thumbnail sketches are similar to [[doodle]]s, but may include as  much detail as a small [[Pencil sketching|sketch]]. A “comprehensive” thumbnail sketch of a printed project, more or less to final size, is often referred to as a “comp”, and can be highly detailed with production information.

'''SMS ''Natter'''''{{#tag:ref|\"SMS\" stands for \"''[[Seiner Majestät Schiff]]'' \", or \"His Majesty's Ship\" in German.|group=lower-alpha}} was a [[torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. ''Natter'' was built by the German shipbuilder [[Schichau-Werke]] between 1895 and 1896. She was renamed '''''Torpedoboot 18''''' (abbreviated ''Tb 18'') in 1910 and used for local coast defence during the [[First World War]]. She was scrapped in 1920.

==Design==
In 1895, the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] purchased one prototype [[torpedo boat]] each from the British shipbuilder [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] and the German shipbuilder [[Schichau-Werke]], two specialist builders of torpedo vessels. <ref name=\"conways06 p332\">{{Harvnb|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=332}}</ref>

The ship was armed by two {{convert|47|mm|adj=on}} L/33 Skoda guns and three {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The ship had a crew of 21.<ref name=\"gregp53\"/>

==Construction and service==
The Schichau torpedo boat, named ''Natter'', was [[Keel laying|laid down]] at Schichau's Elbing, [[Prussia]] (now [[Elbląg]] in Poland) shipyard in 1895,<ref name=\"gregp53\"/> and launched in February 1896, later than the competing Yarrow-built torpedo boat {{SMS|Viper|1896|2}}.<ref name=\"conways60p280\"/> She was completed in November 1896.<ref name=\"gregp53\"/> While both torpedo boats had similar stability and seaworthiness, ''Natter'' suffered from vibrations at high speed, which stopped the German-built ship becoming fully operational, and was instead used as a mobile torpedo-battery at the port of Pola (now [[Pula]] in [[Croatia]]). Further orders went to Yarrow.<ref name=\"conways60p280\"/>

In 1910, Austria renamed most of its torpedo boats, with ''Natter'' becoming ''Tb 18''.<ref name=\"conways06 p332\"/> In 1910–1911, ''Tb 18'' was rearmed, with the two torpedo tubes mounted on the ship's beams replaced by a single centreline tube.<ref name=\"conways06 p332\"/> At the outbreak of the [[First World War]], ''Tb 18'' formed part of the Minesweeping flotilla of the Pola Local Defence Forces.<ref name=\"gregp14\">{{Harvnb|Greger|1976|p=14}}</ref><ref name=\"fockp407\">{{Harvnb|Fock|1989|p=407}}</ref> She was employed on training duties in the war, and in 1917 was again rearmed, with a twin torpedo tube mount replacing one of the single tubes.<ref name=\"conways06 p332\"/> ''Tb 18'' was allocated to Great Britain as a [[War reparation]] as part of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] in 1919.

{{redirect|Lossless video compression|a list of lossless video codecs|List of codecs#Lossless video compression}}
'''Uncompressed video''' is [[digital video]] that either has never been [[video compression|compressed]] or was generated by decompressing previously compressed digital video. It is commonly used by video cameras, video monitors, video recording devices (including general purpose computers), and in video processors that perform functions such as image resizing, image rotation, deinterlacing, and text and graphics overlay. It is conveyed over various types of baseband digital video interfaces, such as [[HDMI]], [[DVI]], [[DisplayPort]] and [[Serial digital interface|SDI]]. Standards also exist for carriage of uncompressed video over [[computer network]]s.

Some [[HD video]] cameras output uncompressed video, whereas others compress the video using a lossy compression method such as [[MPEG]] or [[H.264]]. In any lossy compression process, some of the video information is removed, which creates [[compression artifact]]s and reduces the quality of the resulting decompressed video. When editing video, it is preferred to work with video that has never been compressed (or was losslessly compressed) as this maintains the best possible quality, with compression performed after completion of editing.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd743961(v=vs.85).aspx Using Uncompressed Audio and Video Streams] Microsoft</ref>

==Recording==
A standalone video recorder is a device that receives uncompressed video and stores it in either uncompressed or compressed form. These devices typically have a video output which can be used to monitor or playback recorded video. When playing back compressed video, the compressed video is uncompressed by the device before being output. Such devices may also have a communication interface, such as Ethernet or USB, which can used to exchange video files with an external computer, and in some cases control the recorder from an external computer as well.

Recording to a computer is a relatively inexpensive alternative to implementing a digital video recorder, but the computer and its video storage device (e.g., [[solid-state drive]], [[RAID]]) must be fast enough to keep up with the high video data rate, which in some cases may be [[HD video]] or multiple video sources, or both. Due to the extreme computational and storage system performance demands of real-time video processing, other unnecessary [[Computer program|program]] activity (e.g., [[background process]]es, [[virus scanner]]s) and asynchronous hardware interfaces (e.g., [[computer networks]]) may be disabled, and the [[Computer multitasking|process priority]] of the recording [[Real-time computing|realtime process]] may be increased, to avoid disruption of the recording process.

HDMI, DVI and HD-SDI inputs are available as [[PCI Express]] (partly multi-channel) or [[ExpressCard]], [[USB 3.0]]<ref>[http://www.epiphan.com/products/compare-usb-video-grabbers/ Compare USB Video Grabbers] Epiphan</ref> and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] interface<ref>[http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity/ Intensity models] Blackmagic</ref><ref>[http://www.imperx.com/frame-grabbers/hd-sdi-express34 HD-SDI Express/34] Imperx</ref><ref>[http://www.deltacast.tv/Products/DELTA-hd-SDI-OEM-video-input-output-PCI-Express-card.asp OEM video card for 8-10-12-bit HD-SD SDI digital video to PCI Express] Deltacast</ref> also for [[2160p]] ([[4K resolution]]).<ref>[http://www.magewell.com/hardware?lang=en Capture Card Series] Magewell</ref><ref>[http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink/models DeckLink models] Blackmagic</ref>

Software for recording uncompressed video is often supplied with suitable hardware or available for free e.g. [[Ingex]].<ref>[http://ingex.sourceforge.net/studio/ Ingex Studio - Multi-camera Tapeless Recording]</ref>

==Network transmission==
[[SMPTE 2022]] and [[SMPTE 2110|2110]] are standards for professional digital video over [[IP network]]s. SMPTE 2022 includes provisions for both compressed and uncompressed video formats. SMPTE 2110 carries uncompressed video, audio and [[ancillary data]] as separate [[streaming media|streams]].

[[wireless network|Wireless interfaces]] such as [[Wireless LAN]] (WLAN, [[Wi-Fi]]), [[WiDi]], and [[Wireless Home Digital Interface]] can be used to transmit uncompressed standard definition (SD) video but not HD video because the HD bit rates would exceed the network bandwidth. HD can be transmitted using higher speed interfaces such as [[WirelessHD]] and [[WiGig]]. In all cases, when video is conveyed over a network, communication disruptions or diminished bandwidth can corrupt the video or prevent its transmission.

==Data rates==

Uncompressed video has a [[constant bitrate]] that is based on pixel representation, image resolution, and frame rate:

:[[Data signaling rate|data rate]] = [[color depth]]{{efn|Most of the time color depth can be calculated as 3 × single color depth. For example, values of single color can be represented in range from 0 to 255 (8 bits) which gives a total color depth as 3 × 8 <nowiki>=</nowiki> 24.}} × vertical [[Image resolution|resolution]] × horizontal resolution × [[refresh frequency]]

For example:
*24-bit, 1080i @ 60 [[Frame rate|fps]]: 24 × 1920×540{{efn|[[Interlaced video]] formats transmit every other line, half the picture content, per field period. Two field are required for a full frame so the vertical resolution is halved in this calculation.}} × 60 = 1.49 [[gigabit per second|Gbit/s]]
*24-bit, 1080p @ 60 fps: 24 × 1920×1080 × 60 = 2.98 Gbit/s.

'''Uncompressed video''' is [[digital video]] that either has never been [[video compression|compressed]] or was generated by decompressing previously compressed digital video. It is commonly used by video cameras, video monitors, video recording devices (including general purpose computers), and in video processors that perform functions such as image resizing, image rotation, deinterlacing, and text and graphics overlay. It is conveyed over various types of baseband digital video interfaces, such as [[HDMI]], [[DVI]], [[DisplayPort]] and [[Serial digital interface|SDI]]. Standards also exist for carriage of uncompressed video over [[computer network]]s.

Some [[HD video]] cameras output uncompressed video, whereas others compress the video using a lossy compression method such as [[MPEG]] or [[H.264]]. In any lossy compression process, some of the video information is removed, which creates [[compression artifact]]s and reduces the quality of the resulting decompressed video. When editing video, it is preferred to work with video that has never been compressed (or was losslessly compressed) as this maintains the best possible quality, with compression performed after completion of editing.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd743961(v=vs.85).aspx Using Uncompressed Audio and Video Streams] Microsoft</ref>

==Recording==
A standalone video recorder is a device that receives uncompressed video and stores it in either uncompressed or compressed form. These devices typically have a video output which can be used to monitor or playback recorded video. When playing back compressed video, the compressed video is uncompressed by the device before being output. Such devices may also have a communication interface, such as Ethernet or USB, which can used to exchange video files with an external computer, and in some cases control the recorder from an external computer as well.

Recording to a computer is a relatively inexpensive alternative to implementing a digital video recorder, but the computer and its video storage device (e.g., [[solid-state drive]], [[RAID]]) must be fast enough to keep up with the high video data rate, which in some cases may be [[HD video]] or multiple video sources, or both. Due to the extreme computational and storage system performance demands of real-time video processing, other unnecessary [[Computer program|program]] activity (e.g., [[background process]]es, [[virus scanner]]s) and asynchronous hardware interfaces (e.g., [[computer networks]]) may be disabled, and the [[Computer multitasking|process priority]] of the recording [[Real-time computing|realtime process]] may be increased, to avoid disruption of the recording process.

HDMI, DVI and HD-SDI inputs are available as [[PCI Express]] (partly multi-channel) or [[ExpressCard]], [[USB 3.0]]<ref>[http://www.epiphan.com/products/compare-usb-video-grabbers/ Compare USB Video Grabbers] Epiphan</ref> and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] interface<ref>[http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity/ Intensity models] Blackmagic</ref><ref>[http://www.imperx.com/frame-grabbers/hd-sdi-express34 HD-SDI Express/34] Imperx</ref><ref>[http://www.deltacast.tv/Products/DELTA-hd-SDI-OEM-video-input-output-PCI-Express-card.asp OEM video card for 8-10-12-bit HD-SD SDI digital video to PCI Express] Deltacast</ref> also for [[2160p]] ([[4K resolution]]).<ref>[http://www.magewell.com/hardware?lang=en Capture Card Series] Magewell</ref><ref>[http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink/models DeckLink models] Blackmagic</ref>

Software for recording uncompressed video is often supplied with suitable hardware or available for free e.g. [[Ingex]].<ref>[http://ingex.sourceforge.net/studio/ Ingex Studio - Multi-camera Tapeless Recording]</ref>

==Network transmission==
[[SMPTE 2022]] and [[SMPTE 2110|2110]] are standards for professional digital video over [[IP network]]s. SMPTE 2022 includes provisions for both compressed and uncompressed video formats. SMPTE 2110 carries uncompressed video, audio and [[ancillary data]] as separate [[streaming media|streams]].

[[wireless network|Wireless interfaces]] such as [[Wireless LAN]] (WLAN, [[Wi-Fi]]), [[WiDi]], and [[Wireless Home Digital Interface]] can be used to transmit uncompressed standard definition (SD) video but not HD video because the HD bit rates would exceed the network bandwidth. HD can be transmitted using higher speed interfaces such as [[WirelessHD]] and [[WiGig]]. In all cases, when video is conveyed over a network, communication disruptions or diminished bandwidth can corrupt the video or prevent its transmission.

==Data rates==

Uncompressed video has a [[constant bitrate]] that is based on pixel representation, image resolution, and frame rate:

:[[Data signaling rate|data rate]] = [[color depth]]{{efn|Most of the time color depth can be calculated as 3 × single color depth. For example, values of single color can be represented in range from 0 to 256 (8 bits) which gives a total color depth as 3 × 8 <nowiki>=</nowiki> 24.}} × vertical [[Image resolution|resolution]] × horizontal resolution × [[refresh frequency]]

For example:
*24-bit, 1080i @ 60 [[Frame rate|fps]]: 24 × 1920×540{{efn|[[Interlaced video]] formats transmit every other line, half the picture content, per field period. Two field are required for a full frame so the vertical resolution is halved in this calculation.}} × 60 = 1.49 [[gigabit per second|Gbit/s]]
*24-bit, 1080p @ 60 fps: 24 × 1920×1080 × 60 = 2.98 Gbit/s.

==Toledo Shipbuilding Company==
The Toledo Shipbuilding Company, which became an operating unit of the American Shipbuilding Company by consolidation, was itself the builder of several of the most well-known coal-fired steamships of the Great Lakes, such as the {{SS|Chief Wawatam}} (built in 1911).

== Steinbrenners ==
In the early 1960s, the American Shipbuilding Company acquired Kinsman Marine Transit Company, which was owned by the Steinbrenner family. As a result of the transaction, the Steinbrenner family acquired a controlling interest in American Shipbuilding. Frustrated after years of fighting with unions over cost-saving work changes, the Steinbrenners closed the Lorain shipyard in December 1983 and moved all operations to Tampa, Florida.  The principal member of the Steinbrenner family who was involved in the operation of the transit company at this time was [[George Steinbrenner]], who became better known later as the principal owner of the [[New York Yankees]].

The company began having difficulties in the 1980s, going through a bankruptcy in 1993. The company was sold in 1995.

'''San Juan de Ulúa''', also known as '''Castle of San Juan de Ulúa''', is a large complex of [[fortresses]], prisons and one former palace on an island of the same name in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] overlooking the [[seaport]] of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], Mexico.  [[Juan de Grijalva]]'s 1518 expedition named the island.

==History==
{{See also|Battle of San Juan de Ulúa (1568)}}
The fort was built in the Spanish colonial [[New Spain]] era, with construction starting in 1565. It was expanded several times later.

[[File:CastilloSanJuandeUlua.jpg|thumb|The fortress overlooking the Port of Veracruz]]

In 1568, the Spanish Navy succeeded in trapping the English fleet of Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], including his cousin, the young [[Francis Drake]], at San Juan de Ulúa. Although Hawkins and Drake both escaped on their respective ships, many of the English were killed.

[[Richard Hakluyt]]'s book, ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' (1598–1600), claims Drake and Hawkins were on a private venture, peacefully trading with the local Spanish colonists in violation of Spanish law, when the Spanish naval fleet arrived. Despite suspicion of treachery, they allowed the Spaniards to take shelter under truce, between San Juan de Ulúa island, on an otherwise open coastline. The attack by the Spanish was a surprise.

Historians{{who|date=July 2019}}(those who have read John Hawkins's letters and memoranda) know that Drake and Hawkins likely had raided Spanish settlements elsewhere on that voyage. The trade was in [[African slaves]], who had been captured and taken earlier from [[West Africa]]. On that occasion, it appears the English were in fact trading at Vera Cruz. Historians{{who|date=July 2019}}(those who have read John Hawkins's letters and memoranda) have speculated that the Spanish colonists traded with them illegally under their threat of raids and attacks.<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/186/000101880/? Sir John Hawkins], The National Names Database, Last accessed July 17, 2008.</ref>

Hawkins and Drake escaped in the ships ''Minion'' and ''Judith'', and their larger ships were taken or destroyed. The attack and subsequent hardships were instrumental in hardening Drake's attitude against Spain and Catholicism. Earlier in his life, he and his family had been forced to live in poverty after they were displaced by a Catholic rebellion in England.

==Post-Spanish era==
{{See also|Bombardment of San Juan de Ulúa}}

After [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's independence]] in 1821, a large number of Spanish troops continued to occupy San Juan de Ulúa as late as 1825. It was the last site in the former New Spain to be held by Spain and was surrendered to General [[Miguel Barragán]] in November 1825. The Spanish forces were expelled by President [[Vicente Guerrero]] after the failed attempt at re-conquering the country.

Since then, San Juan de Ulúa served as a military and political symbol of Mexican resistance to foreign invasions and occupations, several of which took place during the nineteenth century. In 1836 the French invaded and occupied to put pressure on the national government; during the Mexican–American War, in 1847-48 the U.S. occupied the fort and Veracruz, and in 1863 the French briefly occupied the city when installing Maximilian I as emperor. For much of the nineteenth century, the fort served as a [[prison]], especially for [[political prisoner]]s judged to be opposition to the government. Many prominent Mexican politicians spent time here while they were not in power.

Finally in 1914, the last U.S. invasion, attack and occupation of the port of Veracruz took place as part of the [[Tampico Affair]], against the background of the Mexican Revolution which threatened the regional oil industry, in which Americans were heavily invested. The national legislature awarded the port and city of Veracruz the title of ''Heroic'' for the fourth time following this incident.

A portion of San Juan de Ulúa also served several times as the [[presidential palace]], housing presidents such as [[Benito Juárez]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The citadel was also used as a prison, especially during the early 20th-century regime of President [[Porfirio Díaz]]. It is popularly said that in order to prevent prisoners from escaping, [[sharks]] were put into the waters surrounding the island, so that they would kill anyone attempting to escape.

==Modern times==
The fortress complex was ultimately closed when it was no longer needed for sea defense. After several years of decay, renovations were begun on the complex in the late 20th century. Some projects are continuing.

San Juan de Ulúa has been preserved and adapted as a museum. The prisons and the fortresses are all open to the public, with the exception of the former presidential palace, which suffered severe decay and is still undergoing renovations. The complex is a very popular tourist attraction.

San Juan de Ulúa was used to depict the fortress in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], in the climax of the 1984 film ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''.

'''San Juan de Ulúa''', also known as '''Castle of San Juan de Ulúa''', is a large complex of [[fortresses]], prisons and one former palace on an island of the same name in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] overlooking the [[seaport]] of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], Mexico.  [[Juan de Grijalva]]'s 1518 expedition named the island.  On [[Easter Sunday]] 1519, [[Hernan Cortés]] met with Tendile and Pitalpitoque, emissaries from [[Moctezuma II]]'s [[Aztec Empire]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|89}}<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|36,38,89}}

It was built between 1565-1769.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortalezas.org/index.php?ct=fortaleza&id_fortaleza=975|title=FORTALEZA DE SAN JUAN DE ULÚA|website=fortalezas.org|language=Spanish}}</ref> There is a local museum of the fortress, inaugurated in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilam.org/index.php/es/museo?id=2562|title=Museo Local Fuerte de San Juan de Ulúa (SJU) Veracruz, México|website=ILAM Foundation|language=Spanish}}</ref>
==History==
{{See also|Battle of San Juan de Ulúa (1568)}}
The fort was built in the Spanish colonial [[New Spain]] era, with construction starting in 1565. It was expanded several times later.

In 1568, the Spanish Navy succeeded in trapping the English fleet of Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], including his cousin, the young [[Francis Drake]], at San Juan de Ulúa. Although Hawkins and Drake both escaped on their respective ships, many of the English were killed.

[[Richard Hakluyt]]'s book, ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' (1598–1600), claims Drake and Hawkins were on a private venture, peacefully trading with the local Spanish colonists in violation of Spanish law, when the Spanish naval fleet arrived. Despite suspicion of treachery, they allowed the Spaniards to take shelter under truce, between San Juan de Ulúa island, on an otherwise open coastline. The attack by the Spanish was a surprise.

Historians{{who|date=July 2019}} know that Drake and Hawkins likely had raided Spanish settlements elsewhere on that voyage. The trade was in [[African slaves]], who had been captured and taken earlier from [[West Africa]]. On that occasion, it appears the English were in fact trading at Vera Cruz. Historians{{who|date=July 2019}} have speculated that the Spanish colonists traded with them illegally under their threat of raids and attacks.<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/186/000101880/? Sir John Hawkins], The National Names Database, Last accessed July 17, 2008.</ref>

Hawkins and Drake escaped in the ships ''Minion'' and ''Judith'', and their larger ships were taken or destroyed. The attack and subsequent hardships were instrumental in hardening Drake's attitude against Spain and Catholicism. Earlier in his life, he and his family had been forced to live in poverty after they were displaced by a Catholic rebellion in England.

==Post-Spanish era==
{{See also|Bombardment of San Juan de Ulúa}}

After [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's independence]] in 1821, a large number of Spanish troops continued to occupy San Juan de Ulúa as late as 1825. It was the last site in the former New Spain to be held by Spain and was surrendered to General [[Miguel Barragán]] in November 1825. The Spanish forces were expelled by President [[Vicente Guerrero]] after the failed attempt at re-conquering the country.

Since then, San Juan de Ulúa served as a military and political symbol of Mexican resistance to foreign invasions and occupations, several of which took place during the nineteenth century. In 1836 the French invaded and occupied to put pressure on the national government; during the Mexican–American War, in 1847-48 the U.S. occupied the fort and Veracruz, and in 1863 the French briefly occupied the city when installing Maximilian I as emperor. For much of the nineteenth century, the fort served as a [[prison]], especially for [[political prisoner]]s judged to be opposition to the government. Many prominent Mexican politicians spent time here while they were not in power.

Finally in 1914, the last U.S. invasion, attack and occupation of the port of Veracruz took place as part of the [[Tampico Affair]], against the background of the Mexican Revolution which threatened the regional oil industry, in which Americans were heavily invested. The national legislature awarded the port and city of Veracruz the title of ''Heroic'' for the fourth time following this incident.

A portion of San Juan de Ulúa also served several times as the [[presidential palace]], housing presidents such as [[Benito Juárez]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The citadel was also used as a prison, especially during the early 20th-century regime of President [[Porfirio Díaz]]. It is popularly said that in order to prevent prisoners from escaping, [[sharks]] were put into the waters surrounding the island, so that they would kill anyone attempting to escape.

==Modern times==
The fortress complex was ultimately closed when it was no longer needed for sea defense. After several years of decay, renovations were begun on the complex in the late 20th century. Some projects are continuing.

San Juan de Ulúa has been preserved and adapted as a museum. The prisons and the fortresses are all open to the public, with the exception of the former presidential palace, which suffered severe decay and is still undergoing renovations. The complex is a very popular tourist attraction.

San Juan de Ulúa was used to depict the fortress in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], in the climax of the 1984 film ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''.

==Early life, education, and career launch==
Rinehart was born on August 18, 1897 in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]] (which has since merged with [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]). After studying at [[Shady Side Academy]] in Pittsburgh, he graduated from the [[Morristown-Beard School|Morristown School]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey]] (now Morristown-Beard School) in 1915.<ref name=\"MRR Bio\">{{cite book | last=Cohn | first=Jan | title=Improbable Fiction: The Life of Mary Roberts Rinehart | url=https://archive.org/details/improbablefictio00janc | url-access=registration | year=1980}}</ref> Rinehart then studied at [[Harvard University]] before leaving school to serve in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War I]]. During his days at Harvard, Rinehart served on the Editorial Board of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'', a humor magazine.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Following his war service, Rinehart began a career in publishing as a worker in the advertising department at [[George H. Doran]]. After taking on the position of advertising manager, he also served as the company's secretary and as a member of its Board of Trustees.

==Farrar & Rinehart==
In 1929, Rinehart co-founded the publishing house [[Farrar & Rinehart]] with Frederick Rinehart and [[John C. Farrar]]. Rinehart then served as the company's founding president.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=FORM PUBLISHING FIRM.; S.M.

Under the leadership of Rinehart and his colleagues, Farrar & Rinehart achieved notoriety for publishing the works of [[Hervey Allen]], [[Katherine Brush]], and Mary Roberts Rinehart. The company also achieved recognition as one of the first publishers of dollar fiction. After Farrah & Rinehart acquired the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation from [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1931, the company began to  publish college textbooks. In 1943, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' awarded Farrah & Rinehart its first [[Carey–Thomas Award]] for publication of the [[Rivers of America Series]] by literary figures.<ref name=\"nyt\" />

Seven years later, Rinehart & Company merged with [[Henry Holt and Company]] and John C. Winston Co. to form [[Holt, Rinehart, and Winston]] (now the [[Holt McDougal]] Division of [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]). Holt, Rinehart, and Winston named Rinehart and Charles F.

==Military service==
Rinehart enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] as a private. Rising to the rank of [[lieutenant]], he trained troops in the tactics of [[trench warfare]]. Rinehart later requested a transfer to the front lines to see his mother, who then worked as a wartime [[correspondent]] for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref name=\"nyt\" />

==Rescuing motorists on Bronx River Parkway==
On April 1, 1940, Rinehart rescued two individuals from a dangerous driving situation on the [[Bronx River Parkway]]. A defective muffler in the car of Fred Lindsey and his wife had begun leaking [[carbon monoxide]] fumes during their drive from [[Scotia, New York]]. After the fumes knocked Lindsey semi-unconscious and his wife fully unconscious, their car began swerving from one side of the Parkway to the other, and it narrowly missed several head-on collisions. Risking a collision himself by driving alongside, Rinehart shouted to Lindsey to turn off the car ignition and steer the car toward the grass shoulder. The shouting aroused Lindsey from his semi-conscious state, which enabled him to do the actions requested by Rinehart. Running to the now halted car, Rinehart pulled Lindsey and his wife to the safety of fresh air. The [[New York State Police]] later drove them to Ossining Hospital.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Publisher Saves Two from Auto Fumes; Stanley M.

'''HMS ''G8''''' was a [[British G class submarine|G-class]] [[submarine]] of the [[Royal Navy]] that saw service during [[World War I]], costing an estimated £125,000 (£ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|125000|1914|r=-4}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>

==War service==
[[File:Hms g8 submarine.jpg|thumb|left|Submarine ''G8'' (on right) moored alongside 10th Flotilla's [[depot ship]] {{HMS|Lucia}} during World War I]]
Like the rest of her class, ''G8''′s role was to patrol the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[submarine]]s.

''G8'' belonged to the 10th Flotilla during her war service, but also operated out of [[Scapa Flow]] during most of 1917. Her patrol areas were from north of [[Shetland]] to [[Norway]], the [[Skagerrak]], the [[Kattegat]], and the [[Horns Reef]]. She also made one patrol out of [[Harwich]] for the 9th Flotilla in August 1916 before joining the Tees Flotilla.

Her two [[commanding officer]]s were [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]] Charles de Burgh from 30 June 1916 to 30 July 1917 and Lieutenant John F. Tryon from 30 July 1917 until her loss.

Her last patrol began from Tees on 27 December 1917, leaving with the submarine {{HMS|G12||6}} and the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Medea||6}} for the [[Kattegat]]. She was ordered to start her voyage back on 3 January 1918 or possibly 48 hours later, returning to Tees on or around 6 January 1918. She did not return and was never heard from again. She was officially declared missing on 14 January 1918. The cause remains unknown, but she was found with depth rudders pointing towards the surface, which suggests that the men aboard were trying to get to the surface. Therefore it is thought that a technical error led to the sinking. There is no evidence on the wreck of it being hit by torpedoes or mines.<ref>*[http://www.submarine-museum.co.uk/what-we-have/memorial-chapel/submarine-losses?start=7 'Submarine losses 1904 to present day' - Royal Navy Submarine Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714021235/http://www.submarine-museum.co.uk/what-we-have/memorial-chapel/submarine-losses?start=7 |date=14 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/samfund/101-aar-gammel-ubaad-fundet-i-danmark/7732484|title=101 år gammel ubåd fundet i Danmark|last=Fax: 33141000|first=Rådhuspladsen 37 1785 København V. Telefon: 33111313|website=ekstrabladet.dk|language=da|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>

==Discovery and salvage==
The wreck was found in 2019 by the Danish \"Sea War Museum Jutland\" while they were in the process of registering all wrecks in Danish sea territories \"Kattegat\" and \"Skagerak\". It rests on approximately 100 m. of water. There are no plans of recovering the wreck.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/samfund/101-aar-gammel-ubaad-fundet-i-danmark/7732484|title=101 år gammel ubåd fundet i Danmark|last=Fax: 33141000|first=Rådhuspladsen 37 1785 København V.

Salam is a Law graduate from Trivandrum Law College, 
destined to be in the film fraternity. He believed in his flair for film making and all came along his way. He went through strong criticism and pressure from friends and family, 
when he decided to strip off his law suit and pursue with Film making. He was born in to a conservative Muslim Family of Palapetty in the Northern district of Malappuram, Kerala. His Father Bappu Haji and Mother Ayishumma were sceptical towards his decision to become a Film maker. His first attempt in direction was in Drama field, while he was studying for degree. The drama that he directed brought got quiet good appreciation for him to draw inspiration to be a director who can conquer the horizons of glory.

He started his film career in 2001 the film industry as an assistant to the renowned Malayalam director ''[[Lal Jose]]''. Meesha madhavan (2002), Pattalam (2003), Rasikan (2004), Chandu pottu (2005), Aparichithan (2003), Achanurangatha veedu (2006), Classmates (2006),  Arabhi kadha (2007), Mulla (2008), Neelathamara (2009), Kerala Cafe (2009) Elsamma enna aankutty (2010), Spanish masala (2012), Diamond Necklace (2012), Ayaalum njaanum thammil (2012), Kaanchipurathe kalyanam, Aparichithan, Kallanum polisum, Thaavalam, Maharaja Talkies, Vadhyaar, Oridathoru postman and Arjunan Saakshi are some of the major films that he had worked on as an associate.He got many awards for his short film ''Vadhu'' in 2004. Salam Bappu  holds the credit of co-directing   in a Bangladeshi film namely, “Eytho Prem”, which got critical appreciation In Bangladesh.  Apart from this Bangladeshi film he played a crucial role in the making of an Oman film named Aseel. It was the second movie ever made in the history of Oman Film Industry. The film was screened in many international Film Festivals including Dubai Film Festival bagging applause from most of the critics.

His debut as an independent Malayalam director was marked by the release of the movie [[Red Wine (2013 film)|Red Wine]] in 2013 [March 21] that starred [[Mohanlal]], [[Fahadh Faasil]], and [[Asif Ali (actor)|Asif Ali]].

'''Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart''' (24 March 1739 – 10 October 1791), was a German [[poet]], [[organist]], composer, and journalist. He was repeatedly punished for his social-critical writing and spent ten years in severe conditions in jail.

==Life==
Born at [[Obersontheim]] in [[Swabia]], he entered the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1758 as a student of [[theology]]. He led a dissolute life, and after two years' stay was summoned home by his parents. After attempting to earn a livelihood as private tutor and as assistant preacher, his musical talents gained him the appointment of organist in [[Geislingen an der Steige]]. Meeting Schubart in [[Ludwigsburg]] in 1772, [[Charles Burney]] called him \"the first, real great [[harpsichord]] player that I had hitherto met with in Germany ... He is formed on the Bach school; but is an enthusiast, and original in genius. Many of his pieces are printed in Holland; they are full of taste and fire. He played on the [[Clavichord]], with great delicacy and expression; his finger is brilliant, and fancy rich.\"<ref>Charles Burney, (1773) ''The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United Provinces'', London, T. Becket and Co., Robson and G. Robinson.</ref> Schubart was unappreciated in Ludwigsburg, according to Burney: \"The common people think him mad, and the rest overlook him.\" As a consequence of his wild life and [[blasphemy]], found expressed in a parody of the [[litany]], he was later expelled from the country.<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Schubart, Christian Friedrich Daniel}}</ref>

He then visited in turn [[Heilbronn]], [[Mannheim]], Munich and [[Augsburg]]. In Augsburg, he made a considerable stay, began his ''{{Lang|de|Deutsche Chronik}}'' (''German Chronicle'', 1774–1778) and eked out a subsistence by reciting from the latest works of prominent poets.

In 1775, Schubart witnessed a piano playing competition in Munich between [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Franz Ignaz von Beecke]]. He wrote in his Teutsche Chronik (27 April 1775) that in his opinion, von Beecke played far better than Mozart: \"In Munich... I heard two of the greatest clavier players, Mr Mozart and Captain von Beecke. Mozart’s playing had great weight, and he read at sight everything that we put before him. But no more than that; Beecke surpasses him by a long way. Winged agility, grace and melting sweetness.\" <ref>John Irving: Mozart Piano Sonatas: Contexts, Sources, Style. Cambridge University Press 1997, {{ISBN|0521 496314}}, page 56</ref>

Owing to a bitter attack upon the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], he was expelled from Augsburg and fled to [[Ulm]], where he was arrested in 1777{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and confined in the fortress of [[Hohenasperg]].<ref name=EB1911 />

Here he met with lenient treatment,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and he spent the time by a study of mystical works and in composing poetry. His ''{{Lang|de|Sämtliche Gedichte}}'' (''Complete Poems'') appeared in two volumes at Stuttgart in 1785/1786 (new edition by Gustav Hauff, Leipzig, 1884, in [[Reclam]]s Universal-Bibliothek); in this collection most of the pieces are characterized by the \"[[Sturm und Drang]]\" period.<ref name=EB1911 /> One of the poems he wrote there and published in the ''Schwäbischer [[Musenalmanach]]'' in 1783 was \"[[Die Forelle]]\", set to music by [[Franz Schubert]] in 1817.

He was set free in 1787 by [[Frederick the Great]], king of Prussia, and expressed his gratitude in \"{{Lang|de|Hymnus auf Friedrich den Grossen}}\" (\"Hymn to Frederick the Great\"). Schubart was now appointed musical director and manager of the theatre at Stuttgart, where he continued his ''{{Lang|de|Deutsche Chronik}}'' and began his autobiography, ''{{Lang|de|Schubarts Leben und Gesinnungen}}'' (\"Schubart's Life and Thoughts\", 2 vols, 1791–1793), but he died before its completion in Stuttgart. His ''{{Lang|de|Gesammelte Schriften und Schicksale}}'' (''Collected Writings and Fates'') appeared in 8 volumes (Stuttgart, 1839–1840).<ref name=EB1911 />

Among Schubart's musical works are the [[operetta]] ''{{Lang|de|Die glücklichen Reisenden}}'', the [[melodrama]] ''{{Lang|de|Evas Klage bei des Messias Tod}}'', three books of ''{{Lang|de|Musikalische Rhapsodien}}'' (1786), a \"Salve Regina\", and various songs and keyboard pieces.

The '''Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Matriz do Sagrado Coração de Jesus}}) is an 18-century [[Roman Catholic]] church in [[Laranjeiras, Sergipe|Laranjeiras]], [[Sergipe]], [[Brazil]]. It was the second church built in Laranjeiras, following the [[Church of Our Lady of the Conception of Comandaroba]], which was built by the [[Jesuits]] in the early 18th century. The church was listed as a historic structure by [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] (IPHAN) in 1941. The church is dedicated to the [[Sacred Heart|Sacred Heart of Jesus]] and is constructed in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]]. The Parish Church belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Aracaju]].<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"iphan\"/><ref name=\"pa\"/>

==History==
[[File:Outras agendas em Sergipe (27719738197).jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of façade]]

Construction of Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus began at the end of the 18th century. Residents of Laranjeiras, then a district of [[Nossa Senhora do Socorro]] with a small port on the river, petitioned [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria]] for the construction of a church in 1790. With the completion of the church, Laranjeiras had two churches: the Parish Church and the [[Church of Our Lady of the Conception of Comandaroba|Church of Our Lady of the Conception]], which belonged to the Comandaroba Plantation. The church was unable to accommodate the population of Laranjeiras, which grew rapidly in the 18th century, and the building was enlarged in 1905.<ref name=\"f\"/><ref name=\"hpip\"/>

==Location==

The Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is located on a high point above a bend in the [[Cotinguiba River]]. The church faces the river but, unusually, does not open to Praça da Matriz. The south façade of the church, which faces the public square, has numerous small portals and windows.<ref name=\"hpip\"/>

==Structure==

The building has a structure consisting of mixed masonry of stone and brick. The church has two bell towers with a monumental pediment at center. The pediment has volutes and is topped by a cross. There are three windows at the choir level and a low arch with glazed leaves and flags. The bell towers have windows similar to those at the choir level. The windows of the bell gable are arched; the gables have domes decorated with tiles and topped by pinnacles.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"pa\"/>

===Interior===

The interior has a rectangular plan with a single [[nave]], chancel, and two sacristies. A chapel dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament is located left of the altar. It has a separate door of glass and wood. The altar is simple with an altarpiece with a painting of the Holy Family. This painting, along with those of the walls of the chancel, are attributed to [[José Teófilo de Jesus]].<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"pa\"/>

==Protected status==

The Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1941. It was listed in the Book of Historical Works as no. 294, and was a federally protected site in Laranjeiras.<ref name=\"iphan\"/>

With the completion of the church, Laranjeiras had two churches: the Parish Church and the [[Church of Our Lady of the Conception of Comandaroba|Church of Our Lady of the Conception]], which belonged to the Comandaroba Plantation. The church was unable to accommodate the population of Laranjeiras, which grew rapidly in the 18th century, and the building was enlarged in 1905.<ref name=\"f\"/><ref name=\"hpip\"/>

==Location==

The Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is located on a high point above a bend in the [[Cotinguiba River]]. The church faces the river, but unusually, does not open to Praça da Matriz. The south façade of the church, which faces the public square, has numerous small portals and windows.<ref name=\"hpip\"/>

==Structure==

The building has a structure consisting of mixed masonry of stone and brick. The church has two bell towers with a monumental pediment at center. The pediment has volutes and is topped by a cross. There are three windows at the choir level and a low arch with glazed leaves and flags. The bell towers have windows similar to those at the choir level. The windows of the bell gable are arched; the gables have domes decorated with tiles and topped by pinnacles.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"pa\"/>

===Interior===

The interior has a rectangular plan with a single [[nave]], chancel, and two sacristies. A chapel dedicated to the Blessed Sacrement is located left of the altar. It has a separate door of glass and wood. The altar is simple with an altarpiece with a painting of the Holy Family. This painting, along with those of the walls of the chancel, are attributed to [[José Teófilo de Jesus]].<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"pa\"/>

==Protected status==

The Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1941. It was listed in the Book of Historical Works as no. 294, and was the federally protected site in Laranjeiras.<ref name=\"iphan\"/>

'''''Bates Motel''''' is a 1987 American [[Television film|made-for-television]] [[supernatural horror film]] and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the [[Psycho (franchise)|''Psycho'' film series]] produced by [[Ken Topolsky]], written and directed by [[Richard Rothstein (screenwriter)|Richard Rothstein]], and starring [[Bud Cort]], [[Lori Petty]], [[Moses Gunn]], [[Gregg Henry]], [[Jason Bateman]], and [[Kerrie Keane]]. The film premiered as part of ''[[The NBC Monday Movie|NBC Monday Night at the Movies]]'' on July 5, 1987.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Bates Motel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/123885/Bates-Motel/overview}}</ref>

The film is about Alex West, a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] after killing his [[child abuse|abusive]] stepfather. There he befriends [[Norman Bates]] and ends up inheriting the Bates Motel. It was originally produced as a [[television pilot|pilot]] for a proposed TV series set in the Bates Motel, but it was not picked up by the network.

==Plot==
Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) at the state lunatic asylum nearly twenty years for killing his abusive stepfather, and they became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.

Meanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest.

Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"

[[File:Shroudofturin.jpg|thumb|upright|Full-length image of the [[Shroud of Turin]].]]
The '''Shroud of Turin Research Project''' (often abbreviated as '''STURP''') refers to a team of scientists which performed a set of experiments and analyses on the [[Shroud of Turin]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s. STURP issued its final report in 1981.

Joe Nickell of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] has pointed out that \"STURP’s leaders served on the executive council of the Holy Shroud Guild, which is devoted to the “cause” of the reputed relic.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Fake Turin Shroud Deceives National Geographic Author|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/fake_turin_shroud_deceives_national_geographic_author|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref>

The origins of the group go back to the experiments of physicist [[John P. Jackson]], thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern in 1976. Using the ideas invented in aerospace science for building three dimensional models from images of Mars, Eric Jumper built initial devices to test the photographs of the Shroud of Turin. These were the first experiments relating to the shroud performed by scientists.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 79</ref>

In March 1977, Jackson, Jumper and Mottern invited a few other scientists to join them to form a team for the analysis of the Shroud. The first meeting took place in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. The group had no official sponsorship and the scientists funded their own activities. They also managed to arrange gifts and loans of technical equipment whose value was estimated at over $2&nbsp;million.

Nuclear physicist Tom D'Muhala headed STURP. Apart from Jackson, Jumper, and Motten the team included thermal chemist [[Raymond N. Rogers]], and Ron London, and Roger Morris, all from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. Other team members included Don Lynn of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, biophysicist John Heller, photographers Vern Miller and Barrie Schwortz, optical physicist Sam Pellicori, and electric power experts John D. German and Rudy Dichtl, as well as forensic pathologist Robert Bucklin. STURP included no experts on medieval art, archaeology, or textiles.

To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the shroud in [[Turin]], it was displayed to the public in Turin from 27 August to 8 October 1978, with about 3 million visitors attending the exposition under bullet-proof glass. For the next 5 days after the exposition the STURP team analyzed the shroud around the clock at the royal palace adjoining Turin Cathedral, some scientists sleeping while others worked. A team of European scientists headed by Luigi Gonella supervised the activities.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 80-83</ref> The team gathered sticky tape samples of material from several points on the surface of the shroud.<ref>''The orphaned manuscript: a gathering of publications on the Shroud of Turin'' by Alan D. Adler 2002 {{ISBN|88-7402-003-1}} pages 93–94</ref>

STURP team members continued their research after access to the shroud and published many of theirs results in scientific journals and proceedings.<ref>http://www.shroud.com/78papers.htm</ref><ref>''A Chemist's Perspective On The Shroud of Turin'' by Raymond N. Rogers, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-615-23928-6}}</ref> In 1981, in its final report, STURP wrote:<ref>http://www.shroud.com/78conclu.htm</ref>
<blockquote>
\"We can conclude for now that the Shroud image is that of a real human form of a scourged, crucified man. It is not the product of an artist. The blood stains are composed of hemoglobin and also give a positive test for serum albumin. The image is an ongoing mystery and until further chemical studies are made, perhaps by this group of scientists, or perhaps by some scientists in the future, the problem remains unsolved.\"

German and Rudy Dichtl, as well as forensic pathologist Robert Bucklin. STURP included no experts on medieval art, archaeology, or textiles.

To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the shroud in [[Turin]], it was displayed to the public in Turin from 27 August to 8 October 1978, with about 3 million visitors attending the exposition under bullet-proof glass. For the next 5 days after the exposition the STURP team analyzed the shroud around the clock at the royal palace adjoining Turin Cathedral, some scientists sleeping while others worked. A team of European scientists headed by Luigi Gonella supervised the activities.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 80-83</ref> The team gathered sticky tape samples of material from several points on the surface of the shroud.<ref>''The orphaned manuscript: a gathering of publications on the Shroud of Turin'' by Alan D. Adler 2002 {{ISBN|88-7402-003-1}} pages 93–94</ref>

STURP team members continued their research after access to the shroud and published many of theirs results in scientific journals and proceedings.<ref>http://www.shroud.com/78papers.htm</ref><ref>''A Chemist's Perspective On The Shroud of Turin'' by Raymond N. Rogers, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-615-23928-6}}</ref> In 1981, in its final report, STURP wrote:<ref>http://www.shroud.com/78conclu.htm</ref>
<blockquote>
\"We can conclude for now that the Shroud image is that of a real human form of a scourged, crucified man. It is not the product of an artist. The blood stains are composed of hemoglobin and also give a positive test for serum albumin. The image is an ongoing mystery and until further chemical studies are made, perhaps by this group of scientists, or perhaps by some scientists in the future, the problem remains unsolved.\"

→‎After 1874:East Europeans,safe,Peipsi-Pihkva,"The '''Holy Corner''' is the English name for the '''Oud begijnhof''' or '''Old Saint Elisabeth''' [[beguinage]] in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. It is one of three beguinages in the city - the other two are the [[Groot Begijnhof Sint-Amandsberg|new Saint Elisabeth beguinage]] in the suburb of Sint-Amandsberg and [[Our-Lady Ter Hooyen|Our Lady Ter Hooyen]] in the Lange Violettenstraat. Both Saint Elisabeth beguinages were named after [[Elisabeth of Hungary]], also known as Saint Elisabeth of Thuringia.

== Location ==

[[File:Gent Begijnhof 001.JPG|thumb|right|220px|\"Groothuis\" and \"Infirmerie\" of the former ''Sint-Elisabethbegijnhof'', now the [[Primary education|basisschool]] ''De Muze'']]
Holy Corner is a protected [[Cityscape|urban heritage site]]. It is now a largely urban neighbourhood in the northeast of Ghent, close to the Rabot (originally a Spanish fortification, now a Ghent neighbourhood as well), between the Burgstraat and the Begijnhoflaan.

Holy Corner can easily be reached by general transport. Since its newest addition is the [[Russian Orthodox church]], it is notable that tram 4, the quickest connection from Ghent railway station, has as its final destination the Ghent neighbourhood of [[Moscou (Ghent)|Moscou]].

== History ==

In the 13th century, a number of devout, unmarried and lay women, who had been helping the [[Cistercian]] sisters with their medical work, were given their own premises by Countess [[Jeanne of Flanders|Joanna of Constantinople]], daughter to [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin IX of Flanders]], who also helped with the construction of the Hospital in [[Lille]] named after her ([[L'hospice de la Comtesse Jeanne]], built in 1236).

The beguinage constructed in 1234, and soon named after Saint-Elisabeth who was canonized in 1236, grew into a little town of its own, with a church, a \"Grootjuffer\" house, an infirmary (with its own chapel), 18 convents, a big laundry meadow (used by the beguines who took in laundry of rich Ghent inhabitants) and a large orchard.

During the [[French Revolution]], the city of Ghent acquired the property rights to the beguinage (on the legal provision of having to subsidize and maintain it). This actually happened to all church property in Belgium, but as the beguinage was not solely an area used for religious activities, the city of Ghent repeatedly tried to incorporate it in new development, as Ghent was experiencing the effects of the [[Industrial revolution]] and needed cheap housing for its increasing working force.

After a number of beguines voluntarily settled in a new beguinage at Our Lady Ter Hoyen, the conflict between the Saint Elisabeth beguinage and the town administration dominated by the [[Liberalism in Belgium|liberal party]] became intense. Thanks to financial sponsoring by the [[Duke of Arenberg]] (also known as the Prinz von Recklinghausen) in two years' time (1872–1874) a new beguinage was built at the then still independent village of Sint-Amandsberg. On September 29, 1874, more than 600 beguines left Ghent for Sint-Amandsberg, in carriages provided by the Ghent Roman Catholic aristocracy.

== After 1874 ==
[[Image:Pravoslavye Gent.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Orthodox Church of Saint-Andrew in the Van Akenstraat]]
After the departure of the beguines, the beguinage became a social housing area. There was less investment in infrastructure and accommodation and the area became a prime example of [[urban decay]].

However, in the 20th century, some voices started to be heard that clamoured for the preservation of this unique urban site. Thanks to this, both private enterprise and the town of Ghent started to invest more into local housing, and from 1984 on the neighbourhood even began to feel the effects of [[gentrification]]. As often, artists were the first to come here: [[Constant Permeke]], [[Albert Servaes]] and [[Frits Van den Berghe]] all once lived at Van Akenstraat, 7 (but not simultaneously).

In English, the neighbourhood is commonly known as \"Holy Corner\". The name was originally coined by the late local Church of England vicar, Cameron Walker, who was of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, and who with this name may have hinted at [[Holy Corner]] in [[Edinburgh]]. At the time, the neighbourhood was the location of four churches of four different nominations: the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Saint Elisabeth Church, which was originally the beguinage church, the [[Orthodox Church]] of [[Saint Andrew]], the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] Rabot Church and the Saint John's [[Anglican Church]]. The four churches share an [[Ecumenical]] Whitsun walk. Though the area has been largely gentrified, on Sunday mornings practically every European and African language can be heard in its streets, since many Russians, Greeks, Ukrainians, Romanians, Serbs, Ethiopians, ... come to worship at the Orthodox Church, the Anglican church attracts Africans (and some other Christian foreigners who do not understand Dutch, the vernacular of the other two churches in the neighbourhood) and the Protestant church has Dutch, Africans and some [[East Europeans]] among its worshippers. However, in the summer of 2008, the Anglican church moved to a chapel in the neighbouring Theresianenstraat, just outside the Holy Corner, to return in January 2016. At the end of 2015, to offset a big drop in attendance at Roman Catholic churches in Ghent, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ghent had disaffected a number of Roman Catholic church buildings. The Saint Elisabeth church building was then taken over by the Anglican community, which had in the meantime outgrown its location in the Theresianenstraat. The first fully Anglican church service of the \"Saint Elisabeth’s Anglican Church (the Parish of St. John’s)\" took place on Sunday, January 24th 2016 (after an ecumenical one on the 17th).
