Additionally, identifiers cannot remain static otherwise malicious third parties can observe identifiers over time across a wide area and identify patterns of movement for individual clients on the network.\n\n=== Ephemeral ID ===\nThe majority of protocols make use of Ephemeral IDs, which are strings used to identify clients for a short period of time. While not unique for every encounter, ephemeral IDs make it extremely difficult to track individuals over a period of time longer than the lifetime of the ID. When used in a centralized model, such as BlueTrace, Ephemeral IDs are typically the static user identifier and other data encrypted by a key known only to the server. In a decentralized model they are usually pseudo-randomly generated using a seed known only to the client.\n\n=== Unique ID ===\nUnique ID protocols generate a new identifier for every encounter. Currently the only protocol using this method is the TCN Protocol. The largest issue with using unique IDs for every encounter is that reports can quickly become extremely large, which, when used in combination with a decentralized model, could lead to extremely large download sizes for clients retrieving reports. TCN overcame this obstacle by instead successively and deterministically generating each new unique ID from the previous. Then, when a report needed to be upload, only the first entry within the report time period was submitted and clients would calculate the rest of the entries locally.\n\n== List of protocols ==\n{|

currently unfolding [[2019\u201320_coronavirus_pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic]], reactions to digital contact tracing applications worldwide have been drastic and often polarized, especially in European countries.\nDespite holding the promise to drastically reduce contagion and allow for a relaxation of social distancing measures, digital contact tracing applications have been criticized by academia and publics alike. The two main issues brought up concern the technical efficacy of such systems and their ethical implications, in particular regarding privacy, freedoms and democracy. \n\n=== Technical feasibility ===\n\nThe technical feasibility and necessity of digital contact tracing is currently subject of debate, with its major proponents <ref>{{cite news |last1=Bounie, Maxwell, Vamparys |first1=David, Winston, Xavier |title=Les paradoxes de l\u2019application StopCovid |accessdate=26 April 2020 |issue=23420 |publisher=Le Monde |date=26 April 2020}}</ref> claiming it to be indispensable to stop the spread of pandemics, as COVID-19, and its opponents raising points on its technical functioning and adoption rate by citizens.

Around the world, governments and publics have taken different positions on this issue. \n\n==== Privacy ====\n\nOn privacy, the main problem about digital contact tracing regards type of information which can be collected from each person and the way related data is treated by companies and institutions. The type of data which is collected, and the approach being used (centralized or decentralized) determine the severity of the issue. Moreover, critics point out that claims of anonymity and protection of personal data, even if made by institutions, cannot be verified and that individual\u2019s user profiles can be traced back in several cases. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Casilli, Dehaye, Soufron |first1=Antonio, Paul-Olivier, Baptiste |title=StopCovid est un projet d\u00e9sastreux pilot\u00e9 par des apprentis sorciers |accessdate=27 April 2020 |agency=Le Monde |issue=23420 |publisher=Le Monde |date=26 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n==== Surveillance ====\n\nClosely related to privacy, comes the issue of surveillance: too much personal data in centralized governmental database could set a dangerous precedent on the way governments are capable of \u201cspying\u201d on individual behaviour.

Additionally, identifiers cannot remain static otherwise malicious third parties can observe identifiers over time across a wide area and identify patterns of movement for individual clients on the network.\n\n=== Ephemeral ID ===\nThe majority of protocols make use of Ephemeral IDs, which are strings used to identify clients for a short period of time. While not unique for every encounter, ephemeral IDs make it extremely difficult to track individuals over a period of time longer than the lifetime of the ID. When used in a centralized model, such as BlueTrace, Ephemeral IDs are typically the static user identifier and other data encrypted by a key known only to the server. In a decentralized model they are usually pseudo-randomly generated using a seed known only to the client.\n\n=== Unique ID ===\nUnique ID protocols generate a new identifier for every encounter. Currently the only protocol using this method is the TCN Protocol. The largest issue with using unique IDs for every encounter is that reports can quickly become extremely large, which, when used in combination with a decentralized model, could lead to extremely large download sizes for clients retrieving reports. TCN overcame this obstacle by instead successively and deterministically generating each new unique ID from the previous. Then, when a report needed to be upload, only the first entry within the report time period was submitted and clients would calculate the rest of the entries locally.\n\n== List of protocols ==\n{|

currently unfolding [[2019\u201320_coronavirus_pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic]], reactions to digital contact tracing applications worldwide have been drastic and often polarized, especially in European countries.\nDespite holing the promise to drastically reduce contagion and allow for a relaxation of social distancing measures, digital contact tracing applications have been criticized by academia and publics alike. The two main issues brought up concern the technical efficacy of such systems and their ethical implications, in particular regarding privacy, freedoms and democracy. \n\n=== Technical feasibility ===\n\nThe technical feasibility and necessity of digital contact tracing is currently subject of debate, with its major proponents <ref>{{cite news |last1=Bounie, Maxwell, Vamparys |first1=David, Winston, Xavier |title=Les paradoxes de l\u2019application StopCovid |accessdate=26 April 2020 |issue=23420 |publisher=Le Monde |date=26 April 2020}}</ref> claiming it to be indispensable to stop the spread of pandemics, as COVID-19, and its opponents raising points on its technical functioning and adoption rate by citizens. First of all, the conflict between the opt-in voluntary usage by citizens in many countries and the necessity of an almost universal adoption rate is unresolved. Indeed, according to a study published in ''Science''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ferretti |first1=Luca |last2=Wymant |first2=Chris |last3=Kendall |first3=Michelle |last4=Zhao |first4=Lele |last5=Nurtay |first5=Anel |last6=Abeler-D\u00f6rner |first6=Lucie |last7=Parker |first7=Michael |last8=Bonsall |first8=David |last9=Fraser |first9=Christophe |title=Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing |journal=Science |date=31 March 2020 |volume=6936 |doi=10.1126/science.abb6936 |url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/30/science.abb6936.abstract |accessdate=27 April 2020}}</ref>, an adoption rate between of around 60% of the total population is needed for digital contact tracing applications to be effective. In countries where this was made voluntary, like Singapore, the adoption rate remained below 20%.  <ref>{{cite web |last1=Kellion |first1=Leo |title=Coronavirus: NHS contact tracing app to target 80% of smartphone users |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52294896 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |last1=Bounie, Maxwell, Vamparys |first1=David, Winston, Xavier |title=Les paradoxes de l\u2019application StopCovid |accessdate=26 April 2020 |issue=23420 |publisher=Le Monde |date=26 April 2020}}</ref>. Second, the efficacy of using Bluetooth technology to determine proximity is subject to scrutiny, with critics pointing out that false positives could be reported due to the inaccuracy of the technology. Instances of this are interference by physical objects (e.g. two people in two adjacent rooms) and connections being made even at 10-20 meters distances<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kelion |first1=Leo |title=Coronavirus: Why are there doubts over contact-tracing apps? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52353720 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 April 2020}}</ref>. \n\n=== Ethical issues ===  \n\nOther than having doubts about the technical effectiveness of smartphone-based contact tracing systems, publics and academia are confronted with ethical issues about the use of smartphone data by central governments to track and direct citizen behaviour <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Calvo|first1=Rafael |last2=Deterding |first2=Sebastian |last3= Ryan |first3=Richard |title=Health surveillance during covid-19 pandemic |journal=Bmj |date=April 2020 |doi=10.1136/bmj.m1373 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1373.abstract |accessdate=27 April 2020}}</ref>. The most pressing questions pertain privacy and surveillance, liberty, and ownership. Around the world, governments and publics have taken different positions on this issue. \n\n==== Privacy ====\n\nOn privacy, the main problem about digital contact tracing regards type of information which can be collected from each person and the way related data is treated by companies and institutions. The type of data which is collected, and the approach being used (centralized or decentralized) determine the severity of the issue. Moreover, critics point out that claims of anonymity and protection of personal data, even if made by institutions, cannot be verified and that individual\u2019s user profiles can be traced back in several cases <ref>{{cite news |last1=Casilli, Dehaye, Soufron |first1=Antonio, Paul-Olivier, Baptiste |title=StopCovid est un projet d\u00e9sastreux pilot\u00e9 par des apprentis sorciers |accessdate=27 April 2020 |agency=Le Monde |issue=23420 |publisher=Le Monde |date=26 April 2020}}</ref>. \n\n==== Surveillance ====\n\nClosely related to privacy, comes the issue of surveillance: too much personal data in centralized governmental database could set a dangerous precedent on the way governments are capable of \u201cspying\u201d on individual behaviour. The possibility that a wide-ranging adoption of digital contact tracing could set a dangerous precedent for surveillance and control has been abundantly treated by media and academia alike <ref>{{cite news |last1=Casilli, Dehaye, Soufron |first1=Antonio, Paul-Olivier, Baptiste |title=StopCovid est un projet d\u00e9sastreux pilot\u00e9 par des apprentis sorciers |accessdate=27 April 2020 |agency=Le Monde |issue=23420 |publisher=Le Monde |date=26 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Calvo, Deterding, Ryan |first1=Rafael, Sebastian, Richard |title=Health surveillance during covid-19 pandemic |journal=Bmj |date=April 2020 |doi=10.1136/bmj.m1373 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1373.abstract |accessdate=27 April 2020}}</ref> . In short, the main concern here relates to the tendency of temporary measures, justified by an emergency situation, to be normalized and extended indefinitely in a society.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[COVID-19 apps]]\n\n== References ==\n\n[[Category:Software associated with the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols| ]]\n[[Category:Bluetooth software]]\n[[Category:Mass surveillance]]\n", "name_user": "F-Velocyclette", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIssues and controversies", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_contact_tracing"}
