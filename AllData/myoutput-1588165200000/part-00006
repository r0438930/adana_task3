It was serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from April 2005 to June 2012 and the chapters collected into 30 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The series follows Nozomu Itoshiki, a teacher who takes all aspects of life, word, and culture in the most negative light possible. It [[Satire|satirizes]] politics, media, and Japanese society. In 2007, the manga received the 31st [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the [[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]] category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kodansha.co.jp/award/archive/manga.html|title=Kodansha Manga Awards Page|accessdate=2007-07-17|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qxJiVakM?url=http://www.kodansha.co.jp/award/archive/manga.html|archivedate=2010-07-03}}</ref> The manga has been adapted into three [[anime]] television series and two sets of [[original video animation|OVA]]s animated by [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] between 2007 and 2010.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n{{see also|List of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei characters}}\n''Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei'' revolves around a very pessimistic high school teacher named Nozomu Itoshiki who, at the very beginning of the series, tries to hang himself on a [[sakura]] tree.  He is saved by an extremely optimistic student known only as Kafuka Fuura (though in her effort to save his life, she almost kills him). She explains to him that it is simply unimaginable that he would hang himself on such a nice day, especially in front of such beautiful trees.  She decides to nickname Nozomu {{nihongo|\"Pink Supervisor\"|\u6843\u8272\u4fc2\u9577|Momoiro Kakarich\u014d}}, and offers to pay him fifty [[Japanese yen|yen]] to call him by that nickname. After having enough of the strange Kafuka, Nozomu bolts to the school and starts his [[homeroom]] class, but the attempt to escape was in vain as he finds that she is one of his students. Not only that, but Kafuka is just the tip of the iceberg, due to each and every student in his class representing a new personality quirk or bizarre obsession, posing challenges that he must overcome in spite of himself.\n\nEach chapter or episode of the series revolves around a particular aspect of life, Japanese culture, or a common phrase in the Japanese language. Typically, this involves the subject being taken either to its most logical extreme (a discussion of ''[[amakudari]]'', the practice of \"descending\" from the public to the private sector, results in Nozomu \"descending\" until he reaches his previous life), or taken literally (in Nozomu's family, ''[[omiai]]'', normally a meeting between a potential match in an arranged marriage, is instead a marriage made official by eye-contact). On other occasions, Nozomu challenges his students to think about the ''negative'' aspects of something usually considered positive. These in-depth, off-kilter analyses (along with the reactions of the students according to their own personality quirks) are usually brought to a head with a punchline based on the overall premise, or more rarely, a [[Non sequitur (humor)|non-sequitur gag]] or piece of [[fan service]].\n\nWhile ostensibly set in the present day relative to its original serialization, the manga uses a variety of aesthetic tropes that evoke the [[Taish\u014d period]], the relatively liberal period in Japan before the rise of militarism in the [[Sh\u014dwa period]]. Many aesthetic aspects are meant to evoke Taish\u014d liberalism, Taish\u014d Romanticism (see [[Japanese literature]]) and Taish\u014d arts (see [[Hanshinkan Modernism]]). This is exemplified by Nozomu and Matoi consistently wearing a [[kimono]] and [[hakama]] (an obsolete style of Japanese school uniforms in the late 1800s), but is also evident in stylistic choices such as the [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] appearance of architecture, vehicles, and technology indicative of the Taish\u014d period. However, the fashion of women typically follows the [[modern girl]] trend, which is a break from the [[Meiji period]] and signifies the style of the Taish\u014d period.\n\nChapter titles are oblique references to literature, modified to suit the needs of the chapter. The chapter title pages are drawn to resemble [[karuta]] cards, with an illustration in a silhouetted ''kiri-e'' style. The anime carries this further through a washed-out, grainy visual style that mimics film, and frequent use of [[katakana]] (rather than [[hiragana]]) as [[okurigana]]. The anime also regularly refers to the date as though [[Emperor Hirohito]] were still alive, such that [[Heisei]] 20 (the twentieth year of [[Emperor Akihito]]'s reign, or 2008 by the [[Gregorian calendar]]) becomes \"Sh\u014dwa 83\".\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{see also|List of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei chapters}}\n''Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[K\u014dji Kumeta]].

It was serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from April 2005 to June 2012 and the chapters collected into 30 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The series follows Nozomu Itoshiki, a teacher who takes all aspects of life, word, and culture in the most negative light possible. It [[Satire|satirizes]] politics, media, and Japanese society. In 2007, the manga received the 31st [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the [[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]] category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kodansha.co.jp/award/archive/manga.html|title=Kodansha Manga Awards Page|accessdate=2007-07-17|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qxJiVakM?url=http://www.kodansha.co.jp/award/archive/manga.html|archivedate=2010-07-03}}</ref> The manga has been adapted into three [[anime]] television series and two sets of [[original video animation|OVA]]s animated by [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] between 2007 and 2010.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n{{see also|List of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei characters}}\n''Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei'' revolves around a very pessimistic high school teacher named Nozomu Itoshiki who, at the very beginning of the series, tries to hang himself on a [[sakura]] tree.  He is saved by an extremely optimistic student known only as Kafuka Fuura (though in her effort to save his life, she almost kills him). She explains to him that it is simply unimaginable that he would hang himself on such a nice day, especially in front of such beautiful trees.  She decides to nickname Nozomu {{nihongo|\"Pink Supervisor\"|\u6843\u8272\u4fc2\u9577|Momoiro Kakarich\u014d}}, and offers to pay him fifty [[Japanese yen|yen]] to call him by that nickname. After having enough of the strange Kafuka, Nozomu bolts to the school and starts his [[homeroom]] class, but the attempt to escape was in vain as he finds that she is one of his students. Not only that, but Kafuka is just the tip of the iceberg, due to each and every student in his class representing a new personality quirk or bizarre obsession, posing challenges that he must overcome in spite of himself.\n\nEach chapter or episode of the series revolves around a particular aspect of life, Japanese culture, or a common phrase in the Japanese language. Typically, this involves the subject being taken either to its most logical extreme (a discussion of ''[[amakudari]]'', the practice of \"descending\" from the public to the private sector, results in Nozomu \"descending\" until he reaches his previous life), or taken literally (in Nozomu's family, ''[[omiai]]'', normally a meeting between a potential match in an arranged marriage, is instead a marriage made official by eye-contact). On other occasions, Nozomu challenges his students to think about the ''negative'' aspects of something usually considered positive. These in-depth, off-kilter analyses (along with the reactions of the students according to their own personality quirks) are usually brought to a head with a punchline based on the overall premise, or more rarely, a [[Non sequitur (humor)|non-sequitur gag]] or piece of [[fan service]].\n\nWhile ostensibly set in the present day relative to its original serialization, the manga uses a variety of aesthetic tropes that evoke the [[Taish\u014d period]], the relatively liberal period in Japan before the rise of militarism in the [[Sh\u014dwa period]]. Many aesthetic aspects are meant to evoke Taish\u014d liberalism, Taish\u014d Romanticism (see [[Japanese literature]]) and Taish\u014d arts (see [[Hanshinkan Modernism]]). This is exemplified by Nozomu and Matoi consistently wearing a [[kimono]] and [[hakama]] (an obsolete style of Japanese school uniforms in the late 1800s), but is also evident in stylistic choices such as the [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] appearance of architecture, vehicles, and technology indicative of the Taish\u014d period. However, the fashion of women typically follows the [[modern girl]] trend, which is a break from the [[Meiji period]] and signifies the style of the Taish\u014d period.\n\nChapter titles are oblique references to literature, modified to suit the needs of the chapter. The chapter title pages are drawn to resemble [[karuta]] cards, with an illustration in a silhouetted ''kiri-e'' style. The anime carries this further through a washed-out, grainy visual style that mimics film, and frequent use of [[katakana]] (rather than [[hiragana]]) as [[okurigana]]. The anime also regularly refers to the date as though [[Emperor Hirohito]] were still alive, such that [[Heisei]] 20 (the twentieth year of [[Emperor Akihito]]'s reign, or 2008 by the [[Gregorian calendar]]) becomes \"Sh\u014dwa 83\".\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{see also|List of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei chapters}}\n''Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[K\u014dji Kumeta]].
