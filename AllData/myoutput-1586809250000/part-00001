A [[Planned community|new town]], situated on the border with [[Hertfordshire]] and London, Harlow occupies a large area of land on the south bank of the upper [[River Stort|Stort Valley]], which has been made navigable through other towns and features a canal section near its [[watermill]]. [[Old Harlow]] is a village-size suburb founded by the early medieval age and most of its [[high street]] buildings are early Victorian and residential, mostly protected by one of the Conservation Areas in the district. In Old Harlow is a field named '''Harlowbury''', a de-settled monastic area which has the remains of a chapel, a [[scheduled ancient monument]].\n\nThe [[M11 motorway]] passes through the east of the district, entirely to the east of the town. Harlow has its own commercial and leisure economy. It is also an outer part of the [[London commuter belt]] and employment centre of the M11 corridor which includes [[Cambridge]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] to the north. At the time of the 2011 Census, Harlow's population was recorded at 81,944 and its district had the third-highest proportion of [[social housing]] in England, 26.9%,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} a legacy of the 1947 commitment to re-house [[The Blitz|blitzed]] London families after World War II and provide a percentage of homes for other needy families who cannot afford [[renting|market rent]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThere is some dispute as to where the [[placename]] Harlow derives from. One theory is that it derives from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words 'here' and 'hlaw', meaning \"army hill\", probably to be identified with Mulberry Hill, which was used as the [[wikt:moot|moot]] or meeting place for the district.\n\nThe other theory is that it derives from the words 'here' and 'hearg', meaning \"temple hill/mound\", probably to be identified with an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] burial mound, later a [[Roman Britain|Roman temple]] site on River Way.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe earliest deposits are of a Mesolithic (circa 10,000 BC) hunting camp excavated by Davey in Northbrooks in the 1970s (Unpublished) closely followed by the large and unexcavated deposits of Neolithic flint beside Gilden Way. These deposits are mostly known because of the large numbers of surface-bound, worked flint. Substantial amounts of worked flint suggest an organised working of flint in the area. Large amounts of debitage litter the area and tools found include axeheads, hammers, blades, dowels and other boring tools and multipurpose flints such as scrapers. An organised field walk in the late 1990s by Bartlett (Unpublished) indicates that most of the area, some 80 hectares, produced worked flint from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age with a smattering of Mesolithic. This indicates organised industry existed from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. The deposits are so large and dispersed that any major archaeological work in the area will have to take this into consideration before any ground work is started. Harlow was in Roman times the site of a small town (around [[Harlow Mill railway station]]) with a substantial stone built temple.<ref>Barry C. Burnham, J. S. Wacher: ''The Small Towns of Roman Britain'', Berkeley, Los Angeles 1990, pp. 186-187</ref>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Churchgate Street - geograph.org.uk - 1576708.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]], Churchgate Street]]\n\nThe entry in the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Domesday Book]] reads: ''Herlaua: St Edmunds Abbey before and after 1066; Geoffrey from Count Eustace; Thorgils from Eudo the Steward; Richard from Ranulf, brother of Ilger. Mill, 7 beehives, 8 cobs, 43 cattle, 3 foals.'' The mill is now a 300-year-old listed building and restaurant.<ref>Harlow Mill (now restaurant) \u2013 Grade II [[listed building|listing]]. {{National Heritage List for England|num=1111737|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe original village, mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], developed as a typical rural community around what is now known as [[Old Harlow]], with many of its buildings still standing. This includes for instance the Grade II listed [[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]] in Churchgate Street.  Its former Chapel is in a ruinous state in a field which was once the '''Harlowbury Abbey''' part of Old Harlow, is Grade I listed and is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1111694|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKingsmoor House on Paringdon Road is a Grade II* listed building and dates from the 18th century. It was built as a gentleman's residence and owned by local families including the [[Harlow Woods|Risden]], [[John Archer-Houblon|Houblon]] and [[Edward Joseph Todhunter|Todhunter]] families. It was later used as a private school and council offices before falling derelict.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingsmoor House - Harlow - May 2011 |url=https://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/residential-sites/18970-kingsmoor-house-harlow-2011-a.html |website=Derelict Places}}</ref> It has since been restored and converted into residential apartments.\n\n===The New Town===\n\nThe original Harlow [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] was built after [[World War II]] to ease overcrowding in London and the surrounding areas due to the devastation caused by the bombing during the Blitz. Harlow was, along with places such as [[Basildon]], [[Stevenage]] and [[Hemel Hempstead]] a result of the New Towns Act of 1946, with the master plan for Harlow drawn up in 1947 by Sir [[Frederick Gibberd]].<ref>[http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm Gardens Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020033303/http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm |date=20 October 2004 }} \u2013 Frederick Gibberd</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8603701.stm New town, a name change and all the jazz] BBC News web site</ref> The town was planned from the outset and was designed to respect the existing landscape. A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the [[market town]] of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as [[Old Harlow]], and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town's neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and [[public house|pubs]]. Gibberd invited many of the country's leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including [[Philip Powell (architect)|Philip Powell]] and [[Hidalgo Moya]], [[Leonard Manasseh]], Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, Gerard Goalen, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Jane Drew]], Graham Dawbarn, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]] and [[William Crabtree]].  Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas.  The cycle network is composed mostly of the original old town roads.\n\nThe town's authorities built Britain's first pedestrian precinct,<ref>[https://www.mun.ca/geog/interdisiplinary/harlow/harlow1.php Memorial University \u2013 Department of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121041144/http://www.mun.ca/geog/interdisiplinary/harlow/harlow1.php |date=21 January 2008 }} \u2013 Harlow's History and Geography</ref> and first modern-style residential [[tower block]], The Lawn,<ref>[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1271496 English Heritage] \u2013 The Lawn</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6264579.stm BBC News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907002448/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6264579.stm |date=7 September 2007 }} \u2013 ''Redeveloping Essex's fallen utopia ''</ref> constructed in 1951; it is now a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]].

The first neighbourhood, Mark Hall, is a conservation area.

Subsequently, many of the original town buildings, including most of its health centres, the Staple Tye shopping centre and many industrial units have been rebuilt. Gibberd's original town hall, a landmark in the town, has been demolished and replaced by a new civic centre and The Water Gardens shopping area.\n\n===Redevelopment===\n[[File:The Chase - geograph.org.uk - 400869.jpg|thumb|The Newhall housing development built circa 2007 between Old Harlow and Church Langley]]\n\nSince becoming a new town, Harlow has undergone several stages of expansion, the first of which was the \"mini expansion\" that was created by the building of the Sumners and Katherines estates in the mid-to-late seventies to the west of the existing town. Since then Harlow has further expanded with the Church Langley estate completed in 2005, and its newest neighbourhood [[Newhall, Essex|Newhall]] has completed the first stage of its development, with the second stage underway in 2013. The [[Harlow Gateway Scheme]] is currently underway, with the relocation of the Harlow Football Stadium to Barrow's Farm in early 2006, and the building of a new hotel, apartments, and a restaurant adjacent to the railway station being complete. The next stage of this scheme involves the completion of the 530 eco-homes being built on the former sports centre site, and the centre's relocation to the nearby former college playing field site.\n\nOther major developments under consideration include both a northern and southern bypass of the town, and significant expansion to the north, following the completed expansion to the east. The Harlow North<ref>[http://www.harlownorth.com Ropemaker Properties Limited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305002149/http://www.harlownorth.com/ |date=5 March 2007 }} \u2013 Harlow North</ref> plans, currently awaiting permission, involve an extension of the town across the floodplains on the town's northern border, into neighbouring [[Hertfordshire]]. The plan was supported by former MP [[Bill Rammell]], all three political groups on Harlow Council, and the [[East of England Regional Assembly]]. It is opposed by Hertfordshire County Council, East Herts Council, [[Mark Prisk]], MP for Hertford and Stortford in whose constituency the development would be, and all the parishes concerned.

A [[Planned community|new town]], situated on the border with [[Hertfordshire]] and London, Harlow occupies a large area of land on the south bank of the upper [[River Stort|Stort Valley]], which has been made navigable through other towns and features a canal section near its [[watermill]]. [[Old Harlow]] is a village-size suburb founded by the early medieval age and most of its [[high street]] buildings are early Victorian and residential, mostly protected by one of the Conservation Areas in the district. In Old Harlow is a field named '''Harlowbury''', a de-settled monastic area which has the remains of a chapel, a [[scheduled ancient monument]].\n\nThe [[M11 motorway]] passes through the east of the district, entirely to the east of the town. Harlow has its own commercial and leisure economy. It is also an outer part of the [[London commuter belt]] and employment centre of the M11 corridor which includes [[Cambridge]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] to the north. At the time of the 2011 Census, Harlow's population was recorded at 81,944 and its district had the third-highest proportion of [[social housing]] in England, 26.9%,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} a legacy of the 1947 commitment to re-house [[The Blitz|blitzed]] London families after World War II and provide a percentage of homes for other needy families who cannot afford [[renting|market rent]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThere is some dispute as to where the [[placename]] Harlow derives from. One theory is that it derives from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words 'here' and 'hlaw', meaning \"army hill\", probably to be identified with Mulberry Hill, which was used as the [[wikt:moot|moot]] or meeting place for the district.\n\nThe other theory is that it derives from the words 'here' and 'hearg', meaning \"temple hill/mound\", probably to be identified with an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] burial mound, later a [[Roman Britain|Roman temple]] site on River Way.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe earliest deposits are of a Mesolithic (circa 10,000 BC) hunting camp excavated by Davey in Northbrooks in the 1970s (Unpublished) closely followed by the large and unexcavated deposits of Neolithic flint beside Gilden Way. These deposits are mostly known because of the large numbers of surface-bound, worked flint. Substantial amounts of worked flint suggest an organised working of flint in the area. Large amounts of debitage litter the area and tools found include axeheads, hammers, blades, dowels and other boring tools and multipurpose flints such as scrapers. An organised field walk in the late 1990s by Bartlett (Unpublished) indicates that most of the area, some 80 hectares, produced worked flint from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age with a smattering of Mesolithic. This indicates organised industry existed from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. The deposits are so large and dispersed that any major archaeological work in the area will have to take this into consideration before any ground work is started. Harlow was in Roman times the site of a small town (around [[Harlow Mill railway station]]) with a substantial stone built temple.<ref>Barry C. Burnham, J. S. Wacher: ''The Small Towns of Roman Britain'', Berkeley, Los Angeles 1990, pp. 186-187</ref>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Churchgate Street - geograph.org.uk - 1576708.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]], Churchgate Street]]\n\nThe entry in the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Domesday Book]] reads: ''Herlaua: St Edmunds Abbey before and after 1066; Geoffrey from Count Eustace; Thorgils from Eudo the Steward; Richard from Ranulf, brother of Ilger. Mill, 7 beehives, 8 cobs, 43 cattle, 3 foals.'' The mill is now a 300-year-old listed building and restaurant.<ref>Harlow Mill (now restaurant) \u2013 Grade II [[listed building|listing]]. {{National Heritage List for England|num=1111737|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe original village, mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], developed as a typical rural community around what is now known as [[Old Harlow]], with many of its buildings still standing. This includes for instance the Grade II listed [[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]] in Churchgate Street.  Its former Chapel is in a ruinous state in a field which was once the '''Harlowbury Abbey''' part of Old Harlow, is Grade I listed and is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1111694|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKingsmoor House on Paringdon Road is a Grade II* listed building and dates from the 18th century. It was built as a gentleman's residence and owned by local families including the [[Harlow Woods|Risden]], [[John Archer-Houblon|Houblon]] and [[Edward Joseph Todhunter|Todhunter]] families. It was later used as a private school and council offices before falling derelict.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingsmoor House - Harlow - May 2011 |url=https://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/residential-sites/18970-kingsmoor-house-harlow-2011-a.html |website=Derelict Places}}</ref> It has since been restored and converted into residential apartments.\n\n===The New Town===\n\nThe original Harlow [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] was built after [[World War II]] to ease overcrowding in London and the surrounding areas due to the devastation caused by the bombing during the Blitz. Harlow was, along with places such as [[Basildon]], [[Stevenage]] and [[Hemel Hempstead]] a result of the New Towns Act of 1946, with the master plan for Harlow drawn up in 1947 by Sir [[Frederick Gibberd]].<ref>[http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm Gardens Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020033303/http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm |date=20 October 2004 }} \u2013 Frederick Gibberd</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8603701.stm New town, a name change and all the jazz] BBC News web site</ref> The town was planned from the outset and was designed to respect the existing landscape. A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the [[market town]] of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as [[Old Harlow]], and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town's neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and [[public house|pubs]]. Gibberd invited many of the country's leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including [[Philip Powell (architect)|Philip Powell]] and [[Hidalgo Moya]], [[Leonard Manasseh]], Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, Gerard Goalen, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Jane Drew]], Graham Dawbarn, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]] and [[William Crabtree]].  Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas.  The cycle network is composed mostly of the original old town roads.\n\nThe town's authorities built Britain's first pedestrian precinct,<ref>[https://www.mun.ca/geog/interdisiplinary/harlow/harlow1.php Memorial University \u2013 Department of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121041144/http://www.mun.ca/geog/interdisiplinary/harlow/harlow1.php |date=21 January 2008 }} \u2013 Harlow's History and Geography</ref> and first modern-style residential [[tower block]], The Lawn,<ref>[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1271496 English Heritage] \u2013 The Lawn</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6264579.stm BBC News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907002448/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6264579.stm |date=7 September 2007 }} \u2013 ''Redeveloping Essex's fallen utopia ''</ref> constructed in 1951; it is now a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]].

Subsequently, many of the original town buildings, including most of its health centres, the Staple Tye shopping centre and many industrial units have been rebuilt. Gibberd's original town hall, a landmark in the town, has been demolished and replaced by a new civic centre and The Water Gardens shopping area.\n\n===Redevelopment===\n[[File:The Chase - geograph.org.uk - 400869.jpg|thumb|The Newhall housing development built circa 2007 between Old Harlow and Church Langley]]\n\nSince becoming a new town, Harlow has undergone several stages of expansion, the first of which was the \"mini expansion\" that was created by the building of the Sumners and Katherines estates in the mid-to-late seventies to the west of the existing town. Since then Harlow has further expanded with the Church Langley estate completed in 2005, and its newest neighbourhood [[Newhall, Essex|Newhall]] has completed the first stage of its development, with the second stage underway in 2013. The [[Harlow Gateway Scheme]] is currently underway, with the relocation of the Harlow Football Stadium to Barrow's Farm in early 2006, and the building of a new hotel, apartments, and a restaurant adjacent to the railway station being complete. The next stage of this scheme involves the completion of the 530 eco-homes being built on the former sports centre site, and the centre's relocation to the nearby former college playing field site.\n\nOther major developments under consideration include both a northern and southern bypass of the town, and significant expansion to the north, following the completed expansion to the east. The Harlow North<ref>[http://www.harlownorth.com Ropemaker Properties Limited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305002149/http://www.harlownorth.com/ |date=5 March 2007 }} \u2013 Harlow North</ref> plans, currently awaiting permission, involve an extension of the town across the floodplains on the town's northern border, into neighbouring [[Hertfordshire]]. The plan was supported by former MP [[Bill Rammell]], all three political groups on Harlow Council, and the [[East of England Regional Assembly]].
