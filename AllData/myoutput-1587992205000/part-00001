Even though the hornets are many times bigger  than the bees, bees numbers make the difference. These bees are adapted to survive temperatures above {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} but the hornet is not. Thus, bees are able to kill their attacker by making a ball around the hornet and then increasing their body temperature above {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.<ref name=Ono>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ono M, Okada I, Sasaki M | year = 1987 | title = Heat production by balling in the Japanese noneybee, ''Apis cerana japonica'' as a defensive behavior against the hornet, ''Vespa simillima xanthoptera'' (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 43 | issue = 9 | pages = 1031\u20131034 | doi = 10.1007/BF01952231 }}</ref>\n\nAnopheles mosquitoes, vectors of Malaria, thermoregulate each time they take a blood meal on a warm-blooded animal. During blood ingestion, they emit a droplet composed of urine and fresh blood that they keep attached to their anus.  The liquid of the drop evaporates dissipating the excess of heat in their bodies consequence of the rapid ingestion of relatively high amounts of blood much warmer than the insect itself.  This evaporative cooling mechanism helps them to avoid the thermal stress associated to their haematophagous way of life.<ref name=\"Lahond\u00e8re\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lahond\u00e8re C, Lazzari CR | title = Mosquitoes cool down during blood feeding to avoid overheating | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 40\u20135 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22177900 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.029 }}</ref>\n\nThe Grayling butterfly (''[[Grayling (butterfly)|Hipparchia semele]]'') engages in thermoregulation as well. The species prefers to live in open habitats with easy access to the sun, and can be seen orienting its body to maximize exposure to the sun. At lower temperatures, the grayling can be observed exposing as much of its body as possible to the sun, whereas at higher temperatures, it exposes as little of its body as possible. This behavior is often used by male butterflies defending their territory, as this thermoregulatory behavior allows them to maximize their flight efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreisig H | title = Thermoregulation and flight activity in territorial male graylings, Hipparchia semele (Satyridae), and large skippers, Ochlodes venata (Hesperiidae) | journal = Oecologia | volume = 101 | issue = 2 | pages = 169\u2013176 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 28306787 | doi = 10.1007/BF00317280 | bibcode = 1995Oecol.101..169D }}</ref>\n\nThe thermoregulatory properties of dark coloration are important for mate searching by ''[[Phymata americana]]'' males.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Punzalan D, Rodd FH, Rowe L | title = Sexual selection mediated by the thermoregulatory effects of male colour pattern in the ambush bug Phymata americana | journal = Proceedings.
