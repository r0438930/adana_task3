For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and falsifiability==\n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created within the logical structure constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  Popper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"all men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Yet another example of an unfalsifiable statement is \"all angels have large wings\". It is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 14-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. The logical structure has universal classes. For example, the concept of swans define a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist or will exist. Once we know the universal classes, informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in these classes. In particular, an existential statement is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. For example, the statement \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that the basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> However, this agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principles. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is then considered in details and, as we discussed [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| before]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples).\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Kaye{{efn-ua | Not to be confused with [[David Kaye (law professor)]], United Nations special rapporteur. David H.

It then argues that while the Court did not embrace the views of any specific philosopher of science, inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations. Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied \"[[precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]\".{{sfn|Ridley|2003}} [[Richard Dawkins]] adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.{{sfn|Wallis|2005}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1995}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1986}} [[Karl Popper]] at first spoke against the testability of natural selection{{sfn|Popper|1982b}}{{sfn|Popper|1976}} but recanted, \"I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation.\"{{sfn|Popper|1978}}\n\n===Young-earth creationism===\n{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}\nMuch of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]].

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and falsifiability==\n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created within the logical structure constitute the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  Popper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"all men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Yet another example of an unfalsifiable statement is \"all angels have large wings\". It is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 14-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. The logical structure has universal classes. For example, the concept of swans define a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist or will exist. Once we know the universal classes, informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in these classes. In particular, an existential statement is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. For example, the statement \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that the basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> However, this agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principles. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is then considered in details and, as we discussed [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| before]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples).\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims.

Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory. In other words, we only accept the falsification if a low-level empirical hypothesis which describes such an effect is proposed and corroborated. This kind of hypothesis may be called a falsifying hypothesis.\"</ref>\n\n<ref  name=\"falsifiabilityVsfalsification\"  group=upper-alpha>  {{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66|loc=sec. 22}}: \"We must clearly distinguish between falsifiability and falsification.
