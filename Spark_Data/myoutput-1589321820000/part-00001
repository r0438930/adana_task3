A drug that is UAD can also be sold at drugstores, stores where no prescription can be filed and there is only a relatively small selection of popular drugs like painkillers and cough medicine. The drugs are usually on the shelves, and the store also sells items like toys, gadgets, perfumes and homeopathic products. The drugs in this category have limited risk and addiction potential. Examples are [[naproxen]] and [[diclofenac]] in small amounts, [[cinnarizine]], 400&nbsp;mg ibuprofen up to 20 tablets and also 500&nbsp;mg [[paracetamol]] up to 50 tablets.

The FDA requires that all \"new drugs\" obtain a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) before entering interstate commerce, but the act exempts any drugs [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] (GRAS/E).<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/investigational-new-drug-ind-application/drug-development-and-review-definitions Drug Development and Review Definitions].

Retrieved on 2014-04-24.</ref>\n\nThe FDA requires OTC products to be  labeled with an approved \"Drug Facts\" label to educate consumers about their medications. The labels comply to a standard format and are intended to be easy for typical consumers to understand. Drug Facts labels include information on the product's [[active ingredient|active ingredient(s)]], [[Indication (medicine)|indication]]s and purpose, safety warnings, directions for use, and [[inactive ingredients]].<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-information-consumers/otc-drug-facts-label OTC Drug Facts Label].

Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\n====Restricted over-the-counter substances====\nAn ill-defined third category of substances is products having over-the-counter status from the FDA while being simultaneously subject to other restrictions on sale. While they are legally classified as OTC drugs, they are typically stored behind the counter and are sold only in stores that are registered with their state. They may be unavailable in convenience and grocery stores that stock other non-restricted OTC medications.\n\nFor example, many drugstores have moved products containing [[pseudoephedrine]], an OTC product, into locations where customers must ask a pharmacist for them. A prescription is not required; the change has been made in an effort to reduce [[methamphetamine]] production. Since the passage of the [[Illinois Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act]] and the subsequent federal [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], the purchase of pseudoephedrine is restricted. Sellers of pseudoephedrine must obtain and record the identity of the purchaser and enforce [[Pseudoephedrine#United States|quantity restrictions]]. Some states may have more stringent requirements (such as [[controlled substances in Oregon#Methamphetamine|Oregon]], where a [[medical prescription]] is required to purchase any quantity of pseudoephedrine). After initial attempts to control methamphetamine use (by requiring documentation of sale with government issued ID as well as limits on the quantity an individual could purchase) failed to realize meaningful reductions in methamphetamine use and production, [[Mississippi]] passed House Bill 512 in the State Senate on February 2, 2010 \"to require a prescription from a licensed medical professional to purchase over-the-counter medicines with pseudoephedrine, [[ephedrine]], or any other precursor chemical that can readily and illicitly be converted into [[methamphetamine]], [[Methcathinone]] or any active/scheduled analogs of [[Phenylethylamines]]/ [[amphetamine]].\"{{Citation needed|date = February 2016|reason = can't verify this wording}} However, products containing the substance are still OTC in most states, since no prescription is required.\n\n[[File:Plan b one step.jpg|thumb|Plan B One-Step]]\n\nA similar regulation once applied to some forms of [[emergency contraception]]. However, on February 25, 2014 the FDA approved generic one-pill emergency contraception products for unrestricted sale on the shelf. There is no age limit or need for ID to purchase.<ref>[https://ec.princeton.edu/pills/planbhistory.html Princeton University]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, some [[List of Schedule V drugs|Schedule V]] controlled substances may be classified as OTC products in certain states. Such drugs are sold without a prescription but are subject to record-keeping rules and quantity and/or age restrictions, and they must be dispensed by a [[pharmacy]].<ref>[https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1306/1306_26.htm Controlled Substances Listed in Schedules III, IV, and V]. US Department of Justice - Drug Enforcement Administration. Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom, medication is governed by the Medicines Regulations 2012. Medication falls into one of three categories:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Medicines information|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Medicinesinfo/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=19 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n# Prescription Only Medication (POM), which are legally available only with a valid prescription from a prescriber. A [[pharmacist]] has to be on the premises for POM medicines to be dispensed, required by law. The medicine has been specifically prescribed for the patient holding the prescription, so it is considered safe for only the recipient to take. Just a small example of these include most [[antibiotics]] and all [[antidepressants]] or [[antidiabetic]] medications. Drugs included as POM are high-strength painkillers such as [[oxycodone]] and [[tramadol]], medications such as [[Zolpidem]] (Ambien), [[diazepam]] (Valium), and certain topical preparations such as [[corticosteroids]]. These medicines are often sold by drug dealers, especially those marked as \"CD POM,\" which are controlled due to abuse risk such as [[dipipanone]], [[temazepam]], and [[methadone]].\n# General Sales List (GSL), available off the shelf with no pharmacy training required to sell (so they can be sold anywhere, such as supermarkets). In general, they are considered safe for most people when taken correctly. Examples of these include 16-packs (or less) of painkillers such as [[paracetamol]] and [[ibuprofen]] as well as a host of other safe medications such as small pack sizes of [[Antihistamine|antiallergy]] tablets, [[laxative]] medication, and skin creams.\n# Pharmacy Medicines (P) are medicines which are legally neither a POM or GSL medication. These can be sold from a registered pharmacy but should not be available for self-selection (although directions to discuss a 'P' product may be allocated shelf space with associated GSL items). 'P' medications are reserved from the GSL list as they are either associated with a need for advice on use, or used in conditions which may require referral to a medical prescriber. Suitable trained counter assistants may sell a 'P' medication under the supervision of a pharmacist and will ask questions to determine if the customer needs to be referred for a discussion with a pharmacist. Some 'POM' medicines are available for use in certain situations and doses as 'P' medicines.\n\nIf it is not appropriate to sell a 'P' medication \u2013 i.e. the condition is not suitable for self-management and requires referral to a medical prescriber \u2013 then a sale should not occur and the pharmacist has a legal and professional obligation to refer this on to an appropriate service.\n\nExamples of these include some sleep aid tablets such as [[Diphenhydramine|Nytol]], human [[deworming]] tablets such as [[Mebendazole]], painkillers with small amounts of [[codeine]] (up to 12.8&nbsp;mg per tablet), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. Medication available only with a prescription is marked somewhere on the box/container with [POM]. Pharmacy-only products are marked with [P]. A prescription is not required for [P] medicines, and pharmacy sales assistants are required by [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] codes to ask certain questions, which varies for what the customer says. If they ask for a specific product, the pharmacy assistant must ask \"Who is it for,\" \"How long have you had the symptoms,\" \"Are you allergic to any medication,\" \"Are you taking any medication\" ('WHAM' questions). If a customer asks for a remedy, e.g., hay fever, then the two WHAM questions must be followed \"Who is it for,\" \"What are the symptoms,\" \"How long have you had the symptoms,\" \"Have you taken any action towards your symptoms,\" and \"Are you taking any other medication.\" It is with this information that the pharmacist can halt the sale, if need be. No [POM], [P] or [GSL] products that are stocked in a pharmacy can be sold, dispensed, or pre-made until a responsible pharmacist is signed in and on the premises. Some medication available in supermarkets and petrol stations is sold only in smaller packet sizes. Often, larger packs will be marked as [P] and available only from a pharmacy. Frequently, customers buying larger-than-usual doses of [P] medicines (such as [[DXM]], promethazine, codeine or Gee's linctus) will be queried, due to the possibility of abuse.<ref>[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Availabilityprescribingsellingandsupplyingofmedicines/Availabilityofmedicines/index.htm Availability of medicines].

Retrieved on 2012-07-04.</ref>\n\n==Transitions between prescription and OTC==\nAs a general rule, over-the-counter drugs have to be used primarily to treat a condition that does not require the direct supervision of a doctor and must be proven to be reasonably safe and well tolerated. OTC drugs are usually also required to have little or no abuse potential, although in some areas drugs such as [[codeine]] are available OTC (usually in strictly limited formulations or requiring paperwork or identification to be submitted during purchase).\n\nOver time, often 3\u20136 years, drugs that prove themselves safe and appropriate as prescription medicines may be switched from prescription to OTC. An example of this is [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), an anti-histamine which once required a prescription but now is available OTC nearly everywhere. More recent examples are [[cimetidine]] and [[loratadine]] in the United States, and [[ibuprofen]] in Australia.\n\nIt is somewhat unusual for an OTC drug to be withdrawn from the market as a result of safety concerns, rather than market forces, though it does happen occasionally. For example, [[phenylpropanolamine]] was removed from sale in the United States over concern regarding [[strokes]] in young women. A study has been done examining consumer's perceptions about the risk of and access to nonprescription medication.   The study concluded that a small percentage of consumers prefer having access to medication over potential risks of taking non-prescribed medication.\n<ref name=alexander>{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=GC|author2=Mohajir N |author3=Meltzer DO |title=Consumers' perceptions about risk of and access to nonprescription medications|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|year=2005|volume=45|issue=3|pages=363\u2013370|pmid=15991758|doi=10.1331/1544345054003868}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was announced in February 2007 that [[Boots the Chemist]] would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in [[Manchester]], [[England]] (previous available as prescription only).

Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\nThus, an OTC drug product is allowed to be marketed either (1) pursuant to an [[Monograph#United States Food and Drug Administration regulation|FDA monograph]] or (2) pursuant to an NDA for products that do not fit within a specific monograph.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/drug-applications-over-counter-otc-drugs|title=Drug Applications for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|date=2019-05-29|website=FDA|language=en|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> There is also the possibility that certain OTC drug products are marketed under the grandfathering provisions of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], but the FDA has never formally acknowledged that any legitimate grandfathered OTC drug exists.\n\nExamples of OTC substances approved in the United States are sunscreens, anti-microbial and anti-fungal products, external and internal analgesics such as [[lidocaine]] and [[aspirin]], [[psoriasis]] and [[eczema]] topical treatments, anti-[[dandruff]] shampoos containing [[coal tar]], and other topical products with a therapeutic effect.\n\nThe [[Federal Trade Commission]] regulates advertising of OTC products, in contrast to prescription drug advertising, which is regulated by the FDA.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/UCM148055.pdf Regulation of Nonprescription Drug Products] Fda.gov. Retrieved on 2014-04-24.</ref>\n\nThe FDA requires OTC products to be  labeled with an approved \"Drug Facts\" label to educate consumers about their medications. The labels comply to a standard format and are intended to be easy for typical consumers to understand. Drug Facts labels include information on the product's [[active ingredient|active ingredient(s)]], [[Indication (medicine)|indication]]s and purpose, safety warnings, directions for use, and [[inactive ingredients]].<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-information-consumers/otc-drug-facts-label OTC Drug Facts Label].

While they are legally classified as OTC drugs, they are typically stored behind the counter and are sold only in stores that are registered with their state. They may be unavailable in convenience and grocery stores that stock other non-restricted OTC medications.\n\nFor example, many drugstores have moved products containing [[pseudoephedrine]], an OTC product, into locations where customers must ask a pharmacist for them. A prescription is not required; the change has been made in an effort to reduce [[methamphetamine]] production. Since the passage of the [[Illinois Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act]] and the subsequent federal [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], the purchase of pseudoephedrine is restricted. Sellers of pseudoephedrine must obtain and record the identity of the purchaser and enforce [[Pseudoephedrine#United States|quantity restrictions]]. Some states may have more stringent requirements (such as [[controlled substances in Oregon#Methamphetamine|Oregon]], where a [[medical prescription]] is required to purchase any quantity of pseudoephedrine). After initial attempts to control methamphetamine use (by requiring documentation of sale with government issued ID as well as limits on the quantity an individual could purchase) failed to realize meaningful reductions in methamphetamine use and production, [[Mississippi]] passed House Bill 512 in the State Senate on February 2, 2010 \"to require a prescription from a licensed medical professional to purchase over-the-counter medicines with pseudoephedrine, [[ephedrine]], or any other precursor chemical that can readily and illicitly be converted into [[methamphetamine]], [[Methcathinone]] or any active/scheduled analogs of [[Phenylethylamines]]/ [[amphetamine]].\"{{Citation needed|date = February 2016|reason = can't verify this wording}} However, products containing the substance are still OTC in most states, since no prescription is required.\n\n[[File:Plan b one step.jpg|thumb|Plan B One-Step]]\n\nA similar regulation once applied to some forms of [[emergency contraception]]. However, on February 25, 2014 the FDA approved generic one-pill emergency contraception products for unrestricted sale on the shelf. There is no age limit or need for ID to purchase.<ref>[https://ec.princeton.edu/pills/planbhistory.html Princeton University]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, some [[List of Schedule V drugs|Schedule V]] controlled substances may be classified as OTC products in certain states. Such drugs are sold without a prescription but are subject to record-keeping rules and quantity and/or age restrictions, and they must be dispensed by a [[pharmacy]].<ref>[https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1306/1306_26.htm Controlled Substances Listed in Schedules III, IV, and V]. US Department of Justice - Drug Enforcement Administration. Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom, medication is governed by the Medicines Regulations 2012. Medication falls into one of three categories:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Medicines information|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Medicinesinfo/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=19 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n# Prescription Only Medication (POM), which are legally available only with a valid prescription from a prescriber. A [[pharmacist]] has to be on the premises for POM medicines to be dispensed, required by law. The medicine has been specifically prescribed for the patient holding the prescription, so it is considered safe for only the recipient to take. Just a small example of these include most [[antibiotics]] and all [[antidepressants]] or [[antidiabetic]] medications. Drugs included as POM are high-strength painkillers such as [[oxycodone]] and [[tramadol]], medications such as [[Zolpidem]] (Ambien), [[diazepam]] (Valium), and certain topical preparations such as [[corticosteroids]]. These medicines are often sold by drug dealers, especially those marked as \"CD POM,\" which are controlled due to abuse risk such as [[dipipanone]], [[temazepam]], and [[methadone]].\n# General Sales List (GSL), available off the shelf with no pharmacy training required to sell (so they can be sold anywhere, such as supermarkets). In general, they are considered safe for most people when taken correctly. Examples of these include 16-packs (or less) of painkillers such as [[paracetamol]] and [[ibuprofen]] as well as a host of other safe medications such as small pack sizes of [[Antihistamine|antiallergy]] tablets, [[laxative]] medication, and skin creams.\n# Pharmacy Medicines (P) are medicines which are legally neither a POM or GSL medication. These can be sold from a registered pharmacy but should not be available for self-selection (although directions to discuss a 'P' product may be allocated shelf space with associated GSL items). 'P' medications are reserved from the GSL list as they are either associated with a need for advice on use, or used in conditions which may require referral to a medical prescriber. Suitable trained counter assistants may sell a 'P' medication under the supervision of a pharmacist and will ask questions to determine if the customer needs to be referred for a discussion with a pharmacist. Some 'POM' medicines are available for use in certain situations and doses as 'P' medicines.\n\nIf it is not appropriate to sell a 'P' medication \u2013 i.e. the condition is not suitable for self-management and requires referral to a medical prescriber \u2013 then a sale should not occur and the pharmacist has a legal and professional obligation to refer this on to an appropriate service.\n\nExamples of these include some sleep aid tablets such as [[Diphenhydramine|Nytol]], human [[deworming]] tablets such as [[Mebendazole]], painkillers with small amounts of [[codeine]] (up to 12.8&nbsp;mg per tablet), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. Medication available only with a prescription is marked somewhere on the box/container with [POM]. Pharmacy-only products are marked with [P]. A prescription is not required for [P] medicines, and pharmacy sales assistants are required by [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] codes to ask certain questions, which varies for what the customer says. If they ask for a specific product, the pharmacy assistant must ask \"Who is it for,\" \"How long have you had the symptoms,\" \"Are you allergic to any medication,\" \"Are you taking any medication\" ('WHAM' questions). If a customer asks for a remedy, e.g., hay fever, then the two WHAM questions must be followed \"Who is it for,\" \"What are the symptoms,\" \"How long have you had the symptoms,\" \"Have you taken any action towards your symptoms,\" and \"Are you taking any other medication.\" It is with this information that the pharmacist can halt the sale, if need be. No [POM], [P] or [GSL] products that are stocked in a pharmacy can be sold, dispensed, or pre-made until a responsible pharmacist is signed in and on the premises. Some medication available in supermarkets and petrol stations is sold only in smaller packet sizes. Often, larger packs will be marked as [P] and available only from a pharmacy. Frequently, customers buying larger-than-usual doses of [P] medicines (such as [[DXM]], promethazine, codeine or Gee's linctus) will be queried, due to the possibility of abuse.<ref>[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Availabilityprescribingsellingandsupplyingofmedicines/Availabilityofmedicines/index.htm Availability of medicines].

OTC drugs are usually also required to have little or no abuse potential, although in some areas drugs such as [[codeine]] are available OTC (usually in strictly limited formulations or requiring paperwork or identification to be submitted during purchase).\n\nOver time, often 3\u20136 years, drugs that prove themselves safe and appropriate as prescription medicines may be switched from prescription to OTC. An example of this is [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), an anti-histamine which once required a prescription but now is available OTC nearly everywhere. More recent examples are [[cimetidine]] and [[loratadine]] in the United States, and [[ibuprofen]] in Australia.\n\nIt is somewhat unusual for an OTC drug to be withdrawn from the market as a result of safety concerns, rather than market forces, though it does happen occasionally. For example, [[phenylpropanolamine]] was removed from sale in the United States over concern regarding [[strokes]] in young women. A study has been done examining consumer's perceptions about the risk of and access to nonprescription medication.   The study concluded that a small percentage of consumers prefer having access to medication over potential risks of taking non-prescribed medication.\n<ref name=alexander>{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=GC|author2=Mohajir N |author3=Meltzer DO |title=Consumers' perceptions about risk of and access to nonprescription medications|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|year=2005|volume=45|issue=3|pages=363\u2013370|pmid=15991758|doi=10.1331/1544345054003868}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was announced in February 2007 that [[Boots the Chemist]] would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in [[Manchester]], [[England]] (previous available as prescription only).
