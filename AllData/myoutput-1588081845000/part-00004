The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War. However, old attitudes still prevailed amongst some members of the general public, with resentment by association towards Bevin Boys. In 1943 Ernest Bevin said in Parliament:\n: ''There are thousands of cases in which conscientious objectors, although they have refused to take up arms, have shown as much courage as anyone else in Civil Defence and in other walks of life.''\n:<small>Ernest Bevin, 9 December 1943</small><ref>{{ukhansard | house=HC | date=9 December 1943 | vol=395 | c=1108}}</ref>\n\n==End of programme==\nThe final conscription ballot took place in May 1945 (shortly before [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]]), however the final conscripts were not released from service until March 1948.\n\n==Recognition of contribution to the war effort==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bevin Boy Veteran badge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Bevin Boy Veteran badge, awarded to former Bevin Boys by the British Government since 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/5-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-bevin-boys/|title=5 things you (probably) didn\u2019t know about the Bevin Boys |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>{{ffdc|Bevin Boy Veteran badge.jpg|log=2020 April 5}}]] -->\n\nWithin a few months of the first Bevin Boys starting work, there were calls for a badge to be awarded in recognition of the importance of their national service,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Young mine workers |date= 31 May 1944 |page_number= 8 |issue= 49870}}</ref>. \n\nAfter the war, Bevin Boys received neither [[medal]]s nor the right to return to the jobs they had previously held.<ref name=Museum_Wales/> (Like Forces veterans, they were entitled to participate in the Government's Further Education and Training Scheme, which paid university fees and an annual means-tested grant of up to \u00a3426 to cover living expenses whilst studying.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dent |first= Harold Collett |year= 2007 |title=  Growth in English education, 1946-1952  |location= London |publisher= Routledge |chapter= 1 |isbn= 9780415432160}}</ref>)\n\nThe role played by Bevin Boys in Britain's war effort was not fully recognised until 1995, 50 years after [[VE Day]], when [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] mentioned them in a speech.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/bevins-boys-kept-in-the-dark-for-60-years.html | title=Bevin\u2019s Boys \u2013 British Conscripts Forced To Mine Coal \u2013 Kept in the Dark for Over 70 Years | accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 June 2007, [[Tony Blair]] informed the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that thousands of conscripts who worked in mines during the Second World War would be awarded a veterans badge similar to the HM armed forces badge awarded by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1555056/Bevin-Boys-war-effort-honoured-with-badge.html|title=Bevin Boys' war effort honoured with badge|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> The first badges were awarded on 25 March 2008 by the then Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]], at a reception in 10 Downing Street, marking the 60th anniversary of discharge of the last Bevin Boys.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Bevin Boys honoured |date= 26 March 2008 |page_number= 4 |issue= 69281}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bevin Boys Memorial 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|One of the memorial stones at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]].]] \nOn Tuesday 7 May 2013, a memorial to the Bevin Boys, based on the Bevin Boys Badge, was unveiled by the [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]] at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] at [[Alrewas]], Staffordshire.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Court Circular |date= 8 May 2013 |page_number= 51 |issue= 70879}}</ref><ref name=memorial>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/royalfamilyvideo/10041949/Bevin-Boys-memorial-unveiled-by-Countess-of-Wessex.html|title=Bevin Boys memorial unveiled by Countess of Wessex|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref> The memorial was designed by former Bevin Boy Harry Parkes; it is made of four stone plinths carved from grey [[Kilkenny Marble|Kilkenny stone]] from the Republic of Ireland.

The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War. However, old attitudes still prevailed amongst some members of the general public, with resentment by association towards Bevin Boys.
