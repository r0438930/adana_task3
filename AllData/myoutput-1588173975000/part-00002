In contrast to VLF waves, the height of the layer is much less than one wavelength at ELF frequencies, so the only mode that can propagate at ELF frequencies is the [[TEM mode]] in [[vertical polarization]], with the [[electric field]] vertical and the [[magnetic field]] horizontal.

Signals in the ELF frequency range, however, can penetrate much deeper. Two factors limit the usefulness of ELF communications channels: the low data transmission rate of a few characters per minute and, to a lesser extent, the one-way nature due to the impracticality of installing an antenna of the required size on a submarine (the antenna needs to be of an exceptional size in order to achieve successful communication). Generally, ELF signals have been used to order a submarine to rise to a shallow depth where it could receive some other form of communication.\n\n===Difficulties of ELF communication===\nOne of the difficulties posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] size, because the length of the antenna must be at least a substantial fraction of the length of the waves. Simply put, a 3 [[hertz|Hz]] (cycle per second) signal would have a wavelength equal to the distance EM waves travel through a given medium in one third of a second. Taking account of [[refractive index]], ELF waves propagate slightly slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. As used in military applications, the wavelength is {{convert|299,792|km|abbr=on}} per second divided by 50\u201385&nbsp;Hz, which equals around {{convert|3500|to|6000|km|abbr=on}} long. This is comparable to the [[Earth]]'s diameter of around {{convert|12742|km|abbr=on}}. Because of this huge size requirement, to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, the Earth itself forms a significant part of the antenna, and extremely long leads are necessary into the ground. Various means, such as [[electrical lengthening]], are used to construct practical radio stations with smaller sizes.\n\nThe U.S. maintained two sites, in the [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]], [[Wisconsin]] and in the [[Escanaba River State Forest]], [[Michigan]] (originally named [[Project Sanguine]], then downsized and rechristened Project ELF prior to construction), until they were dismantled, beginning in late September 2004. Both sites used long [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, so-called [[ground dipole]]s, as leads. These leads were in multiple strands ranging from {{convert|22.5|to|45|km}} long. Because of the inefficiency of this method, considerable amounts of [[electric power|electrical power]] were required to operate the system.\n\n===Ecological impact===\nThere have been some concerns over the possible ecological impact of ELF signals. In 1984 a federal judge halted construction, requiring more environmental and health studies. This judgment was overruled by a federal appeals court on the basis that the [[US Navy]] claimed to have spent over $25 million studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields, with results indicating that they were similar to the effect produced by standard power distribution lines. The judgment was not accepted by everyone and, during the time that ELF was in use, some Wisconsin politicians such as Democratic Senators [[Herb Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold]] and Congressman [[Dave Obey]] called for its closure. Similar concerns have, in the past, been raised about electromagnetic radiation and health.\n\n==Other uses==\nTransmitters in the 22&nbsp;Hz range are also used in pipeline maintenance or [[pigging]]. The signal is generated as an alternating magnetic field, and the transmitter is mounted to, or to part of, the \"pig\", the cleaning device inserted into the pipe. The pig is pushed through a pipeline mostly made of metal. The ELF signal can be detected through the metal allowing its location to be detected by receivers located outside of the pipe.<ref>St\u00e9phane Sainson, ''Inspection en ligne des pipelines. Principes et m\u00e9thodes''. Ed. Lavoisier. 2007. {{ISBN|978-2743009724}}. 332 p.</ref> It is needed to check if a pig has passed a certain location and to locate a pig which has become stuck.\n\nSome radio monitoring hobbyists record ELF [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s using antennas ranging in size from eighteen inch active antennas up to several thousand feet in length taking advantage of fences, highway guard rails, and even decommissioned railroad tracks, and [[pitch control|play them back at higher speeds]] to more easily observe natural low frequency fluctuations in the [[Earth science#Earth's electromagnetic field|Earth's electromagnetic field]]. Increasing the playback speed increases the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], so that it can be brought into the [[audio frequency]] range for audibility.\n\n==Natural sources==\nNaturally occurring ELF waves are present on Earth, resonating in the region between [[ionosphere]] and surface seen in [[lightning]] strikes that make electrons in the atmosphere oscillate.<ref name=\"Titan ELF\">{{cite news| url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| title=Titan's Mysterious Radio Wave| date=1 June 2007| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory| accessdate=2007-06-02| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603142552/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| archivedate=3 June 2007| df=dmy-all}} Republished as \"''[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassinif-20070601-02.html Casini - Unlocking Saturn's Secrets - Titan's mysterious radio wave]''\". 22 November 2007.

Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of ELF waves, so the waves may instead be reflecting off the liquid-ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia, the existence of which is predicted by some theoretical models. Titan's ionosphere is also more complex than Earth's, with the main ionosphere at an altitude of {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} but with an additional layer of charged particles at {{convert|63|km|abbr=on}}. This splits Titan's atmosphere into two separate resonating chambers. The source of natural ELF waves on Titan is unclear as there does not appear to be extensive lightning activity.<ref name=\"Titan ELF\"/>\n\nHuge ELF radiation power outputs of 100,000 times the Sun's output in visible light may be radiated by [[magnetar]]s.

Health effects related to short-term, high-level exposure have been established and form the basis of two international exposure limit guidelines (ICNIRP, 1998; IEEE, 2002) such as 0.2-0.4 mA at 50/60&nbsp;Hz. A study by Reilly in 1999 showed that the threshold for direct perception of exposure to ELF RF by human volunteer subjects started at around 2 to 5 kV/m at 60&nbsp;Hz, with 10% of volunteers detecting the ELF exposure at this level.

ELF waves have extremely low attenuation of 1\u20132&nbsp;dB per 1000&nbsp;km,<ref name=\"Jursa\" /><ref name=\"Barr3\">Barr, et al (2000) [http://nova.stanford.edu/~vlf/IHY_Test/Tutorials/SubionosphericVLFPropagation/Papers/Barr_2000.pdf  ELF and VLF radio waves], p. 1695, 1696 fig. 3</ref> giving a single transmitter the potential to communicate worldwide.\n\nELF waves can also travel considerable distances through \"lossy\" media like earth and seawater, which would absorb or reflect higher frequency radio waves.\n\n===Schumann resonances===\n{{main|Schumann resonances}}\nThe attenuation of ELF waves is so low that they can travel completely around the Earth several times before decaying to negligible amplitude, and thus waves radiated from a source in opposite directions circumnavigating the Earth on a [[great circle]] path [[interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other.<ref name=\"Barr2\">Barr, et al (2000) [http://nova.stanford.edu/~vlf/IHY_Test/Tutorials/SubionosphericVLFPropagation/Papers/Barr_2000.pdf  ELF and VLF radio waves], p. 1700-1701</ref> At certain frequencies these oppositely directed waves are [[in phase]] and add (reinforce), causing [[standing wave]]s.

The fundamental Schumann resonance is at approximately 7.83&nbsp;Hz, the frequency at which the [[wavelength]] equals the circumference of the Earth, and higher harmonics occur at 14.1, 20.3, 26.4, and 32.4&nbsp;Hz, etc. Lightning strikes excite these resonances, causing the Earth-ionosphere cavity to \"ring\" like a bell, resulting in a peak in the noise spectrum at these frequencies, so the Schumann resonances can be used to monitor global thunderstorm activity.\n\nInterest in Schumann resonances was renewed in 1993 when E. R. Williams showed a correlation between the resonance frequency and tropical air temperatures, suggesting the resonance could be used to monitor [[global warming]].<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite journal\n  | last1  = Williams\n  | first1 = Earle R.\n  | title = The Schumann resonance: A global tropical thermometer\n  | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n  | volume = 256\n  | issue = 5060\n  | pages = 1184\u20131187\n  | date = May 22, 1992\n  | issn = \n  | doi =  10.1126/science.256.5060.1184 \n  | pmid = 17795213\n | id = \n  | bibcode =1992Sci...256.1184W}}</ref><ref name=\"Barr2\" />\n\n==Submarine communications==\n[[Image:Ground dipole ELF antenna.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|A [[ground dipole]] antenna used for transmitting ELF waves, similar to the U.S. Navy Clam Lake antennas, showing how it works.

Signals in the ELF frequency range, however, can penetrate much deeper. Two factors limit the usefulness of ELF communications channels: the low data transmission rate of a few characters per minute and, to a lesser extent, the one-way nature due to the impracticality of installing an antenna of the required size on a submarine (the antenna needs to be of an exceptional size in order to achieve successful communication). Generally, ELF signals have been used to order a submarine to rise to a shallow depth where it could receive some other form of communication.\n\n===Difficulties of ELF communication===\nOne of the difficulties posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] size, because the length of the antenna must be at least a substantial fraction of the length of the waves. Simply put, a 3 [[hertz|Hz]] (cycle per second) signal would have a wavelength equal to the distance EM waves travel through a given medium in one third of a second. Taking account of [[refractive index]], ELF waves propagate slightly slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. As used in military applications, the wavelength is {{convert|299,792|km|abbr=on}} per second divided by 50\u201385&nbsp;Hz, which equals around {{convert|3500|to|6000|km|abbr=on}} long. This is comparable to the [[Earth]]'s diameter of around {{convert|12742|km|abbr=on}}. Because of this huge size requirement, to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, the Earth itself forms a significant part of the antenna, and extremely long leads are necessary into the ground. Various means, such as [[electrical lengthening]], are used to construct practical radio stations with smaller sizes.\n\nThe U.S. maintained two sites, in the [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]], [[Wisconsin]] and in the [[Escanaba River State Forest]], [[Michigan]] (originally named [[Project Sanguine]], then downsized and rechristened Project ELF prior to construction), until they were dismantled, beginning in late September 2004. Both sites used long [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, so-called [[ground dipole]]s, as leads. These leads were in multiple strands ranging from {{convert|22.5|to|45|km}} long. Because of the inefficiency of this method, considerable amounts of [[electric power|electrical power]] were required to operate the system.\n\n===Ecological impact===\nThere have been some concerns over the possible ecological impact of ELF signals. In 1984 a federal judge halted construction, requiring more environmental and health studies. This judgment was overruled by a federal appeals court on the basis that the [[US Navy]] claimed to have spent over $25 million studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields, with results indicating that they were similar to the effect produced by standard power distribution lines. The judgment was not accepted by everyone and, during the time that ELF was in use, some Wisconsin politicians such as Democratic Senators [[Herb Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold]] and Congressman [[Dave Obey]] called for its closure. Similar concerns have, in the past, been raised about electromagnetic radiation and health.\n\n==Other uses==\nTransmitters in the 22&nbsp;Hz range are also used in pipeline maintenance or [[pigging]]. The signal is generated as an alternating magnetic field, and the transmitter is mounted to, or to part of, the \"pig\", the cleaning device inserted into the pipe. The pig is pushed through a pipeline mostly made of metal. The ELF signal can be detected through the metal allowing its location to be detected by receivers located outside of the pipe.<ref>St\u00e9phane Sainson, ''Inspection en ligne des pipelines. Principes et m\u00e9thodes''. Ed. Lavoisier. 2007. {{ISBN|978-2743009724}}. 332 p.</ref> It is needed to check if a pig has passed a certain location and to locate a pig which has become stuck.\n\nSome radio monitoring hobbyists record ELF [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s using antennas ranging in size from eighteen inch active antennas up to several thousand feet in length taking advantage of fences, highway guard rails, and even decommissioned railroad tracks, and [[pitch control|play them back at higher speeds]] to more easily observe natural low frequency fluctuations in the [[Earth science#Earth's electromagnetic field|Earth's electromagnetic field]]. Increasing the playback speed increases the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], so that it can be brought into the [[audio frequency]] range for audibility.\n\n==Natural sources==\nNaturally occurring ELF waves are present on Earth, resonating in the region between [[ionosphere]] and surface seen in [[lightning]] strikes that make electrons in the atmosphere oscillate.<ref name=\"Titan ELF\">{{cite news| url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| title=Titan's Mysterious Radio Wave| date=1 June 2007| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory| accessdate=2007-06-02| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603142552/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| archivedate=3 June 2007| df=dmy-all}} Republished as \"''[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassinif-20070601-02.html Casini - Unlocking Saturn's Secrets - Titan's mysterious radio wave]''\". 22 November 2007.

Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of ELF waves, so the waves may instead be reflecting off the liquid-ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia, the existence of which is predicted by some theoretical models. Titan's ionosphere is also more complex than Earth's, with the main ionosphere at an altitude of {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} but with an additional layer of charged particles at {{convert|63|km|abbr=on}}.
