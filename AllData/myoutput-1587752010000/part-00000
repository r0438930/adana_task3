Their songs are characterized by a blend of instrumental music and [[sound effect]]s and are commonly used to provide atmosphere during the [[Halloween]] season, in [[haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attractions]], theme parks, and in the [[role-playing game]] industry.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1996\u20131998)===\n[[Composer]]/[[filmmaker]] Edward Douglas formed Midnight Syndicate in 1996 shortly after releasing a [[low-budget film|micro-budget]], [[direct-to-video]] horror film called ''The Dead Matter (1996)''<ref>[http://www.fearnet.com/news/b13590_Musical_Horrors_Incarnate__Midnight_Syndicate_s_THE_DEAD_MATTER.html?intcid=search_articles_midnight-syndicate Interview with Edward Douglas], ''FEARnet'', October 2008.</ref> which he directed and scored and would later remake.<ref>Michael Gingold, \"The Dead Matter: From Midnight music to a movie\", ''[[Fangoria Magazine]]'' (New York, NY), August, 2010, Pg.6.</ref>  Midnight Syndicate's self-titled debut album was released the following year.<ref>[http://cocatalog.loc.gov US Copyright office] ''Midnight Syndicate'' album \u00a9 date 1997-09-17</ref>  A majority of music on the album was written, arranged, and performed by Edward Douglas. Contributors included Scott Angus, Mark Rakocy, Dennis Carleton, Jamie Barbour, Ray Portler, the rap act Dark Side, and [[Christopher Robichaud]].  Douglas coined the term ''cine-fusion'' to describe the album. ''Cine-fusion'' is described in the album's liner notes as\n:\"a blending of [[film score|movie soundtrack music]] and [[pop music]]&nbsp;... a compilation of soundtracks to movies that do not exist.  The goal of the music is to stimulate the imaginations of listeners so that they are able to transport themselves to worlds or movies of their own creation.\"\nMusically, the album contained an eclectic blend of styles including everything from dark instrumental music (of which three tracks appeared on future releases), [[Rock music|rock]],<ref name=\"music extreme\">[http://www.musicextreme.com/midnight.htm Interview with Gavin Goszka], Federico Marongiu, \"Midnight Syndicate\", ''Music Extreme'' (Argentina), 2001.</ref> [[Rock-a-Billy|rock-a-billy]], [[techno music|techno]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[New-age music|new-age]], [[Black comedy#Musicians|humor-pop]], [[jazz]], and [[Space music|space]].

Douglas and Goszka wrote and performed the music on the album while Vargo served as [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] and [[creative director]] of the project, as well as writing and performing the vocals and narrations, and designing the cover art and packaging. The album and songs were also titled after several of Vargo's most popular paintings. ''[[Born of the Night]]'' was independently released in September 1998 through Vargo's Monolith Graphics and Douglas' Entity Productions, hitting the horror market just in time for the Halloween season. It was Midnight Syndicate's first critically acclaimed gothic-horror soundtrack and proved to be an instant success,<ref>John Soeder, \"Gothic Horror Rock Featured This Weekend\", ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' (Cleveland, OH), March 2, 2000.</ref> establishing Midnight Syndicate's trademark sound.\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Realm of Shadows]]'' followed suit with the same flavor of dark instrumental music and another gothic setting. Douglas and Goszka wrote all of the music for this album while Vargo wrote and performed the opening narration and theme story. Again, the songs were titled after Vargo's artworks. Both albums were featured as official soundtracks for Universal Studios' ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', and used in several other major theme parks during Halloween, such as [[Busch Gardens]], [[Cedar Point]] and [[Thorpe Park|Thorpe Park's]] ''Fright Nights'' event.<ref name=scene99>Jeff Niesel, \"Soundbites\", ''[http://www.clevescene.com/issues/1999-10-14/music/soundbites.html Scene Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050117183008/http://clevescene.com/issues/1999-10-14/music/soundbites.html |date=2005-01-17 }}'' (Cleveland, OH), October 14, 1999.</ref> The heavy metal band [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] also featured tracks from ''[[Born of the Night]]'' as opening music for their 2000 US tour.

This time Douglas and Goszka teamed up with two members who worked on the first ''[[Midnight Syndicate (album)|Midnight Syndicate]]'' CD, Mark Rakocy (graphic design) and Christopher Robichaud (vocals).   Set in a Victorian haunted [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental institution]] called Haverghast Asylum, ''[[Gates of Delirium]]'' was the first Midnight Syndicate disc to feature the fictitious Haverghast family,<ref name=\"music extreme\" /> a theme the band would revisit on future discs such as ''[[The 13th Hour]]''.

''[[Born of the Night]]'' was independently released in September 1998 through Vargo's Monolith Graphics and Douglas' Entity Productions, hitting the horror market just in time for the Halloween season.
