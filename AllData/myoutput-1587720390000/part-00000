It is commonly considered a [[flagship species]] within its range, with the efforts going into its conservation having positive effects on many other species that share its habitat. Recent genetic research suggests it is closely related to the [[wattlebird]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst described by the English naturalist [[George Shaw]] in 1794, the regent honeyeater was moved to ''[[Anthochaera]]'' in 1827 by the naturalists [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]].{{sfn|Vigors|Horsfield|1827|pp=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/778569 320-321]}} It was known as ''Xanthomyza phrygia'' for many years, the genus erected by [[William John Swainson]] in 1837. DNA analysis shows that its ancestry is in fact nested within the wattlebird genus ''[[Anthochaera]]''. The ancestor of the regent honeyeater split from a lineage that gave rise to the [[red wattlebird|red]] and [[yellow wattlebird]]s. The little and western wattlebirds arose from another lineage that diverged earlier.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Driskell, Amy C.|author2=Christidis, Les|author2-link=Leslie Christidis|year=2004|title=Phylogeny and Evolution of the Australo-Papuan Honeyeaters (Passeriformes, Meliphagidae)|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|pmid=15120392|volume=31|issue=3|pages=943\u201360|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.017}}</ref>\nThe generic name ''Anthochaera'' derives from the Ancient Greek ''anthos'' 'flower, bloom' and ''khair\u014d'' 'enjoy'; the specific epithet ''phrygia'' derives from Latin ''phrygius'', referring to the people of [[Phrygia]] who were skilled in embroidery with gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling|title=Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird-names|last=Jobling|first=James A.|year=2010|accessdate = 2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe neck and head are glossy black.
