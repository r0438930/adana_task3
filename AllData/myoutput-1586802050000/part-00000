Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world.

The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. \"[[Music history]]\" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.\n\n==Eras of music==\n{{Music eras}}\n\n===Prehistoric music===\n{{Main|Prehistoric music}}\nPrehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.\n\nPrehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]]. However, it is more common to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music of non-European continents \u2013 especially that which still survives \u2013 as [[Folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]]. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]].

[[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas, describes music at length.\n\n[[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.\n\nThe history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500\u2013644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226\u2013651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.\n\nThe [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].\n\n'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}\nGreek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.  Instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked [[string instrument]], the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.\n\n===Biblical period===\n{{main|History of music in the biblical period}}\n[[Image:David-harp.jpg|thumb|<center>\"David with his harp\" [[Paris Psalter]],<br> c. 960, [[Constantinople]]</center>]]\nAccording to [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1\u20136). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4\u20136; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).<ref>''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', \"Music\", 1897</ref>\n\nMusic and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called [[litany]],\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"<ref name=JRT>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html \"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.</ref>\n\n:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the \"father of all such as handle the harp and pipe\", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. \"One finds in the biblical text\", writes Alfred Sendrey, \"a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class\u2014which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].<ref name=JRT/>\n\n===Early music===\n{{Main|Early music}}\nEarly music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.\nyou can shove it\n\n==Western art music==\n{{History of Western art music}}\n\n{{Main|Western art music}}\n\n===Medieval music===\n{{Main|Medieval music}}\nWhile musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].\n\nDuring the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.\n\nSeveral schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[L\u00e9onin]] and [[P\u00e9rotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouv\u00e8re]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnes\u00e4nger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.\n\nForms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].\n\n===Renaissance music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Renaissance music}}\n[[Image:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]\n\nThe beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].\n\nThe invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.\n\nMost parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesur\u00e9e]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.\n\nOne of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.\n\nMusic prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].\n\n===Baroque music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Baroque music}}\n[[File:Bernardo Strozzi - Claudio Monteverdi (c.1630).jpg|thumb|220px|Portrait of Italian composer [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in [[Venice]], by [[Bernardo Strozzi]], c. 1630]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}<!--But not in the Renaissance?

Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].\n\n===Classical music era===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Classical period (music)}}\nThe music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).\n\n[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]\nAlong with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.\n\n===Romantic music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Romantic music}}\n[[Image:Siegfried - Heinrich Gudehus.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The title character from a 19th-century performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]\nIn the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&nbsp;\u2013 and often much longer&nbsp;\u2013 musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9|Faur\u00e9]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[C\u00e9sar Franck|Franck]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].\n\n===20th and 21st-century music===\n{{Main|20th-century music}}\n[[File:'Free Concerts' Radio Dealer poster (1922).jpg|thumb|The radio transformed listening habits after 1920]]\nMusic of all kinds also became increasingly portable.

Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.\n\nPrehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]].

The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]].

It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.\n\nThe history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500\u2013644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226\u2013651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.\n\nThe [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].\n\n'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}\nGreek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]].

The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1\u20136). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4\u20136; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).<ref>''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', \"Music\", 1897</ref>\n\nMusic and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called [[litany]],\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"<ref name=JRT>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html \"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.</ref>\n\n:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the \"father of all such as handle the harp and pipe\", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. \"One finds in the biblical text\", writes Alfred Sendrey, \"a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class\u2014which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].<ref name=JRT/>\n\n===Early music===\n{{Main|Early music}}\nEarly music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.\n\n==Western art music==\n{{History of Western art music}}\n\n{{Main|Western art music}}\n\n===Medieval music===\n{{Main|Medieval music}}\nWhile musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].\n\nDuring the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.\n\nSeveral schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[L\u00e9onin]] and [[P\u00e9rotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouv\u00e8re]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnes\u00e4nger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.\n\nForms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].\n\n===Renaissance music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Renaissance music}}\n[[Image:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]\n\nThe beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].\n\nThe invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.\n\nMost parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesur\u00e9e]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.\n\nOne of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.\n\nMusic prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].\n\n===Baroque music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Baroque music}}\n[[File:Bernardo Strozzi - Claudio Monteverdi (c.1630).jpg|thumb|220px|Portrait of Italian composer [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in [[Venice]], by [[Bernardo Strozzi]], c. 1630]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}<!--But not in the Renaissance? Or what?--> German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.<ref name=\"sdsu\">{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].\n\n===Classical music era===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Classical period (music)}}\nThe music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).\n\n[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]\nAlong with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.\n\n===Romantic music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Romantic music}}\n[[Image:Siegfried - Heinrich Gudehus.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The title character from a 19th-century performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]\nIn the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&nbsp;\u2013 and often much longer&nbsp;\u2013 musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9|Faur\u00e9]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[C\u00e9sar Franck|Franck]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].\n\n===20th and 21st-century music===\n{{Main|20th-century music}}\n[[File:'Free Concerts' Radio Dealer poster (1922).jpg|thumb|The radio transformed listening habits after 1920]]\nMusic of all kinds also became increasingly portable.
