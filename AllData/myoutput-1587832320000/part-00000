{"title_page": "William Anderson (Scottish writer)", "text_new": "{{for|other people of a similar name|William Anderson (disambiguation){{!}}William Anderson}}\n'''William Anderson''' (1805\u20131866) was a Scottish miscellaneous writer.\n\n==Biography==\nAnderson was born in Edinburgh 10 December 1805. His father was supervisor of excise at [[Oban]], and his mother the daughter of John Williams, author of the \u2018Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom.\u2019 He was thus a younger brother of [[John Anderson (genealogist, 1789-1832)]], the historian of the house of Hamilton. After receiving a good education in Edinburgh he became clerk to a [[Leith]] merchant, but subsequently entered a lawyer's office in Edinburgh. At an early period he began to contribute to the newspapers, and in 1830 published a volume of verse, entitled \u2018Poetical Aspirations,\u2019 which reached a second edition in 1833. This was followed by a volume of prose and verse, entitled \u2018Odd Sketches.\u2019 After a short residence in London in 1831 he obtained a situation on the \u2018Aberdeen Journal.\u2019\n\nIn 1836 he returned to London, where he formed a rather extensive literary connection, and in 1839 brought out the \u2018Gift of all Nations,\u2019 an annual which numbered among its contributors [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], [[Sheridan Knowles]], the [[Countess of Blessington]], and [[Miss Pardoe]]. In the same year he also published \u2018Landscape Lyrics,\u2019 which reached a second edition in 1854. In 1842 he became editor of the \u2018Western Watchman,\u2019 a weekly newspaper published at [[Ayr]]; in 1844 he was chosen subeditor of the \u2018[[Edinburgh Witness]],\u2019 which, although the articles of [[Hugh Miller]] had secured it a wide circulation, had hitherto been subedited in a very perfunctory manner; and in 1845 he became the chief subeditor of the \u2018[[Glasgow Daily Mail]],\u2019 the first daily newspaper published in Scotland.\n\nOn account of the serious effects on his health of severe night labour, he was two years afterwards compelled for a time to abandon literary work, and he never formed any subsequent connection with a newspaper. With the exception of a volume of \u2018Poems\u2019 published in 1845, and the \u2018Young Voyager,\u2019 1855, a poem descriptive of the search after Sir John Franklin, and intended for juvenile readers, the remaining works of Anderson are of the nature chiefly of popular compilations. They include an edition of the \u2018Works of Lord Byron,\u2019 with a life and notes, 1850; the \u2018Poems and Songs of R. Gilfillan,\u2019 with a memoir, 1851; and a \u2018Treasury\u2019 series, embracing the \u2018Treasury of Discovery,\u2019 1853; of the \u2018Animal World,\u2019 1854; of \u2018Manners,\u2019 1855; of \u2018History,\u2019 1856; and of \u2018Nature,\u2019 1857. Of a somewhat higher character than these compilations are the \u2018Scottish Nation,\u2019 1859\u201363, an expansion of his \u2018Popular Scottish Biography\u2019 published in 1842; and \u2018Genealogy and Surnames,\u2019 1865. The \u2018Scottish Nation,\u2019 though diffuse and ill arranged, displays great industry and a minute acquaintance with Scottish family history; while \u2018Genealogy and Surnames,\u2019 amid much that is commonplace, contains some curious information not easily accessible elsewhere.\n\nHe died suddenly at London 2 August 1866.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Anderson, William (1805-1866)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, William}}\n[[Category:1805 births]]\n[[Category:1866 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish people]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish writers]]\n[[Category:Writers from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish poets]]\n[[Category:Scottish journalists]]\n[[Category:Scottish historians]]\n[[Category:19th-century British journalists]]\n[[Category:British male journalists]]\n[[Category:Male poets]]\n[[Category:19th-century British male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|other people of a similar name|William Anderson (disambiguation){{!}}William Anderson}}\n'''William Anderson''' (1805\u20131866) was a Scottish miscellaneous writer.\n\n==Biography==\nAnderson was born in Edinburgh 10 December 1805.
