The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.\" In the same ''Huffington Post'' article, it was reported that following a $7,025 payment from the campaign of [[Paul Ryan]] primary election challenger [[Paul Nehlen]], Hardaway and Richardson made a campaign video and endorsed Nehlen.<ref name=\"huffpo congress\" />\n\n=== Diamond and Silk Act of 2019 ===\nIn June 2019, House Representative [[Steve King]] joined with Diamond and Silk to introduce the Diamond and Silk Act, an anti\u2013[[sanctuary city]] bill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/448489-steve-king-unveils-diamond-and-silk-act-named-for-conservative-youtubers|title=Steve King unveils 'Diamond and Silk Act' named for conservative YouTubers|last=Frazin|first=Rachel|date=2019-06-13|website=TheHill|language=en|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-king-introduces-diamond-and-silk-act-press-conference-2019-6|title=Disgraced Rep.
