R. R. Tolkien]], but set in the Second Age of [[Middle-earth]] before the main narrative of the book and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|films]]. It was developed by JD Payne and Patrick McKay for the streaming service [[Prime Video]]. The series is produced by [[Amazon Studios]] in cooperation with the [[Tolkien Estate]] and [[The Tolkien Trust|Trust]], [[HarperCollins]], and [[New Line Cinema]], with Payne and McKay serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\n[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] closed a deal in November 2017 to buy the television right for ''The Lord of the Rings'' for $250 million, making a five season production commitment worth at least $1 billion. This would make it the most expensive television series ever. Payne and McKay were hired to develop the series in July 2018, with the rest of the series' creative team confirmed a year later. Casting took place around the world, with [[Robert Aramayo]] leading a large cast of series regulars. Filming began in February 2020 in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], after negotiations between Amazon and the New Zealand government ensured the series could be produced in the country where the film trilogy had been made. Production on the series was placed on hold in March due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'' is expected to premiere on Prime Video in 2021. A second season was formally ordered in November 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Premise ==\nSet in the early Second Age of [[Middle-earth]],<ref name=\"SecondAge\" /> the series tells new stories before the events of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> While the details of the premise are not known, the map released by Amazon sets the show before the sack of Eregion, which would place it at the time of the [[Rings of Power#Fictional history|forging of the great Rings]] (as shown in the opening two minutes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'') or earlier. \n\n=== Storyline ===\nPrior to the reveal of the map, Amazon quoted the Ring-verse for publicity, which contributes to the timeframe being set in the time of the forging of the Rings. According to Tolkien's chronology of ''The Lord of the Rings'', around this time in the story, Sauron (the villain of the live-action film) takes a fair guise and eventually convinces the Elves of Eregion to forge Rings of Power, much against the advice of the other Elf-Lords, Galadriel and Gil-Galad. Sauron then takes control over the other rings by forging The One Ring, revealing his true intentions.\n\nAs stated by Tom Shippey, Sauron then \"invades Eriador\", destroying Eregion, before being \"forced back by a N\u00famenorean expedition.\"<ref name=\"ShippeyJul2019\" /> As he points out, the map includes the island kingdom of Numenore (as well as the southern lands of Harad) and the show could explore concurrent events in those realms, which could include drama, portrayal of decadence and forced occupation by the Numenoreans, and the encroachment of Sauron upon Harad. The casting of non-Caucasian actors and the prominence of coasts in the location scouting and of wet-sets in the studio filming,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://redanianintelligence.com/2020/02/08/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-enters-production-in-new-zealand|title=Amazon\u2019s Lord of the Rings enters production in New Zealand|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> seem to contribute to this. \n\nShippey explains that following these events, the Numenoreans capture Sauron, who then \"corrupts the N\u00famenoreans and seduces them to break the ban of the Valar\", resulting in the deluge of the island, whose refugees go on to form the kingdom of Gondor and defeat Sauron in the Battle of the Last Alliance. Its possible that these events would be explored in the spinoff show that Amazon had optioned. \n\n== Cast and characters ==\n* [[Robert Aramayo]] as \"Beldor\"<ref name=\"Aramayo\" />\n* [[Owain Arthur]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Nazanin Boniadi]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Tom Budge]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Morfydd Clark]], reportedly as [[Galadriel]]<ref name=\"Clark\" />\n* [[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* Ema Horvath<ref name=\"Horvath\" />\n* [[Markella Kavenagh]] as \"Tyra\"<ref name=\"KavenaghVariety\" />\n* [[Joseph Mawle]] as \"Oren\"<ref name=\"Mawle\" />\n* Tyroe Muhafidin<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* Sophia Nomvete<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* Megan Richards<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Dylan Smith (Canadian actor)|Dylan Smith]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* Charlie Vickers<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Daniel Weyman]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Maxim Baldry]]<ref name=\"Baldry\" />\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Episode table |background=#90AEBC |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           =\n |DirectedBy      = [[J.

In 1964, following the launch of [[BBC Two|BBC2]], Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1972, [[Bo Hansson|Bo Hanson]] adapted ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' to a short made for Swedish TV called [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'']], which featured live actors agains animated backgrounds.\n\nAnother attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref> The deal with United Artists gave them first bidding rights for the TV rights, but being that they were unsuccessfull at launching a film adaptation, that right remained unused.\n\nIn 1972, Rankin and Bass exploited a mishap in the publication of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' which made them public domain in the US, to create animated TV specials off of Tolkien's books. They decided an adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was impossible, but went forward with ''The Hobbit'' and optioned the closing chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a potential sequel called ''Frodo: The Hobbit II''. Tolkien's Estate and Saul Zaentz (who was developing an [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|animated ''Lord of the Rings'' feature]] for United Artists) sued them in an attempt to stop their special from airing, but it ended up becoming \"authorized through a series of settlement agreements.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2285701/saul-zaentz-company-v-wozniak-travel-inc/|title=SAUL ZAENTZ COMPANY v.

Reaction to the specials, which were animated by [[Topcraft]], were mixed-to-positive, and while [[Romeo Muller]] won a [[Peabody Award]] for his teleplay to ''The Hobbit,'' Arthur Rankin later expressed regret over the quality of its sequel, saying they \"shouldn't have made it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/arthur-rankin-jr|title=The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation Presents: ARTHUR RANKIN, JR.|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Douglas A.

Despite the name it was based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' rather than ''The Hobbit''; but it included only the parts of the story that the hobbits had witnessed themselves (hence the title). This is the only film adaptation which includes Tom Bombadil, the Barrow-wights and the scourging of the Shire. It aired again in 1998, but then the rights to broadcast it were revoked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2015/06/23/taru-sormusten-herrasta-suomenlinnassa|title=Taru sormusten herrasta k\u00e4\u00e4ntyi Suomessa kes\u00e4teatteriksi ja lopulta Ylen tv-sarjaksi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWriter, Producer and Director Peter Jackson started developing a film adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1995, first for Miramax (as at least three<ref name=\":35\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref><ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> films) and then for New Line (as at least five films<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19021.php|title=John Howe interview|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>).

R. R. Tolkien]] upon whose books those films were based. With the two sides \"on better terms\" following the settlement, they began shopping a potential television series based on Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' books to several outlets, including [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Netflix]], and [[HBO]].<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> By September, Amazon had emerged as the frontrunner and entered negotiations for the series.<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /><ref name=\"Nov2017Negotiations\" /> In an uncommon move for programming developments at the studio, Amazon CEO [[Jeff Bezos]] was personally involved with the negotiations;<ref name=\"Nov2017Negotiations\" /> Bezos had previously given [[Amazon Studios]] a mandate to develop a fantasy series of comparable scale to HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', which had made the company the lead contender for the project.<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" />\n\nOn November 13, 2017, Amazon closed a deal to acquire the global television rights for the books. The rights cost close to $250 million, before any development or production costs. Industry commentators described this amount as \"insane\", especially since Amazon agreed to pay for the rights without any creative talent being attached to the project.<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> As part of the deal, Amazon's streaming service [[Prime Video]] gave a multi-season commitment to the series that was believed to be for five seasons, with the possibility of creating a spin-off series as well. The series' budget was expected to be in the range of $100 million to $150 million per season, and was likely to eventually exceed $1 billion which would make it the most expensive television series ever.<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /><ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> Amazon Studios wanted to produce the series themselves, so [[Warner Bros. Television]] would not be involved in the project, with Amazon instead working with the [[Tolkien Estate]] and [[The Tolkien Trust|Trust]], [[HarperCollins]], and [[New Line Cinema]].<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> New Line, the Warner Bros. division who produced the films, was included in the deal due to the potential for the series to use material from the films.<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /> The series is a prequel to the event of ''The Lord of the Rings'' described as \"previously unexplored stories\" based on Tolkien's works, with some creative restrictions imposed on the series by the Tolkien Estate.<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> The deal stipulated that production on the series begin within two years.<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" />\n\n==== Creative team ====\nBy April 2018, ''Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' film director [[Peter Jackson]] had begun discussing his potential involvement in the series with Amazon,<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /> but in June he was confirmed to not be involved in the series.<ref name=\"JacksonJun2018\" /> Later that month, Head of Amazon Studios Jennifer Salke said discussions with Jackson were ongoing as to how much involvement he would have in the series. She added that the deal for the series had only been officially closed around a month earlier, and the studio had been meeting with many different writers about the project. They intended to have a game plan for the series and a writing team set \"very soon\", with the hope that the series could debut in 2021.<ref name=\"SalkeJun2018\" /> Amazon hired writers JD Payne and Patrick McKay to develop the series in July.<ref name=\"PayneMcKay\" /> That December, Jackson stated that he and his producing partners were potentially going to read scripts and look over the designs for the series and offer notes to the writers, but otherwise would not be involved in the project. He stated, \"I wish them all the best and if we can help them we certainly will try\".<ref name=\"JacksonDec2018\" />\n\n[[Bryan Cogman]] joined the series as a consultant in May 2019 after signing an overall deal with Amazon. Cogman previously served as a writer on ''Game of Thrones'', and was set to work alongside Payne and McKay in developing the new series.<ref name=\"Cogman\" /> In July, [[J. A. Bayona]] was hired to direct the first two episodes of the series and serve as executive producer alongside his producing partner Bel\u00e9n Atienza.<ref name=\"Bayona\" /> Later that month, ''Game of Thrones'' creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]] were in discussions with several outlets regarding signing an overall deal, including with Amazon who were interested in having the pair consult on ''The Lord of the Rings'';<ref name=\"BenioffWeissAmazon\" /> they ultimately signed a deal with Netflix instead.<ref name=\"BenioffWeissNetflix\" /> At the end of July, Amazon announced that Payne and McKay would serve as [[showrunner]]s and executive producers for the series, and revealed the full creative team that was working on the project: executive producers Bayona, Atienza, Bruce Richmond, Gene Kelly, Lindsey Weber, and Sharon Tal Yguado; co-producer Ron Ames; costume designer Kate Hawley; production designer [[Rick Heinrichs]]; visual effects supervisor [[Jason Smith (visual effects)|Jason Smith]]; and illustrator/concept artist [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]], who was one of the chief conceptual designers on the films.<ref name=\"CreativeTeamVideo\" /><ref name=\"CreativeTeamDeadline\" /> Additionally, Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] was revealed to be working on the series,<ref name=\"CreativeTeamDeadline\" /> though he was believed to no longer be involved in the project by April 2020.<ref name=\"NoShippey\" /> Whther his supposed lack of further involvement is due to the COVID-19 related shutdown or the writing process of the series is unknown.\n\n==== Production locations ====\nWhen asked in June 2018 whether the series would be filmed in [[New Zealand]], where the films were produced, Salke said that was a possibility but added that Amazon was willing to film in other countries as long as they could \"provide those locations in a really authentic way, because we want it to look incredible\".<ref name=\"SalkeJun2018Deadline\" /> That December, Amazon held a \"crisis meeting\" with [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]], New Zealand's [[Minister of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Minister of Economic Development]], after the studio threatened to take the production to another country due to the lack of available studio space in [[Auckland]].<ref name=\"NZCrisisMeetingDec2018\" /> During the meeting, Parker told Amazon they were welcome in New Zealand and the country's government wanted them to make the series there, but he did not propose any special deal to have the series made in New Zealand because \"you don't want these things at any cost; you want them on terms that are good for New Zealand and those are the things that are being thrashed out\". New Zealand's Major Screen Production Grant, which provides up to a 25 per cent refund in tax for international productions, was offered to Amazon for the series.<ref name=\"NZCrisisMeetingDetails\" /> Amazon reportedly considered [[Scotland]] as an alternative filming location, with location scouting taking place there in late 2018.<ref name=\"ScotlandScouting\" />\n\nFilming was informally confirmed to take place in New Zealand at the end of June, with leases taking effect at Kumeu Film Studios and Auckland Film Studios in July. Auckland was chosen as the primary filming location in the country because the studios that were used to produce the films in [[Wellington]] were in use by the ''[[Avatar (franchise)|Avatar]]'' films at the time that production of the series was set to begin. Pre-production on the series was underway in Auckland for almost a year before this confirmation.<ref name=\"NZFilmingJun2019\" /> Amazon's decision to film in New Zealand was reportedly influenced by the New Zealand government's reassurances that the country was safe to film in following the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] in March, as well as the potential effects of [[Brexit]] in Scotland. With the production primarily based in Auckland, additional filming was still expected to take place in Scotland as well as in other locations around New Zealand such as [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].<ref name=\"NZFilmingJul2019\" /> Amazon officially announced that the series would be filmed in New Zealand in September 2019, after completing negotiations with the New Zealand Government and the [[New Zealand Film Commission]], as well as Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED). Filming was set to begin on the series in \"the coming months\", with some locations still being discussed according to ATEED. Payne and McKay explained that in choosing the series' primary location, they and the production team had needed \"somewhere majestic, with pristine coasts, forests, and mountains\" that could also meet the production requirements of the series.<ref name=\"NZFilmingSep2019\" />\n\n==== Seasons ====\nPrime Video gave the series a multi-season commitment, believed to be for five seasons, as part of the initial deal with the Tolkien Estate,<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /><ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> though the streaming service still had to give a formal greenlight to future seasons before work could begin on them.<ref name=\"Season2\" /> In July 2019, Shippey stated that the first season of the series was supposed to consist of 20 episodes.<ref name=\"ShippeyJul2019\" /> In November, Amazon officially ordered a second season of the series, and scheduled a longer-than-usual four or five month production break after completion of filming on the first two episodes. This was to allow all the footage for the first episodes to be reviewed, and so the series' writers room could be reconvened to begin work on the second season before filming on the first season continued. This gave the series the option to film the first two seasons [[Back-to-back film production|back-to-back]] as the ''Lord of the Rings'' films had been.<ref name=\"Season2\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nA writers room for the series had begun work in [[Santa Monica]] by mid-February 2019. Salke described extensive security measures that were being taken to keep details of this writing secret, including windows being taped closed and a security guard requiring fingerprint clearance from those entering the room.<ref name=\"SalkeFeb2019\" /> In addition to Payne and McKay, writers on the series include [[Gennifer Hutchison]], Helen Shang, [[Jason Cahill]], Justin Doble, Bryan Cogman, and [[Stephany Folsom]], with Glenise Mullins acting as a consulting writer.<ref name=\"CreativeTeamVideo\" /><ref name=\"CreativeTeamDeadline\" /> The writers room was set to be disbanded once production on the series began, but would be reconvened during the four or five month break in filming that was scheduled following production on the first two episodes. The writers were expected to map out the second season and write the majority of its scripts during this production break.<ref name=\"Season2\" />\n\nAt the start of March 2019, Amazon revealed that the series would be set in the Second Age of [[Middle-earth]], thousands of years before the story of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"SecondAge\" /> Shippey explained that the series was not allowed to contradict anything that Tolkien had written about the Second Age and would have to follow the broad strokes of his narrative, with the Tolkien Estate prepared to veto any such changes, but Amazon was free to add any characters or details to fill in the gaps between Tolkien's works. The series is also only allowed to adapt and reference content from the ''Lord of the Rings'' books and their extensive appendices rather than any of Tolkien's other books that explore the Second Age such as ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The Tolkien Estate retained the rights to the events of the First Age while [[Middle-earth Enterprises]] held the rights to the events of the Third Age (as seen in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' films), so the series was also not allowed to explore those. Shippey felt this left the series with \"a lot of scope for interpretation and free invention\".<ref name=\"ShippeyJul2019\" />\n\nThe series is most likely going to be in continuity with the live-action films. Peter Jackson, who (by his own admission and that of Jennifer Salke) has been contacted by the showrunners, has stated that the showrunners \"want to try to have a series and a world where it sort of fits with the films; they want to keep the designs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/12/06/peter-jackson-philippa-boyens-talk-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-series/|title=Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens Talk Amazon's 'Lord of the Rings' Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> John Howe, who worked on the live-action films as a conceptual designer, has reprised his role for the series and commented that the showrunners \"are determined to remain faithful to the existing trilogies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narniafans.com/2019/08/interview-with-narnia-conceptual-designer-john-howe/|title=Narnia Fans: John Howe interview|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and has reportedly repeated this notion in an exhibit at Shanghai, saying \"its a continuation\" and \"part of the same universe.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?post=965055;guest=238830674#964906|title=Short interview|last=|first=|date=|website=TheOneRing.net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Howe also anticipated the return to New Zealand for a filming location, and designed the map for the show, which is similar in aesthetic and in some topographic elements (namely, the unusual proximity of the Mountains of the East to the westlands) to the maps used for the films. Reports that [[Morfydd Clark]] will be playing Galadriel, given her resemblence of [[Cate Blanchett]], also support this.\n\n=== Casting ===\nSalke stated in June 2018 that though the series would not be a remake of the films, it would include some characters from the films.<ref name=\"SalkeJun2018Deadline\" /> By July 2019, casting for the series was taking place around the world, with casting directors working in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.<ref name=\"KavenaghDeadline\" /> Casting for extras began in New Zealand at that time.<ref name=\"NZCastingBegins\" /> Some of the cast have been reportedly attached with character names, although those might only be tentative or placeholder names for their actual characters. [[Markella Kavenagh]] was in talks to portray the character \"Tyra\" in the series at the end of July;<ref name=\"KavenaghVariety\" /> this was expected to be a series regular role.<ref name=\"KavenaghDeadline\" /> [[Will Poulter]] was cast as \"Beldor\", one of the series' leads, in September.<ref name=\"PoulterDeadline\" /><ref name=\"PoulterVariety\" /> The role was \"one of the more coveted jobs\" for young actors in Hollywood before Poulter's casting.<ref name=\"PoulterVariety\" /> [[Maxim Baldry]] was cast in a \"significant role\" in mid-October,<ref name=\"BaldryCollider\" /> with [[Joseph Mawle]] cast, reportedly as the series' lead villain, \"Oren\", later in the month.<ref name=\"Mawle\" /> In December, Ema Horvath was cast in another series regular role;<ref name=\"Horvath\" /> Poulter left the series due to scheduling conflicts;<ref name=\"NoPoulter\" /> and [[Morfydd Clark]] was cast, reportedly as a young [[Galadriel]], the character who was portrayed in the films by [[Cate Blanchett]].<ref name=\"Clark\" />\n\n[[Robert Aramayo]] was cast in the lead role for the series, replacing Poulter as Beldor, in early January 2020.<ref name=\"Aramayo\" /> A week later, Amazon officially announced that the series' main cast would include Aramayo, [[Owain Arthur]], [[Nazanin Boniadi]], [[Tom Budge]], Clark, [[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]], Horvath, Kavenagh, Mawle, Tyroe Muhafidin, Sophia Nomvete, Megan Richards, [[Dylan Smith (Canadian actor)|Dylan Smith]], Charlie Vickers, and [[Daniel Weyman]]. Amazon's co-head of television Vernon Sanders noted that there were still some key roles that had yet to be filled.<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" /> One of these key roles was confirmed to go to Baldry in March when his deal for the series was completed, after he had been informally attached to the series in October 2019.<ref name=\"Baldry\" /><ref name=\"BaldryCollider\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nTable reads with the cast in New Zealand had begun by mid-January 2020,<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" /> ahead of the start of filming in early February.<ref name=\"FilmingStarted\" /> Production began in Auckland primarily at Kumeu Film Studios and Auckland Film Studios,<ref name=\"NZFilmingJun2019\" /> with J.

R. R. Tolkien]], but set in the Second Age of [[Middle-earth]] before the main narrative of the book and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|films]]. It was developed by JD Payne and Patrick McKay for the streaming service [[Prime Video]]. The series is produced by [[Amazon Studios]] in cooperation with the [[Tolkien Estate]] and [[The Tolkien Trust|Trust]], [[HarperCollins]], and [[New Line Cinema]], with Payne and McKay serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\n[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] closed a deal in November 2017 to buy the television right for ''The Lord of the Rings'' for $250 million, making a five season production commitment worth at least $1 billion. This would make it the most expensive television series ever. Payne and McKay were hired to develop the series in July 2018, with the rest of the series' creative team confirmed a year later. Casting took place around the world, with [[Robert Aramayo]] leading a large cast of series regulars. Filming began in February 2020 in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], after negotiations between Amazon and the New Zealand government ensured the series could be produced in the country where the film trilogy had been made. Production on the series was placed on hold in March due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'' is expected to premiere on Prime Video in 2021. A second season was formally ordered in November 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Premise ==\nSet in the early Second Age of [[Middle-earth]],<ref name=\"SecondAge\" /> the series tells new stories before the events of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> While the details of the premise are not known, the map released by Amazon sets the show before the sack of Eregion, which would place it at the time of the [[Rings of Power#Fictional history|forging of the great Rings]] (as shown in the opening two minutes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'') or earlier. \n\n=== Storyline ===\nAccording to Tolkien's chronology of ''The Lord of the Rings'', around this time in the story, Sauron (the villain of the live-action film) takes a fair guise and eventually convinces the Elves of Eregion to forge Rings of Power, much against the advice of the other Elf-Lords, Galadriel and Gil-Galad. Sauron then takes control over the other rings by forging The One Ring, revealing his true intentions. The use of the Ring verse by Amazon prior to the reveal of the final map contributes to this possible timeframe, although the show could also begin earlier down the timeline.\n\nAs stated by Tom Shippey, Sauron then \"invades Eriador\", destroying Eregion, before being \"forced back by a N\u00famenorean expedition.\"<ref name=\"ShippeyJul2019\" /> As he points out, the map includes the island kingdom of Numenore (as well as the southern lands of Harad) and the show could explore concurrent events in those realms, which could include drama, portrayal of decadence and forced occupation by the Numenoreans, and the encroachment of Sauron upon Harad. The casting of non-Caucasian actors and the prominence of coasts in the location scouting and of wet-sets in the studio filming,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://redanianintelligence.com/2020/02/08/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-enters-production-in-new-zealand|title=Amazon\u2019s Lord of the Rings enters production in New Zealand|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> seem to contribute to this. \n\nShippey explains that following these events, the Numenoreans capture Sauron, who then \"corrupts the N\u00famenoreans and seduces them to break the ban of the Valar\", resulting in the deluge of the island, whose refugees go on to form the kingdom of Gondor and defeat Sauron in the Battle of the Last Alliance. Its possible that these events would be explored in the spinoff show that Amazon had optioned. \n\n== Cast and characters ==\n* [[Robert Aramayo]] as \"Beldor\"<ref name=\"Aramayo\" />\n* [[Owain Arthur]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Nazanin Boniadi]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Tom Budge]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Morfydd Clark]], reportedly as [[Galadriel]]<ref name=\"Clark\" />\n* [[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* Ema Horvath<ref name=\"Horvath\" />\n* [[Markella Kavenagh]] as \"Tyra\"<ref name=\"KavenaghVariety\" />\n* [[Joseph Mawle]] as \"Oren\"<ref name=\"Mawle\" />\n* Tyroe Muhafidin<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* Sophia Nomvete<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* Megan Richards<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Dylan Smith (Canadian actor)|Dylan Smith]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* Charlie Vickers<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Daniel Weyman]]<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" />\n* [[Maxim Baldry]]<ref name=\"Baldry\" />\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Episode table |background=#90AEBC |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           =\n |DirectedBy      = [[J.

In 1964, following the launch of [[BBC Two|BBC2]], Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1972, [[Bo Hansson|Bo Hanson]] adapted ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' to a short made for Swedish TV called [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'']], which featured live actors agains animated backgrounds.\n\nAnother attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref> The deal with United Artists gave them first bidding rights for the TV rights, but being that they were unsuccessfull at launching a film adaptation, that right remained unused.\n\nIn 1972, Rankin and Bass exploited a mishap in the publication of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' which made them public domain in the US, to create animated TV specials off of Tolkien's books. They decided an adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was impossible, but went forward with ''The Hobbit'' and optioned the closing chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a potential sequel called ''Frodo: The Hobbit II''. Tolkien's Estate and Saul Zaentz (who was developing an [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|animated ''Lord of the Rings'' feature]] for United Artists) sued them in an attempt to stop their special from airing, but it ended up becoming \"authorized through a series of settlement agreements.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2285701/saul-zaentz-company-v-wozniak-travel-inc/|title=SAUL ZAENTZ COMPANY v.

Despite the name it was based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' rather than ''The Hobbit''; but it included only the parts of the story that the hobbits had witnessed themselves (hence the title). This is the only film adaptation which includes Tom Bombadil, the Barrow-wights and the scourging of the Shire. It aired again in 1998, but then the rights to broadcast it were revoked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2015/06/23/taru-sormusten-herrasta-suomenlinnassa|title=Taru sormusten herrasta k\u00e4\u00e4ntyi Suomessa kes\u00e4teatteriksi ja lopulta Ylen tv-sarjaksi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWriter, Producer and Director Peter Jackson started developing a film adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1995, first for Miramax (as at least three<ref name=\":35\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref><ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> films) and then for New Line (as at least five films<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19021.php|title=John Howe interview|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>). This development period resulted in the highly successful, acclaimed and award-winning ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (2001-2003) and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' trilogies (2012-2014), all written, produced and directed by Jackson, with the final extended cut (edited for TV) released in October 2015.

R. R. Tolkien]] upon whose books those films were based. With the two sides \"on better terms\" following the settlement, they began shopping a potential television series based on Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' books to several outlets, including [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Netflix]], and [[HBO]].<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> By September, Amazon had emerged as the frontrunner and entered negotiations for the series.<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /><ref name=\"Nov2017Negotiations\" /> In an uncommon move for programming developments at the studio, Amazon CEO [[Jeff Bezos]] was personally involved with the negotiations;<ref name=\"Nov2017Negotiations\" /> Bezos had previously given [[Amazon Studios]] a mandate to develop a fantasy series of comparable scale to HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', which had made the company the lead contender for the project.<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" />\n\nOn November 13, 2017, Amazon closed a deal to acquire the global television rights for the books. The rights cost close to $250 million, before any development or production costs. Industry commentators described this amount as \"insane\", especially since Amazon agreed to pay for the rights without any creative talent being attached to the project.<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> As part of the deal, Amazon's streaming service [[Prime Video]] gave a multi-season commitment to the series that was believed to be for five seasons, with the possibility of creating a spin-off series as well. The series' budget was expected to be in the range of $100 million to $150 million per season, and was likely to eventually exceed $1 billion which would make it the most expensive television series ever.<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /><ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> Amazon Studios wanted to produce the series themselves, so [[Warner Bros. Television]] would not be involved in the project, with Amazon instead working with the [[Tolkien Estate]] and [[The Tolkien Trust|Trust]], [[HarperCollins]], and [[New Line Cinema]].<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> New Line, the Warner Bros. division who produced the films, was included in the deal due to the potential for the series to use material from the films.<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /> The series is a prequel to the event of ''The Lord of the Rings'' described as \"previously unexplored stories\" based on Tolkien's works, with some creative restrictions imposed on the series by the Tolkien Estate.<ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> The deal stipulated that production on the series begin within two years.<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" />\n\n==== Creative team ====\nBy April 2018, ''Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' film director [[Peter Jackson]] had begun discussing his potential involvement in the series with Amazon,<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /> but in June he was confirmed to not be involved in the series.<ref name=\"JacksonJun2018\" /> Later that month, Head of Amazon Studios Jennifer Salke said discussions with Jackson were ongoing as to how much involvement he would have in the series. She added that the deal for the series had only been officially closed around a month earlier, and the studio had been meeting with many different writers about the project. They intended to have a game plan for the series and a writing team set \"very soon\", with the hope that the series could debut in 2021.<ref name=\"SalkeJun2018\" /> Amazon hired writers JD Payne and Patrick McKay to develop the series in July.<ref name=\"PayneMcKay\" /> That December, Jackson stated that he and his producing partners were potentially going to read scripts and look over the designs for the series and offer notes to the writers, but otherwise would not be involved in the project. He stated, \"I wish them all the best and if we can help them we certainly will try\".<ref name=\"JacksonDec2018\" />\n\n[[Bryan Cogman]] joined the series as a consultant in May 2019 after signing an overall deal with Amazon. Cogman previously served as a writer on ''Game of Thrones'', and was set to work alongside Payne and McKay in developing the new series.<ref name=\"Cogman\" /> In July, [[J. A. Bayona]] was hired to direct the first two episodes of the series and serve as executive producer alongside his producing partner Bel\u00e9n Atienza.<ref name=\"Bayona\" /> Later that month, ''Game of Thrones'' creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]] were in discussions with several outlets regarding signing an overall deal, including with Amazon who were interested in having the pair consult on ''The Lord of the Rings'';<ref name=\"BenioffWeissAmazon\" /> they ultimately signed a deal with Netflix instead.<ref name=\"BenioffWeissNetflix\" /> At the end of July, Amazon announced that Payne and McKay would serve as [[showrunner]]s and executive producers for the series, and revealed the full creative team that was working on the project: executive producers Bayona, Atienza, Bruce Richmond, Gene Kelly, Lindsey Weber, and Sharon Tal Yguado; co-producer Ron Ames; costume designer Kate Hawley; production designer [[Rick Heinrichs]]; visual effects supervisor [[Jason Smith (visual effects)|Jason Smith]]; and illustrator/concept artist [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]], who was one of the chief conceptual designers on the films.<ref name=\"CreativeTeamVideo\" /><ref name=\"CreativeTeamDeadline\" /> Additionally, Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] was revealed to be working on the series,<ref name=\"CreativeTeamDeadline\" /> though he was believed to no longer be involved in the project by April 2020.<ref name=\"NoShippey\" /> Whther his supposed lack of further involvement is due to the COVID-19 related shutdown or the writing process of the series is unknown.\n\n==== Production locations ====\nWhen asked in June 2018 whether the series would be filmed in [[New Zealand]], where the films were produced, Salke said that was a possibility but added that Amazon was willing to film in other countries as long as they could \"provide those locations in a really authentic way, because we want it to look incredible\".<ref name=\"SalkeJun2018Deadline\" /> That December, Amazon held a \"crisis meeting\" with [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]], New Zealand's [[Minister of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Minister of Economic Development]], after the studio threatened to take the production to another country due to the lack of available studio space in [[Auckland]].<ref name=\"NZCrisisMeetingDec2018\" /> During the meeting, Parker told Amazon they were welcome in New Zealand and the country's government wanted them to make the series there, but he did not propose any special deal to have the series made in New Zealand because \"you don't want these things at any cost; you want them on terms that are good for New Zealand and those are the things that are being thrashed out\". New Zealand's Major Screen Production Grant, which provides up to a 25 per cent refund in tax for international productions, was offered to Amazon for the series.<ref name=\"NZCrisisMeetingDetails\" /> Amazon reportedly considered [[Scotland]] as an alternative filming location, with location scouting taking place there in late 2018.<ref name=\"ScotlandScouting\" />\n\nFilming was informally confirmed to take place in New Zealand at the end of June, with leases taking effect at Kumeu Film Studios and Auckland Film Studios in July. Auckland was chosen as the primary filming location in the country because the studios that were used to produce the films in [[Wellington]] were in use by the ''[[Avatar (franchise)|Avatar]]'' films at the time that production of the series was set to begin. Pre-production on the series was underway in Auckland for almost a year before this confirmation.<ref name=\"NZFilmingJun2019\" /> Amazon's decision to film in New Zealand was reportedly influenced by the New Zealand government's reassurances that the country was safe to film in following the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] in March, as well as the potential effects of [[Brexit]] in Scotland. With the production primarily based in Auckland, additional filming was still expected to take place in Scotland as well as in other locations around New Zealand such as [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].<ref name=\"NZFilmingJul2019\" /> Amazon officially announced that the series would be filmed in New Zealand in September 2019, after completing negotiations with the New Zealand Government and the [[New Zealand Film Commission]], as well as Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED). Filming was set to begin on the series in \"the coming months\", with some locations still being discussed according to ATEED. Payne and McKay explained that in choosing the series' primary location, they and the production team had needed \"somewhere majestic, with pristine coasts, forests, and mountains\" that could also meet the production requirements of the series.<ref name=\"NZFilmingSep2019\" />\n\n==== Seasons ====\nPrime Video gave the series a multi-season commitment, believed to be for five seasons, as part of the initial deal with the Tolkien Estate,<ref name=\"THRInsideDeal\" /><ref name=\"Nov2017Deal\" /> though the streaming service still had to give a formal greenlight to future seasons before work could begin on them.<ref name=\"Season2\" /> In July 2019, Shippey stated that the first season of the series was supposed to consist of 20 episodes.<ref name=\"ShippeyJul2019\" /> In November, Amazon officially ordered a second season of the series, and scheduled a longer-than-usual four or five month production break after completion of filming on the first two episodes. This was to allow all the footage for the first episodes to be reviewed, and so the series' writers room could be reconvened to begin work on the second season before filming on the first season continued. This gave the series the option to film the first two seasons [[Back-to-back film production|back-to-back]] as the ''Lord of the Rings'' films had been.<ref name=\"Season2\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nA writers room for the series had begun work in [[Santa Monica]] by mid-February 2019. Salke described extensive security measures that were being taken to keep details of this writing secret, including windows being taped closed and a security guard requiring fingerprint clearance from those entering the room.<ref name=\"SalkeFeb2019\" /> In addition to Payne and McKay, writers on the series include [[Gennifer Hutchison]], Helen Shang, [[Jason Cahill]], Justin Doble, Bryan Cogman, and [[Stephany Folsom]], with Glenise Mullins acting as a consulting writer.<ref name=\"CreativeTeamVideo\" /><ref name=\"CreativeTeamDeadline\" /> The writers room was set to be disbanded once production on the series began, but would be reconvened during the four or five month break in filming that was scheduled following production on the first two episodes. The writers were expected to map out the second season and write the majority of its scripts during this production break.<ref name=\"Season2\" />\n\nAt the start of March 2019, Amazon revealed that the series would be set in the Second Age of [[Middle-earth]], thousands of years before the story of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"SecondAge\" /> Shippey explained that the series was not allowed to contradict anything that Tolkien had written about the Second Age and would have to follow the broad strokes of his narrative, with the Tolkien Estate prepared to veto any such changes, but Amazon was free to add any characters or details to fill in the gaps between Tolkien's works. The series is also only allowed to adapt and reference content from the ''Lord of the Rings'' books and their extensive appendices rather than any of Tolkien's other books that explore the Second Age such as ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The Tolkien Estate retained the rights to the events of the First Age while [[Middle-earth Enterprises]] held the rights to the events of the Third Age (as seen in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' films), so the series was also not allowed to explore those. Shippey felt this left the series with \"a lot of scope for interpretation and free invention\".<ref name=\"ShippeyJul2019\" />\n\nThe series is most likely going to be in continuity with the live-action films. Peter Jackson, who (by his own admission and that of Jennifer Salke) has been contacted by the showrunners, has stated that the showrunners \"want to try to have a series and a world where it sort of fits with the films; they want to keep the designs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/12/06/peter-jackson-philippa-boyens-talk-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-series/|title=Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens Talk Amazon's 'Lord of the Rings' Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> John Howe, who worked on the live-action films as a conceptual designer, has reprised his role for the series and commented that the showrunners \"are determined to remain faithful to the existing trilogies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narniafans.com/2019/08/interview-with-narnia-conceptual-designer-john-howe/|title=Narnia Fans: John Howe interview|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and has reportedly repeated this notion in an exhibit at Shanghai, saying \"its a continuation\" and \"part of the same universe.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?post=965055;guest=238830674#964906|title=Short interview|last=|first=|date=|website=TheOneRing.net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Howe also anticipated the return to New Zealand for a filming location, and designed the map for the show, which is similar in aesthetic and in some topographic elements (namely, the unusual proximity of the Mountains of the East to the westlands) to the maps used for the films. Reports that [[Morfydd Clark]] will be playing Galadriel, given her resemblence of [[Cate Blanchett]], also support this.\n\n=== Casting ===\nSalke stated in June 2018 that though the series would not be a remake of the films, it would include some characters from the films.<ref name=\"SalkeJun2018Deadline\" /> By July 2019, casting for the series was taking place around the world, with casting directors working in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.<ref name=\"KavenaghDeadline\" /> Casting for extras began in New Zealand at that time.<ref name=\"NZCastingBegins\" /> Some of the cast have been reportedly attached with character names, although those might only be tentative or placeholder names for their actual characters. [[Markella Kavenagh]] was in talks to portray the character \"Tyra\" in the series at the end of July;<ref name=\"KavenaghVariety\" /> this was expected to be a series regular role.<ref name=\"KavenaghDeadline\" /> [[Will Poulter]] was cast as \"Beldor\", one of the series' leads, in September.<ref name=\"PoulterDeadline\" /><ref name=\"PoulterVariety\" /> The role was \"one of the more coveted jobs\" for young actors in Hollywood before Poulter's casting.<ref name=\"PoulterVariety\" /> [[Maxim Baldry]] was cast in a \"significant role\" in mid-October,<ref name=\"BaldryCollider\" /> with [[Joseph Mawle]] cast, reportedly as the series' lead villain, \"Oren\", later in the month.<ref name=\"Mawle\" /> In December, Ema Horvath was cast in another series regular role;<ref name=\"Horvath\" /> Poulter left the series due to scheduling conflicts;<ref name=\"NoPoulter\" /> and [[Morfydd Clark]] was cast, reportedly as a young [[Galadriel]], the character who was portrayed in the films by [[Cate Blanchett]].<ref name=\"Clark\" />\n\n[[Robert Aramayo]] was cast in the lead role for the series, replacing Poulter as Beldor, in early January 2020.<ref name=\"Aramayo\" /> A week later, Amazon officially announced that the series' main cast would include Aramayo, [[Owain Arthur]], [[Nazanin Boniadi]], [[Tom Budge]], Clark, [[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]], Horvath, Kavenagh, Mawle, Tyroe Muhafidin, Sophia Nomvete, Megan Richards, [[Dylan Smith (Canadian actor)|Dylan Smith]], Charlie Vickers, and [[Daniel Weyman]]. Amazon's co-head of television Vernon Sanders noted that there were still some key roles that had yet to be filled.<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" /> One of these key roles was confirmed to go to Baldry in March when his deal for the series was completed, after he had been informally attached to the series in October 2019.<ref name=\"Baldry\" /><ref name=\"BaldryCollider\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nTable reads with the cast in New Zealand had begun by mid-January 2020,<ref name=\"OfficialCast\" /> ahead of the start of filming in early February.<ref name=\"FilmingStarted\" /> Production began in Auckland primarily at Kumeu Film Studios and Auckland Film Studios,<ref name=\"NZFilmingJun2019\" /> with J.
