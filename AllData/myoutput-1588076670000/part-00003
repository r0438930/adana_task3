NO production by eNOS is dependent on [[calcium]]-[[calmodulin]] and other cofactors.\n\n[[Nitric oxide synthase]]s (NOSs) synthesize the metastable free radical nitric oxide (NO). Three [[protein isoform|isoform]]s are known for the NOS enzyme: endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS) - each with separate functions. The neuronal enzyme (NOS-1) and the endothelial isoform (NOS-3) are calcium-dependent and produce low levels of this gas as a cell signaling molecule. The inducible isoform (NOS-2) is calcium-independent and produces large amounts of gas that can be cytotoxic.\n\nNOS oxidizes the guanidine group of L-arginine in a process that consumes five electrons and results in the formation of NO with stoichiometric formation of L-citrulline. The process involves the oxidation of NADPH and the reduction of molecular oxygen. The transformation occurs at a catalytic site adjacent to a specific binding site of L-arginine.<ref>Ignarro L.J.

Overdosage with inhaled nitric oxide will be seen by elevations in [[methemoglobin]] and pulmonary toxicities associated with inspired \u00b7NO. Elevated NO may cause [[acute lung injury]].\n\n=== Contraindications ===\nInhaled nitric oxide is contraindicated in the treatment of neonates known to be dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. This is as the nitric oxide decreases the pulmonary circulation's resistance by dilating pulmonary blood vessels. The increased pulmonary return increases pressure in the left atrium, causing closure of the foramen ovale and reducing the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus. Closing these shunts can kill neonates with heart malformations that rely on the right-to-left shunting of blood.\n\n===Fatty liver disease===\nNitric oxide production is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is essential for hepatic lipid metabolism under starvation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gu|first1=Qilin|last2=Yang|first2=Xiaojie|last3=Lin|first3=Li|last4=Li|first4=Shaoyang|last5=Li|first5=Qing|last6=Zhong|first6=Shan|last7=Peng|first7=Jinrong|last8=Cui|first8=Zongbin|title=Genetic ablation of solute carrier family 7a3a leads to hepatic steatosis in zebrafish during fasting|journal=Hepatology|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=6|pages=1929\u20131941|doi=10.1002/hep.27356|pmid=25130427}}</ref>\n\n=== Pulmonary embolism ===\nNitric oxide is also administered as [[salvage therapy]] in patients with acute [[right ventricular failure]] secondary to [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref name=\"pmid22005573\">{{cite journal| vauthors=Summerfield DT, Desai H, Levitov A, Grooms DA, Marik PE | title=Inhaled Nitric Oxide as Salvage Therapy in Massive Pulmonaryembolism: A Case Series | journal=Respir Care | year= 2011 | volume=  57| issue=  3| pages=  444\u20138| pmid=22005573 | doi=10.4187/respcare.01373 | doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n=== Pharmacology ===\nNitric oxide is considered an [[Antianginal|anti]][[Angina pectoris|anginal]] drug: It causes [[vasodilation]], which can help with ischemic pain, known as angina, by decreasing the cardiac workload.

Nitroglycerin pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The nitroglycerin reacts with a [[thiol|sulfhydryl]] group (\u2013SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing vasodilation.

It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine 3\u2019,5\u2019-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation.

NO production by eNOS is dependent on [[calcium]]-[[calmodulin]] and other cofactors.\n\n[[Nitric oxide synthase]]s (NOSs) synthesize the metastable free radical nitric oxide (NO). Three [[protein isoform|isoform]]s are known for the NOS enzyme: endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS) - each with separate functions. The neuronal enzyme (NOS-1) and the endothelial isoform (NOS-3) are calcium-dependent and produce low levels of this gas as a cell signaling molecule. The inducible isoform (NOS-2) is calcium-independent and produces large amounts of gas that can be cytotoxic.\n\nNOS oxidizes the guanidine group of L-arginine in a process that consumes five electrons and results in the formation of NO with stoichiometric formation of L-citrulline. The process involves the oxidation of NADPH and the reduction of molecular oxygen. The transformation occurs at a catalytic site adjacent to a specific binding site of L-arginine.<ref>Ignarro L.J.

Vascular damage can lead to decreased blood flow to the extremities, causing the diabetic patient to be more likely to develop [[Neuropathy]] and non-healing ulcers, and to be at a greater risk for lower limb [[amputation]].\n\n=== Pediatric and adult use ===\nThe primary use is in the form of [[Nitroglycerin (drug)|nitroglycerin]], either pill or liquid spray forms, which, as a prodrug, is [[Denitration|denitrated]] and releases the active metabolite nitric oxide (NO).\n\nAs with all supplements of nitric oxide, the response is short-lived because, as a normally produced internal physiologic control mechanism, increased concentrations lead to increased rates of clearance, which is the reason that the effectiveness of sustained use of nitroglycerin for vasodilation fades to none after hours to days.\n\nIn the United States, ongoing direct use of nitric oxide use is only approved for [[neonates]]. In the adult ICU setting, inhaled \u00b7NO can improve hypoxemia in [[acute lung injury]], [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], and severe [[pulmonary hypertension]], although the effects are short-lived and there are no studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes.

Overdosage with inhaled nitric oxide will be seen by elevations in [[methemoglobin]] and pulmonary toxicities associated with inspired \u00b7NO. Elevated NO may cause [[acute lung injury]].\n\n=== Contraindications ===\nInhaled nitric oxide is contraindicated in the treatment of neonates known to be dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. This is as the nitric oxide decreases the pulmonary circulation's resistance by dilating pulmonary blood vessels. The increased pulmonary return increases pressure in the left atrium, causing closure of the foramen ovale and reducing the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus. Closing these shunts can kill neonates with heart malformations that rely on the right-to-left shunting of blood.\n\n===Fatty liver disease===\nNitric oxide production is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is essential for hepatic lipid metabolism under starvation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gu|first1=Qilin|last2=Yang|first2=Xiaojie|last3=Lin|first3=Li|last4=Li|first4=Shaoyang|last5=Li|first5=Qing|last6=Zhong|first6=Shan|last7=Peng|first7=Jinrong|last8=Cui|first8=Zongbin|title=Genetic ablation of solute carrier family 7a3a leads to hepatic steatosis in zebrafish during fasting|journal=Hepatology|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=6|pages=1929\u20131941|doi=10.1002/hep.27356|pmid=25130427}}</ref>\n\n=== Pulmonary embolism ===\nNitric oxide is also administered as [[salvage therapy]] in patients with acute [[right ventricular failure]] secondary to [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref name=\"pmid22005573\">{{cite journal| vauthors=Summerfield DT, Desai H, Levitov A, Grooms DA, Marik PE | title=Inhaled Nitric Oxide as Salvage Therapy in Massive Pulmonaryembolism: A Case Series | journal=Respir Care | year= 2011 | volume=  57| issue=  3| pages=  444\u20138| pmid=22005573 | doi=10.4187/respcare.01373 | doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n=== Pharmacology ===\nNitric oxide is considered an [[Antianginal|anti]][[Angina pectoris|anginal]] drug: It causes [[vasodilation]], which can help with ischemic pain, known as angina, by decreasing the cardiac workload.

In contrast, inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to help survival and recovery from [[paraquat]] poisoning, which produces lung tissue-damaging superoxide and hinders NOS metabolism.\n\nThis vasodilation does not decrease the volume of blood the heart pumps, but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood. Nitroglycerin pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The nitroglycerin reacts with a [[thiol|sulfhydryl]] group (\u2013SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing vasodilation.

It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine 3\u2019,5\u2019-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation.
