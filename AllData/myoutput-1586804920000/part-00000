It involves musical, artistic, literary, or spiritual pursuits. In this context, Bohemians may or may not be [[Nomadism|wanderers]], [[adventurer]]s, or [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]].\n\nThis use of the word bohemian first appeared in the English language in the 19th century to describe the non-traditional lifestyles of [[marginalized]] and impoverished artists, writers, journalists, musicians, and actors in major European cities.<ref>First occurrence in this sense in English, 1848 (''[[OED]]'').</ref>\n\nBohemians were associated with unorthodox or [[anti-establishment]] political or social viewpoints, which often were expressed through [[free love]], [[frugality]], and\u2014in some cases\u2014[[simple living]] or [[voluntary poverty]].

''Boh\u00e9mien'' was a common term for the [[Romani people in France|Romani people of France]], who were mistakenly thought to have reached France in the 15th century via [[Bohemia]] (the western part of modern [[Czech Republic]]).<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Bohemian|title=''Bohemian'' etymology |accessdate=2008-12-27|last=Harper |first=Douglas |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\n===European bohemianism===\nLiterary and artistic bohemians were associated in the French imagination with the roving [[Romani people|Romani]] people.

Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> but literary bohemians and the Romani were both outsiders, apart from conventional society and untroubled by its disapproval. Use of the French and English terms  to refer to the Romani is now old-fashioned and archaic, respectively, and both the French and English terms carry a connotation of [[Western esotericism|arcane]] enlightenment (and are considered antonyms of the word [[Philistinism|philistine]]) and the less frequently intended, pejorative connotation of carelessness about personal hygiene and marital fidelity.\n\nThe title character in ''[[Carmen]]'' (1876), a French opera set in the Spanish city of [[Seville]], is referred to as a \"boh\u00e9mienne\" in Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy's libretto. Her [[Habanera (aria)|signature aria]] declares love itself to be a \"gypsy child\" ''(enfant de Boh\u00eame)'', going where it pleases and obeying no laws.\n\n{{quote|The term bohemian has come to be very commonly accepted in our day as the description of a certain kind of literary gypsy, no matter in what language he speaks, or what city he inhabits ....

Public perceptions of the alternative lifestyles supposedly led by artists were further molded by [[George du Maurier]]'s romanticized best-selling novel of Bohemian culture ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' (1894). The novel outlines the fortunes of three [[expatriate]] English artists, their Irish model, and two colourful [[Central Europe]]an musicians, in the artist quarter of Paris.\n\nIn Spanish literature, the Bohemian impulse can be seen in [[Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n]]'s play ''[[Luces de Bohemia]]'', published in 1920.\n\nIn his song [[La Boh\u00e8me (Charles Aznavour song)|La Boh\u00e8me]], [[Charles Aznavour]] described the Bohemian lifestyle in [[Montmartre]].

It involves musical, artistic, literary, or spiritual pursuits. In this context, Bohemians may or may not be [[Nomadism|wanderers]], [[adventurer]]s, or [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]].\n\nThis use of the word bohemian first appeared in the English language in the 19th century to describe the non-traditional lifestyles of [[marginalized]] and impoverished artists, writers, journalists, musicians, and actors in major European cities.<ref>First occurrence in this sense in English, 1848 (''[[OED]]'').</ref>\n\nBohemians were associated with unorthodox or [[anti-establishment]] political or social viewpoints, which often were expressed through [[free love]], [[frugality]], and\u2014in some cases\u2014[[simple living]] or [[voluntary poverty]].

Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> but literary bohemians and the Romani were both outsiders, apart from conventional society and untroubled by its disapproval. Use of the French and English terms  to refer to the Romani is now old-fashioned and archaic, respectively, and both the French and English terms carry a connotation of [[Western esotericism|arcane]] enlightenment (and are considered antonyms of the word [[Philistinism|philistine]]) and the less frequently intended, pejorative connotation of carelessness about personal hygiene and marital fidelity.\n\nThe title character in ''[[Carmen]]'' (1876), a French opera set in the Spanish city of [[Seville]], is referred to as a \"boh\u00e9mienne\" in Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy's libretto.

Public perceptions of the alternative lifestyles supposedly led by artists were further molded by [[George du Maurier]]'s romanticized best-selling novel of Bohemian culture ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' (1894). The novel outlines the fortunes of three [[expatriate]] English artists, their Irish model, and two colourful [[Central Europe]]an musicians, in the artist quarter of Paris.\n\nIn Spanish literature, the Bohemian impulse can be seen in [[Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n]]'s play ''[[Luces de Bohemia]]'', published in 1920.\n\nIn his song [[La Boh\u00e8me (Charles Aznavour song)|La Boh\u00e8me]], [[Charles Aznavour]] described the Bohemian lifestyle in [[Montmartre]].
