This prompted his mother to return to Ireland and Stuart's childhood was divided between his home in Ireland and [[Rugby School]] in England, where he boarded.\n\nIn 1920, at age 17, he became a Catholic and married [[Iseult Gonne]], [[Maud Gonne]]'s daughter. Maud Gonne's companion, [[Mary Barry O'Delaney]], stood as his godmother upon his conversion.<ref name=Maume>{{cite book|last1=Maume|first1=Patrick|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=O'Delaney, Mary Barry}}</ref> Aged 24 years, Iseult had had a romantic but unsettled life. Maud Gonne's estranged husband [[John MacBride]] was executed in 1916 for taking part in the [[Easter Rising]]. Iseult Gonne's father was the right-wing French politician, [[Lucien Millevoye]], with whom Maud Gonne had had an affair between 1887 and 1899. Because of her complex family situation, Iseult was often passed off as Maud Gonne's niece in conservative circles in Ireland. Iseult grew up in Paris and London. She had been proposed to by [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1917 (he had also earlier proposed to her mother; Yeats was 50 at the time, Iseult 20) and had a brief affair with [[Ezra Pound]] prior to meeting Stuart. Pound and Stuart both believed in the primacy of the artist over the masses and were subsequently drawn to [[fascism]]; Stuart to [[Nazi Germany]] and Pound to [[Fascist Italy]].\n\n==IRA involvement==\nGonne and Stuart had a baby daughter who died in infancy. Perhaps to recover from this tragedy, they travelled for a while in Europe but returned to Ireland as the [[Irish Civil War]] began. Unsurprisingly given Gonne's strong opinions, the couple were caught up on the anti-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) side of this fight. Stuart was involved in gun running and was interned after a botched raid.\n\n==Literary career==\nAfter independence, Stuart participated in the literary life of [[Dublin]] and wrote poetry and novels. His novels were successful and his writing was publicly supported by Yeats. Yeats, however, seemed to have had mixed feelings for Stuart who was, after all, married to a woman he regarded almost as a daughter and, even, as a possible wife. In his poem \"Why should not Old Men be Mad?\" (1936) in which he lists what he regards as provocations to rage, he claims he has seen\n:\"A girl that knew all Dante once\n:Live to bear children to a dunce\"\nThe first of these lines is accepted as referring to Gonne and the second to Stuart (Elborn 1990).\n\nStuart and Gonne had three children, a daughter Dolores who died three months old, a son Ian and a daughter Katherine. Ian Stuart went on to become an artist and was married for a time to the sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] and later to the Berlin-trained artist and jewellery designer Anna Stuart [7] whom he first met in 1970. They gave Stuart three grandchildren; food entrepreneur Laragh, photographer Suki and sculptress Sophia.\n\nStuart's time with Gonne may not have been an entirely happy time; from the accounts given in his apparently autobiographical novels, both he and his wife struggled with personal demons and their internal anguish poisoned their marriage. In her letters to close friend William Butler Yeats, Iseult Gonne's mother Maud Gonne characterizes Francis Stuart as being emotionally, financially, and physically abusive towards Iseult: \"Stuart's conduct towards Iseult is shocking. While they were staying with me in Dublin he struck her & one day knocked her down. He threw her out of her own room with such violence that she fell on the landing half dressed at the feet of Claud Chevasse who was staying in the house at the time.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>  Another time, neighbors reported seeing a fire in the couple's house: \"They found Iseult in her dressing gown outside. Stuart had locked himself in her room from where the flames were coming. They could see him pouring petroleum. Finally he opened the door -- he had been burning Iseult's clothes to punish her! Frequently he locked her up without food.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with the Third Reich==\nIt was also during the 1930s that Stuart became friendly with German Intelligence ([[Abwehr]]) agent [[Helmut Clissmann]] and his Irish wife Elizabeth. Clissmann was working for the German Academic Exchange Service and the ''[[Deutsche Akademie]]'' (DA). He was facilitating academic exchanges between Ireland and the [[Third Reich]] but also forming connections which might be of benefit to German Intelligence. Clissmann was also a representative of the [[Nazi]] ''Auslandorganisation'' (AO) \u2013 the Nazi Party's foreign organisation \u2013 in pre-war Ireland.\n\nStuart was also friendly with the head of the German Legation in Dublin, Dr [[Eduard Hempel]], largely as a result of Maud Gonne MacBride's rapport with him. By 1938 Stuart was seeking a way out of his marriage and the provincialism of Irish life. Iseult intervened with Clissmann to arrange for Stuart to travel to Germany to give a series of academic lectures in conjunction with the DA. Stuart travelled to Germany in April 1939 and his host in Germany was Professor [[Walter F. Schirmer]], the senior member of the English faculty with the DA and [[Berlin University]]. He eventually visited Munich, Hamburg, Bonn and Cologne. At the completion of his lecture tour he accepted an appointment as lecturer in English and Irish literature at Berlin University to begin in 1940, two years after Jews had been barred from German universities by the Nazis' [[Nuremberg Laws]].\n\nIn July 1939 Stuart returned home to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] and confirmed at the outbreak of war in September that he would still take the place in Berlin. When Stuart's plans for travelling to Germany were finalised, he received a visit from his brother-in-law, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], this meeting followed the seizure of an IRA radio transmitter on 29 December 1939, which had been used to contact Germany. Stuart, MacBride, [[Seamus O'Donovan]], and IRA Chief of Staff [[Stephen Hayes (Irish Republican)|Stephen Hayes]] then met at O'Donovan's house. Stuart was told to take a message to Abwehr HQ in Berlin. He travelled alone to [[Nazi Germany]], something that was possible because Ireland was neutral in the [[Second World War]], and arrived in Berlin during January 1940. Upon arrival he delivered the IRA message and had some discussion with the Abwehr on the conditions in Ireland and the fate of the IRA-Abwehr radio link. He also reactivated his acquaintance with Abwehr asset Helmut Clissmann who was acting as an advisor to SS Colonel Dr [[Edmund Vessenmayer]]. Through Clissmann Stuart was introduced to [[Sonderf\u00fchrer]] Kurt Haller. Around August 1940, Stuart was asked by Haller if he would participate in [[Operation Dove (Ireland)|Operation Dove]] and he agreed although he was later dropped in favour of [[Frank Ryan (Irish republican)|Frank Ryan]]. In so far as is known he had no further contact with German Intelligence although he did maintain links with Frank Ryan up to his death and funeral in June 1944.\n\n===Time in Berlin===\n\nBetween March 1942 and January 1944 Stuart worked as part of the ''Redaktion-Irland'' (also sometimes referred to as ''Irland-Redaktion'', \"''Editorial Ireland\"'' in English) team, reading radio broadcasts containing Nazi propaganda which were aimed at and heard in Ireland. Before deciding to accept this job he discussed it with Frank Ryan, and they agreed that no anti-Semitic or anti-Soviet statements should be made. He was dropped from the ''Redaktion-Irland'' team in January 1944 because he objected to the anti-Soviet material that was presented to him and deemed essential by his supervisors. His [[passport]] was taken from him by the [[Gestapo]] after this event.<ref>David O'Donoghue: Hitler's Irish Voices \u2013 The Story of German Radio's Wartime Irish Service. Beyond the Pale, Dublin 1998 {{ISBN|1-900960-04-4}}</ref>\n\nIn his radio broadcasts he frequently spoke with admiration of [[Hitler]] and expressed the hope that Germany would help unite Ireland. After the war he maintained that he was not drawn to Germany by support for Nazism, but that he was fascinated by wartime Germany as a dark spectacle of the grotesque and as a celebration of destruction. Stuart described one such event at the Berlin Olympic stadium in June 1939 as: \"A most amazing thing. Such a spectacle and organisation.\"<ref name=\"Hull, p.310\">Hull, p.310</ref>\n\n===Anti-semitism===\nStuart is known to have read only one piece of what might be considered anti-semitic propaganda for Redaktion-Irland: his first, and even then it was a single sentence. Whilst enthralled with the macabre spectacle of wartime Nazi Germany, he is also on record via his letters as deploring much of what he saw around him.<ref name=indo>{{Cite news | last=Cronin | first= Anthony| title=Healing the Wounds of Francis Stuart |newspaper=[[The Irish Independent]] |page = 1| date=27 June 1999}}</ref> \n\nHowever, Stuart did write the following in a 1924 IRA pamphlet (discovered by Brendan Barrington, see Bibliography):<blockquote>Austria, in 1921, had been ruined by the war, and was far, far poorer than Ireland is today, for besides having no money she was overburdened with innumerable debts. At that time Vienna was full of Jews, who controlled the banks and the factories and even a large part of the Government; the Austrians themselves seemed about to be driven out of their own city.<ref>Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, [http://www.colmtoibin.com/essays/lrb/CTLRBSept012000b.htm \"Issues of Truth and Invention\" (Part II)], ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 1 September 2000, on colmtoibin.com</ref></blockquote>In a lengthy article for  the lrb [[Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn]] wrote , \"Let us accept then that Stuart was anti-semitic, that he admired Hitler, that he was a rabid Irish nationalist.\" <ref> [http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geKYk4SgBbvDoA6hNXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1526774456/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lrb.co.uk%2fv23%2fn01%2fcolm-toibin%2fissues-of-truth-and-invention/RK=2/RS=xgZ.2iSFCpxsngFxqMzlmoHROC4- issues of truth and invention lrb]</ref>\n\n==Post World War II==\nIn 1945 Stuart decided to return to Ireland with a former student, Gertrude Meissner; they were unable to do so and were arrested and detained by Allied troops. After they were released, Stuart and Meissner lived in Germany and then France and England. They married in 1954 after Iseult's death and in 1958 they returned to settle in Ireland. In 1971 Stuart published his best known work, ''Black List Section H'', an [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]]<ref>{{cite book | title=The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature | work=Black List Section H | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Welch (ed.), Robert | authorlink=Robert Welch (author) | year=1996 | isbn=0198661584 | url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00welc }}</ref> documenting his life and distinguished by a queasy sensitivity to moral complexity and moral ambiguity.\n\nIn 1991 he made an extended appearance on British television: on 16 March he took part in an ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' discussion called ''The Luck of The Irish?'' alongside [[J. P. Donleavy]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], [[Emily O'Reilly]], [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Paul Hill]] and others.<ref>See [[List of After Dark editions#Series 4]]</ref>\n\nIn 1996 Stuart was elected a [[Saoi]] of [[Aosd\u00e1na]]. This is a high honour in the Irish art world and the influential [[Irish language]] poet [[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]] objected strongly, referring to Stuart's actions during the war and claiming that he held anti-Semitic opinions. When it was put to a vote, she was the only person to vote for the motion (there were 70 against, with 14 abstentions).<ref>The Irish Times, 27 November 1997</ref> She resigned from Aosd\u00e1na in protest, sacrificing a government stipend by doing so. While the Aosd\u00e1na affair was ongoing, ''[[Irish Times]]'' columnist [[Kevin Myers]] attacked Stuart as a Nazi sympathiser; Stuart sued for [[libel]] and the case was settled out of court. The statement from the ''Irish Times'' read out in the High Court accepted \"that Mr Stuart never expressed anti-Semitism in his writings or otherwise\".<ref name=indo/>\n\nFor some years before his death he lived in [[County Clare]] with his partner Fionuala and in [[County Wicklow]] with his son Ian and daughter-in-law Anna in a house outside [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] village.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Stuart died of natural causes on 2 February 2000 at the age of 97 in County Clare.\n\n==Works==\nStuart wrote many novels including ''Black List Section H'' (1971) {{ISBN|0-14-006229-7}}, his most well-known work which is heavily autobiographical.

He threw her out of her own room with such violence that she fell on the landing half dressed at the feet of Claud Chevasse who was staying in the house at the time.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>  Another time, neighbors reported seeing a fire in the couple's house: \"They found Iseult in her dressing gown outside. Stuart had locked himself in her room from where the flames were coming. They could see him pouring petroleum. Finally he opened the door -- he had been burning Iseult's clothes to punish her! Frequently he locked her up without food.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with the Third Reich==\nIt was also during the 1930s that Stuart became friendly with German Intelligence ([[Abwehr]]) agent [[Helmut Clissmann]] and his Irish wife Elizabeth. Clissmann was working for the German Academic Exchange Service and the ''[[Deutsche Akademie]]'' (DA). He was facilitating academic exchanges between Ireland and the [[Third Reich]] but also forming connections which might be of benefit to German Intelligence. Clissmann was also a representative of the [[Nazi]] ''Auslandorganisation'' (AO) \u2013 the Nazi Party's foreign organisation \u2013 in pre-war Ireland.\n\nStuart was also friendly with the head of the German Legation in Dublin, Dr [[Eduard Hempel]], largely as a result of Maud Gonne MacBride's rapport with him. By 1938 Stuart was seeking a way out of his marriage and the provincialism of Irish life. Iseult intervened with Clissmann to arrange for Stuart to travel to Germany to give a series of academic lectures in conjunction with the DA. Stuart travelled to Germany in April 1939 and his host in Germany was Professor [[Walter F. Schirmer]], the senior member of the English faculty with the DA and [[Berlin University]]. He eventually visited Munich, Hamburg, Bonn and Cologne. At the completion of his lecture tour he accepted an appointment as lecturer in English and Irish literature at Berlin University to begin in 1940, two years after Jews had been barred from German universities by the Nazis' [[Nuremberg Laws]].\n\nIn July 1939 Stuart returned home to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] and confirmed at the outbreak of war in September that he would still take the place in Berlin. When Stuart's plans for travelling to Germany were finalised, he received a visit from his brother-in-law, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], this meeting followed the seizure of an IRA radio transmitter on 29 December 1939, which had been used to contact Germany. Stuart, MacBride, [[Seamus O'Donovan]], and IRA Chief of Staff [[Stephen Hayes (Irish Republican)|Stephen Hayes]] then met at O'Donovan's house. Stuart was told to take a message to Abwehr HQ in Berlin. He travelled alone to [[Nazi Germany]], something that was possible because Ireland was neutral in the [[Second World War]], and arrived in Berlin during January 1940. Upon arrival he delivered the IRA message and had some discussion with the Abwehr on the conditions in Ireland and the fate of the IRA-Abwehr radio link. He also reactivated his acquaintance with Abwehr asset Helmut Clissmann who was acting as an advisor to SS Colonel Dr [[Edmund Vessenmayer]]. Through Clissmann Stuart was introduced to [[Sonderf\u00fchrer]] Kurt Haller. Around August 1940, Stuart was asked by Haller if he would participate in [[Operation Dove (Ireland)|Operation Dove]] and he agreed although he was later dropped in favour of [[Frank Ryan (Irish republican)|Frank Ryan]]. In so far as is known he had no further contact with German Intelligence although he did maintain links with Frank Ryan up to his death and funeral in June 1944.\n\n===Time in Berlin===\n\nBetween March 1942 and January 1944 Stuart worked as part of the ''Redaktion-Irland'' (also sometimes referred to as ''Irland-Redaktion'', \"''Editorial Ireland\"'' in English) team, reading radio broadcasts containing Nazi propaganda which were aimed at and heard in Ireland. Before deciding to accept this job he discussed it with Frank Ryan, and they agreed that no anti-Semitic or anti-Soviet statements should be made. He was dropped from the ''Redaktion-Irland'' team in January 1944 because he objected to the anti-Soviet material that was presented to him and deemed essential by his supervisors. His [[passport]] was taken from him by the [[Gestapo]] after this event.<ref>David O'Donoghue: Hitler's Irish Voices \u2013 The Story of German Radio's Wartime Irish Service. Beyond the Pale, Dublin 1998 {{ISBN|1-900960-04-4}}</ref>\n\nIn his radio broadcasts he frequently spoke with admiration of [[Hitler]] and expressed the hope that Germany would help unite Ireland. After the war he maintained that he was not drawn to Germany by support for Nazism, but that he was fascinated by wartime Germany as a dark spectacle of the grotesque and as a celebration of destruction. Stuart described one such event at the Berlin Olympic stadium in June 1939 as: \"A most amazing thing. Such a spectacle and organisation.\"<ref name=\"Hull, p.310\">Hull, p.310</ref>\n\n===Anti-semitism===\nStuart is known to have read only one piece of what might be considered anti-semitic propaganda for Redaktion-Irland: his first, and even then it was a single sentence. Whilst enthralled with the macabre spectacle of wartime Nazi Germany, he is also on record via his letters as deploring much of what he saw around him.<ref name=indo>{{Cite news | last=Cronin | first= Anthony| title=Healing the Wounds of Francis Stuart |newspaper=[[The Irish Independent]] |page = 1| date=27 June 1999}}</ref> \n\nHowever, Stuart did write the following in a 1924 IRA pamphlet (discovered by Brendan Barrington, see Bibliography):<blockquote>Austria, in 1921, had been ruined by the war, and was far, far poorer than Ireland is today, for besides having no money she was overburdened with innumerable debts. At that time Vienna was full of Jews, who controlled the banks and the factories and even a large part of the Government; the Austrians themselves seemed about to be driven out of their own city.<ref>Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, [http://www.colmtoibin.com/essays/lrb/CTLRBSept012000b.htm \"Issues of Truth and Invention\" (Part II)], ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 1 September 2000, on colmtoibin.com</ref></blockquote>In a lengthy article for  the lrb [[Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn]] wrote , \"Let us accept then that Stuart was anti-semitic, that he admired Hitler, that he was a rabid Irish nationalist.\" <ref> [http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geKYk4SgBbvDoA6hNXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1526774456/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lrb.co.uk%2fv23%2fn01%2fcolm-toibin%2fissues-of-truth-and-invention/RK=2/RS=xgZ.2iSFCpxsngFxqMzlmoHROC4- issues of truth and invention lrb]</ref>\n\n==Post World War II==\nIn 1945 Stuart decided to return to Ireland with a former student, Gertrude Meissner; they were unable to do so and were arrested and detained by Allied troops. After they were released, Stuart and Meissner lived in Germany and then France and England. They married in 1954 after Iseult's death and in 1958 they returned to settle in Ireland. In 1971 Stuart published his best known work, ''Black List Section H'', an [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]]<ref>{{cite book | title=The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature | work=Black List Section H | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Welch (ed.), Robert | authorlink=Robert Welch (author) | year=1996 | isbn=0198661584 | url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00welc }}</ref> documenting his life and distinguished by a queasy sensitivity to moral complexity and moral ambiguity.\n\nIn 1991 he made an extended appearance on British television: on 16 March he took part in an ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' discussion called ''The Luck of The Irish?'' alongside [[J. P. Donleavy]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], [[Emily O'Reilly]], [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Paul Hill]] and others.<ref>See [[List of After Dark editions#Series 4]]</ref>\n\nIn 1996 Stuart was elected a [[Saoi]] of [[Aosd\u00e1na]]. This is a high honour in the Irish art world and the influential [[Irish language]] poet [[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]] objected strongly, referring to Stuart's actions during the war and claiming that he held anti-Semitic opinions. When it was put to a vote, she was the only person to vote for the motion (there were 70 against, with 14 abstentions).<ref>The Irish Times, 27 November 1997</ref> She resigned from Aosd\u00e1na in protest, sacrificing a government stipend by doing so. While the Aosd\u00e1na affair was ongoing, ''[[Irish Times]]'' columnist [[Kevin Myers]] attacked Stuart as a Nazi sympathiser; Stuart sued for [[libel]] and the case was settled out of court. The statement from the ''Irish Times'' read out in the High Court accepted \"that Mr Stuart never expressed anti-Semitism in his writings or otherwise\".<ref name=indo/>\n\nFor some years before his death he lived in [[County Clare]] with his partner Fionuala and in [[County Wicklow]] with his son Ian and daughter-in-law Anna in a house outside [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] village.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Stuart died of natural causes on 2 February 2000 at the age of 97 in County Clare.\n\n==Works==\nStuart wrote many novels including ''Black List Section H'' (1971) {{ISBN|0-14-006229-7}}, his most well-known work which is heavily autobiographical.
