Consequently, organisms can evolve to become simpler and thus multiply faster and produce more offspring, as they require fewer resources to reproduce. A good example are parasites such as Plasmodium - the parasite responsible for [[malaria]] - and [[mycoplasma]]; these organisms often dispense with traits that are made unnecessary through parasitism on a host.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sirand-Pugnet, P. |author2=Lartigue, C. |author3=Marenda, M.  |title=Being Pathogenic, Plastic, and Sexual while Living with a Nearly Minimal Bacterial Genome |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e75 |year=2007 |pmid=17511520 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030075 |pmc=1868952 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nA lineage can also dispense with complexity when a particular complex trait merely provides no selective advantage in a particular environment.
