{"title_page": "Tanaga", "text_new": "{{about|the poem|the volcano|Tanaga (volcano)}}\nThe '''Tanaga''' is an indigenous type of  [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[poem]], that is used traditionally in the [[Tagalog language]]. The modern ''tanaga'' is used in a variety of Philippine languages and English due to popularity in the 20th century. Its usage declined in the later half of the 20th century, but was revived through a collectivity of Filipino artists in the 21st century. The poetic art uses four lines, each line having seven syllables only. The art exemplifies teachings, idioms, feelings, and ways of life. It contains many figures of speech.\n\n==Format==\nThe Tanaga consists of four lines with seven syllables each with the same rhyme at the end of each line --- that is to say a 7-7-7-7 [[Syllabic verse]], with an AABB rhyme scheme.\n\n\n'''In the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] original,<ref>{{cite book|last=de Noceda|first=Juan|title=Vocabulario de la lengua tagala, trabaxado por varios sugetos doctos y graves|year=1754|publisher=Imprenta de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas|location=Manila|pages=324, 440|url=http://bvpb.mcu.es/es/consulta/registro.cmd?control=CCPB000336658-8|author2=Pedro de San Lucar }}</ref> using archaic orthography''':<br>\n''\"Catitibay ca tolos''<br>\n''sacaling datnang agos!''<br>\n''aco\u2019I momonting lomot''<br>\n''sa iyo,I popolopot.\"''<br>\n\n\n'''In the modern [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] orthography:'''\n\n''\"Katitibay kang Tulos''<br>\n''Sakaling datnan ng agos!''<br>\n''Ako'y mumunting lumot''<br>\n''sa iyo'y pupulupot.\"''<br>\n\n\n'''Translation:'''\n\n''\"Oh be resilient you Stake''<br>\n''Should the waters be coming!''<br>\n''I shall cower as the moss''<br>\n''To you I shall be clinging.\"''<br>\n\n\n\nThe above Tanaga is attributed to Friars Juan de Noceda and Pedro de Sanlucar by Vim Nadera, and quoted them as saying \u201cPoesia muy alta en tagalo, compuesta de siete silabas, y cuatro versos, llena de metafora.\u201d (16th century) (\"Poetry is quite high in Tagalog, composed of seven syllables, and four verses, full of metaphor.\") <!--This is a very rough translation\n\nis this better?-->\n\nLike the Japanese [[haiku]], Tanagas traditionally do not have any titles.

Unlike the ambahan whose length is indefinite, the tanaga is a compact seven-syllable quatrain.
