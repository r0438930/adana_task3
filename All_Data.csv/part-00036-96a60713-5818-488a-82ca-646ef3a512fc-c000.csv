He was one of a few West Pakistan Assembly members who were very much vocal against military dictator General [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] on assembly floor. He as MNA remained critic of his own Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] but when [[Pervez Musharraf|Pervaiz Musharraf]] removed Nawaz Sharif, Hamza stood by him in his bad days.

He was a member of the West Pakistan Legislative Assembly from Lyallpur-VI Constituency from 1962 to 1965<ref>{{cite web |title=Members of the West Pakistan Fifth Legislator |url=http://papmis.pitb.gov.pk/en/members/past-members/provincial-assembly-of-west-pakistan-1956-1969/west-pakistan-fifth-legislator-post |website=papmis.pitb.gov.pk |publisher=Punjab Assembly |accessdate=13 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> and again from 1965 to 1969.<ref>{{cite web |title=Members of the West Pakistan Sixth Legislator |url=http://papmis.pitb.gov.pk/en/members/past-members/provincial-assembly-of-west-pakistan-1956-1969/west-pakistan-sixth-legislator-post |accessdate=13 September 2018|publisher=Punjab Assembly}}</ref> During his tenure as member of the West Pakistan Legislative Assembly, he was very vocal against then President of Pakistan, [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]].<ref name=\"nation/2feb2018\">{{cite news |title=Hamza to retire from Senate in March |url=https://nation.com.pk/02-Feb-2018/hamza-to-retire-from-senate-in-march |accessdate=13 September 2018 |work=The Nation |date=2 February 2018}}</ref> He was one of the three opposition members who were elected from the ticket of Muslim League led by Fatima Jinnah. Toba Tek Singh was the only city other than Karachi where Fatima Jinnah's Muslim League won a seat, and Hamza became the member of parliament. Hamza used to held public protests across the country during the [[1968 movement in Pakistan|1968 Movement in Pakistan]] against military regime of Ayub Khan and was taken into custody in numerous occasions. President Ayub Khan resigned in the face of growing public protests, and was succeeded by General Yahya Khan. He stood against the Marshal Law of General Yahya Khan and was frontline leader for the civil democracy in Pakistan.

He was a very fierce opposition to the ruling party of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the 70's. Hamza was amongst the prominent leaders of [[Pakistan National Alliance]] (PNA), a nine party coalition against the ruling party of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]. The protests of 1977 called for overthrow, [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia ul Haq]] became Chief Marshal Law Administrator after declaring Martial Law in country in 1978.

Hamza’s was the only voice of opposition in the parliament the day when 295-C was passed immediately. During his speech in 1986, Hamza argued that the Islamic texts being cited by those advocating for the death penalty needed to be comprehensively reviewed by religious scholars before any change in the law could be passed. He claimed parliament was being irresponsible by avoiding a deeper debate on the issue. “I have a firm opinion,” said Hamza, “you cannot run the country on selective justice. What is the purpose of the law if it’s destructive for the society? Our people lack depth, they are unreasonably emotional about religion, so I knew that the law will be misused - that’s why I am opposing.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Asia_Bibi|title=Asia Bibi: Pakistan's notorious case|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

==Political Career==

M. Hamza is known for his neutral views in Pakistani politics. He remained vocal on political issues for almost five decades. He was one of a few West Pakistan Assembly members who were very much vocal against military dictator General [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] on assembly floor. He as MNA remained critic of his own Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] but when [[Pervez Musharraf|Pervaiz Musharraf]] removed Nawaz Sharif, Hamza stood by him in his bad days.

He was a member of the West Pakistan Legislative Assembly from Lyallpur-VI Constituency from 1962 to 1965<ref>{{cite web |title=Members of the West Pakistan Fifth Legislator |url=http://papmis.pitb.gov.pk/en/members/past-members/provincial-assembly-of-west-pakistan-1956-1969/west-pakistan-fifth-legislator-post |website=papmis.pitb.gov.pk |publisher=Punjab Assembly |accessdate=13 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> and again from 1965 to 1969.<ref>{{cite web |title=Members of the West Pakistan Sixth Legislator |url=http://papmis.pitb.gov.pk/en/members/past-members/provincial-assembly-of-west-pakistan-1956-1969/west-pakistan-sixth-legislator-post |accessdate=13 September 2018|publisher=Punjab Assembly}}</ref> During his tenure as member of the West Pakistan Legislative Assembly, he was very vocal against then President of Pakistan, [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]].<ref name=\"nation/2feb2018\">{{cite news |title=Hamza to retire from Senate in March |url=https://nation.com.pk/02-Feb-2018/hamza-to-retire-from-senate-in-march |accessdate=13 September 2018 |work=The Nation |date=2 February 2018}}</ref> He was one of the three opposition members who were elected from the ticket of Muslim League led by Fatima Jinnah. Toba Tek Singh was the only city other than Karachi where Fatima Jinnah's Muslim League won a seat, and Hamza became the member of parliament. Hamza used to held public protests across the country during the [[1968 movement in Pakistan|1968 Movement in Pakistan]] against military regime of Ayub Khan and was taken into custody in numerous occasions. President Ayub Khan resigned in the face of growing public protests, and was succeeded by General Yahya Khan. He stood against the Marshal Law of General Yahya Khan and was frontline leader for the civil democracy in Pakistan.

Hamza’s was the only voice of opposition in the parliament the day when 295-C was passed immediately. During his speech in 1986, Hamza argued that the Islamic texts being cited by those advocating for the death penalty needed to be comprehensively reviewed by religious scholars before any change in the law could be passed. He claimed parliament was being irresponsible by avoiding a deeper debate on the issue. “I have a firm opinion,” said Hamza, “you cannot run the country on selective justice. What is the purpose of the law if it’s destructive for the society? Our people lack depth, they are unreasonably emotional about religion, so I knew that the law will be misused - that’s why I am opposing.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Asia_Bibi|title=Asia Bibi: Pakistan's notorious case|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

== History ==
In 1975, Kelty Hearts were formed as Kelty Hearts Amateur Football Club.

'''Japanese folktales ''' are an important cultural aspect of Japan. In commonplace usage, they signify a certain set of well-known classic tales, with a vague distinction of whether they fit the rigorous definition of \"[[Oral tradition|folktale]]\" or not among various types of [[folklore]]. The admixed imposters are literate written pieces, dating back to the [[Muromachi period]] (14th-16th centuries) or even earlier times in the Middle Ages. These would not normally qualify as \"folktales\" (i.e., pieces collected from oral tradition among the populace).

In a more stringent sense, \"Japanese folktales\" refer to orally transmitted folk narrative. Systematic collection of specimens was pioneered by folklorist [[Kunio Yanagita]]. Yanagita disliked the word '''{{Nihongo|''minwa''|民話}}''', a coined term directly translated from \"folktale\" (Yanagita stated that the term was not familiar to actual old folk he collected folktales from, and was not willing to \"go along\" with the conventions of other countries<ref>Yanagita, \"Preface to the 1960 edition\", appended to ''Nihon no mukashibanashi'' (Folk tales of Japan), Shinchosha, 1983, p.175.</ref>). He therefore proposed the use of the term {{Nihongo|mukashibanashi|[[:ja:昔話]]|\"tales of long ago\"}} to apply to all creative types of folktales (i.e., those that are not \"legendary\" types which are more of a reportage).<ref name=heibonsha-minwa>{{Harvnb|Heibonsha|1969}}, encyclopedia, vol.21, 492</ref>

A representative sampling of Japanese folklore would definitely include the quintessential '''''[[Momotarō]]''''' ('''Peach Boy'''), and perhaps other folktales listed among the so-called {{nihongo|\"five great fairy tales\"|五大昔話|Go-dai Mukashi banashi}}:<ref name=asakura>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Asakura|first=Haruhiko(朝倉治彦)|title=神話伝説事典|publisher=東京堂出版|year=1963|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo8xAQAAIAAJ7|isbn=978-4-490-10033-4}}, p.198. quote:\"ごだいおとぎぱなし（五大御伽話）。五大昔話ともいう。桃太郎、猿蟹合戦、舌切雀、花咲爺、かちかち山の五話\"</ref> the battle between ''[[The Crab and the Monkey]]'', ''[[Shita-kiri Suzume]]'' (Tongue-cut sparrow), ''[[Hanasaka Jiisan]]'' (Flower-blooming old man), and ''[[Kachi-kachi Yama]]''.

These stories just named are considered genuine folktales, having received those auspices by folklorist Kunio Yanagita.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Yanagita|first=Kunio(柳田國男)|title=Collected Works (柳田國男全集)|volume=6|publisher=Tsukuma Shobo|year=1998|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1Q0AQAAIAAJ}}, p.253, says calling them ''otogibanashi'' (see below) is a misnomer, since they are ''mukashi banashi'' (Yanagita's preferred term for folktales orally transmitted)</ref> During the [[Edo period]] these tales had been adapted by professional writers and woodblock-printed in a form a called ''[[kusazōshi]]'' (cf.[[chapbooks]]), but a number of local variant versions of the tales have been collected in the field as well.

As a forestated, non-genuine folktales are those already committed to writing long ago, the earliest being the tale of Princess Kaguya (or ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]''), an example of [[monogatari]] type of romance dated to as early as the 10th century,<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dickins|first= F. Victor (Frederick Victor), 1838-1915|title=The Old Bamboo-Hewer's Story (Taketori no okina no monogatari): The earliest of the Japanese romances, written in the 10th century |via=[[Internet Archive]]|publisher=Trübner|year=1888|url=https://archive.org/details/oldbamboohewers00dickgoog}}</ref> though extant manuscripts are much later. The text gives reference, for example, to the flame-proof \"{{nihongo|''fire rat''|[[:ja:火鼠|火鼠]]|Hinezumi}} (or [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]])'s fur robe\" (perhaps familiar to watchers of the anime ''[[Inuyasha]]'' as the vestment of the title character), which attests to considerable degree of book-knowledge and learning by its author.

Other examples of pseudo-folktales which have been composed in the Middle Ages are the ''[[Uji Shūi Monogatari]]'' (13th century) that includes the nucleus of classics as ([[Kobutori Jisan|''Kobutori Jīsan'']] - the old man with the hump on his cheek, and ''[[Straw Millionaire]]''). This and the ''[[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]'' (12th century) also contains a number of type of tales designated ''[[setsuwa]]'', a generic term for narratives of various nature, anything from moralizing to comical. Both works, it might be noted, are divided into parts containing tales from India, tales from China, and tales from Japan. In the ''Konjaku Monogatarishū'' can be seen the early developments of the [[Kintarō]] legend, familiar in folktale-type form.

The Japanese word used to correspond to \"folktale\" has undergone development over the years. From the [[Edo period]], the term used was {{Nihongo|''otokibanashi''|お伽話}}, i.e., tales told by the ''otogii-shū'' who were professional storytellers hired to entertain the daimyō lord at the bedside.<ref name=heibonsha-mukashibanashi>{{Harvnb|Heibonsha|1969}}, encyclopedia, vol.21, 499-504, on mukashibanashi by Shizuka Yamamuro and Taizo Tanaka</ref> That term continued to be in currency through the [[Meiji era]] (late 19th century), when imported terms such as ''minwa'' began usage.<ref name=heibonsha-mukashibanashi/> In the [[Taishō era]], the word ''dōwa'' (lit. \"children's story\" but was a translated coinage for [[fairy tales]] or ''[[wikt:Märchen|märchen]]'') was used.<ref name=heibonsha-mukashibanashi/> Then Yanagita popularized the use of ''mukashi-banashi'' \"tales of long ago\", as mentioned before.

Although some Japanese ghost stories or ''[[kaidan]]'' such as the story of the [[Yuki-onna]] (\"snow woman\") might be considered examples of folktales, but even though some overlaps may exist, they are usually treated as another genre. The familiar forms of stories are embellished works of literature by [[gesaku]] writers, or retooled for the [[kabuki]] theater performance, in the case of the [[bakeneko]] or monstrous cat. The famous collection ''[[Kwaidan]]'' by [[Lafcadio Hearn]] also consists of original retellings. Yanagita published a collection '{{nihongo|''Legends of Tohno''|[[:ja:遠野物語|遠野物語]]|Tohno Monogatari}}' (1910) which featured a number of fanatastical ''[[yōkai]]'' creatures such as [[Zashiki-warashi]] and [[kappa (folklore)|kappa]].

''namidabanashi'', sad stories; ''obakebanashi'', ghost stories; ''ongaeshibanashi'', stories of repaying kindness; ''tonchibanashi'', witty stories; ''waraibanashi'', funny stories; and ''yokubaribanashi'', stories of greed. (These are not standard or commonplace terms or classifications, except perhaps warai banashi. Tonchi banashi is a term but perhaps not a category.)

In the middle years of the 20th century storytellers would often travel from town to town telling these stories with special paper illustrations called [[kamishibai]].

===Animals in folklore===
'''Tongue-cut sparrow''': A washer woman cut off the tongue of a sparrow that was pecking at her rice starch. The sparrow had been fed regularly by the washer woman's neighbors, so when the sparrow didn't come, they went in the woods to search for it. They found it, and after a feast and some dancing (which the sparrow prepared), the neighbors were given the choice between two boxes; one large and one small. The neighbors picked the small box, and it was filled with riches. The washer woman saw these riches and heard where they came from, so she went to the sparrow. She too was entertained and given the choice between two boxes. The washer woman picked the largest box and instead of gaining riches, she was devoured by devils.<ref name=piggott>Japanese Mythology: Library of the World's Myths and Legends, by Juliet Piggott</ref>

'''Mandarin Ducks''': A man kills a drake mandarin duck for food. That night he had a dream that a woman was accusing him of murdering her husband, and then told him to return to the lake. The man does this, and a female mandarin walks up to him and tears its chest open.<ref name=piggott/>

'''Tanuki and Rabbit''': A man catches a tanuki and tells his wife to cook it in a stew. The tanuki begs the wife not to cook him and promises to help with the cooking if he is spared. The wife agrees and unties him. The tanuki then transforms into her and kills her, then cooks her in a stew. Disguised as the man's wife, the tanuki feeds him his wife. Once he is done, the tanuki transforms back to his original form and teases the man for eating his wife. A rabbit that was friends with the family was furious, so he had the tanuki carry sticks and, while he wasn't looking, set these sticks on fire. Then the rabbit treated the burn with hot pepper paste. Finally, the rabbit convinced the tanuki to build a boat of clay, and the rabbit followed in a sturdy boat. The clay boat began to sink, so the tanuki tried to escape, but then the rabbit hit him in the head with an oar, knocking him out and making him drown.<ref name=piggott/>

'''Badger and Fox cub''': A badger, vixen, and the vixen's cub lived in a forest that was running out of food, so they came up with the plan of one of them pretending to be dead, the other disguising as a merchant, and the “merchant” selling the “dead” animal to a human. Then they would have money to buy food. The vixen pretended to be dead while the badger was the merchant. While the transaction was happening however, the badger told the human that the vixen wasn't actually dead, so the human killed her. This infuriated the cub, so he proposed a competition. They would both disguise as humans and go into the village at different times. Whoever guessed what “human” was the other first, wins. The cub walked towards the village first, but he hid behind a tree. The badger went into the village, and accused the governor of being the fox, so the bodyguards of the governor beheaded him.<ref name=piggott/>

'''Japanese folktales ''' are an important cultural aspect of Japan. In commonplace usage, they signify a certain set of well-known classic tales, with a vague distinction of whether they fit the rigorous definition of \"[[Oral tradition|folktale]]\" or not among various types of [[folklore]]. The admixed imposters are literate written pieces, dating back to the [[Muromachi period]] (14th-16th centuries) or even earlier times in the Middle Ages. These would not normally qualify as \"folktales\" (i.e., pieces collected from oral tradition among the populace).

In a more stringent sense, \"Japanese folktales\" refer to orally transmitted folk narrative. Systematic collection of specimens was pioneered by folklorist [[Kunio Yanagita]]. Yanagita disliked the word '''{{Nihongo|''minwa''|民話}}''', a coined term directly translated from \"folktale\" (Yanagita stated that the term was not familiar to actual old folk he collected folktales from, and was not willing to \"go along\" with the conventions of other countries<ref>Yanagita, \"Preface to the 1960 edition\", appended to ''Nihon no mukashibanashi'' (Folk tales of Japan), Shinchosha, 1983, p.175.</ref>). He therefore proposed the use of the term {{Nihongo|mukashibanashi|[[:ja:昔話]]|\"tales of long ago\"}} to apply to all creative types of folktales (i.e., those that are not \"legendary\" types which are more of a reportage).<ref name=heibonsha-minwa>{{Harvnb|Heibonsha|1969}}, encyclopedia, vol.21, 492</ref>

==Overview==
A representative sampling of Japanese folklore would definitely include the quintessential '''''[[Momotarō]]''''' ('''Peach Boy'''), and perhaps other folktales listed among the so-called {{nihongo|\"five great fairy tales\"|五大昔話|Go-dai Mukashi banashi}}:<ref name=asakura>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Asakura|first=Haruhiko(朝倉治彦)|title=神話伝説事典|publisher=東京堂出版|year=1963|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo8xAQAAIAAJ7|isbn=978-4-490-10033-4}}, p.198. quote:\"ごだいおとぎぱなし（五大御伽話）。五大昔話ともいう。桃太郎、猿蟹合戦、舌切雀、花咲爺、かちかち山の五話\"</ref> the battle between ''[[The Crab and the Monkey]]'', ''[[Shita-kiri Suzume]]'' (Tongue-cut sparrow), ''[[Hanasaka Jiisan]]'' (Flower-blooming old man), and ''[[Kachi-kachi Yama]]''.

These stories just named are considered genuine folktales, having received those auspices by folklorist Kunio Yanagita.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Yanagita|first=Kunio(柳田國男)|title=Collected Works (柳田國男全集)|volume=6|publisher=Tsukuma Shobo|year=1998|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1Q0AQAAIAAJ}}, p.253, says calling them ''otogibanashi'' (see below) is a misnomer, since they are ''mukashi banashi'' (Yanagita's preferred term for folktales orally transmitted)</ref> During the [[Edo period]] these tales had been adapted by professional writers and woodblock-printed in a form a called ''[[kusazōshi]]'' (cf.[[chapbooks]]), but a number of local variant versions of the tales have been collected in the field as well.

In the ''Konjaku Monogatarishū'' can be seen the early developments of the [[Kintarō]] legend, familiar in folktale-type form.

The Japanese word used to correspond to \"folktale\" has undergone development over the years.

The wife agrees and unties him. The tanuki then transforms into her and kills her, then cooks her in a stew. Disguised as the man's wife, the tanuki feeds him his wife. Once he is done, the tanuki transforms back to his original form and teases the man for eating his wife. A rabbit that was friends with the family was furious, so he had the tanuki carry sticks and, while he wasn't looking, set these sticks on fire. Then the rabbit treated the burn with hot pepper paste. Finally, the rabbit convinced the tanuki to build a boat of clay, and the rabbit followed in a sturdy boat. The clay boat began to sink, so the tanuki tried to escape, but then the rabbit hit him in the head with an oar, knocking him out and making him drown.<ref name=piggott/>

'''Badger and Fox cub''': A badger, vixen, and the vixen's cub lived in a forest that was running out of food, so they came up with the plan of one of them pretending to be dead, the other disguising as a merchant, and the “merchant” selling the “dead” animal to a human. Then they would have money to buy food. The vixen pretended to be dead while the badger was the merchant. While the transaction was happening however, the badger told the human that the vixen wasn't actually dead, so the human killed her. This infuriated the cub, so he proposed a competition. They would both disguise as humans and go into the village at different times. Whoever guessed what “human” was the other first, wins. The cub walked towards the village first, but he hid behind a tree. The badger went into the village, and accused the governor of being the fox, so the bodyguards of the governor beheaded him.<ref name=piggott/>

==Theorized influences==
{{Fringe theories|section|date=May 2012}}
The folklore of Japan has been influenced by foreign literature as well as the kind of [[spirit worship]] prevalent all throughout prehistoric Asia.

The monkey stories of Japanese folklore have been influenced both by the [[Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] [[Ramayana]] and the [[Chinese literature|Chinese]] classic ''[[Journey to the West]]''.<ref>On the Road to Baghdad Or Traveling Biculturalism: Theorizing a Bicultural Approach to...

Kodansha International. {{ISBN|4-7700-2939-X}}. pp41</ref>

Some stories of [[History of India|ancient India]] were influential in shaping Japanese stories by providing them with materials. [[India]]n materials were greatly modified and adapted in such a way as would appeal to the sensibilities of common people of Japan in general, transmitted through China and Korea.<ref>Miraculous Stories from the Japanese Buddhist Tradition: The [[Nihon Ryōiki]] of the Monk Kyōkai By Kyōkai.

'''Burnie''' is a port city on the north-west coast of [[Tasmania]]. When founded in 1827, it was named Emu Bay, being renamed after William Burnie, a director of the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]], in the early 1840s. Burnie was proclaimed a city by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 26 April 1988.

Most industry in Burnie was based around the railway and the port that served it.

After the hand over of the Surrey Hills and Hampshire Hills lots, the agriculture industry was largely replaced by forestry. The influence of forestry had a major role on Burnie's development in the 1900s with the founding of the pulp and paper mill by [[Associated Pulp and Paper Mills]] in 1938 <ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article68526632 |title=Burnie Paper Mill Nearing Completion. |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=4 December 1937 |accessdate=7 April 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and the woodchip terminal in the later part of the century.

'''Burnie''' is a port city on the north-west coast of [[Tasmania]]. When founded in 1827, it was named Emu Bay, being renamed after William Burnie, a director of the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]], in the early 1840s. Burnie was proclaimed a city by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 26 April 1988.

Benjamin's song \"I Built a Friend\" was used as backing material for a contemporary dance audition of contestant Merrick Hanna, on episode 1 of the [[America's Got Talent (season 12)|12th season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' (May 30, 2017).

'''Sir John William Downer''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] (6 July 1843 – 2 August 1915) was an Australian politician who served two terms as [[Premier of South Australia]], from 1885 to 1887 and again from 1892 to 1893. He later entered federal politics and served as a [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[South Australia]] from 1901 to 1903. He was the first of four Australian politicians from the [[Downer family]] dynasty.

==Early life==
Born in [[Adelaide]], John Downer (the son of [[Downer family|Henry Downer]] who came to [[South Australia]] in 1838 and his wife Jane, ''née'' Field) was educated on a scholarship at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide]], where he was a brilliant student.<ref>Downer, Alick (2012). ''The Downers of South Australia'', p. 35. Wakefield Press, Adelaide. {{ISBN|9781743051993}}</ref> On 23 March 1867 he was admitted to the bar, and soon won a reputation as being among Adelaide's most talented and eloquent lawyers.

==South Australian politician==
[[File:John Downer (Australian politician).jpg|thumb|right|Downer in 1898]]
Downer became a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1878, the same year in which he was elected to the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] for [[Barossa Valley|Barossa]]. He represented this constituency until 1901, leaving it only to enter federal politics.

In the House of Assembly he soon made his mark and became [[Attorney-General of South Australia|Attorney-General]] in [[John Cox Bray]]'s cabinet on 24 June 1881. He endeavoured to bring in several law reforms, and though his married women's property bill was not passed, he succeeded in carrying bills allowing accused persons to give evidence on oath, and amending the insolvency and marriage acts. The government was defeated in June 1884, but a year later, on 16 June 1885, Downer himself became Premier for the first time, as well as being Attorney-General once again.

While Premier, Downer oversaw the construction of the first train line from Adelaide to Melbourne. He also made significant contributions to establishing irrigation settlements along the Murray River. Although this ministry lasted two years and passed a fair amount of legislation, it was often in difficulties, and in June 1886 had to be reconstructed.

At the [[1887 Colonial Conference|Colonial Conference]] held in London during 1887, Downer represented South Australia, but during his return journey to Australia his government was defeated. This ministry was responsible for a tariff imposing increased protective duties. Downer was not in office again for several years, but in October 1892 again became Premier, taking also the portfolio of Chief Secretary. In May 1893 he exchanged this for the position of [[Treasurer of South Australia]], but was ousted at the [[1893 South Australian colonial election|1893 election]] by liberal [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] [[Charles Kingston|Kingston]] with the support of the new [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] led by [[John McPherson (Australian politician)|John McPherson]]. Downer remarked of this party: 'They are very clever fellows. I have great respect for the way they use either side for their purposes with absolute impartiality'. For most of the period until 1899 Downer led the Opposition.

Downer was a strong federalist and had represented South Australia at the 1883 and 1891 [[Federation of Australia|conventions]]. At the latter meeting, he took an important part in protecting the interests of the smaller states, and was a member of the constitutional committee. He was elected one of the 10 representatives of South Australia at the 1897 convention, and was again on the constitutional committee.

==Federal politician and return to state politics==
At the time of Federation in 1901, Downer was elected as one of the inaugural [[Senate of Australia|senators]] for the [[Protectionist Party]] in [[South Australia]] at the first [[Parliament of Australia]], but he did not seek re-election in 1903. He entered the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] as a [[National Defence League]] ([[Liberal Union (South Australia)|Liberal Union]] from 1910) representative of the southern district in 1905, and continued to be re-elected until his death on 2 August 1915.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59414161 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXX |issue=21,446 |location=South Australia |date=5 August 1915 |accessdate=7 June 2016 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

==Character==
[[Alfred Deakin]] assessed Downer in the following terms: 'bull-headed, and rather thick-necked, … with the dogged set of the mouth of a prize fighter' and 'smallish eyes'. Downer was regarded a first-rate barrister, and some of his speeches to juries were singled out by contemporaries as laudable examples of forensic art. He was equally successful in parliamentary debate; one of his colleagues called him the best debater in a house that contained Charles Kingston, [[Frederick Holder]], [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]], and [[John Jenkins (Australian politician)|John Jenkins]].

In politics Downer tended to be conservative without being obstinate. He described himself as a [[Tory]], and partly on account of this he often found himself in a minority during his later years in parliament. Nevertheless, he consistently advocated the rights of married women to their own property, [[women's suffrage|female suffrage]], protection of local industries, and [[Federation of Australia|federation]].

==Family and legacy==
[[File:John Downer.jpg|thumb|right|Downer in 1901]]
Downer married twice: firstly in 1871 to Elizabeth Henderson (c. 1852 – 3 May 1896), daughter of the controversial Rev. [[James Henderson (minister)|James Henderson]];<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article162425473 |title=Obituary |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Observer]] |volume=LXII |issue=3,316 |location=South Australia |date=22 April 1905 |accessdate=8 June 2016 |page=31 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and secondly, in Sydney 29 November 1899 to Una Stella Haslingden Russell, daughter of Henry Edward Russell.<ref>Una Stella Haslingden Russell (b. 1871 at Goulbourn), is not related to [[Henry Chamberlain Russell]], notwithstanding the report in the article 'Interesting Weddings' ({{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article123226399 |title=Interesting Weddings. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sydney, Australia)|Sunday Times (Sydney, NSW : 1895 - 1930)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=2 March 1919 |accessdate=3 February 2016 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}. Her parents being Henry Edward Russell and Frances Emily Russell nee Robey ({{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article101472669 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[Goulburn Herald|The Goulburn Herald And Chronicle]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=8 June 1870 |accessdate=7 June 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}). Frances Emily Russell being the daughter of [[Ralph Mayer Robey]], MLC (1809 - 1864)</ref> With Elizabeth he had three children, John Henry (born 1872), James Frederick (born 1874) and Harold Sydney (born in 1875 and died in infancy).<ref>Downer, Alick (2012). ''The Downers of South Australia'', p. 36. Wakefield Press, Adelaide. {{ISBN|9781743051993}}</ref>
The son of his second marriage was [[Alick Downer|Alexander Russell \"Alick\" Downer]] (born 1910), who served in the [[Robert Gordon Menzies|Menzies]] government, was knighted, and served as Australian High Commissioner in London, and whose son, [[Alexander Downer]] served as leader of the (Opposition) Liberal party in 1994 and Foreign Minister in the [[John Howard|Howard]] government.

The home he purchased in 1880 at 42 Pennington Terrace, [[North Adelaide]], is now [[St Mark's College (University of Adelaide)|St Mark's College]] and the original part of the building is known as Downer House. A draft of the Australian Constitution was prepared in the ballroom in 1897.<ref>Downer, Alick (2012). ''The Downers of South Australia'', p. 37. Wakefield Press, Adelaide. {{ISBN|9781743051993}}</ref>

A brother and partner in his business, [[Henry Edward Downer]] (1836&ndash;1905), entered the South Australian parliament in 1881 and was attorney-general in the [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] ministry from May to August 1890. Another brother, [[A. G. Downer|A(lexander){{not a typo}} George Downer]] (1839&ndash;1916) was his partner in the legal firm G & J Downer and a prominent businessman.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article87312225 |title=A Splendid Citizen |newspaper=[[The Chronicle (Adelaide)|The Chronicle]] |location=Adelaide |date=19 August 1916 |accessdate=13 November 2012 |page=37 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1887, at the [[Imperial Conference]] in London (now the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]), Downer was created [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], recommended to the Queen by the Marquis of Salisbury.<ref>Downer, Alick (2012). ''The Downers of South Australia'', p. 44. Wakefield Press, Adelaide. {{ISBN|9781743051993}}</ref>
During retirement, he joined the [[Adelaide University]] Council and became president of the Commonwealth Club.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5407389 |title=The Commonwealth Club |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |volume=LV |issue=17,035 |location=South Australia |date=22 May 1913 |accessdate=6 June 2017 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The [[Canberra]] suburb of [[Downer, Australian Capital Territory]] was named after him in 1960.

He endeavoured to bring in several law reforms, and though his married women's property bill was not passed, he succeeded in carrying bills allowing accused persons to give evidence on oath, and amending the insolvency and marriage acts. The government was defeated in June 1884, but a year later, on 16 June 1885, Downer himself became Premier for the first time, as well as being Attorney-General once again.

While Premier, Downer oversaw the construction of the first train line from Adelaide to Melbourne. He also made significant contributions to establishing irrigation settlements along the Murray River. Although this ministry lasted two years and passed a fair amount of legislation, it was often in difficulties, and in June 1886 had to be reconstructed.

At the [[1887 Colonial Conference|Colonial Conference]] held in London during 1887, Downer represented South Australia, but during his return journey to Australia his government was defeated. This ministry was responsible for a tariff imposing increased protective duties. Downer was not in office again for several years, but in October 1892 again became Premier, taking also the portfolio of Chief Secretary. In May 1893 he exchanged this for the position of [[Treasurer of South Australia]], but was ousted at the [[1893 South Australian colonial election|1893 election]] by liberal [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] [[Charles Kingston|Kingston]] with the support of the new [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] led by [[John McPherson (Australian politician)|John McPherson]]. Downer remarked of this party: 'They are very clever fellows. I have great respect for the way they use either side for their purposes with absolute impartiality'. For most of the period until 1899 Downer led the Opposition.

Downer was a strong federalist and had represented South Australia at the 1883 and 1891 [[Federation of Australia|conventions]]. At the latter meeting, he took an important part in protecting the interests of the smaller states, and was a member of the constitutional committee. He was elected one of the 10 representatives of South Australia at the 1897 convention, and was again on the constitutional committee.

==Federal politician and return to state politics==
At the time of Federation in 1901, Downer was elected as one of the inaugural [[Senate of Australia|senators]] for the [[Protectionist Party]] in [[South Australia]] at the first [[Parliament of Australia]], but he did not seek re-election in 1903. He entered the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] as a [[National Defence League]] ([[Liberal Union (South Australia)|Liberal Union]] from 1910) representative of the southern district in 1905, and continued to be re-elected until his death on 2 August 1915.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59414161 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXX |issue=21,446 |location=South Australia |date=5 August 1915 |accessdate=7 June 2016 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

==Character==
[[Alfred Deakin]] assessed Downer in the following terms: 'bull-headed, and rather thick-necked, … with the dogged set of the mouth of a prize fighter' and 'smallish eyes'. Downer was regarded a first-rate barrister, and some of his speeches to juries were singled out by contemporaries as laudable examples of forensic art. He was equally successful in parliamentary debate; one of his colleagues called him the best debater in a house that contained Charles Kingston, [[Frederick Holder]], [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]], and [[John Jenkins (Australian politician)|John Jenkins]].

In politics Downer tended to be conservative without being obstinate. He described himself as a [[Tory]], and partly on account of this he often found himself in a minority during his later years in parliament. Nevertheless, he consistently advocated the rights of married women to their own property, [[women's suffrage|female suffrage]], protection of local industries, and [[Federation of Australia|federation]].

'''''Psycho III''''' is a 1986 American [[slasher film]], and the third film in the [[Psycho (franchise)|''Psycho'' franchise]]. It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], who also directs the film, reprising the role of [[Norman Bates]]. It co-stars [[Diana Scarwid]], [[Jeff Fahey]], and [[Roberta Maxwell]]. The screenplay is written by [[Charles Edward Pogue]]. The original electronic music score is composed and performed by [[Carter Burwell]] in one of his earliest projects. ''Psycho III'' is unrelated to [[Robert Bloch]]'s third ''Psycho'' novel, ''[[Psycho House]]'', which was released in 1990.

The film takes place one month after the events of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' where Norman Bates is still running the Bates Motel with the corpse of Emma Spool still sitting up in the house. A suicidal nun, with whom Norman falls in love, comes to the motel along with a drifter named Duane Duke. A reporter also tries to solve the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Spool as someone begins another murder spree.

Released on July 2, 1986, ''Psycho III'' grossed $14.4 million at the U.S. box office on an $8.4 million budget, becoming a financial failure and the lowest-grossing film in the series, and received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a television sequel, ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''.

==Plot==
In 1982, [[Norman Bates]] works at the Bates Motel and lives with the preserved corpse of [[Emma Spool]], whom he erroneously believes to be his mother. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss, Ralph Statler, are concerned because Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke, a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant motel manager to replace the late Warren Toomey who was fired by Norman. Tracy Venable, a journalist from Los Angeles, is working on an article about serial killers being released. She believes that Norman is killing again, so when Norman appears at the diner, Tracy attempts to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives, Norman opens up to her but is distracted when Maureen Coyle, a young, mentally unstable former nun, enters. He is startled because she resembles his former victim, [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman panics and leaves the diner.

\"Mother\" enters Maureen's bathroom later that night, intending to kill her, only to find that Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists. The shock of this causes Norman to reassert his personality while a delirious Maureen mistakes \"Mother\" holding a knife for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix. Norman brings Maureen to a hospital and offers that she stay as long as she needs to. After she is released, they begin a romantic relationship. Later that night, Duane picks up a girl named Red at a bar, but after Red makes it clear that she wants more than just a fling, Duane throws her out. Red tries to call a cab, but \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs Red to death. The following day, tourists arrive at the motel, where they plan to watch a local [[American football|football]] game. Meanwhile, Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's phone number written on a magazine cover repeatedly.

Patsy Boyle, the only sober guest, is murdered by \"Mother\". Norman discovers Patsy's body and buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office. The next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Tracy tells Maureen about Norman's past, causing Maureen to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Norman finds that Spool's corpse is missing and finds a note stating that she is in Cabin 12. Duane demands a large sum of money to keep quiet or else he will turn Norman over to the police. They fight and Norman beats Duane with his guitar until he loses consciousness. Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane then regains consciousness and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives into the swamp. Norman escapes the car while Duane drowns. Meanwhile, Tracy talks to Statler and Myrna about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also been institutionalized for murder.

Maureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love and returns to the motel. Norman and Maureen share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, startling him. He loses his grip on Maureen's hands, causing her to fall down the stairs, killing her. Enraged, Norman promises \"Mother\" that he will get her for this. Tracy enters the house and finds Maureen dead, then sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\" bearing a knife, but is unable to flee. She tries reasoning with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool was his aunt and was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma. Mrs. Spool kidnapped Norman when he was a child, after killing Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him\". When she was caught, Norman was returned to Norma while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. Tracy discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom. Norman takes off his dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, but when Norman raises the knife, he attacks \"Mother\" instead, dismembering Mrs. Spool's corpse. Sheriff Hunt takes Norman to his squad car. Hunt informs Norman that they may never release him from the institution again. Norman replies: \"But I'll be free...I'll finally be free.\" In the back of the squad car, Norman caresses a trophy he concealed: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He strokes the hand and smiles.

[[Carter Burwell]] was approached by Perkins to compose the score to the film, since Perkins had enjoyed Burwell's work on ''[[Blood Simple]]''. Perkins stated that he wanted to take the score in a more contemporary direction than [[Jerry Goldsmith]] had for his more traditional score for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. Burwell flew to Los Angeles and recorded the score largely on a [[Synclavier]] electronic music station, augmented by women's and boys' choirs as well as percussion by Steve Forman.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Psycho3.html|title=Carter Burwell - Psycho III|first=Carter|last=Burwell|website=www.carterburwell.com}}</ref>

After Universal suggested the film contain some pop songs so that the film could be marketable to the MTV generation, Burwell composed and performed songs with colleagues [[Stanton Miranda]] and [[Steve Bray]]. After Universal claimed the songs weren't sufficiently bankable, Burwell attempted to create a song with [[Oingo Boingo]] frontman and then burgeoning film composer [[Danny Elfman]], using sampled strings from [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score to the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. This idea was also rejected.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

Universal finally agreed to let Burwell take a motif from the score he'd composed and develop it into an instrumental electronic pop song. The song, \"Scream of Love\"—co-written by jazz saxophonist [[David Sanborn]]—was released as a 7\" single and a series of dance remixes were commissioned from [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] and featured on the 12\" version. MCA also commissioned a music video for the song featuring Burwell, Perkins and a \"Hitchcockian woman.\" Perkins introduced the video on [[MTV]] as a guest [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] on July 2, 1986.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The rest of the songs composed by Burwell, Miranda and Bray were used as background music in the film, playing from car stereos and jukeboxes.

Burwell's score was sampled by the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Insane Poetry]] on \"Welcome to the Grim Side\", the intro to their 1992 debut album ''[[Grim Reality (album)|Grim Reality]]'', as well as on British musician [[Aim (musician)|Aim]]'s 1999 [[electronica]] album, [[Cold Water Music]].

==Release==
When the film opened on July 2, 1986, it earned $3.2 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $14.4 million at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm|title=Psycho III|publisher=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref>

==Critical response==
Reviews from critics were mixed. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a generally positive review, calling Perkins a \"very creditable director\" and Pogue's screenplay \"efficient,\" concluding that \"'Psycho III' expresses its appreciation of the Hitchcock legacy without seeming to rip it off.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=July 2, 1986 |title=Film: Anthony Perkins in 'Psycho III' |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=C15 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film \"has its moments—about 20 minutes' worth—but the rest is filler in which the filmmakers gamely but futilely try to breathe new life into a tired body.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=July 2, 1986 |title=Psycho III |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=13 }}</ref> Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' thought that the film was \"better in most respects than 'II',\" but \"it fails any sequel's acid test. It feeds off the original without deepening it.\" He added that \"if the movie proves anything, it's that everyone should give Hitchcock a rest.\"<ref>Wilmington, Michael (July 2, 1986). \"'Psycho III' Still Getting Nourishment From Original\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

'''''Psycho III''''' is a 1986 American [[slasher film]], and the third film in the [[Psycho (franchise)|''Psycho'' franchise]]. It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], who also directs the film, reprising the role of [[Norman Bates]]. It co-stars [[Diana Scarwid]], [[Jeff Fahey]], and [[Roberta Maxwell]]. The screenplay is written by [[Charles Edward Pogue]]. The original electronic music score is composed and performed by [[Carter Burwell]] in one of his earliest projects. ''Psycho III'' is unrelated to [[Robert Bloch]]'s third ''Psycho'' novel, ''[[Psycho House]]'', which was released in 1990.

The film takes place one month after the events of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' where Norman Bates is still running the Bates Motel with the corpse of Emma Spool still sitting up in the house. A suicidal nun, with whom Norman falls in love, comes to the motel along with a drifter named Duane Duke. A reporter also tries to solve the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Spool as someone begins another murder spree.

Released on July 2, 1986, ''Psycho III'' grossed $14.4 million at the U.S. box office on an $8.4 million budget, becoming a financial failure and the lowest-grossing film in the series, and received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a television sequel, ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''.

==Plot==
In 1982, [[Norman Bates]] works at the Bates Motel and lives with the preserved corpse of [[Emma Spool]], whom he erroneously believes to be his mother. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss, Ralph Statler, are concerned because Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke, a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant motel manager to replace the late Warren Toomey who was fired by Norman. Tracy Venable, a journalist from Los Angeles, is working on an article about serial killers being released. She believes that Norman is killing again, so when Norman appears at the diner, Tracy attempts to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives, Norman opens up to her but is distracted when Maureen Coyle, a young, mentally unstable former nun, enters. He is startled because she resembles his former victim, [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman panics and leaves the diner.

\"Mother\" enters Maureen's bathroom later that night, intending to kill her, only to find that Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists. The shock of this causes Norman to reassert his personality while a delirious Maureen mistakes \"Mother\" holding a knife for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix. Norman brings Maureen to a hospital and offers that she stay as long as she needs to. After she is released, they begin a romantic relationship. Later that night, Duane picks up a girl named Red at a bar, but after Red makes it clear that she wants more than just a fling, Duane throws her out. Red tries to call a cab, but \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs Red to death. The following day, tourists arrive at the motel, where they plan to watch a local [[American football|football]] game. Meanwhile, Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's phone number written on a magazine cover repeatedly.

Patsy Boyle, the only sober guest, is murdered by \"Mother\". Norman discovers Patsy's body and buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office. The next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Tracy tells Maureen about Norman's past, causing Maureen to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Norman finds that Spool's corpse is missing and finds a note stating that she is in Cabin 12. Duane demands a large sum of money to keep quiet or else he will turn Norman over to the police. They fight and Norman beats Duane with his guitar until he loses consciousness. Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane then regains consciousness and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives into the swamp. Norman escapes the car while Duane drowns. Meanwhile, Tracy talks to Statler and Myrna about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also been institutionalized for murder.

Maureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love and returns to the motel. Norman and Maureen share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, startling him. He loses his grip on Maureen's hands, causing her to fall down the stairs, killing her. Enraged, Norman promises \"Mother\" that he will get her for this. Tracy enters the house and finds Maureen dead, then sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\" bearing a knife, but is unable to flee. She tries reasoning with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool was his aunt and was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma. Mrs. Spool kidnapped Norman when he was a child, after killing Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him\". When she was caught, Norman was returned to Norma while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. Tracy discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom. Norman takes off his dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, but when Norman raises the knife, he attacks \"Mother\" instead, dismembering Mrs. Spool's corpse. Sheriff Hunt takes Norman to his squad car. Hunt informs Norman that they may never release him from the institution again. Norman replies: \"But I'll be free...I'll finally be free.\" In the back of the squad car, Norman caresses a trophy he concealed: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He strokes the hand and smiles.

[[Carter Burwell]] was approached by Perkins to compose the score to the film, since Perkins had enjoyed Burwell's work on ''[[Blood Simple]]''. Perkins stated that he wanted to take the score in a more contemporary direction than [[Jerry Goldsmith]] had for his more traditional score for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. Burwell flew to Los Angeles and recorded the score largely on a [[Synclavier]] electronic music station, augmented by women's and boys' choirs as well as percussion by Steve Forman.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Psycho3.html|title=Carter Burwell - Psycho III|first=Carter|last=Burwell|website=www.carterburwell.com}}</ref>

After Universal suggested the film contain some pop songs so that the film could be marketable to the MTV generation, Burwell composed and performed songs with colleagues [[Stanton Miranda]] and [[Steve Bray]]. After Universal claimed the songs weren't sufficiently bankable, Burwell attempted to create a song with [[Oingo Boingo]] frontman and then burgeoning film composer [[Danny Elfman]], using sampled strings from [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score to the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. This idea was also rejected.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

Universal finally agreed to let Burwell take a motif from the score he'd composed and develop it into an instrumental electronic pop song. The song, \"Scream of Love\"—co-written by jazz saxophonist [[David Sanborn]]—was released as a 7\" single and a series of dance remixes were commissioned from [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] and featured on the 12\" version. MCA also commissioned a music video for the song featuring Burwell, Perkins and a \"Hitchcockian woman.\" Perkins introduced the video on [[MTV]] as a guest [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] on July 2, 1986.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The rest of the songs composed by Burwell, Miranda and Bray were used as background music in the film, playing from car stereos and jukeboxes.

Burwell's score was sampled by the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Insane Poetry]] on \"Welcome to the Grim Side\", the intro to their 1992 debut album ''[[Grim Reality (album)|Grim Reality]]'', as well as on British musician [[Aim (musician)|Aim]]'s 1999 [[electronica]] album, [[Cold Water Music]].

==Release==
When the film opened on July 2, 1986, it earned $3.2 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $14.4 million at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm|title=Psycho III|publisher=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref>

==Critical response==
Reviews from critics were mixed. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a generally positive review, calling Perkins a \"very creditable director\" and Pogue's screenplay \"efficient,\" concluding that \"'Psycho III' expresses its appreciation of the Hitchcock legacy without seeming to rip it off.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=July 2, 1986 |title=Film: Anthony Perkins in 'Psycho III' |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=C15 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film \"has its moments—about 20 minutes' worth—but the rest is filler in which the filmmakers gamely but futilely try to breathe new life into a tired body.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=July 2, 1986 |title=Psycho III |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=13 }}</ref> Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' thought that the film was \"better in most respects than 'II',\" but \"it fails any sequel's acid test.

[[Jousting]] tournaments took place on Richmond Green in the [[Middle Ages]], when English monarchs were living in or visiting what is now called Richmond.<ref name=\"Friends History\">{{cite web | url=http://www.forg.org.uk/history/ | title=History | publisher=Friends of Richmond Green | accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> For over 400 years, Richmond Green has been edged by houses and commercial premises&nbsp;– built to provide accommodation for people serving or visiting [[Richmond Palace]]. In 1625 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] brought his court here to escape the [[Great Plague of London|plague in London]] and by the early 18th century these had become the homes of \"minor nobility, diplomats, and court hangers-on\".<ref name=\"RG Local\"/>

The construction of the railway in the mid-19th century cut the Green off from [[Old Deer Park]], and led to the building of Victorian [[villa]]s for the more prosperous commuters to London. The [[A316 road]], built in the early 20th century, worsened this separation.

Today the northern, western and southern sides of the Green are residential while the eastern side, linking with Richmond's [[high street]], George Street, is largely retail and commercial. Public buildings line the eastern side of Little Green and pubs and cafés cluster in the corner by Paved and Golden Courts&nbsp;– two of a number of alleys that lead from the Green to George Street. These alleys are lined with mostly privately owned [[boutique]]s.

To the west of the Green is Old Palace Lane, running gently down to the river.<ref>Robinson, Derek; Fowler, Simon (2017). ''Old Palace Lane: Medieval to Modern Richmond''.

The street bounding Richmond Green on the north-west is called Pembroke Villas, comprising 5 pairs of large semi-detached Victorian villas, formerly the site of the house of the Dutchman [[Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet]] (1679-1749). It descended to his grandson [[Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam]] (1745-1816) of [[Mount Merrion]], Dublin, Ireland, who named it \"FitzWilliam House\" and there formed his famous art collection and by his will founded the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in Cambridge. The monument to Sir Matthew Decker and Richard FitzWilliam survives against the external wall of St Mary Magdalene's Church, Richmond. FitzWilliam's heir was his cousin [[George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke]] (1759-1827), of [[Wilton House]] in Wiltshire, who renamed the house \"Pembroke House\". It was demolished in 1840.<ref>[https://www.richmond.gov.uk/richmond_green_old_palace_lane_to_the_old_deer_park_gates]</ref>

==Cricket on the Green==
{{Main|Richmond Green cricket ground}}
[[File:The Cricketers, The Green, Richmond, Surrey.jpg|thumb|125px|The Cricketers pub]]
The Green was a popular venue for [[cricket]] matches during the 18th century and before. The earliest reference to cricket on Richmond Green is from a 1666 letter by [[Sir Robert Paston]], a resident of Richmond.

The Green is presently home to two [[village cricket]] teams each affiliated to two of Richmond's [[public houses|pubs]], ''The Prince's Head'' and ''The Cricketers''. Midweek matches are contested in the modern limited overs format of [[Twenty20]] usually on a Tuesday or Thursdays, where surrounding village teams compete for the Len Smith Charity Shield.

[[Jousting]] tournaments took place on Richmond Green in the [[Middle Ages]], when English monarchs were living in or visiting what is now called Richmond.<ref name=\"Friends History\">{{cite web | url=http://www.forg.org.uk/history/ | title=History | publisher=Friends of Richmond Green | accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> For over 400 years, Richmond Green has been edged by houses and commercial premises&nbsp;– built to provide accommodation for people serving or visiting [[Richmond Palace]]. In 1625 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] brought his court here to escape the [[Great Plague of London|plague in London]] and by the early 18th century these had become the homes of \"minor nobility, diplomats, and court hangers-on\".<ref name=\"RG Local\"/>

The construction of the railway in the mid-19th century cut the Green off from [[Old Deer Park]], and led to the building of Victorian [[villa]]s for the more prosperous commuters to London. The [[A316 road]], built in the early 20th century, worsened this separation.

Today the northern, western and southern sides of the Green are residential while the eastern side, linking with Richmond's [[high street]], George Street, is largely retail and commercial. Public buildings line the eastern side of Little Green and pubs and cafés cluster in the corner by Paved and Golden Courts&nbsp;– two of a number of alleys that lead from the Green to George Street. These alleys are lined with mostly privately owned [[boutique]]s.

To the west of the Green is Old Palace Lane, running gently down to the river.<ref>Robinson, Derek; Fowler, Simon (2017). ''Old Palace Lane: Medieval to Modern Richmond''. [[Richmond Local History Society]] and [[Museum of Richmond]]. {{ISBN|978-0-9550717-9-9}}.</ref> Adjoining to the left is the renowned terrace of well-preserved three-storey houses known as Maids of Honour Row.

'''National Renewal''' ({{lang-es|Renovación Nacional}}, '''RN''') is a [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]]<ref name=\"Kirby\"/> political party in [[Chile]]. It belongs to the [[right-wing]] political coalition [[Chile Vamos]], in conjunction with the [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI), the [[Independent Regionalist Party]] (PRI) and [[Political Evolution]] (Evópoli). The party president is [[Mario Desbordes]], and its principal leaders are [[Sebastián Piñera]], two times President of Chile and [[Andrés Allamand]], former minister of defense, former presidential candidate and Senator.

==History==
National Renewal was formed on 29 April 1987 when three rightist organizations – the [[National Union Movement]] (''Movimiento de Unión Nacional'', MUN), the [[National Labour Front (Chile)|National Labour Front]] (''Frente Nacional del Trabajo'', FNT), and the Independent Democratic Union (''Unión Demócrata Independiente'', UDI) — joined together in preparation for the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|1988 Plebiscite]] that would determine the continuity or not of rule of [[Augusto Pinochet]] who had been in power since the coup of 1973. The UDI soon broke away to run as a separate party due to its strong support for the plebiscite and a Pinochet candidacy, while the remaining National Renewal party indicated its preference for an open election or a candidate other than Pinochet. However, once Pinochet was proclaimed candidate, the overwhelming majority of National Renewal supported him.

The party was founded on 29 April with 351 founding members. In this way, National Renewal was the first political party to form in Chile after the lifting on the ban of political parties that had been established after the coup; by December of that year, 61,167 members, led by Andrés Allamand, had joined. The principal idea that the party proclaimed was to generate an environment of calm during the return of democracy. The party supported UDI candidate [[Joaquín Lavín]] as the sole Alliance candidate in the [[1999–2000 Chilean presidential election|1999/2000]] presidential elections, who went on to obtain 47.5% of the votes in the first round, but was subsequently defeated in the second round by [[Ricardo Lagos]].

During early 2005, the party initially supported Lavín to again run as the sole candidate of the Alliance in the [[2005–06 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] of that year. However, in face of Lavín's declining opinion poll numbers, [[Sebastián Piñera]] announced his candidacy as the National Renewal candidate thus ensuring that the Alliance have two candidates for the election. In the first round on 11 December, Piñera obtained 25.4% of the vote, which was enough to send him to the run-off on 15 January 2006 with [[Michelle Bachelet]]. With 46.5% of the vote, Piñera was defeated by Bachelet.

In the [[legislative]] [[2005 Chilean parliamentary election|elections]], also on 11 December 2005, the party won, as part of the [[Alliance for Chile]], 20 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and currently holds 7 out of 38 seats in the Senate.

In the [[2009 Chilean parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]], also on 13 December 2009, the party gains, as part of the [[Coalition for Change]], 18 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies of Chile and currently has 8 out of 38 seats in the Senate of Chile.

In the [[2009–10 Chilean presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Sebastián Piñera was elected [[president of Chile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/especiales/2009/nacional/presidenciales2009/despliegue.asp?idnoticia=394236|title=

In 2013, [[Andrés Allamand]] was presidential precandidate for primary elections, the National Renewal party supported the presidential candidacy of [[Evelyn Matthei]] for the [[2013 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]], that lost in second round with the 37% of the votes.

In January 2014, three deputies (Karla Rubilar, Pedro Browne and Joaquín Godoy)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-559643-9-karla-rubilar-joaquin-godoy-y-pedro-browne-confirman-renuncia-a-renovacion.shtml|title=Karla Rubilar, Joaquín Godoy y Pedro Browne confirman renuncia a Renovación Nacional|work=[[La Tercera]]|date=7 January 2014|accessdate=8 January 2014|author=Francisco Torrealba and Alberto Labra}}</ref> and one senator (Lily Pérez)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|title=Lily Pérez y renuncia a RN: \"Dejó de ser el partido al que entré\"|work=La Tercera|date=16 January 2014|accessdate=17 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116203913/http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> resigned to membership in the party and launched a political movement called \"[[Amplitude (political party)|Amplitude]]\" (''Amplitud''), that aimed to be a new political party inside the Alliance. In the internal elections of 2014 the party, the deputy Cristián Monckeberg was elected president of the party. On 2 August 2014, National Renewal debuts its new logo with a blue and red star gradient colours. In August 2014 the deputy [[Gaspar Rivas]] left the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publimetro.cl/nota/politico/diputado-gaspar-rivas-renuncio-a-renovacion-nacional-chao-con-rn/xIQnhg!hTrMwKO2s2U9c/|title=Diputado Gaspar Rivas: \"Renuncio a Renovación Nacional.

On 22 November 2014, on a Doctrinal Council held in [[Pucón]], National Renewal drafted a new statement of principles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2014/11/22/691210/consejo-de-rn-elimina-alusion-al-golpe-militar-de-su-declaracion-de-principios.html|title=Consejo de RN elimina alusión al Golpe Militar de su declaración de principios|work=EMOL|date=22 November 2014|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref> where they were eliminated references to the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état of September 11, 1973]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2014/12/20/695579/plebiscito-rn-aprobo-con-865-de-votos-eliminacion-de-referencia-al-golpe-en-sus-principios.html|title=Renovación Nacional aprobó la eliminación de referencia al golpe en sus principios|work=EMOL|date=20 December 2014|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>

On 4 October 2015, National Renewal formed with the [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI), [[Political Evolution]] (Evópoli) and the [[Independent Regionalist Party]] (PRI) the new centre-right coalition called [[Chile Vamos]].<ref>http://rbb.cl/cxyr</ref>

In July 2016, the Senator of National Renewal [[Manuel José Ossandón]] left the party to form his presidential candidacy in 2017. The National Renewal party, in 2017, accorded support the presidential candidacy of Sebastián Piñera within UDI and PRI to [[Chile Vamos presidential primary, 2017|primary elections]] of the centre-right coalition Chile Vamos.

In the parliamentary elections of 2017, National Renewal obtained 36 seats in the Chamber of Deputies with 17.80% of the votes and 8 seats in the Senate with 20.98% of the votes, thus becoming the most voted party in these elections and displacing its coalition partner, the Independent Democratic Union.

In 11 March 2018, for the second government of Sebastián Piñera, National Renewal has 5 Ministers, 8 Undersecretaries, 5 regional Intendants and 24 provincial Governors.

During the [[2018–19 in Scottish football|2018–19 season]] Kelty Hearts competed in the [[Lowland League]], the fifth tier of the [[Scottish football league system]], having been promoted from the [[East of Scotland Football League]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=KeltyHeartsFC|author=Kelty Hearts FC|number=872900346514984962|date=8 June 2017|title=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DB0qOWXXoAENZqR.jpg}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/sport/15773167.No_sunshine_for_Leith_as_Hearts_win_again/|title=Kelty Hearts continue perfect East of Scotland League record at Leith Athletic|newspaper=[[Dunfermline Press]]|date=14 December 2017 |accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43821041 |title=Kelty Hearts eye SPFL as they close in on debut season title with 100% record |first=Brian |last=McLauchlin |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=19 April 2018 |accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> The club were previously members of the Fife Junior League and the [[Scottish Junior Football East Region Super League|SJFA East Superleague]], which is the highest division of the [[Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region|East Region]] of the [[Scottish Junior Football Association]].

== History ==
In 1975, Kelty Hearts were formed as Kelty Hearts Amateur Football Club. The club turned [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] after only a few years to remain competitive with other local sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keltyhearts.co.uk/club-history/4584810886|title=Kelty Hearts - History|publisher=Kelty Hearts|language=en|accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref> 

Kelty reached the [[Scottish Junior Cup]] final twice but were runners up both times. In 1999 they were defeated 1–0 by [[Kilwinning Rangers F.C.|Kilwinning Rangers]], and in 2007 they were defeated 2–1 after extra time by [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_cups/6717345.stm|title=Linlithgow Rose 2-1 Kelty Hearts|date=2007-06-03|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Kelty looked to move away from being a [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] side after winning the [[Scottish Junior Football East Region Super League|East Region Super League]] for the second time in [[2016-17 East Superleague|2017]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/news/15342381.Kelty_accepted_into_East_of_Scotland_League/|title=Kelty accepted into East of Scotland League|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> The club applied for membership to join the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] and in December 2017 became a full [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] member, making them eligible to enter the [[Scottish Cup]] as well as joining the [[Scottish football league system]] as a senior club.<ref name=\":0\" />

After being accepted into and winning the [[East of Scotland Football League]] in [[2017–18 East of Scotland Football League|2018]], Kelty were promoted to the [[Lowland League]] (the fifth tier of the [[Scottish football league system]]) for the [[2018–19 in Scottish football|2018–19 season]] after a comprehensive 10–0 aggregate win over [[Threave Rovers F.C.|Threave Rovers]] in the [[2017–18 Lowland Football League#Lowland League play-off|promotion play-off]].<ref name=prom18>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parsreview.org/view-from-the-stands/kelty-hearts-win-promotion-to-lowland-league|title=KELTY HEARTS WIN PROMOTION TO LOWLAND LEAGUE|website=Pars Review|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/sport/16235040.kelty-hearts-celebrate-lowland-league-promotion/|title=The only way is up for Kelty!|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref>

=== Rivalries ===
Kelty share a fierce local rivalry with [[East of Scotland Football League|East of Scotland]] team [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath Hawthorn]]. 

Both clubs were founded in the same year in 1975. The rivalry mainly stems from the close proximity of the two clubs and both being very successful [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] sides within the Fife League. Kelty and [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath]] would often exchange Fife league title wins from year to year, also frequently meet in cup competitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dunfermlinepress.com/sport/15034481.hearts-and-haws-set-for-junior-cup-cracker/|title=Hearts and Haws set for Junior Cup cracker|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref> 

Kelty Hearts are currently in the league above [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath]], competing in the [[Lowland Football League|Lowland League]]. However, they can still face each other in some cup competitions. 

Kelty's other rivals include [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]], another successful former [[Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region|East junior]] side, who they have faced in both league and cup competitions.<ref name=\":1\" /> 

A lot of [[Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region|West junior]] teams had considered Kelty competitive rivals due to the clubs success in the [[Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region|East]] and meeting several times in the [[Scottish Junior Cup]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irvinetimes.com/news/15113704.buffs-send-kelty-packing/|title=Buffs send Kelty packing|website=Irvine Times|language=en|access-date=2018-12-31}}</ref>

'''Abū al-Husayn Bajkam al-Mākānī''' ({{lang-ar|أبو الحسين بجكم المكاني}}), referred to as '''Bajkam''', '''Badjkam''' or '''Bachkam''' (from ''Bäčkäm'', a Persian and Turkish word meaning a horse- or [[yak]]-tail<ref name=\"EI2\">Canard (1960), pp. 866–867</ref>), was a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] military commander and official of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. A former ''[[ghilman|ghulam]]'' of the [[Ziyarid dynasty]], Bajkam entered Abbasid service following the assassination of the Ziyarid ruler [[Mardavij]] in 935. During his five-year tenure at the Caliphate's court at [[Baghdad]], he was granted the title of ''[[amir al-umara]]'', consolidating his dominance over the Caliphs [[ar-Radi]] and [[al-Muttaqi]] and giving him absolute power over their domains. Bajkam was challenged throughout his rule by various opponents, including his predecessor as ''amir al-umara'', [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], the [[Basra]]-based Baridis, and the [[Buyid dynasty]] of Iran, but he succeeded in retaining control until his death. He was murdered by a party of [[Kurds]] during a hunting excursion in 941, shortly after the accession of al-Muttaqi as Caliph. Bajkam was known both for his firm rule and for his patronage of Baghdad intellectuals, who respected and in some cases befriended him. His death led to a void in central power, resulting in a brief period of instability and fighting in Baghdad.

== Early military career and service under Ibn Ra'iq ==
Details of Bajkam's early life are unknown. He was a [[Turkic peoples|Turk]], and began his career as one of the ''[[ghilman]]'' (military slaves, usually of Turkish origin) of a [[vizier]] to the [[Daylamite]] warlord [[Makan ibn Kaki]] in northern [[Iran]].{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}} His master then made a gift of his ''ghilman'', including Bajkam, to Makan.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}} The latter took care of the young Bajkam's training and education, something for which the latter showed his gratitude by adopting his patron's name as his ''[[Nisbat (onomastics)|nisba]]'' (surname).<ref name=\"EI2\"/>

After Makan was defeated by [[Mardavij]], founder of the [[Ziyarid dynasty]], who came to control [[Daylam]], [[Jibal]] and [[Tabaristan]], he entered Mardavij's service, along with many others among Makan's ''ghilman''.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}}<ref name=\"EI2\"/> Mardavij mistreated his ''ghilman'', who consequently murdered him at [[Isfahan]] in January 935, an act in which Bajkam may have been complicit.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}}<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=Iranica>Nagel (1990), pp. 578–586</ref> After Mardavij's death, most of the ''ghilman'' in Ziyarid service dispersed. Bajkam and his fellow officer [[Tuzun (amir al-umara)|Tuzun]] assumed the leadership of a large group and, after first offering their services to the new governor of Jibal, Hasan ibn Harun, proceeded to the [[Abbasid]] court at [[Baghdad]].<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Busse\">Busse (1975), p. 256</ref> At first, their offers were rejected by the court, where the Caliph's ''Hujjariya'' bodyguards jealously guarded their prerogatives, but the ''ghilman'' were eventually taken into the service of [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], governor of [[Basra]] and [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]] in southern [[Iraq (region)|Iraq]]. Now known as ''Bajkam Ra'iqi'', Bajkam created a large military force under his command consisting of his own followers as well as additional Turks and Daylamites summoned from Jibal.<ref name=\"EI2\"/>

In early November 936, the Caliph [[al-Radi]] ({{reign|934|940}}) bestowed the newly created title of ''[[amir al-umara]]'' (\"commander of commanders\") on Ibn Ra'iq, who was effectively granted absolute control over the Caliphate. This provoked the reaction of various provincial governors as well as that of powerful interest groups in Baghdad itself, such as the caliphal bodyguards. Against them, Ibn Ra'iq employed Bajkam and his Turkish supporters. With their aid, he managed to neutralize the ''Hujariyya'' and Saji guard units, after which, in February 937, Bajkam was rewarded with the posts of ''[[sahib al-shurta]]'' (chief of police) and governor of the eastern provinces.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Muir 569\">Muir (1924), p. 569</ref>

Far more difficult and protracted was the war against the ambitious governor of [[Ahwaz]], [[Abu Abdallah al-Baridi]], who aimed to supplant Ibn Ra'iq.<ref name=\"EI2\"/> Al-Baridi's family was of [[Basra]]n origin, and had served the Abbasids in various roles as officials before managing to assert a weak hold over [[Khuzistan]].<ref name=Iranica/> Ibn Ra'iq himself was defeated and forced to leave Basra to the Baridis, but Bajkam saved the situation by scoring two major victories, despite being outnumbered, that allowed him to take possession of Khuzistan. The hard-pressed al-Baridi now turned to his powerful neighbour, the [[Buyid]] ruler of [[Fars Province|Fars]], [['Imad al-Dawla|Ali ibn Buya]], for help. Ali's brother [[Mu'izz al-Dawla|Ahmad]] soon took over Khuzistan, and Ibn Ra'iq was forced to offer possession of the province as an independent domain if Bajkam would recover it. Bajkam however was repulsed by the Buyid forces, and fell back to Wasit.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=Iranica/>

Ignoring Ibn Ra'iq's orders to retake Khuzistan, Bajkam remained at Wasit, and began plotting to depose Ibn Ra'iq himself. To this end, Bajkam began seeking allies: he offered the governorship of Wasit to the Baridis, and through the former [[vizier]] [[Ibn Muqla]], who wished to avenge himself on Ibn Ra'iq for his own downfall and confiscation of his property, gained the covert support of Caliph al-Radi himself.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Mottahedeh\">Mottahedeh (2001), p. 92</ref> In September 938, Bajkam led his troops from Wasit to Baghdad. Ibn Ra'iq tried without success to impede his advance by destroying the great dams of the [[Nahrawan Canal]] and flooding the plain, but Bajkam's army entered the Abbasid capital without opposition, and al-Radi immediately transferred Ibn Ra'iq's title of ''amir al-umara'' to Bajkam.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Muir 569\"/>

== ''Amir al-umara'' ==
[[File:Iraq Ninth Century.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of Iraq in the 9th–10th centuries]]
Despite the continued relegation of al-Radi to a ceremonial role, the relationship between the Caliph and Bajkam was strong, with al-Radi praising Bajkam for his harsh discipline and referring to the latter as his \"protégé\". Al-Radi was appreciative of Bajkam's respect for his position as Caliph, and promised his support for the ''amir al-umara''.<ref name=\"Mottahedeh\"/>

In October–November 938, Bajkam and the Caliph campaigned against the influential [[Hamdanid]] emir of [[Mosul]], [[Nasir al-Dawla|Hasan ibn Abdallah]], who had taken advantage of the turmoil in Iraq to cease forwarding his province's revenue to Baghdad. Although Bajkam's army captured Mosul, Hasan fled before him to the remotest corners of his domain, where Bajkam's forces pursued him in vain. In the meantime, the local population resented the presence of the caliphal troops and launched guerilla warfare against them, while Ibn Ra'iq used Bajkam's absence to take control of Baghdad at the head of a [[Carmathian]] force. These developments forced Bajkam to negotiate with his rivals: the Hamdanids were restored in their province in exchange for the payment of the tax arrears, and Ibn Ra'iq was bought off with the governorship of the provinces of [[Tariq al-Furat]], [[Diyar Mudar]], [[Jund Qinnasrin|Qinnasrin]] and [[al-'Awasim]], which were also claimed by the [[Ikhshidids]] of [[Egypt]]. This arrangement allowed Bajkam and the Caliph to return to Baghdad in February 939.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref>Muir (1924), pp. 569–570</ref>

Bajkam, having consolidated his control over Baghdad, now turned to face the threat posed by the Buyids. To this end, he strengthened his ties with the Baridis of Basra, by handing over Wasit, as previously agreed, appointing Abu Abdallah al-Baridi as vizier of the Abbasid court (although the latter remained at Wasit and did not visit Baghdad), and, finally, by marrying himself to one of al-Baridi's daughters.<ref name=\"EI2\"/> Neither side really trusted the other—Bajkam is said to have remarked of his father-in-law, an inveterate intriguer, that his \"turban covered the head not of a man but of a devil\"—but the deal allowed a fragile peace to prevail in Iraq.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=362}}

Bajkam's success against the Buyids was mixed: Wasit was saved from Buyid attack, and the Baridis led a successful campaign in [[Susiana]], but an expedition into Jibal was crushed by the third Buyid brother, [[Rukn al-Dawla|Hasan]].<ref name=\"EI2\"/> The alliance with the Baridis quickly soured, however, as al-Baridi still maintained his ambition of replacing Bajkam, and Bajkam was aware of this. In late August 940, Bajkam removed al-Baridi from the vizierate and launched an attack on Wasit, which the Baridis abandoned without resistance.<ref name=\"EI2\"/> In the meantime, the Baghdad was in turmoil as religious violence had become commonplace, with fanatical members of the [[Hanbali]] school imposing their tenets on the general populace.<ref>Muir (1924), pp. 570–571</ref>

In December 940, al-Radi died.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Qaddumi\">Qaddūmī (1996), p. 191</ref> Bajkam remained at Wasit, but sent his secretary to Baghdad to convene a council of Abbasid aristocrats, who selected [[al-Muttaqi]] ({{reign|940|944}}), al-Radi's brother, as Caliph.<ref name=\"Muir 572\">Muir (1924), p. 572</ref> Bajkam also sent a slave named Takinak to the deceased Caliph's palace, the [[Dar al-Sultan]], to procure various items, including the valuable al-Yatimah pearl.<ref name=\"Qaddumi\"/><ref name=\"Shalem\">Shalem (1997), p. 43</ref> He also obtained three female slaves from al-Radi's palace, whose singing he remembered from his earlier visits to the Caliph.<ref name=\"Qaddumi\"/>

Among al-Muttaqi's first actions as Caliph was the confirmation of Bajkam as ''amir al-umara''. Despite al-Muttaqi's gesture of support, Bajkam still faced opposition among the semi-autonomous provincial governors, including al-Baridi.<ref name=\"Muir 572\"/>

== Death and ensuing anarchy ==

Bajkam opened a campaign against al-Baridi in early spring 941. His lieutenants were at first defeated by the Baridis, whereupon Bajkam himself left Wasit to take the field. On his way to join his army, however, he was informed that his generals had achieved a major victory over the Baridis, and decided to return to Wasit. On 21 April 941, while travelling, he took part in a hunting excursion, during which he and his party inadvertently encountered a band of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] brigands. During a brief skirmish, Bajkam was slain when one of the Kurds stabbed him in the back with his lance.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Muir 572\"/>

Bajkam's unexpected death created a power vacuum in Baghdad, with disagreements between Daylamite and Turkish forces prompting the former to join the defeated al-Baridi.<ref name=\"Muir 572\"/> With their assistance, he marched on Wasit and Baghdad, capturing them, but was soon forced to flee due to the disorder that followed his usurpation of power. A Daylamite chief named [[Kurankij]] replaced him as ''de facto'' ruler of Baghdad, but he imposed tyrannical rule, and al-Muttaqi appealed to the former ''amir al-umara'' Ibn Ra'iq for assistance.<ref name=\"Muir 572\"/>

Ibn Ra'iq soon retook control of Baghdad, but political turmoil did not cease with his re-installation as ''amir al-umara''. Once again, al-Baridi captured the city, and Ibn Ra'iq fled with the Caliph to Mosul, from where the Hamdanid rulers launched a successful attempt to restore them. The Hamdanid emir Hasan, after ordering the assassination of Ibn Ra'iq, was made ''amir al-umara'' and given the ''laqab'' of [[Nasir al-Dawla]] (\"Defender of the Dynasty\"). In 943, the Hamdanids were forced to retreat to Mosul when Tuzun, one of Bajkam's officers, seized power with military support; the following year, Tuzun captured, blinded, and deposed al-Muttaqi, assuming the role of ''amir al-umara''. The Caliph's brother, [[al-Mustakfi]] (r. 944–946), was appointed as his successor. The competition for control of the Caliph ended in 945, when the Buyid Ahmad took over the position of  ''amir al-umara'' with the title of Mu'izz al-Dawla. This begun the period of undisputed Buyid control over Baghdad and Iraq, which lasted until the [[Seljuk conquest]] in the 1050s.<ref>Muir (1924), pp. 572–580</ref>

== Character ==
Despite his slave origin, Bajkam was educated in Arabic (although he reportedly did not speak it for fear of making mistakes), respected by intellectuals and was known to seek the company of such men as [[Abu Bakr bin Yahya al-Suli|al-Suli]] and the physician [[Sinan ibn Thabit]]. It is in their writings that glimpses of his character survive. According to the researcher [[Marius Canard]], Bajkam was \"covetous of power and money, he did not hesitate to resort to dissimulation and ruse, corruption and torture to attain his ends; he was at times cruel, though his bravery was legendary, and was more upright in character than Ibn Ra'iq\". Bajkam was also solicitous for the welfare of his subjects, and especially the inhabitants of Wasit cherished his memory.<ref name=\"EI2\"/>

In December 940, al-Radi died.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Qaddumi\">Qaddūmī (1996), p. 191</ref> Bajkam remained at Wasit, but sent his secretary to Baghdad to convene a council of Abbasid aristocrats, who selected [[al-Muttaqi]] ({{reign|940|944}}), al-Radi's brother, as Caliph.<ref name=\"Muir 572\">Muir (1924), p. 572</ref> Bajkam also sent a slave named Takinak to the deceased Caliph's palace, the [[Dar al-Sultan]], to procure various items, including the valuable al-Yatimah pearl.<ref name=\"Qaddumi\"/><ref name=\"Shalem\">Shalem (1997), p. 43</ref> He also obtained three female slaves from al-Radi's palace, whose singing he remembered from his earlier visits to the Caliph.<ref name=\"Qaddumi\"/>

Among al-Muttaqi's first actions as Caliph was the confirmation of Bajkam as ''amir al-umara''. Despite al-Muttaqi's gesture of support, Bajkam still faced opposition among the semi-autonomous provincial governors, including al-Baridi.<ref name=\"Muir 572\"/>

== Death and ensuing anarchy ==

Bajkam opened a campaign against al-Baridi in early spring 941. His lieutenants were at first defeated by the Baridis, whereupon Bajkam himself left Wasit to take the field. On his way to join his army, however, he was informed that his generals had achieved a major victory over the Baridis, and decided to return to Wasit. On 21 April 941, while travelling, he took part in a hunting excursion, during which he and his party inadvertently encountered a band of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] brigands. During a brief skirmish, Bajkam was slain when one of the Kurds stabbed him in the back with his lance.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Muir 572\"/>

Bajkam's unexpected death created a power vacuum in Baghdad, with disagreements between Daylamite and Turkish forces prompting the former to join the defeated al-Baridi.<ref name=\"Muir 572\"/> With their assistance, he marched on Wasit and Baghdad, capturing them, but was soon forced to flee due to the disorder that followed his usurpation of power. A Daylamite chief named [[Kurankij]] replaced him as ''de facto'' ruler of Baghdad, but he imposed tyrannical rule, and al-Muttaqi appealed to the former ''amir al-umara'' Ibn Ra'iq for assistance.<ref name=\"Muir 572\"/>

Ibn Ra'iq soon retook control of Baghdad, but political turmoil did not cease with his re-installation as ''amir al-umara''. Once again, al-Baridi captured the city, and Ibn Ra'iq fled with the Caliph to Mosul, from where the Hamdanid rulers launched a successful attempt to restore them. The Hamdanid emir Hasan, after ordering the assassination of Ibn Ra'iq, was made ''amir al-umara'' and given the ''laqab'' of [[Nasir al-Dawla]] (\"Defender of the Dynasty\"). In 943, the Hamdanids were forced to retreat to Mosul when Tuzun, one of Bajkam's officers, seized power with military support; the following year, Tuzun captured, blinded, and deposed al-Muttaqi, assuming the role of ''amir al-umara''. The Caliph's brother, [[al-Mustakfi]] (r. 944–946), was appointed as his successor. The competition for control of the Caliph ended in 945, when the Buyid Ahmad took over the position of  ''amir al-umara'' with the title of Mu'izz al-Dawla. This begun the period of undisputed Buyid control over Baghdad and Iraq, which lasted until the [[Seljuk conquest]] in the 1050s.<ref>Muir (1924), pp. 572–580</ref>

== Character ==
Despite his slave origin, Bajkam was educated in Arabic (although he reportedly did not speak it for fear of making mistakes), respected by intellectuals and was known to seek the company of such men as [[Abu Bakr bin Yahya al-Suli|al-Suli]] and the physician [[Sinan ibn Thabit]]. It is in their writings that glimpses of his character survive. According to the researcher [[Marius Canard]], Bajkam was \"covetous of power and money, he did not hesitate to resort to dissimulation and ruse, corruption and torture to attain his ends; he was at times cruel, though his bravery was legendary, and was more upright in character than Ibn Ra'iq\". Bajkam was also solicitous for the welfare of his subjects, and especially the inhabitants of Wasit cherished his memory.<ref name=\"EI2\"/>

[[File:Luther at the Diet of Worms.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|''Luther at the Diet of Worms'', by  [[Anton von Werner]], 1877]]
The '''Diet of Worms 1521''' ({{lang-de|Reichstag zu Worms}} {{IPA-de|ˈʁaɪçstaːk tsuː ˈvɔɐms|}}) was an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial]] [[diet (assembly)|diet]] (assembly) of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] called by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. It was held at the Heylshof Garden in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], then an [[Imperial Free City]] of the Empire. An imperial diet was a formal deliberative assembly of the whole Empire. This one is most memorable for the '''Edict of Worms''' (''Wormser Edikt''), which addressed [[Martin Luther]] and the effects of the [[Protestant Reformation]].
It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521, with the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] presiding.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130102175338/http://www.worms.de/downloads/Chronik.pdf Chronik der Stadt Worms] Internet Archive</ref>

Other imperial diets took place at Worms in the years 829, 926, 1076, 1122, [[Diet of Worms (1495)|1495]], and 1545, but unless plainly qualified, the term \"Diet of Worms\" usually refers to the assembly of 1521.

In June of the previous year, 1520, [[Pope Leo X]] issued the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' (\"Arise, O Lord\"), outlining forty-one purported errors found in [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Ninety-five Theses]] and other writings related to or written by him. Luther was summoned by the emperor. Prince [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]] obtained an agreement that if Luther appeared he would be promised safe passage to and from the meeting. This guarantee was essential after the treatment of [[Jan Hus]], who was tried and executed at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 despite a promise of safe conduct.

[[Emperor Charles V]] commenced the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of Worms on 23 January 1521. Luther was summoned to renounce or reaffirm his views. When he appeared before the assembly on 16 April, Johann Eck<!-- Do not link to [[Johann Eck]]—a different person by the same name-->, an assistant of the [[Archbishop of Trier]] ([[Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads]] at that time), acted as spokesman for the emperor.

==Martin Luther==
[[File:Luther-in-Worms-auf-Rt.jpg|thumb|Luther in Worms, colorized woodcut, 1577]]
The main events of the Diet of Worms relating to Luther took place from 16 to 18 April 1521.

On 16 April, Luther arrived in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. Luther was told to appear before the Diet at 4 p.m. the following day. Dr Jeromee Schurff, Wittenberg professor in Canon Law, was to act as Luther's lawyer before the Diet.

On 17 April, the imperial marshal, Ulrich von Pappenheim, and the herald, Caspar Sturm, came for Luther.<ref>{{cite book |title=History of the Christian Church |last= Schaff|first= Philip|year=2015 |publisher=Arkrose Press |isbn= 1346209650 |page=145}}</ref> Pappenheim reminded Luther that he should speak only in answer to direct questions from the presiding officer, [[Johann Eck]]. Eck asked if a collection of books was Luther's and if he was ready to revoke their heresies. Dr Schurff said, \"Please have the titles read.\" There were 25 of them, probably including ''The 95 Theses'', ''Resolutions Concerning the 95 Theses'', ''On the Papacy at Rome'', ''Address to the Christian Nobility'', ''The Babylonian Captivity of the Church'', and ''On the Freedom of a Christian''. Luther requested more time for a proper answer, so he was given until the next day at 4 p.m. On 18 April, Luther, saying that he had prayed for long hours and consulted with friends and mediators, presented himself before the Diet. When the counselor put the same questions to him, Luther first apologized that he lacked the etiquette of the court. Then he answered, \"They are all mine, but as for the second question, they are not all of one sort.\" Luther went on to place the writings into three categories: (1) Works which were well received even by his enemies: those he would not reject. (2) Books which attacked the abuses, lies and desolation of the [[Christianity|Christian]] world and the papacy: those, Luther believed, could not safely be rejected without encouraging abuses to continue. To retract them would be to open the door to further oppression.<ref name=\"Oberman\">Oberman, Heiko, ''Luther: Man Between God and the Devil'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-10313-1}}.</ref> \"If I now recant these, then, I would be doing nothing but strengthening tyranny\".<ref name=\"Oberman\"/> (3) Attacks on individuals: he apologized for the harsh tone of these writings but did not reject the substance of what he taught in them; if he could be shown by [[Scripture]] that his writings were in error, Luther continued, he would reject them.  Luther concluded by saying:

<blockquote>
Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.<ref name=Brecht>[[Martin Brecht|Brecht, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:460.</ref>
</blockquote>

According to tradition, Luther is said to have declared, \"Here I stand, I can do no other,\" before concluding with \"God help me. Amen.\"<ref name=\"christiainitytodayHIS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/aprilweb-only/4-8-52.0.html|title='Hier Stehe Ich!'|author=Elesha Coffman|work=ChristianityToday.com}}</ref> However, there is no indication in the transcripts of the Diet or in eyewitness accounts that he ever said this, and most scholars now doubt these words were spoken. 
[[File:Luther statue, Martin-Luther-Denkmal, Worms.JPG|thumb|Luther statue in Worms]]
According to Luther, Eck informed Luther that he was acting like a heretic:

<blockquote>
\"'Martin,' said he, 'there is no one of the heresies which have torn the bosom of the church, which has not derived its origin from the various interpretation of the Scripture. The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments. It was with biblical texts that [[Pelagius]] and [[Arius]] maintained their doctrines. Arius, for instance, found the negation of the eternity of the Word—an eternity which you admit, in this verse of the New Testament—''Joseph knew not his wife till she had brought forth her first-born son''; and he said, in the same way that you say, that this passage enchained him. When the fathers of the council of Constance condemned this proposition of John Huss—''The church of Jesus Christ is only the community of the elect'', they condemned an error; for the church, like a good mother, embraces within her arms all who bear the name of Christian, all who are called to enjoy the celestial beatitude.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/luther/lutherbyluther.html#secondnarrative|title=Life of Luther (Luther by Martin Luther)|author=Martin Luther|publisher=}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Private conferences were held to determine Luther's fate, but he was not arrested at Worms. Through negotiations by his prince, [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]], Luther had been given a letter of safe conduct to and from the hearing. After his dismissal he departed for his home in [[Wittenberg]]. However, fearing for Luther's safety, Frederick III sent men to fake a highway attack and abduct Luther, hiding him away at [[Wartburg]] Castle.

== Edict of Worms ==

The Edict of Worms was a decree issued on 25 May 1521 by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], declaring:

{{quote|For this reason we forbid anyone from this time forward to dare, either by words or by deeds, to receive, defend, sustain, or favour the said Martin Luther. On the contrary, we want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic, as he deserves, to be brought personally before us, or to be securely guarded until those who have captured him inform us, whereupon we will order the appropriate manner of proceeding against the said Luther. Those who will help in his capture will be rewarded generously for their good work.}}

The Papal [[nuncio]] at the diet, [[Girolamo Aleandro]], drew up and proposed the denunciations of Luther that were embodied in the Edict of Worms, promulgated on 26 May. The Edict declared Luther to be an obstinate heretic and banned the reading or possession of his writings.

It was the culmination of an ongoing struggle between Martin Luther and the [[Catholic Church]] over reform, especially concerning the practice of donations for [[indulgences]]. However, there were other deeper issues that revolved around both theological concerns:
*On a theological level, Luther had challenged the absolute authority of the Pope over the Church by maintaining that the doctrine of [[indulgences]], as authorized and taught by the Pope, was wrong.<ref name=Noll>{{cite book|last=Noll|first=Mark A.|title=Turning Points: Decisive Moments in the History of Christianity|origyear=1997|year=2000|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=978-0-8010-1159-7 |page=160}}</ref> 
*Luther maintained that salvation was by faith alone (''[[sola fide]]'') without reference to good works, alms, penance, or the [[Catholic Church|Church's]] [[Catholic sacraments|sacraments]]. Luther maintained that the sacraments were a \"means of grace,\" meaning that while grace was imparted through the Sacraments, the credit for the action belonged to God and not to the individual.<ref>{{cite web|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |title=Outlines of Doctrinal Theology |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt |publisher=Saint Louis, MO: Concordia Publishing House. p. 161. |accessdate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121113340/http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>
*He had also challenged the authority of the Church by maintaining that all doctrines and [[dogma]]ta of the Church not found in Scripture should be discarded (''[[sola scriptura]]'').

To protect the authority of the Pope and the Church, as well as to maintain the doctrine of indulgences, ecclesiastical officials convinced Charles V that Luther was a threat and persuaded him to authorize his condemnation by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Luther escaped arrest and remained in seclusion at [[Wartburg castle]] for several months where he continued to write and [[Luther Bible|translate the New Testament into German]].

== Other decisions==
The Diet of Worms was also the occasion for Charles V to reform the administration of the Empire. Given the vast domains of the House of Habsburg, the Emperor was often on the road and needed deputies (such as the [[Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governors of the Netherlands]] and the [[Regent of Spain|Regents of Spain]]) for the times he was absent from his territories. Charles V elevated his younger brother [[Emperor Ferdinand I|Ferdinand]] to the status of [[Archduke]] as Imperial Lieutenant. As such, Ferdinand became regent and governor of the [[Austrian hereditary lands]] of Charles V as well as his representative in Germany. Ferdinand's role as chairman of the German [[Imperial government]] was never really implemented and ended in 1523 with the dissolution of the body. Ferdinand's rule of the Austrian lands in the name of the Emperor was confirmed with the secret ''Habsburg compact of Brussels'' (1522), according to which Charles also agreed to favor the election of Ferdinand as [[King of the Romans]] in Germany (which took place [[Imperial election, 1531|in 1531]]). Following the abdications of Charles V in 1556, Ferdinand succeeded Charles as Emperor and became [[suo jure]] Archduke of Austria.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=XsQeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=compact+of+brussels+1522&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6yISOgY3kAhVhw8QBHS55ANkQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=compact%20of%20brussels%201522&f=false]</ref>

== Aftermath ==
Despite the agreement that he could return home safely, it was privately understood that Luther would soon be arrested and punished. To protect him from this fate, [[Frederick III of Saxony|Prince Frederick]] seized him on his way home and hid him in [[Wartburg Castle]]. It was during his time in the Wartburg Castle that Luther began his German translation of the Bible. Martin Luther's powerful testimony of faith at the Diet of Worms in 1521 made an indelible impression upon the mind of [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], who turned his eyes to the new faith earlier than any other German prince or any other member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. Moreover, Luther entered into correspondence with him, discussing with him the most important problems of faith. The edict was temporarily suspended at the [[Diet of Speyer 1526]] but then [[Diet of Speyer 1529|reinstated in 1529]].

When Luther eventually emerged from the Wartburg, the emperor, distracted with other matters, did not press for Luther's arrest. Ultimately, because of rising public support for Luther among the German people and the protection of certain German princes, the Edict of Worms was never enforced in Germany. However, in the Low Countries (comprising modern-day [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]]), the Edict was initially enforced against Luther's most active supporters. This could be done because these countries were under the direct rule of Emperor Charles V and his appointed regent, [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy]] (and Charles's aunt). In December 1521, Jacob Proost, prior of the [[Augustinian]] monastery in [[Antwerp]], was the first Luther-supporting cleric to be arrested and prosecuted under the terms of the Worms Edict. In February 1522, Proost was compelled to make public recantation and repudiation of Luther's teachings. Later that year, additional arrests were made among the Augustinians in Antwerp. Two monks, [[Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos]], refused to recant; on 1 July 1523, they were [[burned at the stake]] in Brussels.<ref>Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 2:102ff.</ref>

When the counselor put the same questions to him, Luther first apologized that he lacked the etiquette of the court. Then he answered, \"They are all mine, but as for the second question, they are not all of one sort.\" Luther went on to place the writings into three categories: (1) Works which were well received even by his enemies: those he would not reject. (2) Books which attacked the abuses, lies and desolation of the [[Christianity|Christian]] world and the papacy: those, Luther believed, could not safely be rejected without encouraging abuses to continue. To retract them would be to open the door to further oppression.<ref name=\"Oberman\">Oberman, Heiko, ''Luther: Man Between God and the Devil'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-10313-1}}.</ref> \"If I now recant these, then, I would be doing nothing but strengthening tyranny\".<ref name=\"Oberman\"/> (3) Attacks on individuals: he apologized for the harsh tone of these writings but did not reject the substance of what he taught in them; if he could be shown by [[Scripture]] that his writings were in error, Luther continued, he would reject them.  Luther concluded by saying:

<blockquote>
Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.<ref name=Brecht>[[Martin Brecht|Brecht, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:460.</ref>
</blockquote>

According to tradition, Luther is said to have declared, \"Here I stand, I can do no other,\" before concluding with \"God help me. Amen.\"<ref name=\"christiainitytodayHIS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/aprilweb-only/4-8-52.0.html|title='Hier Stehe Ich!'|author=Elesha Coffman|work=ChristianityToday.com}}</ref> However, there is no indication in the transcripts of the Diet or in eyewitness accounts that he ever said this, and most scholars now doubt these words were spoken. 
[[File:Luther statue, Martin-Luther-Denkmal, Worms.JPG|thumb|Luther statue in Worms]]
According to Luther, Eck informed Luther that he was acting like a heretic:

<blockquote>
\"'Martin,' said he, 'there is no one of the heresies which have torn the bosom of the church, which has not derived its origin from the various interpretation of the Scripture. The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments. It was with biblical texts that [[Pelagius]] and [[Arius]] maintained their doctrines. Arius, for instance, found the negation of the eternity of the Word—an eternity which you admit, in this verse of the New Testament—''Joseph knew not his wife till she had brought forth her first-born son''; and he said, in the same way that you say, that this passage enchained him. When the fathers of the council of Constance condemned this proposition of John Huss—''The church of Jesus Christ is only the community of the elect'', they condemned an error; for the church, like a good mother, embraces within her arms all who bear the name of Christian, all who are called to enjoy the celestial beatitude.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/luther/lutherbyluther.html#secondnarrative|title=Life of Luther (Luther by Martin Luther)|author=Martin Luther|publisher=}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Private conferences were held to determine Luther's fate, but he was not arrested at Worms. Through negotiations by his prince, [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]], Luther had been given a letter of safe conduct to and from the hearing. After his dismissal he departed for his home in [[Wittenberg]]. However, fearing for Luther's safety, Frederick III sent men to fake a highway attack and abduct Luther, hiding him away at [[Wartburg]] Castle.

== Edict of Worms ==

The Edict of Worms was a decree issued on 25 May 1521 by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], declaring:

{{quote|For this reason we forbid anyone from this time forward to dare, either by words or by deeds, to receive, defend, sustain, or favour the said Martin Luther. On the contrary, we want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic, as he deserves, to be brought personally before us, or to be securely guarded until those who have captured him inform us, whereupon we will order the appropriate manner of proceeding against the said Luther. Those who will help in his capture will be rewarded generously for their good work.}}

The Papal [[nuncio]] at the diet, [[Girolamo Aleandro]], drew up and proposed the denunciations of Luther that were embodied in the Edict of Worms, promulgated on 26 May. The Edict declared Luther to be an obstinate heretic and banned the reading or possession of his writings.

It was the culmination of an ongoing struggle between Martin Luther and the [[Catholic Church]] over reform, especially concerning the practice of donations for [[indulgences]]. However, there were other deeper issues that revolved around both theological concerns:
*On a theological level, Luther had challenged the absolute authority of the Pope over the Church by maintaining that the doctrine of [[indulgences]], as authorized and taught by the Pope, was wrong.<ref name=Noll>{{cite book|last=Noll|first=Mark A.|title=Turning Points: Decisive Moments in the History of Christianity|origyear=1997|year=2000|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=978-0-8010-1159-7 |page=160}}</ref> 
*Luther maintained that salvation was by faith alone (''[[sola fide]]'') without reference to good works, alms, penance, or the [[Catholic Church|Church's]] [[Catholic sacraments|sacraments]]. Luther maintained that the sacraments were a \"means of grace,\" meaning that while grace was imparted through the Sacraments, the credit for the action belonged to God and not to the individual.<ref>{{cite web|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |title=Outlines of Doctrinal Theology |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt |publisher=Saint Louis, MO: Concordia Publishing House. p. 161. |accessdate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121113340/http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>
*He had also challenged the authority of the Church by maintaining that all doctrines and [[dogma]]ta of the Church not found in Scripture should be discarded (''[[sola scriptura]]'').

To protect the authority of the Pope and the Church, as well as to maintain the doctrine of indulgences, ecclesiastical officials convinced Charles V that Luther was a threat and persuaded him to authorize his condemnation by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Luther escaped arrest and remained in seclusion at [[Wartburg castle]] for several months where he continued to write and [[Luther Bible|translate the New Testament into German]].

== Other decisions==
The Diet of Worms was also the occasion for Charles V to reform the administration of the Empire. Given the vast domains of the House of Habsburg, the Emperor was often on the road and needed deputies (such as the [[Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governors of the Netherlands]] and the [[Regent of Spain|Regents of Spain]]) for the times he was absent from his territories. Charles V elevated his younger brother [[Emperor Ferdinand I|Ferdinand]] to the status of [[Archduke]] as Imperial Lieutenant. As such, Ferdinand became regent and governor of the [[Austrian hereditary lands]] of Charles V as well as his representative in Germany. Ferdinand's role as chairman of the German [[Imperial government]] was never really implemented and ended in 1523 with the dissolution of the body. Ferdinand's rule of the Austrian lands in the name of the Emperor was confirmed with the secret ''Habsburg compact of Brussels'' (1522), according to which Charles also agreed to favor the election of Ferdinand as [[King of the Romans]] in Germany (which took place [[Imperial election, 1531|in 1531]]). Following the abdications of Charles V in 1556, Ferdinand succeeded Charles as Emperor and became [[suo jure]] Archduke of Austria.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=XsQeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=compact+of+brussels+1522&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6yISOgY3kAhVhw8QBHS55ANkQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=compact%20of%20brussels%201522&f=false]</ref>

== Aftermath ==
Despite the agreement that he could return home safely, it was privately understood that Luther would soon be arrested and punished. To protect him from this fate, [[Frederick III of Saxony|Prince Frederick]] seized him on his way home and hid him in [[Wartburg Castle]]. It was during his time in the Wartburg Castle that Luther began his German translation of the Bible. Martin Luther's powerful testimony of faith at the Diet of Worms in 1521 made an indelible impression upon the mind of [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], who turned his eyes to the new faith earlier than any other German prince or any other member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. Moreover, Luther entered into correspondence with him, discussing with him the most important problems of faith. The edict was temporarily suspended at the [[Diet of Speyer 1526]] but then [[Diet of Speyer 1529|reinstated in 1529]].

When Luther eventually emerged from the Wartburg, the emperor, distracted with other matters, did not press for Luther's arrest. Ultimately, because of rising public support for Luther among the German people and the protection of certain German princes, the Edict of Worms was never enforced in Germany. However, in the Low Countries (comprising modern-day [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]]), the Edict was initially enforced against Luther's most active supporters. This could be done because these countries were under the direct rule of Emperor Charles V and his appointed regent, [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy]] (and Charles's aunt). In December 1521, Jacob Proost, prior of the [[Augustinian]] monastery in [[Antwerp]], was the first Luther-supporting cleric to be arrested and prosecuted under the terms of the Worms Edict. In February 1522, Proost was compelled to make public recantation and repudiation of Luther's teachings. Later that year, additional arrests were made among the Augustinians in Antwerp. Two monks, [[Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos]], refused to recant; on 1 July 1523, they were [[burned at the stake]] in Brussels.<ref>Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 2:102ff.</ref>

The 1522 and 1524 [[Diets of Nuremberg]] attempted to execute the judgement of the Edict of Worms against Luther, but they failed.<ref>1899 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3NBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA350&dq=Nuremberg+Convention+(1522-1523)&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCuOGgtvjfAhVMooMKHRkIBSoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Nuremberg%20Convention%20(1522-1523)&f=false Lutheran Cyclopedia] article titled \"Nuremberg Convention\"</ref>

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

St. Margaret's House began in early 1888 when Miss Elizabeth Anson distributed a leaflet in Oxford asking for support for a Ladies’ Mission. What later became St. Margaret's House was initially called the Bethnal Green Ladies Committee. 
 
[[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]], another settlement in Bethnal Green, had formed in 1884 and in 1886, founded the Federation of Working Men's Clubs.<ref>Baker, T F T. \"[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp147-155 Bethnal Green: Social and Cultural Activities\",] in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11, Stepney, Bethnal Green, British History Online  pp. 147-155, London, 1998). Retrieved 31 August 2018.</ref>  Thus,  St. Margaret's House acted as the female equivalent of Oxford House.
 
The name for the house came in the early 1890s when the Oxford ladies took a lease for the ‘eminently suitable’ premises at 4 Victoria Park Square, which had space for 8 or 9 residents and three living rooms, with suitable offices.<ref>St Margaret’s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989  pg 3</ref> On 21 March 1893, after a short service read by the Bishop of Bedford, St. Margaret's House was opened by H.R.H Princess Mary Adelaide.<ref>St Margaret’s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989  pg 4</ref>

=== Development of community work ===

The house's early pioneering work included the Children's Country Holiday Fund, the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants, district and hospital visits, a needlework scheme to employ very poor women through the winter months, and running the club for girls.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 2</ref> 
 
A small chapel was built by residents and on St. Margaret's Day in June 1904,  Bishop Winnington Ingram came to dedicate the chapel.<ref>St Margaret’s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989  pg 5
</ref>

=== Call for Residents ===

In December 1900, the Georgian Town House of 21 Old Ford Road, which belonged to the Female Guardians Association, was bought by the organisation and became the centre for the settlement.<ref>St Margaret’s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989  pg 5
</ref> On 5 May 1903, [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom]] officially opened the new house.
 
The women living in St. Margaret's House wrote to the Editor of [[the Spectator]] in February 1903 to call out for other women to become residents. \"Our object is to secure two or three permanent residents to fill the place of some who have had to leave us unexpectedly.\" S. Talbot, a resident, wrote.  To become a resident at this point, it cost 20s to 25s per week, and each woman had to do a three-month trial before becoming an official resident.<ref>Talbot, S. [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/22nd-february-1902/17/st-margarets-house-bethnal-green \"St. Margaret’s House, Bethnal Green.\"], The Spectator, pp. 17, London 22 February 1902. Retrieved 31 August 2018</ref>

=== The First World War ===

[[World War I|The Great War]] meant fewer people were signing up to be residents of St. Margaret's House, and membership of the clubs dropped off because the blackout stopped girls from being able to attend.
 
The Hon. Mrs Whittuck, a committee member of the  House, had died before the war in 1915;, two years later, her executors called in the balance of her debt, which included the loan she had taken out to buy St. Margaret's House. With funds limited in an already difficult time, it looked like St. Margaret's House would have to close. But an anonymous benefactor cleared off most of St. Margaret's House's debt, allowing it to remain open.<ref>Beauman, Katherine Bentley [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iMrJN5xz8SAC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=Hon.+Mrs+Whittuck+st+margaret%27s+house&source=bl&ots=gik4jKgz_X&sig=FWtzQgTuIpd6KdRbnbUiheHCTA4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIuvvH9pvcAhWMX8AKHXNJDL4Q6AEISTAD#v=onepage&q=Hon.%20Mrs%20Whittuck%20st%20margaret's%20house&f=false \"Women and the Settlement Movement\"] pp. 97, Radcliffe Press, 1993. Retrieved 31 August 2018</ref>

=== In between wars ===

The social upheavals following the War meant residents were no longer ladies of independent means, but working people, including teachers and librarians, helping with House activities as part of their rent.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 2</ref>
 
And by the early 1920s, St. Margaret's House had fourteen residents, including the Head and the Bursar, six lodgers engaged in teaching or social work, two medical students and one Charity Organisation Society worker. At this point, the settlement still only housed women.
 
In 1924, St. Margaret's House started a children's play hours’ scheme twice a week for over 50 children in Bethnal Green. This same year, the house also helped launch the local branch of the Industrial Christian Fellowship. 
 
The house secured the services of Eleanor Kelly in 1929, who was a founding member of the Association of Welfare Workers. She said of her work, \"All firms who had been doing welfare work before the outbreak of war were asked to take relays of people (mostly women) to train.\"<ref>Woollacott, Angela [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612029400200043 \"Maternalism, professionalism and industrial welfare supervisors in World War I Britain\"]	, Women's History Review, 3:1, 29-56. Retrieved 31 August 2018.</ref>

=== Continued financial difficulties ===

But St. Margaret's House again faced financial difficulties in this period and, in 1921, they were charging £2 a term for the training of students to help improve their financial situation.
 
With the [[Great Depression]], the 1930s saw a terrible period of unemployment in the East End. This meant that from 1933, St. Margaret's House assisted in the running of both the Peel Grove Hobbies Centre for the unemployed and the Unemployed Men's Centre.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 3
</ref> They also started to send out food parcels to old-aged pensioners and the very poor.

=== The Second World War and post-war ===

With the outbreak of war, the Bethnal Green branch of the Citizens Advice Bureaux was organised in the House, and the House became an evacuation sub-office during [[the Blitz]].<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 3</ref>
 
Half of the houses in Bethnal Green were destroyed by bombing during the [[World War II|Second World War]], but St. Margaret's House escaped serious damage. Though there were  several near misses, including an incendiary bomb which fell on the chapel roof and failed to ignite.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 5
</ref> Post-war, the main house had to undergo extensive repair, including a new roof and rewiring. 
 
In 1953, the council decided that men could live at St. Margaret's House as well as women, as the number of female students wishing to take up residence at the house had declined.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 5</ref>
 
Throughout the 1960s and 70s, St. Margaret's House continued to face financial ups and downs, but a visit by the poet laureate, Sir [[John Betjeman]], in 1975, helped to raise enough money to get the house through this financial crisis. 
 
And throughout the 1980s, St. Margaret's House began new, community-centred initiatives with organisations including Bethnal Green Citizens Advice Bureau, the Tower Hamlets Vietnamese Families Association, and the Activity in Retirement Workcentre.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 11</ref>

=== Expansion of St. Margaret’s House ===

In June 1993, the settlement became the leaseholder of two adjoining buildings, number 15 and 17 Old Ford Road. With more space, the House expanded its work and, from the extra revenue generated, the House established its Community Arts Project.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 10</ref>
 
And by 2001, with funding from both public and private sources, St. Margaret's House was able to buy both of these houses.
 
In 2006, the House opened the Gallery Café and they now manage four separate community projects out of their buildings, which are the Gallery Café, Ayoka Charity Shop, Yoganest and The Create Place.

=== The Gallery Café ===

From 1900 until the late 1980s, the café was used by St. Margaret's House as a place for the residents to provide social welfare services for local people. Since then, it has played host to lots of organisations, including a Vietnamese luncheon club, and the Rathbone society, who ran a training project for people with learning difficulties.
 
But the space opened as a vegetarian not-for-profit, community café in 2006, and became a fully vegan café in December 2017.<ref>Fat Gay Vegan, [http://fatgayvegan.com/2018/01/08/london-cafe-turns-totally-vegan/ \"London Cafe Turns Totally Vegan\"], 8 January 2018.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

St. Margaret's House began in early 1888 when Miss Elizabeth Anson distributed a leaflet in Oxford asking for support for a Ladies’ Mission. What later became St. Margaret's House was initially called the Bethnal Green Ladies Committee. 
 
[[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]], another settlement in Bethnal Green, had formed in 1884 and in 1886, founded the Federation of Working Men's Clubs.<ref>Baker, T F T. \"[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp147-155 Bethnal Green: Social and Cultural Activities\",] in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11, Stepney, Bethnal Green, British History Online  pp. 147-155, London, 1998). Retrieved 31 August 2018.</ref>  Thus,  St. Margaret's House acted as the female equivalent of Oxford House.
 
The name for the house came in the early 1890s when the Oxford ladies took a lease for the ‘eminently suitable’ premises at 4 Victoria Park Square, which had space for 8 or 9 residents and three living rooms, with suitable offices.<ref>St Margaret’s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989  pg 3</ref> On 21 March 1893, after a short service read by the Bishop of Bedford, St. Margaret's House was opened by H.R.H Princess Mary Adelaide.<ref>St Margaret’s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989  pg 4</ref>

=== Development of community work ===

The house's early pioneering work included the Children's Country Holiday Fund, the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants, district and hospital visits, a needlework scheme to employ very poor women through the winter months, and running the club for girls.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 2</ref> 
 
A small chapel was built by residents and on St. Margaret's Day in June 1904,  Bishop Winnington Ingram came to dedicate the chapel.<ref>St Margaret’s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989  pg 5
</ref>

=== Call for Residents ===

In December 1900, the Georgian Town House of 21 Old Ford Road, which belonged to the Female Guardians Association, was bought by the organisation and became the centre for the settlement.<ref>St Margaret’s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989  pg 5
</ref> On 5 May 1903, [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom]] officially opened the new house.
 
The women living in St. Margaret's House wrote to the Editor of [[the Spectator]] in February 1903 to call out for other women to become residents. \"Our object is to secure two or three permanent residents to fill the place of some who have had to leave us unexpectedly.\" S. Talbot, a resident, wrote.  To become a resident at this point, it cost 20s to 25s per week, and each woman had to do a three-month trial before becoming an official resident.<ref>Talbot, S. [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/22nd-february-1902/17/st-margarets-house-bethnal-green \"St. Margaret’s House, Bethnal Green.\"], The Spectator, pp. 17, London 22 February 1902. Retrieved 31 August 2018</ref>

=== The First World War ===

[[World War I|The Great War]] meant fewer people were signing up to be residents of St. Margaret's House, and membership of the clubs dropped off because the blackout stopped girls from being able to attend.
 
The Hon. Mrs Whittuck, a committee member of the  House, had died before the war in 1915;, two years later, her executors called in the balance of her debt, which included the loan she had taken out to buy St. Margaret's House. With funds limited in an already difficult time, it looked like St. Margaret's House would have to close. But an anonymous benefactor cleared off most of St. Margaret's House's debt, allowing it to remain open.<ref>Beauman, Katherine Bentley [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iMrJN5xz8SAC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=Hon.+Mrs+Whittuck+st+margaret%27s+house&source=bl&ots=gik4jKgz_X&sig=FWtzQgTuIpd6KdRbnbUiheHCTA4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIuvvH9pvcAhWMX8AKHXNJDL4Q6AEISTAD#v=onepage&q=Hon.%20Mrs%20Whittuck%20st%20margaret's%20house&f=false \"Women and the Settlement Movement\"] pp. 97, Radcliffe Press, 1993. Retrieved 31 August 2018</ref>

=== In between wars ===

The social upheavals following the War meant residents were no longer ladies of independent means, but working people, including teachers and librarians, helping with House activities as part of their rent.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 2</ref>
 
And by the early 1920s, St. Margaret's House had fourteen residents, including the Head and the Bursar, six lodgers engaged in teaching or social work, two medical students and one Charity Organisation Society worker. At this point, the settlement still only housed women.
 
In 1924, St. Margaret's House started a children's play hours’ scheme twice a week for over 50 children in Bethnal Green. This same year, the house also helped launch the local branch of the Industrial Christian Fellowship. 
 
The house secured the services of Eleanor Kelly in 1929, who was a founding member of the Association of Welfare Workers. She said of her work, \"All firms who had been doing welfare work before the outbreak of war were asked to take relays of people (mostly women) to train.\"<ref>Woollacott, Angela [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612029400200043 \"Maternalism, professionalism and industrial welfare supervisors in World War I Britain\"]	, Women's History Review, 3:1, 29-56. Retrieved 31 August 2018.</ref>

=== Continued financial difficulties ===

But St. Margaret's House again faced financial difficulties in this period and, in 1921, they were charging £2 a term for the training of students to help improve their financial situation.
 
With the [[Great Depression]], the 1930s saw a terrible period of unemployment in the East End. This meant that from 1933, St. Margaret's House assisted in the running of both the Peel Grove Hobbies Centre for the unemployed and the Unemployed Men's Centre.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 3
</ref> They also started to send out food parcels to old-aged pensioners and the very poor.

=== The Second World War and post-war ===

With the outbreak of war, the Bethnal Green branch of the Citizens Advice Bureaux was organised in the House, and the House became an evacuation sub-office during [[the Blitz]].<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 3</ref>
 
Half of the houses in Bethnal Green were destroyed by bombing during the [[World War II|Second World War]], but St. Margaret's House escaped serious damage. Though there were  several near misses, including an incendiary bomb which fell on the chapel roof and failed to ignite.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 5
</ref> Post-war, the main house had to undergo extensive repair, including a new roof and rewiring. 
 
In 1953, the council decided that men could live at St. Margaret's House as well as women, as the number of female students wishing to take up residence at the house had declined.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 5</ref>
 
Throughout the 1960s and 70s, St. Margaret's House continued to face financial ups and downs, but a visit by the poet laureate, Sir [[John Betjeman]], in 1975, helped to raise enough money to get the house through this financial crisis. 
 
And throughout the 1980s, St. Margaret's House began new, community-centred initiatives with organisations including Bethnal Green Citizens Advice Bureau, the Tower Hamlets Vietnamese Families Association, and the Activity in Retirement Workcentre.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 11</ref>

=== Expansion of St. Margaret’s House ===

In June 1993, the settlement became the leaseholder of two adjoining buildings, number 15 and 17 Old Ford Road. With more space, the House expanded its work and, from the extra revenue generated, the House established its Community Arts Project.<ref>St Margaret’s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 10</ref>
 
And by 2001, with funding from both public and private sources, St. Margaret's House was able to buy both of these houses.
 
In 2006, the House opened the Gallery Café and they now manage four separate community projects out of their buildings,which are the Gallery Café, Ayoka Charity Shop, Yoganest and The Create Place.

St. Margaret's House now includes the buildings at 15, 17, 21, 23, 27, and 29 Old Ford Road.
And, as of March 2017, the charity has 14 trustees. 28 employees and 18 volunteers<ref>BETA Charity Commission, [http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details%20st%20margaret's%20house \"St. Margaret's House\"], March 2017. Accessed 31 August 2018.</ref>

''Purple Haze'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 72, based on 7 reviews.<ref name=\"Meta\"/>

Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah applauded Anas' intellectual discipline in completing the writing which he describes as demanding mental toughness, tenacity and absolute patience. Policy makers, scholars and corporate figures are of the opinion that the views and ideas presented in the book can be usefully adopted for the formulation of policies by political parties and the government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians|url=http://www.gerakbudayaebooks.com/store/p27/Rich_Malaysia,_Poor_Malaysians.html|website=GERAKBUDAYA ebooks}}</ref>

It also explains the history, the regulations and mechanism used and the secret behind Petronas’ success.<ref>{{cite news|title=Are We In Fact Poor?|url=http://www.bfm.my/current-affairs-are-we-in-fact-poor-20140207.html|work=BFM: The Business Radio Station}}</ref>

On education, the book advocates revisiting the national education philosophy, the introduction of the Love Pedagogy, promoting reading and critical thinking culture, the introduction of philosophy. It also touches on volunteerism and how the third party can become an agent of democracy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Malaysia's spectacular drop in inequality – for real?|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/315933|work=Malaysiakini|date=16 October 2015}}</ref>

The book also offers insightful proposals and shares a way out for the problems facing the country.

The book was a bestseller for more than six months at Kinokuniya and Borders and is arguably a tour de force in the local intellectual landscape, as a venue for ideas that bridge policies and the hopes of the people, the responsibility of educators and the potential of their students and more important the problems of the present and the potential of a brighter future.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/251000|work=Malaysiakini|date=6 January 2014}}</ref>

On 11 May 2017, [[:ms:Arshad Ayub|Tan Sri Arshad Ayub]], Father of UiTM and former deputy of Malaysia's Bank Negara launched the new and expanded edition of Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians.

Tan Sri Arshad Ayub highlighted that Malaysia's 60th year of independence is the precise moment that Malaysia is to return to the drawing board. He argued that Anas has initiated the process by bringing forward a multitude of original ideas encompassing energy, economy, and education based on his analysis on the state of the nation and he urged the government, politicians, the civil society, and policy makers to take heed of Anas' powerfully brave book.<ref name=\"thehindu\">{{cite news|last1=Kaur|first1=Miderjeet|title=Malaysia a success story, says former Bank Negara deputy governor|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/05/12/malaysia-a-success-story-says-former-bank-negara-deputy-governor/|work=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|date=12 May 2017}}</ref>

Anas did his lower secondary school in [[:ms:Sekolah Menengah Islam Al-Amin Gombak|Sekolah Menengah Islam Al-Amin (SMIAA)]].

After his Penilaian Menengah Rendah (PMR) result, he was offered and entrance to the [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]] (MCKK) and [[Sultan Alam Shah Islamic College]] (Malay: Kolej Islam Sultan Alam Shah - KISAS) which he accepted the latter. In KISAS, Anas was the President of the International Club and in 1997 he represented the school as part of the debating team for the Piala Perdana Menteri (PPM). The School won Central Zone championship by defeating debaters from the Royal Military College (RMC), [[Sekolah Seri Puteri]] (SSP), and [[Sekolah Alam Shah]] (SAS). KISAS won third place at national level.

After KISAS, Anas pursued his bachelor's degree from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. In 2011, he became the pioneer sole graduate<ref>{{cite news|title=Pioneers of Master of Project Management|publisher=News Straits Times|date=15 April 2010}}</ref> with Distinction for [[Master of Science in Project Management|Master of Project Management]] from the [[Open University Malaysia]]. In 2015, he again became the pioneer sole graduate for [[Doctor of Business Administration]]<ref>{{cite news|title=DBA Pioneer takes the Podium|publisher=OUM Today|date=October 2015}}</ref> from the same University.

Anas was chosen as the \"valedictorian\" graduate and delivered a speech representing 7,506 graduates at OUM's 17th Convocation. In his speech, he urged all the graduates to become the candles that light the way for society, to be a leader for their family, their community, in the workplace and outside, and to make their voice heard.

==Book - Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians==

Anas is an occasional contributor for The Edge, The Star, Astro Awani and online portals. In 2014, Gerakbudaya published his best-seller book, entitled ''Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians: Essays on Energy, Economy and Education''. A Malay version of the book, ''[http://www.gerakbudayaebooks.com/store/p49/Malaysia_Kaya%2C_Rakyat_Miskin.html Malaysia Kaya, Rakyat Miskin]'' was also published the same year. Both versions was launched by [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]], Malaysia's Former Finance Minister and also the Founding Chairman and CEO of Petronas in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tengku Razaleigh' Speech at RMPM Book Launching|url=http://tengkurazaleighhamzah.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=339:rich-malaysia-poor-malaysians&catid=50:blog&Itemid=131|website=Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah}}</ref>

Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah applauded Anas' intellectual discipline in completing the writing which he describes as demanding mental toughness, tenacity and absolute patience. Policy makers, scholars and corporate figures are of the opinion that the views and ideas presented in the book can be usefully adopted for the formulation of policies by political parties and the government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians|url=http://www.gerakbudayaebooks.com/store/p27/Rich_Malaysia,_Poor_Malaysians.html|website=GERAKBUDAYA ebooks}}</ref>

On Energy, the book touches on how Petronas plays it roles in its significant contribution to the country. It also explains the history, the regulations and mechanism used and the secret behind Petronas’ success.<ref>{{cite news|title=Are We In Fact Poor?|url=http://www.bfm.my/current-affairs-are-we-in-fact-poor-20140207.html|work=BFM: The Business Radio Station}}</ref>

On economy, the book introduces the Malaysia's inequality dilemma, the myth of the rich and poor, high income nation versus low income citizen, the Malaysia's hollow economy conundrum and addresses issue on the foreign workers, education and healthcare. It also explains the concept of free trade, its pros and cons .<ref>{{cite news|title='Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians' shows the economic reality|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2014/01/14/rich-malaysia-poor-malaysians%E2%80%99-shows-the-economic-reality/|work=Free Malaysia Today|date=14 January 2014}}</ref>

On education, the book advocates revisiting the national education philosophy, the introduction of the Love Pedagogy, promoting reading and critical thinking culture, the introduction of philosophy. It also touches on volunteerism and how the third party can become an agent of democracy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Malaysia's spectacular drop in inequality – for real?|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/315933|work=Malaysiakini|date=16 October 2015}}</ref>

The book also offers insightful proposals and shares a way out for the problems facing the country.

The book was a bestseller for more than six months at Kinokuniya and Borders and is arguably a tour de force in the local intellectual landscape, as a venue for ideas that bridge policies and the hopes of the people, the responsibility of educators and the potential of their students and more important the problems of the present and the potential of a brighter future.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/251000|work=Malaysiakini|date=6 January 2014}}</ref>

On 11 May 2017, [[:ms:Arshad Ayub|Tan Sri Arshad Ayub]], Father of UiTM and former deputy of Malaysia's Bank Negara launched the new and expanded edition of Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians. He was accompanied by [[Anuwar Ali|Emeritus Professor Tan Sri Anuwar Ali]], Former Vice-Chancellor of Open University Malaysia and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Tan Sri Dato' Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak, Secretary-General of the World Islamic Economic Forum and [[Ghauth Jasmon|Professor Tan Sri Dr. Ghauth Jasmon]], former Vice-Chancellor of Universiti Malaya.

Tan Sri Arshad Ayub highlighted that Malaysia's 60th year of independence is the precise moment that Malaysia is to return to the drawing board. He argued that Anas has initiated the process by bringing forward a multitude of original ideas encompassing energy, economy, and education based on his analysis on the state of the nation and he urged the government, politicians, the civil society, and policy makers to take heed of Anas' powerfully brave book.<ref name=\"thehindu\">{{cite news|last1=Kaur|first1=Miderjeet|title=Malaysia a success story, says former Bank Negara deputy governor|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/05/12/malaysia-a-success-story-says-former-bank-negara-deputy-governor/|work=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|date=12 May 2017}}</ref>

The expanded book is an updated version with 13 additional chapters providing a more holistic coverage on fundamental issues that are currently plaguing Malaysia on healthcare, the foreign workers, environment, the hollow economy, green technology, woman empowerment and others.

==Non-governmental organisations==

Anas is a co-founder of BLINDSPOT,<ref>{{cite news|title=Malaysia's Vicious Inequality and Proposed Actions To Remedy It|url=http://www.mtuc.org.my/malaysias-vicious-inequality-and-proposed-actions-to-remedy-it/|work=Malaysian Trades Union Congress}}</ref> a socio-economic think tank, a group of concerned citizens voicing out the voice of the voiceless - presenting critical, informative data and facts often missed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Details of TPPA in a month - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/10/07/details-of-tppa-in-a-month/|work=www.thestar.com.my}}</ref>

'''Dany-Robert Dufour''' (born in 1947) is a French philosopher, professor of  educational sciences at the university Paris-VIII. He teaches regularly abroad, particularly in Latin America.
His main focus is symbolic processes (specially ''désymbolisation'') with relevance to [[language philosophy]], [[political philosophy]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. He is a frequent participant in cooperative artistic activities  with music, literature or theatre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://paideia.paris8.free.fr/spip.php?article39 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060905/http://paideia.paris8.free.fr/spip.php?article39 |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>

== Mankind - its weakness and greatness ==

In his books a large portion is dedicated to [[neoteny]] and the human physical inability of becoming \"full-grown\". This has forced humans to invent culture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://paideia.paris8.free.fr/spip.php?article310 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714183130/http://paideia.paris8.free.fr/spip.php?article310 |archive-date=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
This condition may be weakness as well as greatness of man.
:...we are not finalized to a defined place in the hierarchy of species, because we are born incomplete. Different from animals we do not possess an instinct to make us occupy a particular place ... We are not fixated in a natural state, we participate in another world, that of language, culture, where significations are extremely mobile, subject to fluctuations and manipulations. That is our basic frailness. But this frailness is also the beauty of man. That is what takes him out of the animal kingdom and lets him search his own way. It is basically that way the Renaissance started with [[Pico della Mirandola]]'s ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'': you are not finalized to be here rather than anywhere else, thus you may accomplish your own selves. That is a beautiful mission, because that is the part of liberty which God (if he exists) leaves us. Partly you are formatted, partly it is up to you to create yourselves, for better or worse.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article555#nh2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217203000/http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article555#nh2 |archive-date=2015-02-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Construction of \"The Grand Subject\" ==
Culture is created by \"intersubjectivity\", where an \"I\" is talking to a \"you\" about an \"it\".  The \"it\" in this conversation between two persons present is a symbolization of something absent. A symbol has thus substituted the leader of the flock seen in other animals growing out of their [[neoteny|neotenia]]n state. This abstract \"leader\" he calls \"The Grand Subject\" and has been referred to different symbolic powers throughout the ages: spirits, machinery of gods (like the Olympic gods), the monotheistic almighty God, the Proletariate, the Race and, lately, the neoliberal Market.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RAI&ID_NUMPUBLIE=RAI_002&ID_ARTICLE=RAI_002_0009 « Portrait du grand Sujet » in ''Raisons politiques'' (Presses de Sc. Po.)]</ref>

== Deconstruction of (neo)liberal civilisation ==

===Postmodernist change of minds===
In the book ''L'art de réduire les têtes'' (\"The Art of Shrinking Heads\"<ref>http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3340688-the-art-of-shrinking-heads</ref>) Dufour considers the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] change which [[Lyotard]] refers to as \"the end of the Grand Narrative\".
 
This new aspect suits [[liberalism]] in an excellent way, being more flexible than the old way of thinking to the everchanging circulation of merchandise, he claims.

===A new religion===
In the book ''Le Divin Marché, la révolution culturelle libérale'' (\"The Divine Market, the Liberal Cultural Revolution\")<ref>http://www.gallimard.com/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Folio/Folio-essais/Le-Divin-Marche</ref> Dufour tries to point out that we have come under the grip of a new victorious religion: the Divine Market, functioning on a simple but terribly efficient principle which [[Bernard Mandeville]] described in ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1704: it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress. This \"miracle\" is produced by \"[[divine providence]]\", what [[Adam Smith]] was to call \"[[The Invisible Hand]]\".

Dufour also wants to point out that the liberal project tends to contradict the concept of \"school\" in Antiquity: Greek σχολή (scholē), Latin [[otium]] = free time, i.e. the time not employed to work or duties. This concept permitted the individual, before entering business life (Latin \"neg-otium\" = time not free), to create a mastering of mind not to be subject to uncontrolled passions, neither his own nor those of others.

We are thus left to distinguish between two contrary concepts of education: the classical one with self-control and the liberal one  where passions and urges on the loose are permitted. The more this latter educational project triumphs, the more the desymbolized world of drives and urges will protrude, according to Dufour. This world, however, creates a new problem: when no longer control of passions and urges is effected on a symbolic level, it must more and more be effected on a pure corporal level, inwards with pills and outwards with surveillance techniques – something happening not without implications for the function of democracy in liberal societies.

More generally this book describes and analyses – one year before the big [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] – the potentially destructive effects of (neo)liberalism, not only on the market economy, but also and particularly on other fields of human expression such as [[politics]], use of symbols, [[semiotics]], [[psychology]]... And not to disregard what contains everything: how to handle one's own living.

===A world of \"self love\"===
In ''La cité perverse – libéralisme et pornographie'',<ref>http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-la-cit%C3%A9-perverse-lib%C3%A9ralisme-et-pornographie-de-dany-robert-dufour.html</ref> 2009 (''Perverted Society - Liberalism and Pornography'') Dufour attempts to display that the economical and financial crisis starting in October 2009 has provided us with at least one advantage: it has revealed the perverted mechanisms regulating the function of today's society.

We live in a world that has made [[selfishness|egoism]] ([[Adam Smith]]'s \"self love\"<ref>Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature & Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol 1 ch 2 \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages”</ref>) its foremost principle. This principle henceforth commands all forms of conduct, whether in the uppermost classes, among juvenile dilinquents or the middle-classes. Destructive for the notions of \"being together\" or \"being your-self\" it urges us to live in a perverted society: [[pornography]], selfishness, contestation of every law whatsoever, acceptance of [[social darwinism]]. It makes [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]] a tool and results in our world becoming [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]]-ish. It extolls henceforth the alliance between [[Adam Smith]] and [[Marquis de Sade]]. 
 
Against the old moral order, which summoned everyone to master his passions and urges, Dufour proposes that a new order has substituted the old one and that it is now, on the contrary,  fashionable to display one's passions and urges regardless of any consequences. He analyses today's world as a result of the revolution of western [[metaphysics]] during the century between [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s puritan philosophy and de Sade's porno fixated one (philosophie puritaine – philosophie \"putaine\").

de Sade had so well demonstrated how a world subject to the principle of absolute egoism would appear that he was to be imprisoned for 27 years and his books to be concealed in the archives of libraries for two centuries. Dufour investigates de Sade's return, first masked, then overtly, during the 20th century and the world which will become the result of this. He also tries to indicate some ways to escape this (a)moral trap.

::These three books might be qualified as a trilogy of criticism of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[anthropology]].

== Reconstruction of a humanistic civilisation ==

===Renaissance 2.0===
''L'individu qui vient … après le libéralisme''<ref>[http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-l-individu-qui-vient-apres-le-liberalisme-de-dany-robert-dufour.html]</ref> (\"The Individual that Appears … after liberalism\"), published in 2011, is a new step in Dufour's work. He considers that he has sufficiently [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] the liberal anthropology in his previous works and is now to enter a constructive line of work in his research for new possible [[axiom]]s for a real civilizational policy.

He first states that western civilization, after a century of two forceful turbulences, [[nazism]] and [[stalinism]], now is drawn into today's [[neoliberalism]]. This produces a crisis in a hitherto unseen extension, the nature of which is political, economical, ecological, moral, subjective, esthetical, intellectual …

Dufour, however, sees nothing fatal in this third historical dead end during a century. As a philosopher he considers possibilities to resist this latest [[totalitarianism]] which step by step changes and destroys various expressions of human culture.

Dufour sees no other solution than resuming things where they have been discontinued by this new religion which he in his previous works has called ''le divin Marché'' (The Divine Market). 
Like all religions a promise makes it function: salvation by continual growth of riches – a precipitous fleeing ahead leading to global devastation according to Dufour. To avoid such fate he proposes a return to the heart of civilization in order to find the necessary principles for a re-creation. In his opinion our civilization is in possession of the necessary resources for its [[renaissance]].

For this reason he proposes to map the foundations for that western narrative which has wrecked facing \"The Divine Market\".
He proposes to go back to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] and  his public  ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'' which has been called the \"Manifesto of the Renaissance\".

What it is all about is the perspective of a new [[Renaissance]], new dynamics like those during the [[Quattrocento]] when knowledge was attained  how to retrieve the fundaments of Greek civilization and, supported by this, how to overcome the grip of obscure  tenets  dominating general thinking. What Dufour proposes then is to retrieve the civilizational process where it was interrupted in order to obtain the individual who dares to think and act by her/himself while giving the same right to [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]]. An individual cured from that egoism that is at present exalted to general law (Adam Smith's ''self love''). An individual well prepared to meet with any type of flock mentality whether in the form of fanatical mass movements or the present tyranny (without a tyrant) of mass consumption.

===Today's civilization - a madness===
In ''Le délire occidental'' (Occidental Madness),<ref>http://livre.fnac.com/a7551982/Dany-Robert-Dufour-Le-delire-occidental, 2014</ref> Dufour starts from what [[Descartes]] argued in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'': humans make themselves masters and owners of nature. This marks a turn in human progress that has led to the gradual development of thinking in terms of machinery and productivity and the present boost of technology as supreme value.

If this occidental madness today causes problems, it is because it has become worldwide: the neoliberal globalization without limitation exploiting everything, including people and environment. A madness which, like all forms of madness, is doomed to crash against reality. On the one hand because its pretentious omnipotence and illimited arrogance inevitably blocks it: our earth is already forcefully reacting to the ongoing vandalization. On the other hand, because this madness in an obvious way changes the three basic spheres of human life, which are ''work, leisure'' and ''love'', by voiding them of all substance.
*''Work'' is no longer creative, but [[Social alienation|alienating]] and mind-numbing as a result of  a more and more distorted organization of work ([[taylorism]], [[fordism]], [[toyotism]]/[[lean management]]).
*''Leisure'', which once was working on and realisation of oneself ([[otium]]), is now invaded by [[consumerism]].
*As to ''love'', it is profoundly reconfigurated in two ways: partly by transforming sensual [[eroticism]] into pornography, partly by unconditionally promising realisation of all forms of fancy. 
 
This is thoroughly scrutinized in the book. 
Yet, all is not lost: a new reason, free from this madness, is conjured up and the contours of it are sketched up.

====Three madnesses …====
In his book \"''La situation désespéré du présent me remplit d'espoir'' (The Present Situation Fills Me with Hope), 2016, Dany-Robert Dufour tries to illustrate how the ''Occidental madness'', founded on the \"will to always have more\" (what the Greeks called [[pleonexia]], greed), has resulted in nothing but provoking its contrary strife for purity. Which could be transformed into a new madness of \"fundamentalist\" expression, like for instance [[jihadism]], where the strife for a purity guaranteed by the original union with God, can alter into absolute igominy of spectacular deranged massacres of \"infidels\". This second madness leads in turn to a third madness, that of \"madness of identity\" which can cause civil wars in the search for \"alien elements\" to exterminate.

That is why the present day philosophical question, according to Dany-Robert Dufour, is about how to get out of these impasses.

This condition may be weakness as well as greatness of man.
:...we are not finalized to a defined place in the hierarchy of species, because we are born incomplete. Different from animals we do not possess an instinct to make us occupy a particular place ... We are not fixated in a natural state, we participate in another world, that of language, culture, where significations are extremely mobile, subject to fluctuations and manipulations. That is our basic frailness. But this frailness is also the beauty of man. That is what takes him out of the animal kingdom and lets him search his own way. It is basically that way the Renaissance started with [[Pico della Mirandola]]'s ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'': you are not finalized to be here rather than anywhere else, thus you may accomplish your own selves. That is a beautiful mission, because that is the part of liberty which God (if he exists) leaves us. Partly you are formatted, partly it is up to you to create yourselves, for better or worse.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article555#nh2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217203000/http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article555#nh2 |archive-date=2015-02-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Construction of \"The Grand Subject\" ==
Culture is created by \"intersubjectivity\", where an \"I\" is talking to a \"you\" about an \"it\".  The \"it\" in this conversation between two persons present is a symbolization of something absent. A symbol has thus substituted the leader of the flock seen in other animals growing out of their [[neoteny|neotenia]]n state. This abstract \"leader\" he calls \"The Grand Subject\" and has been referred to different symbolic powers throughout the ages: spirits, machinery of gods (like the Olympic gods), the monotheistic almighty God, the Proletariate, the Race and, lately, the neoliberal Market.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RAI&ID_NUMPUBLIE=RAI_002&ID_ARTICLE=RAI_002_0009 « Portrait du grand Sujet » in ''Raisons politiques'' (Presses de Sc. Po.)]</ref>

== Deconstruction of (neo)liberal civilisation ==

===Postmodernist change of minds===
In the book ''L'art de réduire les têtes'' (\"The Art of Shrinking Heads\"<ref>http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3340688-the-art-of-shrinking-heads</ref>) Dufour considers the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] change which [[Lyotard]] refers to as \"the end of the Grand Narrative\".
 
This new aspect suits [[liberalism]] in an excellent way, being more flexible than the old way of thinking to the everchanging circulation of merchandise, he claims.

===A new religion===
In the book ''Le Divin Marché, la révolution culturelle libérale'' (\"The Divine Market, the Liberal Cultural Revolution\")<ref>http://www.gallimard.com/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Folio/Folio-essais/Le-Divin-Marche</ref> Dufour tries to point out that we have come under the grip of a new victorious religion: the Divine Market, functioning on a simple but terribly efficient principle which [[Bernard Mandeville]] described in ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1704: it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress. This \"miracle\" is produced by \"[[divine providence]]\", what [[Adam Smith]] was to call \"[[The Invisible Hand]]\".

Dufour also wants to point out that the liberal project tends to contradict the concept of \"school\" in Antiquity: Greek σχολή (scholē), Latin [[otium]] = free time, i.e. the time not employed to work or duties. This concept permitted the individual, before entering business life (Latin \"neg-otium\" = time not free), to create a mastering of mind not to be subject to uncontrolled passions, neither his own nor those of others.

We are thus left to distinguish between two contrary concepts of education: the classical one with self-control and the liberal one  where passions and urges on the loose are permitted. The more this latter educational project triumphs, the more the desymbolized world of drives and urges will protrude, according to Dufour. This world, however, creates a new problem: when no longer control of passions and urges is effected on a symbolic level, it must more and more be effected on a pure corporal level, inwards with pills and outwards with surveillance techniques – something happening not without implications for the function of democracy in liberal societies.

More generally this book describes and analyses – one year before the big [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] – the potentially destructive effects of (neo)liberalism, not only on the market economy, but also and particularly on other fields of human expression such as [[politics]], use of symbols, [[semiotics]], [[psychology]]... And not to disregard what contains everything: how to handle one's own living.

===A world of \"self love\"===
In ''La cité perverse – libéralisme et pornographie'',<ref>http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-la-cit%C3%A9-perverse-lib%C3%A9ralisme-et-pornographie-de-dany-robert-dufour.html</ref> 2009 (''Perverted Society - Liberalism and Pornography'') Dufour attempts to display that the economical and financial crisis starting in October 2009 has provided us with at least one advantage: it has revealed the perverted mechanisms regulating the function of today's society.

We live in a world that has made [[selfishness|egoism]] ([[Adam Smith]]'s \"self love\"<ref>Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature & Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol 1 ch 2 \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages”</ref>) its foremost principle. This principle henceforth commands all forms of conduct, whether in the uppermost classes, among juvenile dilinquents or the middle-classes. Destructive for the notions of \"being together\" or \"being your-self\" it urges us to live in a perverted society: [[pornography]], selfishness, contestation of every law whatsoever, acceptance of [[social darwinism]]. It makes [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]] a tool and results in our world becoming [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]]-ish. It extolls henceforth the alliance between [[Adam Smith]] and [[Marquis de Sade]]. 
 
Against the old moral order, which summoned everyone to master his passions and urges, Dufour proposes that a new order has substituted the old one and that it is now, on the contrary,  fashionable to display one's passions and urges regardless of any consequences. He analyses today's world as a result of the revolution of western [[metaphysics]] during the century between [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s puritan philosophy and de Sade's porno fixated one (philosophie puritaine – philosophie \"putaine\").

de Sade had so well demonstrated how a world subject to the principle of absolute egoism would appear that he was to be imprisoned for 27 years and his books to be concealed in the archives of libraries for two centuries. Dufour investigates de Sade's return, first masked, then overtly, during the 20th century and the world which will become the result of this. He also tries to indicate some ways to escape this (a)moral trap.

::These three books might be qualified as a trilogy of criticism of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[anthropology]].

== Reconstruction of a humanistic civilisation ==

===Renaissance 2.0===
''L'individu qui vient … après le libéralisme''<ref>[http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-l-individu-qui-vient-apres-le-liberalisme-de-dany-robert-dufour.html]</ref> (\"The Individual that Appears … after liberalism\"), published in 2011, is a new step in Dufour's work. He considers that he has sufficiently [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] the liberal anthropology in his previous works and is now to enter a constructive line of work in his research for new possible [[axiom]]s for a real civilizational policy.

He first states that western civilization, after a century of two forceful turbulences, [[nazism]] and [[stalinism]], now is drawn into today's [[neoliberalism]]. This produces a crisis in a hitherto unseen extension, the nature of which is political, economical, ecological, moral, subjective, esthetical, intellectual …

Dufour, however, sees nothing fatal in this third historical dead end during a century. As a philosopher he considers possibilities to resist this latest [[totalitarianism]] which step by step changes and destroys various expressions of human culture.

Dufour sees no other solution than resuming things where they have been discontinued by this new religion which he in his previous works has called ''le divin Marché'' (The Divine Market). 
Like all religions a promise makes it function: salvation by continual growth of riches – a precipitous fleeing ahead leading to global devastation according to Dufour. To avoid such fate he proposes a return to the heart of civilization in order to find the necessary principles for a re-creation. In his opinion our civilization is in possession of the necessary resources for its [[renaissance]].

For this reason he proposes to map the foundations for that western narrative which has wrecked facing \"The Divine Market\".
He proposes to go back to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] and  his public  ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'' which has been called the \"Manifesto of the Renaissance\".

What it is all about is the perspective of a new [[Renaissance]], new dynamics like those during the [[Quattrocento]] when knowledge was attained  how to retrieve the fundaments of Greek civilization and, supported by this, how to overcome the grip of obscure  tenets  dominating general thinking. What Dufour proposes then is to retrieve the civilizational process where it was interrupted in order to obtain the individual who dares to think and act by her/himself while giving the same right to [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]]. An individual cured from that egoism that is at present exalted to general law (Adam Smith's ''self love''). An individual well prepared to meet with any type of flock mentality whether in the form of fanatical mass movements or the present tyranny (without a tyrant) of mass consumption.

===Today's civilization - a madness===
In ''Le délire occidental'' (Occidental Madness),<ref>http://livre.fnac.com/a7551982/Dany-Robert-Dufour-Le-delire-occidental, 2014</ref> Dufour starts from what [[Descartes]] argued in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'': humans make themselves masters and owners of nature. This marks a turn in human progress that has led to the gradual development of thinking in terms of machinery and productivity and the present boost of technology as supreme value.

If this occidental madness today causes problems, it is because it has become worldwide: the neoliberal globalization without limitation exploiting everything, including people and environment. A madness which, like all forms of madness, is doomed to crash against reality. On the one hand because its pretentious omnipotence and illimited arrogance inevitably blocks it: our earth is already forcefully reacting to the ongoing vandalization. On the other hand, because this madness in an obvious way changes the three basic spheres of human life, which are ''work, leisure'' and ''love'', by voiding them of all substance.
*''Work'' is no longer creative, but [[Social alienation|alienating]] and mind-numbing as a result of  a more and more distorted organization of work ([[taylorism]], [[fordism]], [[toyotism]]/[[lean management]]).
*''Leisure'', which once was working on and realisation of oneself ([[otium]]), is now invaded by [[consumerism]].
*As to ''love'', it is profoundly reconfigurated in two ways: partly by transforming sensual [[eroticism]] into pornography, partly by unconditionally promising realisation of all forms of fancy. 
 
This is thoroughly scrutinized in the book. 
Yet, all is not lost: a new reason, free from this madness, is conjured up and the contours of it are sketched up.

====Three madnesses …====
In his book \"''La situation désespéré du présent me remplit d'espoir'' (The Present Situation Fills Me with Hope), 2016, Dany-Robert Dufour tries to illustrate how the ''Occidental madness'', founded on the \"will to always have more\" (what the Greeks called [[pleonexia]], greed), has resulted in nothing but provoking its contrary strife for purity. Which could be transformed into a new madness of \"fundamentalist\" expression, like for instance [[jihadism]], where the strife for a purity guaranteed by the original union with God, can alter into absolute igominy of spectacular deranged massacres of \"infidels\". This second madness leads in turn to a third madness, that of \"madness of identity\" which can cause civil wars in the search for \"alien elements\" to exterminate.

That is why the present day philosophical question, according to Dany-Robert Dufour, is about how to get out of these impasses.

'''Tawfiq al-Hakim''' or '''Tawfik el-Hakim''' ({{lang-ar|توفيق الحكيم}}, {{ALA-LC|ar|Tawfīq al-Ḥakīm}}; October 9, 1898 &ndash; July 26, 1987) was a prominent [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] writer and visionary. He is one of the pioneers of the Arabic novel and drama. The triumphs and failures that are represented by the reception of his enormous output of plays are emblematic of the issues that have confronted the Egyptian drama genre as it has endeavored to adapt its complex modes of communication to Egyptian society.<ref>{{cite web|title= The achievements of Tawfiq Al-Hakim|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|url= http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=7&reading_id=41&sequence=5|accessdate=2014-04-15}}</ref>

==Early life==
Tawfiq Ismail al-Hakim was born October 9, 1898, in [[Alexandria]], Egypt, to an [[Egypt]]ian father and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] mother.<ref>{{citation|last=Goldschmidt|first=Arthur|year=2000|chapter=al-Hakim, Tawfiq|title=Biographical Dictionary of Modern Egypt|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=1-55587-229-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/00jrgo/page/52 52]|quote=Playwright, novelist, and essayist. Tawfiq was born in Ramleh, Alexandria, to an Egyptian landowning father and an aristocratic Turkish mother.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/00jrgo/page/52}}</ref> His father, a wealthy and illustrious civil officer, worked as a judge in the judiciary in the village of al-Delnegat, in central Beheira province. His mother was the daughter of a retired Turkish officer. Tawfiq al-Hakim enrolled at the Damanhour primary school at the age of seven. He left primary school in 1915 and his father put him in a public school in the Beheira province, where Tawfiq al-Hakim finished secondary school. However, due to the lack of proper secondary schooling in the province, Tawfiq al-Hakim moved to Cairo with his uncles to continue his studies at Muhammad Ali secondary school.

After studying in Cairo, he moved to Paris, where he graduated in law and began preparing a PhD thesis at the Sorbonne. However, his attention turned increasingly to the Paris theatres and the Opera and, after three years in Paris, he abandoned his studies and returned to Egypt in 1928, full of ideas for transforming Egyptian theatre.

==Egyptian drama before Tawfiq al-Hakim==
The cause of 'serious' drama, at least in its textual form, was in the process of being given a boost by one of the Egypt's greatest littérateurs, [[Ahmed Shawqi]], \"Prince of Poets,\" who during his latter years penned a number of verse dramas with themes culled from Egyptian and Islamic history; these included ''Masraa' Kliyubatra'' (The Death of Cleopatra, 1929), ''Majnun Layla'' ([[Layla and Majnun|Driven mad by Layla]], 1931), ''Amirat el-Andalus'' (The [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian Princess, 1932), and ''Ali Bey al-Kebir'' (an 18th-century ruler of Egypt), a play originally written in 1893 and later revised. However, between the popular traditions of farcical comedy and melodrama and the performance of translated versions of European dramatic masterpieces, there still remained a void within which an indigenous tradition of serious drama could develop.and the teez of anything

==War-time political writings==
During [[World War II|WWII]], al-Hakim published many articles against Nazism and Fascism.<ref name=Gershoni>{{cite book|author = Israel Gershoni | pages = 82–85 | chapter = Demon and Infidel | title = Nazism, the Holocaust and the Middle East | editor = Francis Nicosia & Boğaç Ergene | publisher = Berghan Books | year = 2008}}</ref> The articles portrayed Hitler as a demon whose victory would herald the end of human civilization, bringing instead a \"return to barbarism ... tribalism, and beastliness\".<ref name=Gershoni/>

==Plays==
The publication and performance of his play, ''Ahl al-Kahf'' (The People of the Cave, 1933) was a significant event in Egyptian drama. The story of 'the people of the cave' is to be found in the eighteenth surah of the [[Qur'an]] as well as in other sources. It concerns the tale of the seven sleepers of Ephesus who, in order to escape the Roman persecution of Christians, take refuge in a cave. They sleep for three hundred years, and wake up in a completely different era - without realizing it, of course. In its use of overarching themes - rebirth into a new world and a predilection for returning to the past - al-Hakim's play obviously touches upon some of the broad cultural topics that were of major concern to intellectuals at the time, and, because of the play's obvious seriousness of purpose, most critics have chosen to emphasise such features.

Within a year al-Hakim produced another major and highly revered work, ''Shahrazad'' (Scheherazade, 1934). While the title character is, of course, the famous narrator of the [[One Thousand and One Nights]] collection, the scenario for this play is set after all the tales have been told. Now cured of his vicious anger against the female sex by the story-telling virtuosity of the woman who is now his wife, King Shahriyar abandons his previous ways and embarks on a journey in quest of knowledge, only to discover himself caught in a dilemma whose focus is Shahrazad herself; through a linkage to the ancient goddess, [[Isis]], Shahrazad emerges as the ultimate mystery, the source of life and knowledge. Even though the play is now considered one of his finest works, Taha Hussein, a prominent Arab writer and one of the leading intellectuals of the then Egypt criticized some of its aspects, mainly that it was not suitable for a theatrical performance. Later, the two writers wrote together a novel called ''The Enchanted Castle'' (Al-Qasr al-Mashur, 1936) in which both authors revisited some of the themes from al-Hakim's play.
<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beskova|first1=Katarina|title=In the Enchanted Castle with Shahrazad: Taha Husayn and Tawfiq al-Hakim between Friendship and Rivalry|journal=Arabic and Islamic Studies in Honour of Ján Pauliny|date=2016|pages=33-47|url=https://www.academia.edu/31626358/In_the_Enchanted_Castle_with_Shahrazad_Taha_Husayn_and_Tawfiq_al-Hakim_between_Friendship_and_Rivalry|accessdate=25 November 2017|publisher=Comenius University in Bratislava}}</ref>
When the National Theatre Troupe was formed in Egypt in 1935, the first production that it mounted was The People of the Cave. The performances were not a success; for one thing, audiences seemed unimpressed by a performance in which the action on stage was so limited in comparison with the more popular types of [[drama]]. It was such problems in the realm of both production and reception that seem to have led al-Hakim to use some of his play-prefaces in order to develop the notion of his plays as 'théâtre des idées', works for reading rather than performance. However, in spite of such critical controversies, he continued to write plays with philosophical themes culled from a variety of cultural sources: Pygmalion (1942), an interesting blend of the legends of Pygmalion and Narcissus.

Some of al-Hakim's frustrations with the performance aspect were diverted by an invitation in 1945 to write a series of short plays for publication in newspaper article form. These works were gathered together into two collections, ''Masrah al-Mugtama'' (Theatre of Society, 1950) and ''al-Masrah al-Munawwa'' (Theatre Miscellany, 1956). The most memorable of these plays is ''Ughniyyat al-Mawt'' (Death Song), a one-act play that with masterly economy depicts the fraught atmosphere in [[Upper Egypt]] as a family awaits the return of the eldest son, a student in Cairo, in order that he may carry out a murder in response to the expectations of a blood feud.

Al-Hakim's response to the social transformations brought about by the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]], which he later criticized, was the play Al Aydi Al Na'imah (Soft Hands, 1954). The 'soft hands' of the title refer to those of a prince of the former royal family who finds himself without a meaningful role in the new society, a position in which he is joined by a young academic who has just finished writing a doctoral thesis on the uses of the Arabic preposition hatta. The play explores in an amusing, yet rather obviously didactic, fashion, the ways in which these two apparently useless individuals set about identifying roles for themselves in the new socialist context. While this play may be somewhat lacking in subtlety, it clearly illustrates in the context of al-Hakim's development as a playwright the way in which he had developed his technique in order to broach topics of contemporary interest, not least through a closer linkage between the pacing of dialogue and actions on stage. His play formed the basis of a popular Egyptian film by the same name, starring [[Ahmed Mazhar]].

In 1960 al-Hakim was to provide further illustration of this development in technique with another play set in an earlier period of Egyptian history, Al Sultan Al-Ha'ir (The Perplexed Sultan ). The play explores in a most effective manner the issue of the legitimation of power. A [[Mamluk]] sultan at the height of his power is suddenly faced with the fact that he has never been manumitted and that he is thus ineligible to be ruler. By 1960 when this play was published, some of the initial euphoria and hope engendered by the [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] regime itself, given expression in Al Aydi Al Na'imah, had begun to fade. The [[Egyptian people]] found themselves confronting some unsavoury realities: the use of the secret police to squelch the public expression of opinion, for example, and the personality cult surrounding the figure of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. In such a historical context al-Hakim's play can be seen as a somewhat courageous statement of the need for even the mightiest to adhere to the laws of the land and specifically a plea to the ruling [[military dictatorship|military regime]] to eschew the use of violence and instead seek legitimacy through application of the law.

A two volume English translation of collected plays is in the [[UNESCO Collection of Representative Works]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/lit/rep/pop.php?fnc=record&lng=en_GB&record=5513|title=Plays, Prefaces and Postscripts. Vol. I: Theatre of the Mind|website=www.unesco.org}}</ref>

==Style and themes==
The theatrical art of al-Hakim consists of three types:

'''1- Biographical Theatre:'''
The group of plays he wrote in his early life in which he expressed his personal experience and attitudes towards life were more than 400 plays among which were \"al-Arees\", (The Groom) and \"Amama Shibbak al-Tazaker\", (Before the Ticket Office). These plays were more artistic because they were based on Al Hakim's personal opinion in criticizing social life.

'''2- Intellectual Theatre:'''
This dramatic style produced plays to be read not acted. Thus, he refused to call them plays and published them in separate books.
[[File:Naguib Mahfouz and Tawfiq Alhakim.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Naguib Mahfouz]] and Tawfiq Alhakim in 1982]]
'''3- Objective Theatre:'''
Its aim is to contribute to the Egyptian society by fixing some values of the society, exposing the realities of Egyptian life.

Al-Hakim was able to understand nature and depict it in a style which combines symbolism, reality and imagination. He mastered narration, dialogue and selecting settings. 
While al-Hakim's earlier plays were all composed in the literary language, he was to conduct a number of experiments with different levels of dramatic language. In the play, ''Al-Safqah'' (The Deal, 1956), for example - with its themes of land ownership and the exploitation of poor peasant farmers - he couched the dialogue in something he termed 'a third language', one that could be read as a text in the [[Modern Standard Arabic|standard written language of literature]], but that could also be performed on stage in a way which, while not exactly the idiom of [[Egyptian Arabic]], was certainly comprehensible to a larger population than the literate elite of the city. There is perhaps an irony in the fact that another of al-Hakim's plays of the 1960s, ''Ya tali al-Shajarah'' (1962; The Tree Climber, 1966), was one of his most successful works from this point of view, precisely because its use of the literary language in the dialogue was a major contributor to the non-reality of the atmosphere in this [[Theatre of the Absurd]] style involving extensive passages of non-communication between husband and wife. Al-Hakim continued to write plays during the 1960s, among the most popular of which were ''Masir Sorsar'' (The Fate of a Cockroach, 1966) and ''Bank al-Qalaq'' (Anxiety Bank, 1967).

==Influence and impact on Arabic literature==
Tawfiq al-Hakim is one of the major pioneer figures in modern [[Arabic]] literature. In the particular realm of theatre, he fulfills an overarching role as the sole founder of an entire literary tradition, as [[Taha Hussein]] had earlier made clear. His struggles on behalf of [[Arabic]] drama as a literary genre, its techniques, and its language, are coterminous with the achievement of a central role in contemporary Egyptian political and social life.

Hakim's 1956 play ''Death Song'' was the basis of the [[libretto]] to [[Mohammed Fairouz]]'s 2008 opera [[Sumeida's Song]].
<ref name=qonstage>Rase, Sherri (April 8, 2011), [http://www.qonstage.com/QOnStage_articles/2011fairouz-rase/index.html Conversations—with Mohammed Fairouz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322231341/http://www.qonstage.com/QOnStage_articles/2011fairouz-rase/index.html |date=2012-03-22 }}, ''[Q]onStage'', retrieved 2011-04-19</ref>

==Personal life==
Hakim was viewed as something of a [[misogynist]] in his younger years, having written a few misogynistic articles and remaining a [[bachelor]] for an unusually long period of time; he was given the [[Arabic name#Laqab|laqab]] (i.e. [[epithet]]) of عدو المرأة (''<nowiki>'Aduww al Mar'a</nowiki>''), meaning \"Enemy of woman.\" However, he eventually married and had two children, a son and a daughter. His wife died in 1977; his son died in 1978 in a [[automobile accident|car accident]]. He died July 23, 1987.<ref>[[Asharq Al-Awsat]], ''This Day in History-July 23: The Death of Tawfiq al-Hakim'', July 23, 1992</ref>

'''Tawfiq al-Hakim''' or '''Tawfik el-Hakim''' ({{lang-ar|توفيق الحكيم}}, {{ALA-LC|ar|Tawfīq al-Ḥakīm}}; October 9, 1898 &ndash; July 26, 1987) was a prominent [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] writer and visionary. He is one of the pioneers of the Arabic novel and drama. The triumphs and failures that are represented by the reception of his enormous output of plays are emblematic of the issues that have confronted the Egyptian drama genre as it has endeavored to adapt its complex modes of communication to Egyptian society.<ref>{{cite web|title= The achievements of Tawfiq Al-Hakim|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|url= http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=7&reading_id=41&sequence=5|accessdate=2014-04-15}}</ref>

==Early life==
Tawfiq Ismail al-Hakim was born October 9, 1898, in [[Alexandria]], Egypt, to an [[Egypt]]ian father and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] mother.<ref>{{citation|last=Goldschmidt|first=Arthur|year=2000|chapter=al-Hakim, Tawfiq|title=Biographical Dictionary of Modern Egypt|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=1-55587-229-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/00jrgo/page/52 52]|quote=Playwright, novelist, and essayist. Tawfiq was born in Ramleh, Alexandria, to an Egyptian landowning father and an aristocratic Turkish mother.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/00jrgo/page/52}}</ref> His father, a wealthy and illustrious civil officer, worked as a judge in the judiciary in the village of al-Delnegat, in central Beheira province. His mother was the daughter of a retired Turkish officer. Tawfiq al-Hakim enrolled at the Damanhour primary school at the age of seven. He left primary school in 1915 and his father put him in a public school in the Beheira province, where Tawfiq al-Hakim finished secondary school. However, due to the lack of proper secondary schooling in the province, Tawfiq al-Hakim moved to Cairo with his uncles to continue his studies at Muhammad Ali secondary school.

After studying in Cairo, he moved to Paris, where he graduated in law and began preparing a PhD thesis at the Sorbonne. However, his attention turned increasingly to the Paris theatres and the Opera and, after three years in Paris, he abandoned his studies and returned to Egypt in 1928, full of ideas for transforming Egyptian theatre.

==Egyptian drama before Tawfiq al-Hakim==
The cause of 'serious' drama, at least in its textual form, was in the process of being given a boost by one of the Egypt's greatest littérateurs, [[Ahmed Shawqi]], \"Prince of Poets,\" who during his latter years penned a number of verse dramas with themes culled from Egyptian and Islamic history; these included ''Masraa' Kliyubatra'' (The Death of Cleopatra, 1929), ''Majnun Layla'' ([[Layla and Majnun|Driven mad by Layla]], 1931), ''Amirat el-Andalus'' (The [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian Princess, 1932), and ''Ali Bey al-Kebir'' (an 18th-century ruler of Egypt), a play originally written in 1893 and later revised. However, between the popular traditions of farcical comedy and melodrama and the performance of translated versions of European dramatic masterpieces, there still remained a void within which an indigenous tradition of serious drama could develop.and the teez of anything

==War-time political writings==
During [[World War II|WWII]], al-Hakim published many articles against Nazism and Fascism.<ref name=Gershoni>{{cite book|author = Israel Gershoni | pages = 82–85 | chapter = Demon and Infidel | title = Nazism, the Holocaust and the Middle East | editor = Francis Nicosia & Boğaç Ergene | publisher = Berghan Books | year = 2008}}</ref> The articles portrayed Hitler as a demon whose victory would herald the end of human civilization, bringing instead a \"return to barbarism ... tribalism, and beastliness\".<ref name=Gershoni/>

==Plays==
The publication and performance of his play, ''Ahl al-Kahf'' (The People of the Cave, 1933) was a significant event in Egyptian drama. The story of 'the people of the cave' is to be found in the eighteenth surah of the [[Qur'an]] as well as in other sources. It concerns the tale of the seven sleepers of Ephesus who, in order to escape the Roman persecution of Christians, take refuge in a cave. They sleep for three hundred years, and wake up in a completely different era - without realizing it, of course. In its use of overarching themes - rebirth into a new world and a predilection for returning to the past - al-Hakim's play obviously touches upon some of the broad cultural topics that were of major concern to intellectuals at the time, and, because of the play's obvious seriousness of purpose, most critics have chosen to emphasise such features.

Within a year al-Hakim produced another major and highly revered work, ''Shahrazad'' (Scheherazade, 1934). While the title character is, of course, the famous narrator of the [[One Thousand and One Nights]] collection, the scenario for this play is set after all the tales have been told. Now cured of his vicious anger against the female sex by the story-telling virtuosity of the woman who is now his wife, King Shahriyar abandons his previous ways and embarks on a journey in quest of knowledge, only to discover himself caught in a dilemma whose focus is Shahrazad herself; through a linkage to the ancient goddess, [[Isis]], Shahrazad emerges as the ultimate mystery, the source of life and knowledge. Even though the play is now considered one of his finest works, Taha Hussein, a prominent Arab writer and one of the leading intellectuals of the then Egypt criticized some of its aspects, mainly that it was not suitable for a theatrical performance. Later, the two writers wrote together a novel called ''The Enchanted Castle'' (Al-Qasr al-Mashur, 1936) in which both authors revisited some of the themes from al-Hakim's play.
<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beskova|first1=Katarina|title=In the Enchanted Castle with Shahrazad: Taha Husayn and Tawfiq al-Hakim between Friendship and Rivalry|journal=Arabic and Islamic Studies in Honour of Ján Pauliny|date=2016|pages=33-47|url=https://www.academia.edu/31626358/In_the_Enchanted_Castle_with_Shahrazad_Taha_Husayn_and_Tawfiq_al-Hakim_between_Friendship_and_Rivalry|accessdate=25 November 2017|publisher=Comenius University in Bratislava}}</ref>
When the National Theatre Troupe was formed in Egypt in 1935, the first production that it mounted was The People of the Cave. The performances were not a success; for one thing, audiences seemed unimpressed by a performance in which the action on stage was so limited in comparison with the more popular types of [[drama]]. It was such problems in the realm of both production and reception that seem to have led al-Hakim to use some of his play-prefaces in order to develop the notion of his plays as 'théâtre des idées', works for reading rather than performance. However, in spite of such critical controversies, he continued to write plays with philosophical themes culled from a variety of cultural sources: Pygmalion (1942), an interesting blend of the legends of Pygmalion and Narcissus.

Some of al-Hakim's frustrations with the performance aspect were diverted by an invitation in 1945 to write a series of short plays for publication in newspaper article form. These works were gathered together into two collections, ''Masrah al-Mugtama'' (Theatre of Society, 1950) and ''al-Masrah al-Munawwa'' (Theatre Miscellany, 1956). The most memorable of these plays is ''Ughniyyat al-Mawt'' (Death Song), a one-act play that with masterly economy depicts the fraught atmosphere in [[Upper Egypt]] as a family awaits the return of the eldest son, a student in Cairo, in order that he may carry out a murder in response to the expectations of a blood feud.

Al-Hakim's response to the social transformations brought about by the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]], which he later criticized, was the play Al Aydi Al Na'imah (Soft Hands, 1954). The 'soft hands' of the title refer to those of a prince of the former royal family who finds himself without a meaningful role in the new society, a position in which he is joined by a young academic who has just finished writing a doctoral thesis on the uses of the Arabic preposition hatta. The play explores in an amusing, yet rather obviously didactic, fashion, the ways in which these two apparently useless individuals set about identifying roles for themselves in the new socialist context. While this play may be somewhat lacking in subtlety, it clearly illustrates in the context of al-Hakim's development as a playwright the way in which he had developed his technique in order to broach topics of contemporary interest, not least through a closer linkage between the pacing of dialogue and actions on stage. His play formed the basis of a popular Egyptian film by the same name, starring [[Ahmed Mazhar]].

In 1960 al-Hakim was to provide further illustration of this development in technique with another play set in an earlier period of Egyptian history, Al Sultan Al-Ha'ir (The Perplexed Sultan ). The play explores in a most effective manner the issue of the legitimation of power. A [[Mamluk]] sultan at the height of his power is suddenly faced with the fact that he has never been manumitted and that he is thus ineligible to be ruler. By 1960 when this play was published, some of the initial euphoria and hope engendered by the [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] regime itself, given expression in Al Aydi Al Na'imah, had begun to fade. The [[Egyptian people]] found themselves confronting some unsavoury realities: the use of the secret police to squelch the public expression of opinion, for example, and the personality cult surrounding the figure of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. In such a historical context al-Hakim's play can be seen as a somewhat courageous statement of the need for even the mightiest to adhere to the laws of the land and specifically a plea to the ruling [[military dictatorship|military regime]] to eschew the use of violence and instead seek legitimacy through application of the law.

A two volume English translation of collected plays is in the [[UNESCO Collection of Representative Works]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/lit/rep/pop.php?fnc=record&lng=en_GB&record=5513|title=Plays, Prefaces and Postscripts. Vol. I: Theatre of the Mind|website=www.unesco.org}}</ref>

==Style and themes==
The theatrical art of al-Hakim consists of three types:

'''1- Biographical Theatre:'''
The group of plays he wrote in his early life in which he expressed his personal experience and attitudes towards life were more than 400 plays among which were \"al-Arees\", (The Groom) and \"Amama Shibbak al-Tazaker\", (Before the Ticket Office). These plays were more artistic because they were based on Al Hakim's personal opinion in criticizing social life.

'''2- Intellectual Theatre:'''
This dramatic style produced plays to be read not acted. Thus, he refused to call them plays and published them in separate books.
[[File:Naguib Mahfouz and Tawfiq Alhakim.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Naguib Mahfouz]] and Tawfiq Alhakim in 1982]]
'''3- Objective Theatre:'''
Its aim is to contribute to the Egyptian society by fixing some values of the society, exposing the realities of Egyptian life.

Al-Hakim was able to understand nature and depict it in a style which combines symbolism, reality and imagination. He mastered narration, dialogue and selecting settings. 
While al-Hakim's earlier plays were all composed in the literary language, he was to conduct a number of experiments with different levels of dramatic language. In the play, ''Al-Safqah'' (The Deal, 1956), for example - with its themes of land ownership and the exploitation of poor peasant farmers - he couched the dialogue in something he termed 'a third language', one that could be read as a text in the [[Modern Standard Arabic|standard written language of literature]], but that could also be performed on stage in a way which, while not exactly the idiom of [[Egyptian Arabic]], was certainly comprehensible to a larger population than the literate elite of the city. There is perhaps an irony in the fact that another of al-Hakim's plays of the 1960s, ''Ya tali al-Shajarah'' (1962; The Tree Climber, 1966), was one of his most successful works from this point of view, precisely because its use of the literary language in the dialogue was a major contributor to the non-reality of the atmosphere in this [[Theatre of the Absurd]] style involving extensive passages of non-communication between husband and wife. Al-Hakim continued to write plays during the 1960s, among the most popular of which were ''Masir Sorsar'' (The Fate of a Cockroach, 1966) and ''Bank al-Qalaq'' (Anxiety Bank, 1967).

==Influence and impact on Arabic literature==
Tawfiq al-Hakim is one of the major pioneer figures in modern [[Arabic]] literature. In the particular realm of theatre, he fulfills an overarching role as the sole founder of an entire literary tradition, as [[Taha Hussein]] had earlier made clear. His struggles on behalf of [[Arabic]] drama as a literary genre, its techniques, and its language, are coterminous with the achievement of a central role in contemporary Egyptian political and social life.

Hakim's 1956 play ''Death Song'' was the basis of the [[libretto]] to [[Mohammed Fairouz]]'s 2008 opera [[Sumeida's Song]].
<ref name=qonstage>Rase, Sherri (April 8, 2011), [http://www.qonstage.com/QOnStage_articles/2011fairouz-rase/index.html Conversations—with Mohammed Fairouz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322231341/http://www.qonstage.com/QOnStage_articles/2011fairouz-rase/index.html |date=2012-03-22 }}, ''[Q]onStage'', retrieved 2011-04-19</ref>

==Personal life==
Hakim was viewed as something of a [[misogynist]] in his younger years, having written a few misogynistic articles and remaining a [[bachelor]] for an unusually long period of time; he was given the [[Arabic name#Laqab|laqab]] (i.e. [[epithet]]) of عدو المرأة (''<nowiki>'Aduww al Mar'a</nowiki>''), meaning \"Enemy of woman.\" However, he eventually married and had two children, a son and a daughter. His wife died in 1977; his son died in 1978 in a [[automobile accident|car accident]]. He died July 23, 1987.<ref>[[Asharq Al-Awsat]], ''This Day in History-July 23: The Death of Tawfiq al-Hakim'', July 23, 1992</ref>

==Plot==
On the Isle of Evil, [[Victor Frankenstein|Baron Boris von Frankenstein]] (voiced by [[Boris Karloff]]) achieves his ultimate ambition, the secret of total destruction. Having perfected and tested the formula, he sends out messenger bats to summon all monsters to the Isle of Evil in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The Baron intends to inform them of his discovery and also to reveal his imminent retirement as head of the \"Worldwide Organization of Monsters\". Besides [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]] (sometimes referred to as \"Fang\") and the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Monster's more intelligent mate]] (voiced by [[Phyllis Diller]]) who live in the isle's castle with Boris, the invites also include [[Count Dracula]], the [[Mummy (undead)|Mummy]], [[Quasimodo]] (referred to as \"[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\"), the [[Werewolf]], [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|The Invisible Man]], [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and the [[Gill-man|Creature from the Black Lagoon]] (referred to as just \"The Creature\").

The Baron's beautiful assistant Francesca (voiced by [[Gale Garnett]]) enters the lab to confirm that all invitations have been delivered and inquires about one of the addressees named Felix Flanken (voiced by [[Allen Swift]] impersonating [[James Stewart]]). Frankenstein explains that Flanken is his nephew and successor in the monster business. This displeases Francesca, who covets the role for herself. Francesca even asks why there was not an invitation for \"It\". Boris replies that \"It\" was not invited since \"It\" can be a crushing bore, explaining that \"It\" even crushed the island's [[wild boar]]s in his bare hands the last time \"It\" was invited.

Frankenstein has his zombie butler, Yetch (Swift impersonating [[Peter Lorre]]), Chef Mafia Machiavelli, and the zombie bellhops and servants make preparations for the upcoming party while having some zombies patrol the Isle of Evil to make sure that \"It\" does not show up uninvited. The monsters begin to arrive on the freighter that Felix is also traveling on.

However, when Felix proves to be an incompetent, asthmatic (and unsuitably kind-hearted) human, the monsters plot to eliminate him and gain control of the secret formula. Over time, Francesca develops feelings for Felix after he unknowingly saves her multiple times. As Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Monster's Mate descend upon Francesca, she sends out a letter (via messenger bat) to an unknown recipient. When the monsters corner Felix upon capturing Francesca, they are frightened at the arrival of \"It\" (revealed to be a giant [[gorilla]] and a take-off of [[King Kong]]) who proceeds to go on a rampage since he was not invited. \"It\" snatches up the monsters and Francesca (on whom \"It\" develops a crush).

Felix rushes off to tell his Uncle Boris what happened and is instructed to head to the boat. Boris leads the zombies in rescuing Francesca from \"It\" using biplanes. Boris convinces \"It\" to let Francesca go and to take him instead. \"It\" complies, releasing Francesca. Felix and Francesca manage to get off the island as Boris and the remainder of the monsters remain in the clutches of \"It\". Displeased that the monsters tried to steal the secret of total destruction for themselves and attempted to kill Felix as well as having to put up with \"It\", Boris sacrifices his life by dropping the vial containing the formula, destroying the Isle of Evil and everything on it.

The destruction is witnessed offshore by Felix and Francesca. Francesca tearfully admits to Felix that she is not human, but is in fact a robot creation of Boris von Frankenstein. Felix answers that \"none of us are perfect\" where he then mechanically repeats the words \"are perfect\", indicating that he has also been a robot creation of his uncle the entire time.

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
The film was created using Rankin/Bass' \"Animagic\" [[stop motion]] animation process, supervised by [[Tadahito Mochinaga]] at MOM Productions in [[Tokyo]], Japan. The process involved photographing figurines a frame at a time, then re-positioning them, exposing another frame, and so forth.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In addition to Mochinaga, along with assistant director Kizo Nagashima, many other \"Animagic\" technicians of MOM (re-established as Video Tokyo Production after Mochinaga left for China) including puppet makers Ichiro Komuro and Kyoko Kita, and assistant animators Hiroshi Tabata and Fumiko Magari{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} also worked on the film for Rankin/Bass, but are uncredited.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Known as stop-motion animation, it was the same approach used in [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]'s ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', [[Art Clokey]]'s ''[[Gumby]]'' and ''[[Davey and Goliath]]'', and many other films, commercials and TV specials. In partnership with MOM and [[Dentsu]], Rankin/Bass had created several \"Animagic\" productions, including the syndicated television series ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the enormously successful Christmas television special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' and their first full-length film ''[[Willy McBean and his Magic Machine]]''. Classic monster films were enjoying a resurgence in popularity in the late 1960s, along with more comedy-centered examples, ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and ''[[The Munsters]]''. This [[camp (style)|campy]] film is a spoof of horror themes, complete with [[musical film|musical numbers]] and [[in-joke|inside jokes]].

''[[Mad Magazine]]'' creator [[Harvey Kurtzman]] penned the script (with writer Len Korobkin) and ''Mad'' artist [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] designed many of the characters. Davis was a natural for the job, being famous both for his humor work and his monster stories in the pages of [[EC Comics]]. It has long been rumored that [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] had a hand in the script, but while the dialogue is rife with ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]''-like puns, Ackerman's involvement has never been confirmed and his name never appeared in the on-screen credits or in original promotion for the film at the time of its release. In fact, Rankin/Bass historian Rick Goldschmidt, in liner notes accompanying the Anchor Bay DVD release, denied Ackerman was ever involved, at the same time as the DVD packaging promoted Ackerman's name. Goldschmidt repeated his claims on this in a 2006 blog entry, based on his interviews with Korobkin, who claimed to have written the original screenplay, which then was revised by Kurtzman, but never worked with Ackerman.<ref>Rick Goldschmidt's Blogspot site. [http://enchantedworldofrankinbass.blogspot.com/2006/12/are-you-sure.html Are You Sure?] December 27, 2006. Retrieved December 11, 2008.</ref>

In addition to the famous monsters seen in the film, ''Mad Monster Party?'' also features several celebrity likenesses. Karloff and Diller's characters are both designed to look like the actors portraying them, while Baron Frankenstein's lackey, Yetch, is a physical and vocal caricature of [[Peter Lorre]]. Swift also performs impersonations when voicing his characters, such as [[James Stewart]] when voicing Felix, [[Sydney Greenstreet]] as the Invisible Man and [[Charles Laughton]] as the Freighter Captain.

''Mad Monster Party?'' was one of several family-friendly projects Karloff lent his voice to in his final years (including the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|1966 television adaptation]] of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''). It was his final involvement in a production connected to the Frankenstein mythos that had propelled him to stardom some three decades earlier.

[[Image:Mad Monster Party cd cover.jpg|thumb|right|175px|CD cover]]
Although the opening credits identify [[Ethel Ennis]] as singing the opening theme song and, in the same frame, a soundtrack being available on [[RCA Victor]], a commercially released soundtrack was never produced in any format. In September 1998, Percepto released a CD of the soundtrack for the film. \"The Mummy\" is allegedly performed by [[Dyke and the Blazers]]. Tracks without performer credits are instrumentals and contain no dialogue.

==Reception==
The film holds a 70% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on ten reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mad_monster_party/ |title=Mad Monster Party (1967) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref> Howard Thompson of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"this party should make everybody chuckle\".<ref name=nyt/>

==Home media==
The film has been available on video for years, first on original distributor [[Embassy Pictures]]' home entertainment unit, and then on other independent labels before [[StudioCanal]] acquired some rights to the film. Currently, [[Lionsgate]] distributes the film on video under license from StudioCanal.

Before Lionsgate's current video release of ''Mad Monster Party?'', almost all video releases have been from 16&nbsp;mm film and were of very poor color quality. The original film negative was water-damaged some years ago, but  [[Sony Pictures Television]] (which now holds the television rights) eventually unearthed an original 35&nbsp;mm pristine print. This print was digitally remastered, and is the source for the current DVD issue and all subsequent television showings. Anchor Bay released the previous DVD on August 19, 2003, then re-released it on August 23, 2005 with additional features. On September 8, 2009, it was released as a \"Special Edition\" DVD by Lionsgate. The special features include a documentary including interviews with Rick Goldschmidt, Arthur Rankin Jr., voice artist Allen Swift, storyboard artist Don Duga, musical director Maury Laws and others. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 4, 2012.

==Plot==
On the Isle of Evil, [[Victor Frankenstein|Baron Boris von Frankenstein]] (voiced by [[Boris Karloff]]) achieves his ultimate ambition, the secret of total destruction. Having perfected and tested the formula, he sends out messenger bats to summon all monsters to the Isle of Evil in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The Baron intends to inform them of his discovery and also to reveal his imminent retirement as head of the \"Worldwide Organization of Monsters\". Besides [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]] (sometimes referred to as \"Fang\") and the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Monster's more intelligent mate]] (voiced by [[Phyllis Diller]]) who live in the isle's castle with Boris, the invites also include [[Count Dracula]], the [[Mummy (undead)|Mummy]], [[Quasimodo]] (referred to as the \"[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\"), the [[Werewolf]], [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|The Invisible Man]], [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and the [[Gill-man|Creature from the Black Lagoon]] (referred to as just \"The Creature\").

The Baron's beautiful assistant Francesca (voiced by [[Gale Garnett]]) enters the lab to confirm that all invitations have been delivered and inquires about one of the addressees named Felix Flanken (voiced by [[Allen Swift]] impersonating [[James Stewart]]). Frankenstein explains that Flanken is his nephew and successor in the monster business. This displeases Francesca, who covets the role for herself. Francesca even asks why there was not an invitation for \"It\". Boris replies that \"It\" was not invited since \"It\" can be a crushing bore, explaining that \"It\" even crushed the island's [[wild boar]]s in his bare hands the last time \"It\" was invited.

Frankenstein has his zombie butler, Yetch (Swift impersonating [[Peter Lorre]]), Chef Mafia Machiavelli, and the zombie bellhops and servants make preparations for the upcoming party while having some zombies patrol the Isle of Evil to make sure that \"It\" does not show up uninvited. The monsters begin to arrive on the freighter that Felix is also traveling on.

However, when Felix proves to be an incompetent, asthmatic (and unsuitably kind-hearted) human, the monsters plot to eliminate him and gain control of the secret formula. Over time, Francesca develops feelings for Felix after he unknowingly saves her multiple times. As Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Monster's Mate descend upon Francesca, she sends out a letter (via messenger bat) to an unknown recipient. When the monsters corner Felix upon capturing Francesca, they are frightened at the arrival of \"It\" (revealed to be a giant [[gorilla]] and a take-off of [[King Kong]]) who proceeds to go on a rampage since he was not invited. \"It\" snatches up the monsters and Francesca (on whom \"It\" develops a crush).

Felix rushes off to tell his Uncle Boris what happened and is instructed to head to the boat. Boris leads the zombies in rescuing Francesca from \"It\" using biplanes. Boris convinces \"It\" to let Francesca go and to take him instead. \"It\" complies, releasing Francesca. Felix and Francesca manage to get off the island as Boris and the remainder of the monsters remain in the clutches of \"It\". Displeased that the monsters tried to steal the secret of total destruction for themselves and attempted to kill Felix as well as having to put up with \"It\", Boris sacrifices his life by dropping the vial containing the formula, destroying the Isle of Evil and everything on it.

The destruction is witnessed offshore by Felix and Francesca. Francesca tearfully admits to Felix that she is not human, but is in fact a robot creation of Boris von Frankenstein. Felix answers that \"none of us are perfect\" where he then mechanically repeats the words \"are perfect\", indicating that he has also been a robot creation of his uncle the entire time.

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
The film was created using Rankin/Bass' \"Animagic\" [[stop motion]] animation process, supervised by [[Tadahito Mochinaga]] at MOM Productions in [[Tokyo]], Japan. The process involved photographing figurines a frame at a time, then re-positioning them, exposing another frame, and so forth.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In addition to Mochinaga, along with assistant director Kizo Nagashima, many other \"Animagic\" technicians of MOM (re-established as Video Tokyo Production after Mochinaga left for China) including puppet makers Ichiro Komuro and Kyoko Kita, and assistant animators Hiroshi Tabata and Fumiko Magari{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} also worked on the film for Rankin/Bass, but are uncredited.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Known as stop-motion animation, it was the same approach used in [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]'s ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', [[Art Clokey]]'s ''[[Gumby]]'' and ''[[Davey and Goliath]]'', and many other films, commercials and TV specials. In partnership with MOM and [[Dentsu]], Rankin/Bass had created several \"Animagic\" productions, including the syndicated television series ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the enormously successful Christmas television special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' and their first full-length film ''[[Willy McBean and his Magic Machine]]''. Classic monster films were enjoying a resurgence in popularity in the late 1960s, along with more comedy-centered examples, ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and ''[[The Munsters]]''. This [[camp (style)|campy]] film is a spoof of horror themes, complete with [[musical film|musical numbers]] and [[in-joke|inside jokes]].

''[[Mad Magazine]]'' creator [[Harvey Kurtzman]] penned the script (with writer Len Korobkin) and ''Mad'' artist [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] designed many of the characters. Davis was a natural for the job, being famous both for his humor work and his monster stories in the pages of [[EC Comics]]. It has long been rumored that [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] had a hand in the script, but while the dialogue is rife with ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]''-like puns, Ackerman's involvement has never been confirmed and his name never appeared in the on-screen credits or in original promotion for the film at the time of its release. In fact, Rankin/Bass historian Rick Goldschmidt, in liner notes accompanying the Anchor Bay DVD release, denied Ackerman was ever involved, at the same time as the DVD packaging promoted Ackerman's name. Goldschmidt repeated his claims on this in a 2006 blog entry, based on his interviews with Korobkin, who claimed to have written the original screenplay, which then was revised by Kurtzman, but never worked with Ackerman.<ref>Rick Goldschmidt's Blogspot site.

[[File:L15_(17810345710).jpg|thumb|L-15 during a handover ceremony]]

The '''Hongdu L-15 Falcon''' (猎鹰) is a supersonic advanced [[Trainer (aircraft)|training]] and light combat aircraft being developed by Nanchang-based [[Hongdu Aviation Industry Corporation]] (HAIC) to meet the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) and [[People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force]] (PLANAF) lead-in fighter trainer (LIFT) requirements, as well as next-generation training and light combat needs for foreign customers.<ref name=\"163.com\"/>

==Design and development==
The L-15 is an advanced trainer aircraft developed by [[Nanchang]] based Hongdu Aviation Industry Corporation. The aircraft made its [[maiden flight]] on 13 March 2006. The aircraft's general designer is Mr. Zhang Hong (张弘), and development had reportedly been completed alongside [[Yakovlev]] OKB of Russia. The L-15 is a direct rival to the [[Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation]] (GAIC) [[JL-9]]/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle in competition for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]]'s (PLAAF) next-generation advanced trainer aircraft program.

HAIG unveiled a full-scale [[mock-up]] of its L-15 advanced [[lead-in fighter trainer]] (LIFT) in the [[China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition|2004 Zhuhai Airshow]]. The two-seat, two-engine L-15 featured the latest advanced technologies developed by China, such as the digital quadruple [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW), [[glass cockpit]] (two multi-color head down displays for both the front and rear cockpit, and an additional head-up display for the front cockpit) and [[hands-on-throttle-and-stick]] (HOTAS) [[flight control]]. The look-down field of view for the front cockpit is 18°, and 6° for the rear cockpit, exceeding the US requirement.  The aerodynamic performance of the aircraft is enhanced by its large [[leading edge extensions]] (LEX) design, which gives a maximum [[angle of attack]] of 30°. This is very useful when trying to simulate the maneuvers of advanced [[Fourth generation jet fighter|fourth-generation fighters]] such as [[Chengdu J-10|J-10]], [[JF-17 Thunder|JF-17]] and [[Shenyang J-11|J-11]], as well as for newest fifth generation fighter like J-20 and J-31. JL-9/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle trainer jet from Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation (GAIC) is a direct competitor of the L-15. L-15 has a wide range of more advanced features comparing JL-9, but JL-9 is significant cheaper and its development and production would be fully indigenous, while early batches of L-15 still rely on AI-222 series turbofan engine from Ukraine before an indigenous update is ready. <ref name=\"L15-JL9-trainer-jet-competition\">{{cite web |url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/english/L15-advanced-trainer-jet-china.html |title=L15 and JL9 trainer jet competition, China PLAAF |website=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=29 Aug 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128065129/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/english/L15-advanced-trainer-jet-china.html |archivedate=2011-11-28 }}</ref>

Each of the first two units (#01 & #02) are powered by two [[Ivchenko-Progress]] [[ZMKB (Progress) DV-2|DV-2]] engines, which do not have [[Afterburner|afterburners]], and these two aircraft thus do not have the capability to reach supersonic speed. The third unit (#03) is powered by a pair of an improved version of the DV-2, the DV-2F, that has afterburners, so that it can attain supersonic speed.  The subsequent production units are expected to be powered by Ukraine's Ivchenko-Progress [[AI-222K-25F]] [[turbofan]] engines with afterburners once a co-production license is obtained by the 608 Institute. Ivchenko-Progress was able to increase the thrust of the AI-222-28F (thrust 4500&nbsp;kg afterburning) and AI-222-30F (5000&nbsp;kg thrust afterburning) engines. The latter two engines may be used to equip the L-15 or other Chinese aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.airforceworld.com/a/20150624/144.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702181419/http://en.airforceworld.com/a/20150624/144.html |archive-date=2015-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Meanwhile, according to various Chinese reports, L-15s with updated Guizhou FWS-17 engines had already undergone test flights.<ref name=\"sina.cn\"/>

The '''Hongdu L-15 Falcon''' (猎鹰) is a supersonic advanced [[Trainer (aircraft)|training]] and light combat aircraft being developed by Nanchang-based [[Hongdu Aviation Industry Corporation]] (HAIC) to meet the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) and [[People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force]] (PLANAF) lead-in fighter trainer (LIFT) requirements, as well as next-generation training and light combat needs for foreign customers.<ref name=\"163.com\"/>

==Design and development==
The L-15 is an advanced trainer aircraft developed by [[Nanchang]] based Hongdu Aviation Industry Corporation. The aircraft made its [[maiden flight]] on 13 March 2006. The aircraft's general designer is Mr. Zhang Hong (张弘), and development had reportedly been completed alongside [[Yakovlev]] OKB of Russia. The L-15 is a direct rival to the [[Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation]] (GAIC) [[JL-9]]/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle in competition for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]]'s (PLAAF) next-generation advanced trainer aircraft program.

HAIG unveiled a full-scale [[mock-up]] of its L-15 advanced [[lead-in fighter trainer]] (LIFT) in the [[China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition|2004 Zhuhai Airshow]]. The two-seat, two-engine L-15 featured the latest advanced technologies developed by China, such as the digital quadruple [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW), [[glass cockpit]] (two multi-color head down displays for both the front and rear cockpit, and an additional head-up display for the front cockpit) and [[hands-on-throttle-and-stick]] (HOTAS) [[flight control]]. The look-down field of view for the front cockpit is 18°, and 6° for the rear cockpit, exceeding the US requirement.  The aerodynamic performance of the aircraft is enhanced by its large [[leading edge extensions]] (LEX) design, which gives a maximum [[angle of attack]] of 30°. This is very useful when trying to simulate the maneuvers of advanced [[Fourth generation jet fighter|fourth-generation fighters]] such as [[Chengdu J-10|J-10]], [[JF-17 Thunder|JF-17]] and [[Shenyang J-11|J-11]], as well as for newest fifth generation fighter like J-20 and J-31. JL-9/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle trainer jet from Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation (GAIC) is a direct competitor of the L-15. L-15 has a wide range of more advanced features comparing JL-9, but JL-9 is significant cheaper and its development and production would be fully indigenous, while early batches of L-15 still rely on AI-222 series turbofan engine from Ukraine before an indigenous update is ready. <ref name=\"L15-JL9-trainer-jet-competition\">{{cite web |url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/english/L15-advanced-trainer-jet-china.html |title=L15 and JL9 trainer jet competition, China PLAAF |website=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=29 Aug 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128065129/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/english/L15-advanced-trainer-jet-china.html |archivedate=2011-11-28 }}</ref>

'''''Dr. Phil''''' is an American [[talk show]] created by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and the host [[Phil McGraw]]. After McGraw's success with his segments on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''Dr. Phil'' debuted on September 16, 2002. On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of \"life strategies\" from his life experience as a [[clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drphil.com/about-dr-phil/|title=About Dr. Phil {{!}} Dr. Phil|date=2015-10-22|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

The show is in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] throughout the United States and a number of other countries. Its tenth season premiered on September 12, 2011. Occasional prime time specials have aired on [[CBS]]. The program has been nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] every year since 2004. Since September 2008, ''Dr. Phil'' has been broadcast in HDTV with a revamped look and a new theme written and performed by McGraw's son, Jordan.

The executive producers are Phil McGraw and [[showrunner]] Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of [[Phil McGraw|Peteski Productions]] and distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]]. [[Harpo Productions]] co-produced the series until 2010, with [[Paramount Domestic Television]] and its successor, [[CBS Paramount Domestic Television]], serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by [[King World Productions]].

The program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in [[Hollywood, California]]. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season. Reruns of earlier episodes of the series began broadcasting on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] in January 2011. On October 25, 2018, it was announced that ''Dr. Phil'' had been renewed for four additional seasons, taking the show to May 2023, or the end of its 21st season.

==Format==
The show covers a wide variety of topics including [[weight loss]], [[financial planning]], errant children, gift suggestions, [[autistic]] children, unhappily [[marriage|married couples]], [[Teenage rebellion|rebellious teenagers]], mothers who dress far from their age, mothers who refuse to attend weddings, children being stars and their parents' rights, the emotional benefits of controlling, [[dysfunctional families]], mothers who refuse to give their married sons money, and support for charitable causes. Radio personality and former child star [[Danny Bonaduce]] came to the show twice in a year to discuss his failing [[marriage]] (and later [[divorce]]) with second wife Gretchen.

On several shows children and/or adults have taken [[lie detector|polygraph]] tests, usually done by retired FBI agent Jack Trimarco. The show is generally serious in tone, leavened with humor from time to time. It has its occasional tense moments and often [[trash TV|trashy]] scenes, like that of ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', but without melees or aggressive fights on stage, in contrast to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' or ''[[The Steve Wilkos Show]]''. McGraw is noted for often bringing families back on multiple shows for follow-up \"therapy\" sessions in his segment called \"Dr. Phil Family.\"

Generally the program is filmed and guests appear in studio, but in 2006 the ''Dr. Phil House'' began as an occasional series. McGraw and his production staff invite guests to a special house wired with numerous cameras and microphones. There, his staff monitors the conversations of the guests he is trying to help, and intervenes when necessary in order to prevent physical violence. McGraw also provides on-the-spot advice and counseling to the \"house guests\". McGraw's wife Robin sits in the studio audience for almost every show and, at the end of the show, walks off the set with him.

=={{anchor|Notable episodes}}Notable episodes==
* In a show that aired on May 2, 2005, twin sisters Jocelyn and Crystal Potter appeared. Crystal claimed to want to work in the [[adult industry]] together with Jocelyn, who rejected the idea as repulsive. Brothel owner [[Dennis Hof]] was interviewed and stated that the two could make half a million dollars per year in his establishment. The sisters' testimony proved to be less than truthful: beginning in 2002, they appeared as the \"Potter Sisters\" in numerous pornographic films together, and in 2003, they even appeared together with Hof in the porn film ''Goin' Down At The Bunny Ranch''. The show received much criticism due to perceptions of hypocrisy, because even though McGraw was an outspoken critic of [[pornography]], his own son [[Jay McGraw]] was married to [[Erica Dahm]], a ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmate (December 1998), who was notable for performing with her two identical triplet sisters.<ref name=\"porn\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |title=Dr. Phil's Double Trouble|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=New York Daily News|year=2005|author=Ben Widdicombe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052936/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |archivedate = December 31, 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"porn2\">{{Cite web|url=http://s91498905.onlinehome.us/DrPhil/|title=How Dr. Phil became Dr. Phoney|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=OnlineHome.us|year=2005|author=Anon}}</ref>
* The ''Dr. Phil House'' was set in an actual house within the [[Wilshire Park, Los Angeles, California|Wilshire Park]] neighborhood in Los Angeles. It received numerous complaints from neighbors about the disruption caused by filming crews, the guests, cables and production trucks clogging the neighborhood and the constant traffic caused by filming.  After the [[Los Angeles City Council]] revoked film permits, in September 2006, ''Dr. Phil'' stopped filming there. However, \"Peteski\" Productions, the show's production company, which drew its name from the nickname of one of McGraw's sons, retained ownership of the house. The ''Dr. Phil House'' later moved to a studio back lot, and the interior of the house shown in the program became that of a sound stage and ceased to be that of the actual house.<ref>\"Dr. Phil gets the heave-ho for filming abuses,\" Office of council member Tom Labonge, 4th Council District Newsletter [http://www.lacity.org/council/cd4/weekly/cd4weekly112541080_10132006.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Last accessed December 12, 2006</ref>
* In 2006, a [[confidence scam]] was discovered, involving a psychic shop that fraudulently represented ''Dr. Phil''. The three Texas women running the scam, Ann Theresa Stevens (aka Nancy Evans), Serena Stevens (aka Betty Ann Lee), and Cher Evans, had set up a phone line that they claimed was run by the director of ''Dr. Phil''. By telling customers that they could have a phone conversation with McGraw for $750 an hour, they scammed ''Dr. Phil''{{'}}s viewers out of thousands of dollars.<ref>Flood, Mary (April 4, 2007).

* On December 12, 2006, the show featured a segment on ''[[Bumfights]]'', and attacks on the homeless across America. McGraw discontinued an interview, before asking any questions, with Ty Beeson, producer of the video series, who had styled himself in a manner similar to ''Dr. Phil''. Beeson was escorted off the set by uniformed [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] security guards as the studio audience clapped and cheered.<ref>{{YouTube|CNPvdsJS-qE|\"Dr. Phil Kicks Guest Off Show\"}}</ref>

When Bhabie became irritated at the laughter that the audience exhibited at her expense, she responded to it by saying, \"Catch me outside, how about that”. Her pronunciation of this phrase became a viral Internet meme \"Cash Me Ousside Howbow Dah\", and Bhabie became known as the \"Cash Me Outside Girl\".<ref>Burke, Minyvonne (June 28, 2017).

Treasure made various claims to substantiate her belief that [[Transracial (identity)|transracial]] identity is a norm.
* Due to the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]], the show's regular programming format, studio location, as well as in-person guests was temporarily halted in late March of 2020, due to the social distancing measures, States of Emergency, and restrictions on public gatherings. Rather than hosting live-audience shows, or putting the show on hiatus, McGraw began hosting Dr. Phil from his home studio. The episodes typically began with McGraw being joined by various medical doctors, CDC officials and mental health professionals – via internet-conference – and discussed public concerns and anxieties surrounding the pandemic, as well as the mental and physical strain that viewers might have. This was the first time during the history of the Dr. Phil Show that regular, weekly episodes were not filmed in the Studio, and did not involve either in-person guests, audiences and very limited technical assistance.

==''Dr. Phil Now''==
Episodes under the ''Dr. Phil Now'' banner usually feature current events in the news with McGraw's viewpoint, often with an interview with the subject involved, which may include a suspect in a [[true crime]] case, the parents in a contentious child custody battle, or a celebrity subject. These episodes often feature more urgent music, and often feature McGraw originating the segment from the [[master control]] room of [[KCBS-TV]] with a bank of monitors tuned to various news networks and local news stations to give a more news-like feel to the episode.

==Criticism==
McGraw's advice and methods have drawn criticism from psychotherapists as well as from laypersons. McGraw said in a 2001 South Florida newspaper interview that he never liked traditional one-on-one counseling, and that \"I'm not the Hush-Puppies, pipe and 'Let's talk about your mother' kind of psychologist.\"<ref name=\"Lavin\">Lavin, Cheryl. \"Dr. Tell it Like it Is.\" ''South Florida Sun Sentinel'', July 3, 2001, Page 1E</ref> In 2004 the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] called McGraw's conduct in one episode of his television show \"unethical\" and \"incredibly irresponsible\".<ref name=\"Moraes 2004\">{{cite news |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=On Dr. Phil, a Dose of Bad Medicine? |work=Washington Post | date=1 September 2004 |p=C7 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63905-2004Sep30.html | access-date=4 August 2017}}</ref> McGraw's critics regard advice given by him to be at best simplistic, and at worst, ineffective.<ref>{{cite book|title=SHAM; How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless|last=Salerno|first=Steve|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2005|isbn=1-4000-5409-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shamhowselfhelpm00sale}}</ref>

On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of \"life strategies\" from his life experience as a [[clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drphil.com/about-dr-phil/|title=About Dr. Phil {{!}} Dr. Phil|date=2015-10-22|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

The show is in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] throughout the United States and a number of other countries. Its tenth season premiered on September 12, 2011. Occasional prime time specials have aired on [[CBS]]. The program has been nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] every year since 2004. Since September 2008, ''Dr. Phil'' has been broadcast in HDTV with a revamped look and a new theme written and performed by McGraw's son, Jordan.

The executive producers are Phil McGraw and [[showrunner]] Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of [[Phil McGraw|Peteski Productions]] and distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]]. [[Harpo Productions]] co-produced the series until 2010, with [[Paramount Domestic Television]] and its successor, [[CBS Paramount Domestic Television]], serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by [[King World Productions]].

The program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in [[Hollywood, California]]. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season. Reruns of earlier episodes of the series began broadcasting on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] in January 2011. On October 25, 2018, it was announced that ''Dr. Phil'' had been renewed for four additional seasons, taking the show to May 2023, or the end of its 21st season.

==Format==
The show covers a wide variety of topics including [[weight loss]], [[financial planning]], errant children, gift suggestions, [[autistic]] children, unhappily [[marriage|married couples]], [[Teenage rebellion|rebellious teenagers]], mothers who dress far from their age, mothers who refuse to attend weddings, children being stars and their parents' rights, the emotional benefits of controlling, [[dysfunctional families]], mothers who refuse to give their married sons money, and support for charitable causes. Radio personality and former child star [[Danny Bonaduce]] came to the show twice in a year to discuss his failing [[marriage]] (and later [[divorce]]) with second wife Gretchen.

On several shows children and/or adults have taken [[lie detector|polygraph]] tests, usually done by retired FBI agent Jack Trimarco. The show is generally serious in tone, leavened with humor from time to time. It has its occasional tense moments and often [[trash TV|trashy]] scenes, like that of ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', but without melees or aggressive fights on stage, in contrast to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' or ''[[The Steve Wilkos Show]]''. McGraw is noted for often bringing families back on multiple shows for follow-up \"therapy\" sessions in his segment called \"Dr. Phil Family.\"

Generally the program is filmed and guests appear in studio, but in 2006 the ''Dr. Phil House'' began as an occasional series. McGraw and his production staff invite guests to a special house wired with numerous cameras and microphones. There, his staff monitors the conversations of the guests he is trying to help, and intervenes when necessary in order to prevent physical violence. McGraw also provides on-the-spot advice and counseling to the \"house guests\". McGraw's wife Robin sits in the studio audience for almost every show and, at the end of the show, walks off the set with him.

=={{anchor|Notable episodes}}Notable episodes==
* In a show that aired on May 2, 2005, twin sisters Jocelyn and Crystal Potter appeared. Crystal claimed to want to work in the [[adult industry]] together with Jocelyn, who rejected the idea as repulsive. Brothel owner [[Dennis Hof]] was interviewed and stated that the two could make half a million dollars per year in his establishment. The sisters' testimony proved to be less than truthful: beginning in 2002, they appeared as the \"Potter Sisters\" in numerous pornographic films together, and in 2003, they even appeared together with Hof in the porn film ''Goin' Down At The Bunny Ranch''. The show received much criticism due to perceptions of hypocrisy, because even though McGraw was an outspoken critic of [[pornography]], his own son [[Jay McGraw]] was married to [[Erica Dahm]], a ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmate (December 1998), who was notable for performing with her two identical triplet sisters.<ref name=\"porn\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |title=Dr. Phil's Double Trouble|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=New York Daily News|year=2005|author=Ben Widdicombe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052936/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |archivedate = December 31, 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"porn2\">{{Cite web|url=http://s91498905.onlinehome.us/DrPhil/|title=How Dr. Phil became Dr. Phoney|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=OnlineHome.us|year=2005|author=Anon}}</ref>
* The ''Dr. Phil House'' was set in an actual house within the [[Wilshire Park, Los Angeles, California|Wilshire Park]] neighborhood in Los Angeles. It received numerous complaints from neighbors about the disruption caused by filming crews, the guests, cables and production trucks clogging the neighborhood and the constant traffic caused by filming.  After the [[Los Angeles City Council]] revoked film permits, in September 2006, ''Dr. Phil'' stopped filming there. However, \"Peteski\" Productions, the show's production company, which drew its name from the nickname of one of McGraw's sons, retained ownership of the house. The ''Dr. Phil House'' later moved to a studio back lot, and the interior of the house shown in the program became that of a sound stage and ceased to be that of the actual house.<ref>\"Dr. Phil gets the heave-ho for filming abuses,\" Office of council member Tom Labonge, 4th Council District Newsletter [http://www.lacity.org/council/cd4/weekly/cd4weekly112541080_10132006.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Last accessed December 12, 2006</ref>
* In 2006, a [[confidence scam]] was discovered, involving a psychic shop that fraudulently represented ''Dr. Phil''. The three Texas women running the scam, Ann Theresa Stevens (aka Nancy Evans), Serena Stevens (aka Betty Ann Lee), and Cher Evans, had set up a phone line that they claimed was run by the director of ''Dr. Phil''. By telling customers that they could have a phone conversation with McGraw for $750 an hour, they scammed ''Dr. Phil''{{'}}s viewers out of thousands of dollars.<ref>Flood, Mary (April 4, 2007).

* On December 12, 2006, the show featured a segment on ''[[Bumfights]]'', and attacks on the homeless across America. McGraw discontinued an interview, before asking any questions, with Ty Beeson, producer of the video series, who had styled himself in a manner similar to ''Dr. Phil''. Beeson was escorted off the set by uniformed [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] security guards as the studio audience clapped and cheered.<ref>{{YouTube|CNPvdsJS-qE|\"Dr. Phil Kicks Guest Off Show\"}}</ref>

When Bhabie became irritated at the laughter that the audience exhibited at her expense, she responded to it by saying, \"Catch me outside, how about that”.

Treasure made various claims to substantiate her belief that [[Transracial (identity)|transracial]] identity is a norm.
* Due to the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]], the show's regular programming format, studio location, as well as in-person guests was temporarily halted in late March of 2020, due to the social distancing measures, States of Emergency, and restrictions on public gatherings. Rather than hosting live-audience shows, or putting the show on hiatus, McGraw began hosting Dr. Phil from his home studio. The episodes typically began with McGraw being joined by various medical doctors, CDC officials and mental health professionals – via internet-conference – and discussed public concerns and anxieties surrounding the pandemic, as well as the mental and physical strain that viewers might have. This was the first time during the history of the Dr. Phil Show that regular, weekly episodes were not filmed in the Studio, and did not involve either in-person guests, audiences and very limited technical assistance.

==''Dr. Phil Now''==
Episodes under the ''Dr. Phil Now'' banner usually feature current events in the news with McGraw's viewpoint, often with an interview with the subject involved, which may include a suspect in a [[true crime]] case, the parents in a contentious child custody battle, or a celebrity subject. These episodes often feature more urgent music, and often feature McGraw originating the segment from the [[master control]] room of [[KCBS-TV]] with a bank of monitors tuned to various news networks and local news stations to give a more news-like feel to the episode.

==Criticism==
McGraw's advice and methods have drawn criticism from psychotherapists as well as from laypersons. McGraw said in a 2001 South Florida newspaper interview that he never liked traditional one-on-one counseling, and that \"I'm not the Hush-Puppies, pipe and 'Let's talk about your mother' kind of psychologist.\"<ref name=\"Lavin\">Lavin, Cheryl. \"Dr. Tell it Like it Is.\" ''South Florida Sun Sentinel'', July 3, 2001, Page 1E</ref> In 2004 the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] called McGraw's conduct in one episode of his television show \"unethical\" and \"incredibly irresponsible\".<ref name=\"Moraes 2004\">{{cite news |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=On Dr. Phil, a Dose of Bad Medicine? |work=Washington Post | date=1 September 2004 |p=C7 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63905-2004Sep30.html | access-date=4 August 2017}}</ref> McGraw's critics regard advice given by him to be at best simplistic, and at worst, ineffective.<ref>{{cite book|title=SHAM; How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless|last=Salerno|first=Steve|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2005|isbn=1-4000-5409-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shamhowselfhelpm00sale}}</ref>

The '''Trafficante crime family''', also known as the '''[[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] Mafia''', is the only original [[American mafia|Mafia]] crime family in the state of [[Florida]]

==History== 
{{see also|History of Tampa, Florida}}

===Tampa's underworld===
Tampa crime started with [[Charlie Wall]] who, in the 1920s, controlled a number of gambling rackets and corrupt government officials. Wall controlled Tampa from the neighborhood known as [[Ybor City, Tampa, Florida|Ybor City]], he employed Italians, Cubans and men of other ethnicities into his organization. Charlie Wall's only competition was Tampa's earliest Mafia boss Ignacio Antinori.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\">{{cite web|url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317|title= Deitche, Scott. \"The Mob\" April 26, 2001|author=|date=|website=creativeloafing.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>

===Antinori gang===
The first Italian gang in the [[Tampa Bay]] area was created by [[Ignacio Antinori]] in 1925. Antinori, a [[Palermo, Sicily|Sicilian]]-born immigrant, became a well-known drug kingpin and the Italian crime boss of Tampa in the late 1920s. A smaller Italian gang in the area was controlled by [[Santo Trafficante Sr.]], who had lived in Tampa since the age of 18. Trafficante had already set up [[Bolita]] games throughout the city and was a very powerful man. Antinori took notice of Santo Trafficante and invited him into his organization and together they expanded the Bolita games across the state. By the 1930s Ignacio Antinori and Charlie Wall were in a bloody war for ten years, which would later be known as \"Era of Blood\". Wall's closest associate, [[Evaristo \"Tito\" Rubio]], was shot on his porch on March 8, 1938. The war ended in the 1940s with Ignacio Antinori being shot and killed with a sawn-off shotgun. Both Wall's and Antinori's organizations were weakened leaving Santo Trafficante as one of the last and most powerful bosses in Tampa.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/>

===Trafficante Sr. era===
[[Santo Trafficante Sr.]] had now taken over a majority of the city and started to teach his son Santo Trafficante Jr. how to run the city. In Trafficante Sr.'s adult life he only portrayed himself as a successful Tampa cigar factory owner.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Cigar\">Deitche, Scott. \"Cigar City Mafia: A Complete History of the Tampa Underworld\". New York: Barricade Books. 2004</ref> Santo was being watched closely by police and made Salvatore \"Red\" Italiano the acting boss. With the untimely [[Kefauver]] hearings and Charlie Wall testifying in 1950, both Trafficantes fled to [[Cuba]]. He always wanted to make it big in Cuban casinos and dispatched his son, Santo, Jr., to [[Havana]] in 1946 to help operate a mob owned [[casino]]. The Tampa mob made a lot of money in Cuba, but never achieved its ambition of making the island part of its own territory. After the hearings ended the Trafficantes returned to Tampa to find out that Italiano had just fled to Mexico leaving Jimmy Lumia the biggest mobster in the city. Santo had Lumia killed after finding out he was bad mouthing him while he was in Cuba and he took over again. In 1953 Santo Jr. survived a shooting. The family suspected it was Charlie Wall and they had him killed in 1955. Trafficante remained the boss of Tampa until he died of natural causes in 1954.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/><ref name=\"Scott Deitche Don\">Deitche, Scott. \"The Silent Don: The Criminal Underworld of Santo Trafficante Jr\".

===Trafficante Jr. era===
[[File:Santo_Trafficante_at_San_Souci’s_bar._Havana,_Cuba.png|thumb|left|Santo Trafficante at [[Sans Souci Cabaret|San_Souci]]’s bar, 1955.]]

[[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]] succeeded his father as the boss of Tampa and ruled his family with an iron fist.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Don\"/> Despite numerous stunted ambitions, he was regarded as one of the most powerful mob bosses of the [[American Mafia]]. Santo Jr. was born in the United States on Nov. 15, 1914 and was one of five sons of Mafia boss Santo Trafficante. He maintained close working ties with the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]] and [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]] crime families from [[New York City]]. Santo Jr. worked closely with Lucchese family boss [[Tommy Lucchese]], who was a friend of his father, and a man who helped train him in the 1940s.<ref>Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful mafia empires by Selwyn Raab [https://books.google.com/books?id=5nAt6N8iQnYC&pg=PA719&dq=Raab+%22Five+Families%22+The+rise,decline+and+resurgence+of+America's+most+powerful+mafia+empires.+ch.13&hl=en&ei=xq2CTZqwFbCF0QGF7ZzTCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Trafficante&f=false (pg. 105)]</ref>

Santo Jr. was known to have been deeply involved in the [[CIA]] efforts to involve the underworld in assassination attempts on [[Fidel Castro]].<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Don\"/> Under pressure of a court order granting him immunity from prosecution, but threatening him with contempt if he refused to talk, Trafficante admitted to a Congressional committee in 1975 that he had in the early 1960s recruited other mobsters to assassinate Castro.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} \"It was like [[World War II]]\" he told the committee. \"They told me to go to the draft board and sign up.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In 1978, Trafficante was called to testify before members of the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] investigating possible links between [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and [[anti-Castro]] Cubans, including the theory that Castro had President [[John F. Kennedy]] killed in retaliation for the [[assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|CIA's attempts to assassinate Castro]].<ref name=\"Eugene Register-Guard; September 28, 1978\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Witness denies assassination, Cuba tied |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0PlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CuIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6656%2C8218377 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |agency=UPI |page=8A |date=September 28, 1978 |access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref>

===LoScalzo era===
In 1987 Vincent LoScalzo became boss of the Trafficante family and Florida became open territory. The [[Five Families]] of New York City could work in any city in the state. LoScalzo's new family was smaller because many of the older mobsters were dead or retired.<ref name=\"Carrie Weimar\">Weimar, Carrie. \"Throwback: Tampa mob trail\". ST. Petersburg Times. October 16, 2006 [http://www.sptimes.com/2006/10/16/Hillsborough/Throwback__Tampa_mob_.shtml]</ref> He has interests in [[gambling]], [[prostitution]], [[narcotics]], [[Trade union|union]] [[racketeering]], [[truck hijacking|hijacking]] and [[Fence (criminal)|fencing]] stolen goods. He controls a few bars, lounges, restaurants, night clubs and liquor stores all over the state of Florida. Loscalzo has ties to [[California]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] as well as being connected to the [[Sicilian Mafia]]. On July 1, 1989, LoScalzo was indicted on racketeering charges that included grand theft. The charges were later dropped and then reinstated. LoScalzo plead [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] on October 7, 1997 and received three months of probation. In 1992, LoScalzo was arrested at the [[Tampa International Airport]] for carrying a loaded .38-caliber pistol in his brief case. The weapon showed up on the x-ray scanner. He was convicted for the charge in 1999 and was sentenced to 60 days in jail.<ref name=\"Carrie Weimar\"/>

====South Florida operations====
Santo Jr. started the family's south Florida crew in the early 1980s, putting Steven Bruno Raffa in charge. Bruno ran the crew with associates and freelancers after the death of Santo Jr. Raffa maintained a good relationship with LoScalzo, the new boss of the family and Genovese mobster John Mamone. In 2000 nineteen members of the crew were arrested and Raffa committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2004-03-25/news/the-snitch/2|title=The Snitch|first=Trevor|last=Aaronson|date=25 March 2004|website=browardpalmbeach.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Deitche|first1=Scott M.|title=The Suicide Of Steve Raffa|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_108.html|website=Rick Porrello's American Mafia.com|date=January 2001}}</ref>

====North Florida Operations====
The Trafficante Family expanded their reach into North Florida cities like Daytona and Jacksonville during the late 1980s. The North Florida operations were run by the Maglianos & Granados. The activities of this crew included money laundering, racketeering, narcotics distribution, and illegal gambling. In May 2015, 13 people in Jacksonville were indicted by the Federal government on money laundering charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/local/how-did-alleged-organized-crime-conspiracy-unfold|title=How did alleged organized crime conspiracy unfold?|first=Scott Johnson, News4Jax.com|last=Staff|date=|website=www.news4jax.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>

===Current Status===
As of November 25, 2007, Vincent LoScalzo is a 70+ year old semi-retired mobster and a ''\"regular Joe\"'' according to Scott Deitche, author of ''Cigar City Mafia''. The old family membership has died and the Tampa Mob has fallen into the shadows of the NYC mobs.<ref name=\"Michael Van Sickler\">Van Sickler, Michael. \"Kingpin of no Kingdom: A Brandom man Denies any mafia ties\".

Gotti|John A. \"Junior\" Gotti]], son of the late [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[John Gotti]], has been running organized crime in Tampa since his release from prison in 2005. Gotti is allegedly a captain in the Gambino family. On August 5, 2008 Gotti was indicted on charges of racketeering, [[kidnapping]], conspiracy to commit murder and [[drug trafficking]].

The '''Trafficante crime family''', also known as the '''[[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] Mafia''', is the only original [[American mafia|Mafia]] crime family in the state of [[Florida]]

==History==
{{see also|History of Tampa, Florida}}

===Tampa's underworld===
Tampa crime started with [[Charlie Wall]] who, in the 1920s, controlled a number of gambling rackets and corrupt government officials. Wall controlled Tampa from the neighborhood known as [[Ybor City, Tampa, Florida|Ybor City]], he employed Italians, Cubans and men of other ethnicities into his organization. Charlie Wall's only competition was Tampa's earliest Mafia boss Ignacio Antinori.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\">{{cite web|url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317|title= Deitche, Scott. \"The Mob\" April 26, 2001|author=|date=|website=creativeloafing.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>

===Antinori gang===
The first Italian gang in the [[Tampa Bay]] area was created by [[Ignacio Antinori]] in 1925. Antinori, a [[Palermo, Sicily|Sicilian]]-born immigrant, became a well-known drug kingpin and the Italian crime boss of Tampa in the late 1920s. A smaller Italian gang in the area was controlled by [[Santo Trafficante Sr.]], who had lived in Tampa since the age of 18. Trafficante had already set up [[Bolita]] games throughout the city and was a very powerful man. Antinori took notice of Santo Trafficante and invited him into his organization and together they expanded the Bolita games across the state. By the 1930s Ignacio Antinori and Charlie Wall were in a bloody war for ten years, which would later be known as \"Era of Blood\". Wall's closest associate, [[Evaristo \"Tito\" Rubio]], was shot on his porch on March 8, 1938. The war ended in the 1940s with Ignacio Antinori being shot and killed with a sawn-off shotgun. Both Wall's and Antinori's organizations were weakened leaving Santo Trafficante as one of the last and most powerful bosses in Tampa.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/>

===Trafficante Sr. era===
[[Santo Trafficante Sr.]] had now taken over a majority of the city and started to teach his son Santo Trafficante Jr. how to run the city. In Trafficante Sr.'s adult life he only portrayed himself as a successful Tampa cigar factory owner.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Cigar\">Deitche, Scott. \"Cigar City Mafia: A Complete History of the Tampa Underworld\". New York: Barricade Books. 2004</ref> Santo was being watched closely by police and made Salvatore \"Red\" Italiano the acting boss. With the untimely [[Kefauver]] hearings and Charlie Wall testifying in 1950, both Trafficantes fled to [[Cuba]]. He always wanted to make it big in Cuban casinos and dispatched his son, Santo, Jr., to [[Havana]] in 1946 to help operate a mob owned [[casino]]. The Tampa mob made a lot of money in Cuba, but never achieved its ambition of making the island part of its own territory. After the hearings ended the Trafficantes returned to Tampa to find out that Italiano had just fled to Mexico leaving Jimmy Lumia the biggest mobster in the city. Santo had Lumia killed after finding out he was bad mouthing him while he was in Cuba and he took over again. In 1953 Santo Jr. survived a shooting. The family suspected it was Charlie Wall and they had him killed in 1955. Trafficante remained the boss of Tampa until he died of natural causes in 1954.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/><ref name=\"Scott Deitche Don\">Deitche, Scott. \"The Silent Don: The Criminal Underworld of Santo Trafficante Jr\". New York: Barricade Books. 2008</ref>

===Trafficante Jr. era===
[[File:Santo_Trafficante_at_San_Souci’s_bar._Havana,_Cuba.png|thumb|left|Santo Trafficante at [[Sans Souci Cabaret|San_Souci]]’s bar, 1955.]]

[[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]] succeeded his father as the boss of Tampa and ruled his family with an iron fist.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Don\"/> Despite numerous stunted ambitions, he was regarded as one of the most powerful mob bosses of the [[American Mafia]]. Santo Jr. was born in the United States on Nov. 15, 1914 and was one of five sons of Mafia boss Santo Trafficante. He maintained close working ties with the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]] and [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]] crime families from [[New York City]]. Santo Jr. worked closely with Lucchese family boss [[Tommy Lucchese]], who was a friend of his father, and a man who helped train him in the 1940s.<ref>Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful mafia empires by Selwyn Raab [https://books.google.com/books?id=5nAt6N8iQnYC&pg=PA719&dq=Raab+%22Five+Families%22+The+rise,decline+and+resurgence+of+America's+most+powerful+mafia+empires.+ch.13&hl=en&ei=xq2CTZqwFbCF0QGF7ZzTCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Trafficante&f=false (pg. 105)]</ref>

Santo Jr. was known to have been deeply involved in the [[CIA]] efforts to involve the underworld in assassination attempts on [[Fidel Castro]].<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Don\"/> Under pressure of a court order granting him immunity from prosecution, but threatening him with contempt if he refused to talk, Trafficante admitted to a Congressional committee in 1975 that he had in the early 1960s recruited other mobsters to assassinate Castro.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} \"It was like [[World War II]]\" he told the committee. \"They told me to go to the draft board and sign up.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In 1978, Trafficante was called to testify before members of the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] investigating possible links between [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and [[anti-Castro]] Cubans, including the theory that Castro had President [[John F. Kennedy]] killed in retaliation for the [[assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|CIA's attempts to assassinate Castro]].<ref name=\"Eugene Register-Guard; September 28, 1978\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Witness denies assassination, Cuba tied |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0PlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CuIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6656%2C8218377 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |agency=UPI |page=8A |date=September 28, 1978 |access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref>

Santo, Jr. never spent a day in jail, and he died of natural causes in 1987.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche Everything\">Deitche, Scott. \"The Everything Mafia Book, Second Edition\". New York: Barricade Books. 2007</ref>

===LoScalzo era===
In 1987 Vincent LoScalzo became boss of the Trafficante family and Florida became open territory. The [[Five Families]] of New York City could work in any city in the state. LoScalzo's new family was smaller because many of the older mobsters were dead or retired.<ref name=\"Carrie Weimar\">Weimar, Carrie. \"Throwback: Tampa mob trail\". ST. Petersburg Times. October 16, 2006 [http://www.sptimes.com/2006/10/16/Hillsborough/Throwback__Tampa_mob_.shtml]</ref> He has interests in [[gambling]], [[prostitution]], [[narcotics]], [[Trade union|union]] [[racketeering]], [[truck hijacking|hijacking]] and [[Fence (criminal)|fencing]] stolen goods. He controls a few bars, lounges, restaurants, night clubs and liquor stores all over the state of Florida. Loscalzo has ties to [[California]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] as well as being connected to the [[Sicilian Mafia]]. On July 1, 1989, LoScalzo was indicted on racketeering charges that included grand theft. The charges were later dropped and then reinstated. LoScalzo plead [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] on October 7, 1997 and received three months of probation. In 1992, LoScalzo was arrested at the [[Tampa International Airport]] for carrying a loaded .38-caliber pistol in his brief case. The weapon showed up on the x-ray scanner. He was convicted for the charge in 1999 and was sentenced to 60 days in jail.<ref name=\"Carrie Weimar\"/>

====South Florida operations====
Santo Jr. started the family's south Florida crew in the early 1980s, putting Steven Bruno Raffa in charge. Bruno ran the crew with associates and freelancers after the death of Santo Jr. Raffa maintained a good relationship with LoScalzo, the new boss of the family and Genovese mobster John Mamone. In 2000 nineteen members of the crew were arrested and Raffa committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2004-03-25/news/the-snitch/2|title=The Snitch|first=Trevor|last=Aaronson|date=25 March 2004|website=browardpalmbeach.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Deitche|first1=Scott M.|title=The Suicide Of Steve Raffa|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_108.html|website=Rick Porrello's American Mafia.com|date=January 2001}}</ref>

====North Florida Operations====
The Trafficante Family expanded their reach into North Florida cities like Daytona and Jacksonville during the late 1980s. The North Florida operations were run by the Maglianos & Granados. The activities of this crew included money laundering, racketeering, narcotics distribution, and illegal gambling. In May 2015, 13 people in Jacksonville were indicted by the Federal government on money laundering charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/local/how-did-alleged-organized-crime-conspiracy-unfold|title=How did alleged organized crime conspiracy unfold?|first=Scott Johnson, News4Jax.com|last=Staff|date=|website=www.news4jax.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>

===Current Status===
As of November 25, 2007, Vincent LoScalzo is a 70+ year old semi-retired mobster and a ''\"regular Joe\"'' according to Scott Deitche, author of ''Cigar City Mafia''. The old family membership has died and the Tampa Mob has fallen into the shadows of the NYC mobs.<ref name=\"Michael Van Sickler\">Van Sickler, Michael. \"Kingpin of no Kingdom: A Brandom man Denies any mafia ties\".

====Gambinos in Tampa====
Recently{{when?|date=May 2019}} statements have spread across Florida that [[John A. Gotti|John A. \"Junior\" Gotti]], son of the late [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[John Gotti]], has been running organized crime in Tampa since his release from prison in 2005. Gotti is allegedly a captain in the Gambino family. On August 5, 2008 Gotti was indicted on charges of racketeering, [[kidnapping]], conspiracy to commit murder and [[drug trafficking]]. He and five others were indicted by a Florida grand jury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechicagosyndicate.com/2008/08/entire-john-junior-gotti-tampa-gambino.html|title=Entire John \"Junior\" Gotti Tampa Gambino Crime Family Indictment|first=The Chicago|last=Syndicate|date=|website=www.thechicagosyndicate.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>

'''Lancôme''' ({{IPA-fr|lɑ̃kom}}) is a French luxury perfumes and cosmetics house that distributes products internationally.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chesters|first=Anna|title=A brief history of Lancôme|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/mar/19/brief-history-lancome|accessdate=11 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 March 2012}}</ref> Lancôme is part of the [[L'Oréal]] Luxury Products division, which is its parent company and offers luxury [[skin care]], [[fragrances]], and makeup at higher-end prices.

==History==
[[Image:Lancome NYC Boutique Exterior.jpg|thumb|right|Lancôme Boutique on NYC's Upper West Side|Lancôme Boutique on NYC's Upper West Side]]

Founded in 1935 by Guillaume d'Ornano and his business partner Armand Petitjean in France, as originally a fragrance house. The name \"Lancôme\" was inspired by the forest of Lancosme that lies in the Indre valley in the heart of France in the region of La Brenne - the name was chosen by Guillaume's wife Elisabeth d'Ornano. The roses in the area inspired the company's symbol of the single golden rose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.in/content/exclusive-80-years-lancome-film/|title=Exclusive: 80 years of Lancôme in a 2-minute film}}</ref>

Lancôme launched its first five fragrances in 1935 at the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|World's Fair]] in Brussels: ''Tendre Nuit'', ''Bocages'', ''Conquete'', ''Kypre'' and ''Tropiques''. Petitjean entered into the luxury skincare market, launching Nutrix, his first \"all-purpose repair cream\" in 1936, followed by make-up, cosmetics, and skincare products. Lancôme was acquired by L'oreal in 1964, and quickly became part of its luxury products division.

==History==
[[Image:Lancome NYC Boutique Exterior.jpg|thumb|right|Lancôme Boutique on NYC's Upper West Side|Lancôme Boutique on NYC's Upper West Side]]

Founded in 1935 by Guillaume d'Ornano and his business partner Armand Petitjean in France, as originally a fragrance house. The name \"Lancôme\" was inspired by the forest of Lancosme that lies in the Indre valley in the heart of France in the region of La Brenne - the name was chosen by Guillaume's wife Elisabeth d'Ornano. The roses in the area inspired the company's symbol of the single golden rose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.in/content/exclusive-80-years-lancome-film/|title=Exclusive: 80 years of Lancôme in a 2-minute film}}</ref>

Lancôme launched its first five fragrances in 1935 at the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|World's Fair]] in Brussels: ''Tendre Nuit'', ''Bocages'', ''Conquete'', ''Kypre'' and ''Tropiques''. Petitjean entered into the luxury skincare market, launching Nutrix, his first \"all-purpose repair cream\" in 1936, followed by make-up, cosmetics, and skincare products. Lancôme was acquired by L'oreal in 1964, and quickly became part of its luxury products division.

'''Peter John Hudson''' <small>[[Order of Australia|AM]]</small> (born 19 February 1946) is a former [[Australian rules football]] player, considered one of the greatest [[full-forward]]s in the game's history.

Hudson was prolific in his goal scoring in all senior competitions in which he competed. Originally from [[Tasmania]], Hudson played with [[New Norfolk Eagles|New Norfolk Football Club]], in the [[Tasmanian Football League]] before crossing to [[Hawthorn Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] (now the Australian Football League); following his Hawthorn days he returned to Tasmania, playing for [[Glenorchy Football Club]] during which he kicked an amazing 616 goals in 81 games at a phenomenal 7.61 goals per game.

Over his career, he kicked 1,721 goals in 288 premiership games between 1963 and 1979, and 1981. His final match was in the 1981 [[Tasmanian Football League|TANFL]] Preliminary Final for Glenorchy, where Hudson, who had made a brief comeback with two rounds remaining due to Glenorchy having a string of injuries, kicked 30 goals in three matches, including six in his team's Preliminary Final loss to New Norfolk. Hudson was kept goalless just four times during his career in premiership matches by Richmond's [[Barry Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Barry Richardson]] in Round 7 of 1969, Collingwood's [[Ian Cooper (Australian footballer born 1946)|Ian Cooper]] in Round 2 of 1974, Carlton's [[Rod Austin]] in Round 14 of 1977 and in the TANFL, Bruce Greenhill of [[Sandy Bay Football Club|Sandy Bay]] in 1978.

Some sources list Hudson as playing 107 games and kicking 769 goals for Glenorchy for a TANFL total of 185 games and 1,147 goals, and a career total of 314 games and 1,875 goals. These discrepancies arise from the TANFL including goals scored in intrastate matches representing the TANFL in TANFL player's career statistics at that time, a ruling that was later rescinded.<ref name=\"age1\">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/29/1056825277701.html |title=Hudson the legend now a life member |date=30 June 2003 |publisher=The Age |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>

If the Tasmanian competitions, representative and night series games are considered, Hudson played an overall total of 372 matches and kicked 2,191 goals – an average of 5.89 goals a game over his entire career – making him the highest goalkicker in elite Australian rules football history.

Hudson's ability to win the ball was hard to pinpoint. There were times he seemed to gain possession of the ball ever so quietly and with consistent, nonchalant ease, his tally of goals for the game would gradually climb. Among his armoury of skills, he seemed to have the ability to quietly sneak away from the opposition attendant full-back. Before the frustrated backman knew it, Hudson had taken a nice comfortable mark on his chest for a simple goal.

== VFL career ==
In a Victorian Football League career beginning with the Hawthorn Football Club in 1967, he kicked 727 goals at an average of 5.64 a game.

Hudson won the [[Coleman Medal]] for the League's leading goal kicker four times in his career: in 1968 (125 goals); 1970 (146); 1971 (150); and 1977 (110). He also became the first player to kick 100 goals in a VFL season five times (the other year he exceeded 100 goals being 1969 when he kicked 120, but did not win the Coleman).

In 1971 he equalled [[Bob Pratt]]'s [[List of VFL/AFL records|record]] of 150 goals in a season after kicking three goals in Hawthorn's winning [[1971 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] side. Hudson kicked into the man-on-the-mark Barry Lawrence ([[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]) in one of his attempts to break the record during the grand final.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/afls-150-greatest-moments-no73/story-e6frf9lx-1111116502629 |title=AFL's 150 greatest moments – No.73 |date=1 June 2008 |publisher=Sunday Herald Sun |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>

In the first round of 1972 he seriously injured his knee just before half time. He had already kicked 8 goals and had just taken a mark within distance when he fell awkwardly. It was thought that his career had finished.<ref name=encyc />

On 25 August 1973 he returned from [[Tasmania]] to kick eight goals against Collingwood at [[VFL Park]]. After playing Rounds 1 and 2 in 1974, he again injured his knee and returned to Tasmania.  After hurting his knee playing netball later that year he decided to have knee surgery in the summer. He did not play another VFL game until lured back for the 1977 season when he ended up kicking 110 goals for the season.<ref name=\"age2\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zgMQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UJIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5133,7252632&dq=peter-hudson+hawthorn&hl=en |title=Hawks – class of '76 |last=Beames |first=Percy |date=28 September 1976 |work=The Age |publisher=Google News Archive |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"heraldsun2\">{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/liberty-bell-has-a-hollow-ring/story-e6frf9lf-1111115906644 |title=Liberty Bell has a hollow ring |last=Ralph |first=Jon |date=28 March 2008 |publisher=Herald Sun |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>

== Post VFL ==
Hudson coached and played for Glenorchy Football Club in the TFL in 1975 and 1976, taking them to a premiership in his first year. Following his second return from the VFL, in 1978 he once again played for Glenorchy, kicking 153 goals and winning the highest individual honour in the TFL, the [[William Leitch Medal]]. In the next season he again topped the goalkicking with 179 goals, winning his second William Leitch medal. He retired as a player at the end of the season. He coached [[Hobart Football Club|Hobart]] in the TFL in 1986–1987 for consecutive unsuccessful finals campaigns.

In 1979, he was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM) in the Australia Day Honours, for services to Australian football.<ref name=\"honour1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=886410&search_type=quick&showInd=true |title=HUDSON, Peter John – AM |work=It's an honour |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"honour2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=978152&search_type=quick&showInd=true |title=HUDSON, Peter John – ASM |work=It's an honour |publisher=Department of the Premier and Cabinet |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"honour3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1122730&search_type=quick&showInd=true |title=HUDSON, Peter John – CM |work=It's an honour |publisher=Department of the Premier and Cabinet |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>

He was inducted into the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]] in 1996 and elevated to \"Legend\" status in 1999. His citation reads: \"''A freakish full-forward who just kept accumulating goals.

Owen Benjamin is a proponent of free speech and for the dialectical exploration of what is considered \"taboo\" or \"politically incorrect\". This lens of \"dialectical exploration\" should be used upon all of Benjamin's more controversial \"antisemitic\" statements - both as a comedian and as critic in the 21st century situ.

== Childhood ==

Edward William Carlson (May 4, 1883 – July 26, 1932) was an American miniature portraitist. His parents were Swedish immigrants Minnie and John. Carlson spent most of his childhood in Chicago, Illinois where his parents owned and operated the Englewood Home Laundry.<ref>Located initially and 6112 South Green Street, Englewood, and later six blocks away at 6637 South Halsted, Englewood (Chicago).</ref><ref>Illinois. Department of Factory Inspection, ''Annual Report of the Factory Inspector of Illinois: 1900-1901''. Office of Illinois Department of Factory Inspection, January 1, 1902, page 96.</ref>

At four years of age circa 1887 Carlson fell ill with [[scarlet fever]], and as a result, lost both his hearing and eventually his speech.<ref name=\"Vestkunsten 1932, page 3\">''Sv[ensk]-amer[ikansk] könstnar avlider, Vestkunsten: Veckotidning för svenskarne på Stillahavskusten'' (San Francisco and Oakland, California, USA), August 11, 1932, page 3. (Swedish)</ref><ref>Holmquist, John Theodore, ''[https://archive.org/details/HolmquistBriefFamilyTree1953 A Brief Family Tree]'' (1953), pages 1-2.</ref>

Carlson was one of eight siblings though two died young. His remaining brothers and sisters, of whom he was the oldest, were Enoch, Amanda, Esther, Arvid and John.

Circa 1900 the Carlson family moved near [[Grovertown, Indiana]] where they bought or leased a farm near those of his mother's brothers. At this time Edward Carlson's occupation is a farmhand.<ref>1900 United States Federal Census</ref> He was seventeen years old.

==Adulthood==

As an adolescent Carlson showed an aptitude for painting. Later, after working on the family farm in Indiana, he returned to Chicago and attended the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=\"Vestkunsten 1932, page 3\"/><ref>For insight on the origin and struggle of Swedish specifically, and emigrant or first generation artists in general, see \"Among Swedish Artists in Chicago\", ''Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter'', December 28, 1921.

== Childhood ==

Edward William Carlson (May 4, 1883 – July 26, 1932) was an American miniature portraitist. His parents were Swedish immigrants Minnie and John. Carlson spent most of his childhood in Chicago, Illinois where his parents owned and operated the Englewood Home Laundry.<ref>Located initially and 6112 South Green Street, Englewood, and later six blocks away at 6637 South Halsted, Englewood (Chicago).</ref><ref>Illinois. Department of Factory Inspection, ''Annual Report of the Factory Inspector of Illinois: 1900-1901''. Office of Illinois Department of Factory Inspection, January 1, 1902, page 96.</ref>

At four years of age circa 1887 Carlson fell ill with [[scarlet fever]], and as a result, lost both his hearing and eventually his speech.<ref name=\"Vestkunsten 1932, page 3\">''Sv[ensk]-amer[ikansk] könstnar avlider, Vestkunsten: Veckotidning för svenskarne på Stillahavskusten'' (San Francisco and Oakland, California, USA), August 11, 1932, page 3. (Swedish)</ref><ref>Holmquist, John Theodore, ''[https://archive.org/details/HolmquistBriefFamilyTree1953 A Brief Family Tree]'' (1953), pages 1-2.</ref>

Carlson was one of eight siblings though two died young. His remaining brothers and sisters, of whom he was the oldest, were Enoch, Amanda, Esther, Arvid and John.

Circa 1900 the Carlson family moved near [[Grovertown, Indiana]] where they bought or leased a farm near those of his mother's brothers. At this time Edward Carlson's occupation is a farmhand.<ref>1900 United States Federal Census</ref> He was seventeen years old.

==Adulthood==

As an adolescent Carlson showed an aptitude for painting. Later, after working on the family farm in Indiana, he returned to Chicago and attended the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=\"Vestkunsten 1932, page 3\"/><ref>For insight on the origin and struggle of Swedish specifically, and emigrant or first generation artists in general, see \"Among Swedish Artists in Chicago\", ''Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter'', December 28, 1921.

== Childhood ==

Edward William Carlson (May 4, 1883 – July 26, 1932) was an American miniature portraitist. His parents were Swedish immigrants Minnie and John. Carlson spent most of his childhood in Chicago, Illinois where his parents owned and operated the Englewood Home Laundry.<ref>Located initially and 6112 South Green Street, Englewood, and later six blocks away at 6637 South Halsted, Englewood (Chicago).</ref><ref>Illinois. Department of Factory Inspection, ''Annual Report of the Factory Inspector of Illinois: 1900-1901''. Office of Illinois Department of Factory Inspection, January 1, 1902, page 96.</ref>

At four years of age circa 1887 Carlson fell ill with [[scarlet fever]], and as a result, lost both his hearing and eventually his speech.<ref name=\"Vestkunsten 1932, page 3\">''Sv[ensk]-amer[ikansk] könstnar avlider, Vestkunsten: Veckotidning för svenskarne på Stillahavskusten'' (San Francisco and Oakland, California, USA), August 11, 1932, page 3. (Swedish)</ref><ref>Holmquist, John Theodore, ''[https://archive.org/details/HolmquistBriefFamilyTree1953 A Brief Family Tree]'' (1953), pages 1-2.</ref>

Carlson was one of eight siblings though two died young. His remaining brothers and sisters, of whom he was the oldest, were Enoch, Amanda, Esther, Arvid and John.

Circa 1900 the Carlson family moved near [[Grovertown, Indiana]] where they bought or leased a farm near those of his mother's brothers. At this time Edward Carlson's occupation is a farmhand.<ref>1900 United States Federal Census</ref> He was seventeen years old.

As an adolescent Carlson showed an aptitude for painting. Later, after working on the family farm in Indiana, he returned to Chicago and attended the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=\"Vestkunsten 1932, page 3\"/><ref>For insight on the origin and struggle of Swedish specifically, and emigrant or first generation artists in general, see \"Among Swedish Artists in Chicago\", ''Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter'', December 28, 1921.

Also attending the Art Institute was Eva Randolph Dorchester (August 28, 1880 – October 14, 1926) of Sherman, Texas who was deaf-mute since birth. Eva had been born in Kentucky. Her father, C. B.

Between 1907 and 1910 Carlson boarded at various residences in Chicago, probably while attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.<ref>Carlson residences in Chicago - 1907: 1043 South Irving Ave; 1907-09: 143 West 24th Street; 1910-11: 2700 West 23rd Street.</ref> By 1910 he was living with his uncle August Holmquist, his aunt Hanna, and his young cousins Alma, Ebba, Alice and Violet at their home on 2700, West 23rd Street, Chicago.<ref>Thirteenth Census of the United States, 1910 (NARA microfilm publication T624_254, Page: 17A, 1,178 rolls).

At an exhibit at the [[Swedish Club of Chicago]] in 1912 Edward won the prize for miniature painting.<ref>Olson, Ernst Wilhelm. ''The Swedish Element in Illinois: Survey of the Past Seven Decades with Life Sketches of Men of Today''. Chicago, Illinois: Swedish-American Biographical Association, 1917, pages 263, 265.</ref>

In 1915 Carlson again exhibited some of his portraits at the [[Swedish Club of Chicago]]. \"Among the miniature portraits there are six by Edward Carlson of Chicago, which are the pride of the exhibit.\"<ref>\"Pallet and Pencil: The Swedish Club of Chicago Holds its Fourth Art Exhibit\" ''Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter'', April 27, 1915.

''Swedish-American Historical Society'', volume 42, number 2, April 1991, page 92.</ref> Edward's work appeared often at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and in other venues. In 1920 a number of his portraits were included in an exhibition of one hundred pieces by forty artists, which traveled first to [[New York City|New York]] and then to the cities of [[Stockholm]], [https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6teborg Göteborg] ([[Gothenburg]]) and [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]]. The art critic [[Elisabeth Luther Cary]], the first full-time art critic for the [[New York Times]], wrote, \"The small group of miniatures by Ed. W.

In July of the following year, Edward and Marjorie took the train to the [[National Fraternal Society for the Deaf]] (NFSD) convention, attended by about 800 people, in Denver, Colorado. After the convention Edward and Marjorie headed west. \"Ed. W. Carlson and 13-year-old daughter, Majorie, left Denver for Spokane, Portland, California and Texas points a two months' trip. It was very touching to see the tender care with which Carlson consoled his little girl [whose] mother died in Texas....\"<ref>''The Deaf-Mute's Journal'', volume 56, July 28, 1927, page 2.</ref>

In 1929 Carlson was awarded first prize in the miniature category from the [[Swedish Club of Chicago]].<ref>\"Art Exhibit Closes Prizes Awarded\", ''Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter'', April 17, 1929. [Translated from the Swedish and made available through the Foreign Language Press Survey]</ref><ref>''The Deaf-Mutes' Journal'', Mexico, N.Y.: Henry C. Rider, April 4, 1929, page 2.</ref>

The art critic [[Elisabeth Luther Cary]], the first full-time art critic for the [[New York Times]], wrote, \"The small group of miniatures by Ed. W.

'''Karnal''' ({{Audio|Karnal.ogg|pronunciation}} is a city located in [[Haryana]], India and is the administrative headquarters of [[Karnal District]].

Karnal is said to have been founded by दानवीर King [[Karna]] the bountiful, magnanimous , munificent , a key figure in the epic [[Mahabharata]], who donated सवा मण Gold daily to his subjects, Populance & any one who asked for it , who died at the hands of his half-brother and archrival, [[Arjuna]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Karnal|url=http://www.karnal.gov.in/|publisher=District of Karnal|accessdate=26 November 2013|title=Karnal}}</ref>

It was also used by [[East India Company]] army as a refuge during the [[1857 Mutiny|Indian Rebellion of 1857]] in [[Delhi]].

The [[Battle of Karnal]] between [[Nader Shah]] of Persia and the [[Mughal Empire]] took place in this city on 1739.

== History ==
The city is said to be named after [[Karna]] who as per [[Mahabharata]] was an elder brother of the [[Pandavas]] born to [[Kunti]] and [[Surya]] (Sun) before marriage.<ref name=Karna/> Karna was a very close associate of [[Duryodhana]] and fought for him in the great [[Kurukshetra war]]. A tank in the city also bears the name Karna Tal and a town gate is called Karna gate after him.<ref name=Karna>[https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sunday-special/people/king-karna-returns-to-his-land-karnal/496282.html King Karna returns to his land — Karnal]</ref>

=== Ancient past ===

At the end of 6th century A.D., area was under the rule of [[Vardhanas]] of [[Thanesar]].<ref>{{cite book |author=D. C. Ganguly |chapter=Western India in the Sixth Century A.D.|editor=R. C.

The region was under [[Kanauj]] rule under the Pala Emperor of Bengal (770-810 A.D.). The authority of [[Mihira Bhoja]] (836-885 A.D.), the [[Pratihara]] ruler of Kanauj penetrated as far as Pehowa including Karnal.<ref name=history/>

The [[Tomara dynasty|Tomaras]] descending from Raja Jaula, established themselves as rulers of this region in the middle of the 9th century.<ref name=history>{{cite book |author=H. A. Phadke |title=Haryana, Ancient and Medieval |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HxlIAAAAIAAJ |year=1990 |publisher=Harman |isbn=978-81-85151-34-2 |ref=harv }}</ref> About the beginning of the 10th century, as the Pratihara power began to decline, the Tomaras assumed independence. One of the Tomara rulers, [[Anangpal Tomar]], found the city of Delhi and made it his capital with the area of Karnal and modern day Haryana being under his realm. The Tomaras came into conflict with the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chauhans of Shakambhari]], but continued to rule the Haryana country till the middle of 12th century when they were overthrown by the Chahamana [[Vigraharaja IV]].<ref>{{cite book |author=R.

=== Medieval era ===
{{main|Battle of Karnal}}
[[Image:The Daria-e Noor (Sea of Light) Diamond from the collection of the national jewels of Iran at Central Bank of Islamic Republic of Iran.jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[Daria-i-Noor]] diamond was seized by Persia's Nader Shah from the Mughal dynasty following the Battle of Karnal and subsequent sack of Delhi (1739)]]
In A.D. 1739, [[Nader Shah|Nader Shah of Persia]] [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|invaded the Mughal empire]] and Karnal was the scene of the famed [[Battle of Karnal]] in which Nader Shah decisively defeated Mughal Emperor [[Muhammad Shah]].<ref name=Shah>[[Michael Axworthy|Axworthy, Michael]] (2009)</ref> Muhammad Shah with an enormous army occupied a strongly fortified camp at Karnal but he yielded to the invader as his supplies were cut off from the open country by Shah and were starved into submission.<ref name=Shah/> The tactic defeat drastically weakened the [[Mughal Empire]], while the [[Afsharid Empire|Persian Empire]] prospered and subsequently hastened [[British Empire]] establishment in India.

[[Sikh history|Sikhs]] appeared on the scene in the 18th century. The importance of Karnal grew in the time of Raja Gajpat Singh of [[Jind State]] who after its capture in A.D. 1763 built the boundary wall and a fort and under whose rule the town increased considerably in size.<ref>{{cite book |author=D. C. Miglani |title=Politics and Rural Power Struggle: Emerging Trends |publisher=Deep and Deep Publications |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5kNN4i2dLF4C&pg=PA74 |isbn=81-7100-578-0}}</ref> On January 14, 1764 Sikh Chiefs defeated and killed [[Zain Khan Sirhindi]], the Durrani Governor, and took possession of the whole of Sirhind province as far south as Panipat including Karnal.

=== Modern history ===
During [[Indian independence movement]], a district political conference was organized at Karnal with [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] as its chairman. [[Mool Chand Jain]] often referred to as ''\"Gandhi of Haryana\"'' hailed from Karnal was one of the prominent leader of the Indian Independence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Babu Mool Chand Jain Comprehensive Archives|url=http://moolchandjain.org}}</ref>

A tank in the city also bears the name Karna Tal and a town gate is called Karna gate after him.<ref name=Karna>[https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sunday-special/people/king-karna-returns-to-his-land-karnal/496282.html King Karna returns to his land — Karnal]</ref>

=== Ancient past ===

At the end of 6th century A.D., area was under the rule of [[Vardhanas]] of [[Thanesar]].<ref>{{cite book |author=D. C. Ganguly |chapter=Western India in the Sixth Century A.D.|editor=R. C. Majumdar |editor-link=R. C. Majumdar |title=A Comprehensive History of India |volume=3, Part I: A.D. 300-985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRBuAAAAMAAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Indian History Congress / People's Publishing House |oclc=34008529 |ref=harv }}</ref> The 7th century was a period of eclecticism in religion, Buddhism was declining and Hinduism was resurging in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The region was under [[Kanauj]] rule under the Pala Emperor of Bengal (770-810 A.D.). The authority of [[Mihira Bhoja]] (836-885 A.D.), the [[Pratihara]] ruler of Kanauj penetrated as far as Pehowa including Karnal.<ref name=history/>

The [[Tomara dynasty|Tomaras]] descending from Raja Jaula, established themselves as rulers of this region in the middle of the 9th century.<ref name=history>{{cite book |author=H. A. Phadke |title=Haryana, Ancient and Medieval |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HxlIAAAAIAAJ |year=1990 |publisher=Harman |isbn=978-81-85151-34-2 |ref=harv }}</ref> About the beginning of the 10th century, as the Pratihara power began to decline, the Tomaras assumed independence. One of the Tomara rulers, [[Anangpal Tomar]], found the city of Delhi and made it his capital with the area of Karnal and modern day Haryana being under his realm. The Tomaras came into conflict with the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chauhans of Shakambhari]], but continued to rule the Haryana country till the middle of 12th century when they were overthrown by the Chahamana [[Vigraharaja IV]].<ref>{{cite book |author=R. B. Singh |title=History of the Chāhamānas |publisher=N. Kishore |year=1964 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKs9AAAAIAAJ |oclc=11038728 |ref=harv }}</ref> The country between the Satluj and the Yamuna including Karnal experienced relative peace for a century and a half except the plundering invasions of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]].

=== Medieval era ===
{{main|Battle of Karnal}}
[[Image:The Daria-e Noor (Sea of Light) Diamond from the collection of the national jewels of Iran at Central Bank of Islamic Republic of Iran.jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[Daria-i-Noor]] diamond was seized by Persia's Nader Shah from the Mughal dynasty following the Battle of Karnal and subsequent sack of Delhi (1739)]]
In A.D. 1739, [[Nader Shah|Nader Shah of Persia]] [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|invaded the Mughal empire]] and Karnal was the scene of the famed [[Battle of Karnal]] in which Nader Shah decisively defeated Mughal Emperor [[Muhammad Shah]].<ref name=Shah>[[Michael Axworthy|Axworthy, Michael]] (2009)</ref> Muhammad Shah with an enormous army occupied a strongly fortified camp at Karnal but he yielded to the invader as his supplies were cut off from the open country by Shah and were starved into submission.<ref name=Shah/> The tactic defeat drastically weakened the [[Mughal Empire]], while the [[Afsharid Empire|Persian Empire]] prospered and subsequently hastened [[British Empire]] establishment in India.

[[Sikh history|Sikhs]] appeared on the scene in the 18th century. The importance of Karnal grew in the time of Raja Gajpat Singh of [[Jind State]] who after its capture in A.D. 1763 built the boundary wall and a fort and under whose rule the town increased considerably in size.<ref>{{cite book |author=D. C. Miglani |title=Politics and Rural Power Struggle: Emerging Trends |publisher=Deep and Deep Publications |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5kNN4i2dLF4C&pg=PA74 |isbn=81-7100-578-0}}</ref> On January 14, 1764 Sikh Chiefs defeated and killed [[Zain Khan Sirhindi]], the Durrani Governor, and took possession of the whole of Sirhind province as far south as Panipat including Karnal.

=== Modern history ===
During [[Indian independence movement]], a district political conference was organized at Karnal with [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] as its chairman. [[Mool Chand Jain]] often referred to as ''\"Gandhi of Haryana\"'' hailed from Karnal was one of the prominent leader of the Indian Independence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Babu Mool Chand Jain Comprehensive Archives|url=http://moolchandjain.org}}</ref>
