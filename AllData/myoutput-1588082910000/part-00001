The band was initially active between 1965 and 1973, and was briefly managed by the [[pop art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]], serving as the [[house band]] at [[the Factory]] and Warhol's ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'' events from 1966 to 1967. Their debut album, ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'' (with German-born singer and model [[Nico]]), was released in 1967 to critical indifference and poor sales but has become critically acclaimed; in 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it the \"most prophetic rock album ever made.\"<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/the-velvet-underground-and-nico-the-velvet-underground-52023/ RS 500 Greatest Albums] November 18, 2003.</ref><ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6597640/13_the_velvet_underground 13-The Velvet Underground and Nico] Rolling Stone, November 1, 2003</ref>\n\nThe band's integration of rock and the [[avant-garde]] achieved little commercial success during its existence, but it is now recognized as one of the most influential bands in rock, [[Underground music|underground]], [[Experimental music|experimental]], and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] music.<ref name=\"bio\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20131125-do-the-velvets-beat-the-beatles |title=The Velvet Underground: As influential as The Beatles? |last=Kot |first=Greg |publisher=BBC |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref> The provocative subject matter, musical experiments, and often [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] attitudes explored in the band's work proved influential in the development of [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music]].<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Richie|title=The Velvet Underground \u2013 Biography & History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-velvet-underground-mn0000840402/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the band No.&nbsp;19 on its list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\".<ref>Julian Casablancas, [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939222/19_the_velvet_underground \"The Velvet Underground\" (No.&nbsp;19)], in [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty \"The Immortals: The First Fifty\"], ''Rolling Stone'', No.&nbsp;946 (April 15, 2004), accessed April 29, 2007.</ref> In 2017, a study of [[AllMusic]]'s catalog indicated the Velvet Underground as the fifth most frequently cited artist influence in its database.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kopf|first1=Dan|last2=Wong|first2=Amy X.|title=A definitive list of the musicians who influenced our lives most|url=https://qz.com/1094962/a-definitive-list-of-the-musicians-who-influenced-our-lives-most/|website=Quartz|date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996 by [[Patti Smith]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-career and early stages (1964\u20131966)===\nThe foundations for what would become the Velvet Underground were laid in late-1964. Singer/songwriter/guitarist [[Lou Reed]] had performed with a few short-lived [[Garage rock|garage bands]] and had worked as a songwriter for [[Pickwick Records]] (Reed described his tenure there as being \"a poor man's [[Carole King]]\").<ref name=Fricke>[[David Fricke]], [[liner notes]] for the ''[[Peel Slowly and See]]'' [[box set]] (Polydor, 1995).</ref> Reed met [[John Cale]], a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music upon securing a [[Leonard Bernstein]] scholarship. Cale had worked with experimental composers [[John Cage]], [[Cornelius Cardew]] and [[La Monte Young]], and had performed with Young's [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], though was also interested in rock music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incubator for the Velvet Underground|author=John Cale as told to Marc Myers|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323596204578241620759540276|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref> Young's use of extended [[Drone (music)|drones]] would be a profound influence on the band's early sound. Cale was pleasantly surprised to discover that Reed's experimentalist tendencies were similar to his own: Reed sometimes used alternative guitar tunings to create a droning sound. The pair rehearsed and performed together; their partnership and shared interests built the path towards what would later become the Velvet Underground.\n\nReed's first group with Cale was the Primitives, a short-lived group assembled to issue budget-priced recordings and support an anti-dance single written by Reed, \"The Ostrich\", to which Cale added a viola passage. Reed and Cale recruited [[Sterling Morrison]] \u2014 a college classmate of Reed's at [[Syracuse University]] \u2014 as a replacement for [[Walter De Maria]], who had been a third member of the Primitives.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1216}}</ref> Reed and Morrison both played guitars, Cale played viola, keyboards and bass and [[Angus MacLise]] joined on percussion to complete the initial four-member unit.

The band immediately and unanimously adopted ''The Velvet Underground'' as its new name in November 1965.\n\nThe newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of [[Beat generation|beat]] poetry, with MacLise playing gentle \"pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Quoted by David Fricke in his liner notes for the ''Peel Slowly and See'' box set ([[Polydor]], 1995).</ref>\n\nIn July 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a [[demo tape]] at their [[Ludlow Street]] loft without MacLise, because he refused to be tied down to a schedule and would only turn up to band practice sessions when he wanted.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">{{cite web |author=Biography by Richie Unterberger |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/angus-maclise-mn0000756247/biography |title=Angus MacLise &#124; Biography & History |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Metzger |first=Richard |url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/angus_maclise_original_velvet_underground_drummer |title=DREAMWEAPON: The Art and Life of Angus MacLise, original Velvet Underground drummer |publisher=Dangerous Minds |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale attempted to give a copy of the tape to [[Marianne Faithfull]],<ref>John Cale & Victor Bockris ''What's Welsh For Zen'' London: Bloomsbury, 1999</ref> hoping she would pass it on to [[Mick Jagger]], lead singer of [[the Rolling Stones]]. Nothing ever came of this, but the demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set ''Peel Slowly and See''.\n\nManager and music journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] arranged for the group's first paying gig\u2014[[USD|$]]75 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|75|1965}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to play at [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]], in Summit, New Jersey, opening for [[the Myddle Class]]. When they decided to take the gig, MacLise abruptly left the group, protesting what he considered a [[sellout]]; he was also unwilling to be told when to start and stop playing. \"Angus was in it for art\", Morrison reported.<ref name=Fricke/>\n\nMacLise was replaced by [[Moe Tucker|Maureen \"Moe\" Tucker]], the younger sister of Morrison's friend Jim Tucker. Tucker's playing style was rather unusual: she generally played standing up rather than seated and had an abbreviated [[Drum kit|drum setup]] of [[tom-toms]], [[Snare drum|snare]] and an upturned [[bass drum]], using [[Mallets#percussion mallets|mallets]] as often as drumsticks, and rarely using [[cymbals]] (she admits that she always hated cymbals).<ref>{{cite web|last=Coston |first=Daniel |url=http://danielcoston.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/moe-tucker-interview-1997-part-one.html |title=The Coston Chronicles: Moe Tucker interview, 1997, part one |publisher=Danielcoston.blogspot.com.au |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> When the band asked her to do something unusual, she turned her bass drum on its side and played standing up. After her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans brought in from outside. Her rhythms, at once simple and exotic (influenced by the likes of [[Babatunde Olatunji]] and [[Bo Diddley]] records), became a vital part of the group's music, despite Cale's initial objections to the presence of a female drummer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bockris|first1=Victor|title=Transformer: The Lou Reed Story|date=1994|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-684-80366-6|pages=99, 101|quote=Cale, horrified by the mere suggestion that a 'chick' should play in their great group, had to be placated by the promise that it was strictly temporary.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/transformerlour000bock}}</ref> The group earned a regular paying gig at the Caf\u00e9 Bizarre and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble.\n\n===Andy Warhol and the ''Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' (1966\u20131967)===\nIn 1965, after being introduced to the Velvet Underground by filmmaker [[Barbara Rubin]],<ref name=\"boo-hooray\">{{cite web|last1=Kugelberg|first1=Johan|title=Christmas on Earth: Barbara Rubin|url=http://boo-hooray.com/exhibits/christmas-on-earth|website=Boo-Hooray Gallery |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614041743/http://boo-hooray.com/exhibits/christmas-on-earth |archivedate=June 14, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}</ref> Andy Warhol became the band's manager and suggested they use the German-born singer [[Nico]] (born Christa P\u00e4ffgen) on several songs. Warhol's reputation helped the band gain a higher profile. He helped the band secure a recording contract with MGM's Verve Records, with himself as nominal \"[[record producer|producer]]\", and gave the Velvets free rein over the sound they created.\n\nDuring their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow, ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'', which combined Warhol's films with the band's music, which made use of minimalist devices, such as drones. Warhol included the band with his show in an effort to \"use rock as a part of a larger, interdisciplinary-art work based around performance\" (McDonald).{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} They played shows for several months in New York City, then traveled throughout the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maxskansascity.com/classic/warhol/#section3|title=Andy Warhol Biography: From The Velvet Underground To Basquiat |website=Maxskansascity.com}}{{failed verification|date=January 2018}}</ref> During a short period in September 1966, when Cale was ill, the avant-garde musician [[Henry Flynt]], and Richard Mishkin, who had played in Reed's first group at university,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx7zCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=19|title=Notes from the Velvet Underground: The Life of Lou Reed|author=Howard Sounes|publisher=Random House|date= October 22, 2015|isbn=9781473508958}}</ref> took turns to cover for him.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx7zCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT67|page=67|title=Notes from the Velvet Underground: The Life of Lou Reed|author=Howard Sounes|publisher=Random House|date= October 22, 2015|isbn=9781473508958}}</ref>\n\nThe show included 16&nbsp;mm film projections by Warhol, combined with a stroboscopic-light show designed by Danny Williams.

This soon changed to \"the exploding plastic inevitable\".\n\nIn 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few ''EPI'' shows when Reed was suffering from [[hepatitis]] and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ, Tucker switched to bass guitar and MacLise was on drums. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed \"Booker T\", after musician [[Booker T. Jones]]. Some of these performances have been released as a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]; they remain the only record of MacLise with the Velvet Underground.\n\nAccording to Morrison, MacLise is said to have regretted leaving the Velvet Underground and wanted to rejoin, but Reed specifically prohibited this and made it clear that this stint was only temporary. MacLise still behaved eccentrically with time and commerce and went by his own clock: for instance, he showed up half an hour late to one show and carried on with a half-hour of drumming to compensate for his late arrival, long after the set had finished.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/>\n\nIn December 1966, Warhol and [[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]] designed Issue 3 of the multimedia [[Aspen (magazine)|''Aspen'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/aspen/aspen3/index.html |title=Aspen no. 3: The Pop Art issue |publisher=Ubu.com |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}</ref> Included in this issue of the \"magazine\", which retailed at $4 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) per copy and was packaged in a hinged box designed to look like Fab laundry detergent, were various leaflets and booklets, one of which was a commentary on rock and roll by Lou Reed, another an ''EPI'' promotional newspaper.

The album was recorded primarily in [[Scepter Studios]] in New York City during April 1966, but for reasons unclear, some songs were rerecorded at [[TTG Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], along with the new song \"[[Sunday Morning (The Velvet Underground song)|Sunday Morning]]\", later in the year with [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] producing. The album was released by Verve Records the following year in March 1967. The album cover is famous for its Warhol design: a yellow banana sticker with \"Peel slowly and see\" printed near the tip. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, peeled banana beneath.\n\nEleven songs showcased the Velvets' dynamic range, veering from the pounding attacks of \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man]]\" and \"[[Run Run Run (Lou Reed song)|Run Run Run]]\", the droning \"Venus in Furs\" and \"[[Heroin (The Velvet Underground song)|Heroin]]\", the chiming and celestial \"Sunday Morning\", to the quiet \"[[Femme Fatale (The Velvet Underground song)|Femme Fatale]]\" and the tender \"[[I'll Be Your Mirror]]\", as well as Warhol's own favorite song of the group, \"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\".<ref name=\"all\"/> [[Kurt Loder]] would later describe \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" as a \"mesmerizing [[gothic-rock]] masterpiece\".<ref name=\"all\">Kurt Loder, \"Liner notes&nbsp;\u2013 ''V.U.''

After several months of shows in the US, the band swiftly recorded their third album ''[[The Velvet Underground (album)|The Velvet Underground]]'' in late 1968 at [[TTG Studios]] in Hollywood, California. It was released in March 1969. The cover photograph was taken by [[Billy Name]]. The LP sleeve was designed by Dick Smith, then a staff artist at MGM/Verve. Released on March 12, 1969, the album failed to make ''Billboard'''s Top 200 album chart.\n\nThe harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent on their third album. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by [[folk music]], prescient of the songwriting style that would soon form Reed's solo career. While Reed had covered a vast range of lyrical subjects on the first two Velvet Underground albums, the lyrical themes of the third album were more \"intimate\" in nature. Reed's songwriting also covered new emotional ground as well, as heard in the songs \"Pale Blue Eyes\", \"Jesus\", \"Beginning to See the Light\", and \"I'm Set Free\". The personal tone of the album's subject matter resulted in Reed's desire to create a \"closet\" mix that boosted the vocals to the forefront, while reducing the album's instrumentation. The second (and more widely distributed) mix is the stereo mix done by MGM/Verve staff recording engineer Val Valentin. Another factor in the change of sound was the band's Vox amplifiers and assorted fuzzboxes were rumored to have been stolen from an airport while they were on tour and they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with [[Sunn]]. In addition, Reed and Morrison had purchased matching [[Fender Electric XII|Fender 12-string electric guitars]], but Doug Yule plays down the influence of the new equipment.\n\nMorrison's ringing guitar parts and Yule's melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are used prominently on the album.{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} Reed's songs and singing are subdued and confessional in nature,{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gq9Vp45cGx4C&pg=PT70#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=70|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Man Who Changed the World|author=Wim Hendrikse|publisher=New Generation Publishing|date= May 1, 2013|isbn=9780755250530}}</ref> Doug Yule sang the lead vocal on \"Candy Says\" (about the [[Warhol superstar]] [[Candy Darling]]), which opens the LP, and a rare Moe Tucker lead vocal is used on \"After Hours\", which closes the album, because Reed felt her \"innocent\" voice was more believable for a sad song.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Peter Hogan, Peter K. Hogan|publisher=Rough Guides|date= 2007|title=Velvet Underground|page=252}}</ref> The album has the experimental track \"The Murder Mystery\", which utilised all four band members (Reed, Yule, Tucker and Morrison) reading different lyrics, sometimes simultaneously, as well as the ballad \"Pale Blue Eyes\".\n\n===Year on the road and the \"lost\" fourth album (1969)===\nThe Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road both in the US and Canada, and not making much headway commercially. Despite these commercial setbacks, the band focused on performing live shows on the road, playing both re-worked songs from their past albums, and debuting new songs that would find their way onto the ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]'' album, such as \"New Age\", \"Rock and Roll\", and \"Sweet Jane\". While the band continued to do extended improvisations in their live shows, by 1969 they were focusing on tight live performances,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and several of the live shows the band played during this period would end up released as live albums many years later. The live album ''[[1969: The Velvet Underground Live]]'' (with Reed, Yule, Morrison & Tucker) was recorded in October 1969 but not released until 1974, on Mercury Records, at the urging of rock critic [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]], who worked in [[A&R]] for Mercury at the time. Nelson asked singer-songwriter [[Elliott Murphy]] to write liner notes for the double album. In his notes, Murphy described a scene 100 years in the future, with a student taking a class on \"classical rock'n'roll\" and listening to the Velvet Underground. He wondered what the student would make of the music and concluded, \"I wish it was a hundred years from today (I can't stand the suspense)\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21317-the-complete-matrix-tapes/amp/ |title=The Velvet Underground: ''The Complete Matrix Tapes'' |first=Douglas |last=Wolk |date=December 8, 2015 |website=Pitchfork.com |accessdate=February 5, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite liner notes |title=1969: The Velvet Underground Live |first=Elliott |last=Murphy |author-link=Elliott Murphy |year=1972 |url=http://www.elliottmurphy.com/downloads/vunotes.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=February 5, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this period the band played a series of shows in November 1969 at the Matrix and the Family Dog venues in San Francisco; recordings of these shows were released in 2001, as a triple live album, ''[[Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes]]'', which included the line up of Reed, Yule, Morrison and Tucker. During 1969 the band recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of promising material (both singles and one-offs) that were never officially released at the time due to disputes with their record label. What many consider to be the prime songs of these recording sessions were released years later, in 1985, in a compilation album called ''[[VU (album)|VU]]''. The album ''VU'' marks the transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album and the band's movement to the later pop rock song-style of their final record, ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]''.{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} Two of the songs the Velvets recorded during this period were later used on film soundtracks: \"Stephanie Says\" was used in the 2001 film ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''; \"I'm Sticking With You\" has a rare Moe Tucker\u2013Lou Reed dual-lead vocal track, with Doug Yule accompanying on piano, and was included in the film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]''.\n\nThe rest of the recordings, as well as some alternative takes and instrumental tracks were later bundled on ''[[Another View]]'' which was released in 1986. After Reed's departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records over the years: \"Stephanie Says\", \"Ocean\", \"I Can't Stand It\", \"Lisa Says\", and \"Andy's Chest\", as well as \"She's My Best Friend\", which had been originally sung by Doug Yule.\n\nBy 1969 the MGM and Verve record labels had been losing money for several years. A new president, [[Mike Curb]], was hired and he decided to cancel the recording contracts of 18 of their acts who supposedly glorified drugs in their lyrics, including their many controversial and unprofitable acts. The drug or [[hippie]]-related bands were released from MGM, and the Velvets were on his list, along with [[Eric Burdon and the Animals]] and [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[Mothers of Invention]]. Nonetheless MGM insisted on retaining ownership of all master tapes of their recordings and according to an MGM representative in a ''[[Rolling Stone magazine|Rolling Stone]]'' article from 1970, \"it wasn't eighteen groups, [Curb] was misquoted. The cuts were made partly to do with the drug scene\u2014like maybe a third of them had to do with drug reasons. The others were dropped because they weren't selling.\" Lou Reed would later remark in the 1987 issue of ''[[Creem]]'' that while he did not believe that MGM dropped the Velvets for drug associations, he did acknowledge, \"We wanted to get out of there.\"<ref name=\"richieunterberger.com\" />\n\n===''Loaded'', Tucker's pregnancy and Max's residency (1970)===\n{{Main|Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|l1=Loaded}}\n[[Cotillion Records]] (a subsidiary of [[Atlantic Records]] that specialized in blues and [[Southern soul]]) signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album with Lou Reed: ''Loaded''. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album \"loaded with hits\". Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the Velvet Underground had performed,{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} and two of Reed's best-known songs,{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\".\n\nBy the recording of ''Loaded'', Doug Yule played a more prominent role in the band, and with Reed's encouragement, sang the lead vocal on four songs: \"Who Loves the Sun\", which opened the album, \"New Age\", \"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\" and the final track, \"Oh! Sweet Nuthin\". Yule once commented on the recording of ''Loaded'': \"Lou leaned on me a lot in terms of musical support and for harmonies, vocal arrangements. I did a lot on ''Loaded''. It sort of devolved down to the Lou and Doug recreational recording.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/yule.html |title=Doug Yule interview- Perfect Sound Forever |publisher=Furious.com |date=October 21, 1995 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile the third Velvets' LP was recorded mostly live in a collaborative atmosphere, the bulk of ''Loaded'' was crafted in the studio. In addition to handling all the bass and piano duties on ''Loaded'', Yule also contributed several lead guitar parts and played drums on five of the album's ten tracks (most notably on the songs \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Sweet Jane\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/vu/articles/lowdown/lowdown.html |title=The Velvet Underground \u2013 The Lowdown on Loaded |publisher=Olivier.landemaine.free.fr |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> since Moe Tucker (who was credited as the album's drummer) was absent on maternity leave to have her first child, a daughter named Kerry.

Reed's last live performance with the band at Max's was informally recorded and was released two years later in 1972 as ''[[Live at Max's Kansas City]]'', also on Atlantic Records.\n\n===Reed's departure and release of ''Loaded'' (1970)===\nDisillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making, and facing pressure by manager [[Steve Sesnick]], Reed decided to quit the band during the last week of the Max's Kansas City shows in August 1970. Although Reed had informed Tucker, who was attending the show but not playing with the band because of her pregnancy, that he planned to leave the group on his last evening, he did not tell Morrison or Yule. In a 2006 interview, Yule said Sesnick waited until one hour before the band was scheduled to take the stage the following night before notifying him that Reed was not coming. \"I was expecting [Lou] to show up, I thought he was late.\" Yule blamed Sesnick for Reed's departure. \"Sesnick had engineered Lou's leaving the group. He and Lou had a relationship where Lou had depended on him for moral support, and he trusted him, and Sesnick basically said 'screw you.' ... It must have been hard for Lou to hear that because he depended on him, so he quit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aGaLi32M_Y |title=The Velvet Underground \u2013 Doug Yule Part 8 |publisher=YouTube |date=December 23, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> While ''Loaded'' was finalized and mixed, it had yet to be mastered and was not set to be released by Atlantic until November of that year.

Due to publicity around the release, and growing interest in the Velvet Underground in Europe, Sesnick was able to secure a single album deal with Polydor in the UK, and a handful of promotional shows were booked in the UK in November and December 1972. After Sesnick reached out to Yule, a new Velvet Underground lineup was quickly assembled by Yule to do the UK shows. This brief lineup of the Velvet Underground consisted of Yule, guitarist Rob Norris (later of [[The Bongos]]), bassist George Kay (Krzyzewski), and drummer [[Mark Nauseef]].

While Yule intended to recruit Tucker to play drums on ''Squeeze'', Sesnick vetoed his decision and claimed she was \"too expensive\" to hire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/dougyule/dystory.html |title=Doug Yule \u2013 Story |publisher=Olivier.landemaine.free.fr |date=October 26, 2008 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Squeeze'' was released in February the following year, 1973, in Europe only, with minimal promotion by the label, and was held in low regard by fans and critics. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] notes that the album received \"uniformly terrible reviews\" upon initial release,<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine in the ''Allmusic'' [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r51960|pure_url=yes}} website article on ''Squeeze'']</ref> and in the early 1970s, the ''NME Book of Rock'' counted it as \"a Velvet Underground album in name only\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Nick Logan (Editor) |title=The New musical Express Book of Rock: Nick Logan: 9780352300744: Amazon.com: Books |isbn=0352300744 |year=1975 }}</ref> When asked about ''Squeeze'', Yule hinted that band manager Steve Sesnick orchestrated the album purely as a money ploy. \"Sesnick dumped the second iteration of the band in England with no money and no equipment and just left us there to find our way back. He gave me six copies of ''Squeeze'' as pay. I never got any money. When you sign with [[ASCAP]] or [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] you get an advance. He not only made an arrangement with them but actually signed as me and took the money.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/vu/articles/headheldhigh/yule.html|title=Head Held High|website=olivier.landemaine.free.fr}}</ref>\n\nDespite the negative reviews of the album upon its initial release, in recent years the album has been revisited by both critics and musicians with more sympathetic and favorable reviews. In 2011 music writer [[Steven Shehori]] included ''Squeeze'' in his \"Criminally Overlooked Albums\" series for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and in a lengthy review of the album, offered the following positive assessment of ''Squeeze'': \"if you pluck it from the shackles of its murky back-story, ''Squeeze'' is nothing short of a quintessential listening experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/steven-shehori/squeeze-velvet-underground_b_880182.html |title=Criminally Overlooked Albums: Squeeze by Doug Yule's Velvet Underground &#124; Steven Shehori |publisher=Huffingtonpost.ca |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> The UK band [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] took their name from its title according to band member [[Chris Difford]], who offered the following opinion of the album in a 2012 interview: \"It's an odd record, but the name came from that, definitely. ...

The band members objected to the billing (instigated by their tour manager); according to Yule, the promoter was not supposed to bill the band as the Velvet Underground.<ref name=\"olivier.landemaine.free.fr\"/> In late May 1973, the band and the tour manager parted ways, thus bringing the Velvet Underground to an end until the classic line-up of Reed, Tucker, Morrison and Cale would reunite in the 1990s.\n\n===Post-VU developments (1972\u20131990)===\nReed, Cale and Nico teamed up at the beginning of 1972 to play a concert in Paris at the [[Bataclan club]]. This concert was bootlegged, and finally received an official release as ''[[Le Bataclan '72]]'' in 2003. Before that, Cale and Nico had developed solo careers. Nico had also begun a solo career with Cale producing a majority of her albums. Reed started his solo career in 1972 after a brief sabbatical. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a [[tugboat]] captain in Houston for several years. Moe Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in several touring bands, including Tucker's band.\n\nYule subsequently toured with Lou Reed and played on the latter's ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' album, and Yule (at Reed's request) also contributed guitar and bass tracks to Reed's album ''[[Coney Island Baby]]'', which can be heard in the Bonus Edition of the album (released in 2002). Yule became a member of [[American Flyer (band)|American Flyer]], then dropped out of the music industry altogether before reappearing in the early 2000s.\n\nIn 1985 Polydor released the album ''VU'', which collected unreleased recordings that might have constituted the band's fourth album for MGM in 1969 but had never been released. Some of the songs had been recorded when Cale was still in the band. More unreleased recordings of the band, some of them demos and unfinished tracks, were released in 1986 as ''Another View''.\n\nOn July 18, 1988, Nico died of a cerebral haemorrhage following a bicycle accident.\n\nCzech dissident playwright [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] was a fan of the Velvet Underground, ultimately becoming a friend of Lou Reed. Though some attribute the name of the 1989 \"[[Velvet Revolution]]\", which ended more than 40 years of [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist]] rule in Czechoslovakia, to the band, Reed pointed out that the name ''Velvet Revolution'' derives from its peaceful nature\u2014that no one was \"actually hurt\" during those events.<ref name=Reedinterview>Lou Reed, [http://havel.columbia.edu/media_panels/video_window/?material=reed&timeline=havel7 ''Havel at Columbia'' interview: \"7: The Velvet Revolution and The Velvet Underground\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229073839/http://havel.columbia.edu/media_panels/video_window/?material=reed&timeline=havel7 |date=December 29, 2007 }}, accessed April 29, 2007. (See table of contents for \"Chapters\".)</ref> Reed has also given at least one radio interview where he stated that it was called the Velvet Revolution because all of the dissidents were listening to the Velvet Underground leading up to the overthrow, and this music was an inspiration for the events that followed.

From left to right: Morrison (at back), Tucker, Cale and Reed.]]\n\nIn 1990, Reed and Cale released ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a song cycle about Andy Warhol, who had died in 1987. Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the Velvet Underground had broken up, ''Songs for Drella'' was the first time the pair had worked together in decades, and speculation about a reunion began to form, fueled by the one-off appearance by Reed, Cale, Morrison and Tucker to play \"Heroin\" as the encore to a brief ''Songs for Drella'' set in [[Jouy-en-Josas]], France. Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison also joined John Cale for an encore at his show at New York University on December 5, 1992.\n\nThe Reed\u2013Cale\u2013Morrison\u2013Tucker lineup officially reunited without Yule (whose inclusion had been championed by Morrison) in 1992,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> commencing activities with a European tour beginning in Edinburgh on June 1, 1993, and including a performance at Glastonbury which appeared on an ''[[NME]]'' front cover. Cale sang most of the songs Nico had originally performed. As well as headlining (with [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]] as the opening act), the Velvets performed as supporting act for five dates of [[U2]]'s [[Zoo TV Tour]]. With the success of the Velvet Underground's European reunion tour, a series of US tour dates were proposed, as was an ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' broadcast, and possibly even some new studio recordings. Before any of this could come to fruition, Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nOn August 30, 1995, Sterling Morrison died of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] after returning to his hometown of Poughkeepsie, New York, at age 53.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> When the classic lineup of the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996, Reed, Tucker, and Cale reformed the Velvet Underground for the last time.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Doug Yule was not inducted and did not attend.

The band was initially active between 1965 and 1973, and was briefly managed by the [[pop art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]], serving as the [[house band]] at [[the Factory]] and Warhol's ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'' events from 1966 to 1967. Their debut album, ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'' (with German-born singer and model [[Nico]]), was released in 1967 to critical indifference and poor sales but has become critically acclaimed; in 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it the \"most prophetic rock album ever made.\"<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/the-velvet-underground-and-nico-the-velvet-underground-52023/ RS 500 Greatest Albums] November 18, 2003.</ref><ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6597640/13_the_velvet_underground 13-The Velvet Underground and Nico] Rolling Stone, November 1, 2003</ref>\n\nThe band's integration of rock and the [[avant-garde]] achieved little commercial success during its existence, but it is now recognized as one of the most influential bands in rock, [[Underground music|underground]], [[Experimental music|experimental]], and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] music.<ref name=\"bio\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20131125-do-the-velvets-beat-the-beatles |title=The Velvet Underground: As influential as The Beatles? |last=Kot |first=Greg |publisher=BBC |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref> The provocative subject matter, musical experiments, and often [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] attitudes explored in the band's work proved influential in the development of [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music]].<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Richie|title=The Velvet Underground \u2013 Biography & History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-velvet-underground-mn0000840402/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the band No.&nbsp;19 on its list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\".<ref>Julian Casablancas, [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939222/19_the_velvet_underground \"The Velvet Underground\" (No.&nbsp;19)], in [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty \"The Immortals: The First Fifty\"], ''Rolling Stone'', No.&nbsp;946 (April 15, 2004), accessed April 29, 2007.</ref> In 2017, a study of [[AllMusic]]'s catalog indicated the Velvet Underground as the fifth most frequently cited artist influence in its database.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kopf|first1=Dan|last2=Wong|first2=Amy X.|title=A definitive list of the musicians who influenced our lives most|url=https://qz.com/1094962/a-definitive-list-of-the-musicians-who-influenced-our-lives-most/|website=Quartz|date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996 by [[Patti Smith]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-career and early stages (1964\u20131966)===\nThe foundations for what would become the Velvet Underground were laid in late-1964. Singer/songwriter/guitarist [[Lou Reed]] had performed with a few short-lived [[Garage rock|garage bands]] and had worked as a songwriter for [[Pickwick Records]] (Reed described his tenure there as being \"a poor man's [[Carole King]]\").<ref name=Fricke>[[David Fricke]], [[liner notes]] for the ''[[Peel Slowly and See]]'' [[box set]] (Polydor, 1995).</ref> Reed met [[John Cale]], a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music upon securing a [[Leonard Bernstein]] scholarship. Cale had worked with experimental composers [[John Cage]], [[Cornelius Cardew]] and [[La Monte Young]], and had performed with Young's [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], though was also interested in rock music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incubator for the Velvet Underground|author=John Cale as told to Marc Myers|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323596204578241620759540276|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref> Young's use of extended [[Drone (music)|drones]] would be a profound influence on the band's early sound. Cale was pleasantly surprised to discover that Reed's experimentalist tendencies were similar to his own: Reed sometimes used alternative guitar tunings to create a droning sound. The pair rehearsed and performed together; their partnership and shared interests built the path towards what would later become the Velvet Underground.\n\nReed's first group with Cale was the Primitives, a short-lived group assembled to issue budget-priced recordings and support an anti-dance single written by Reed, \"The Ostrich\", to which Cale added a viola passage. Reed and Cale recruited [[Sterling Morrison]] \u2014 a college classmate of Reed's at [[Syracuse University]] \u2014 as a replacement for [[Walter De Maria]], who had been a third member of the Primitives.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1216}}</ref> Reed and Morrison both played guitars, Cale played viola, keyboards and bass and [[Angus MacLise]] joined on percussion to complete the initial four-member unit.

The band immediately and unanimously adopted ''The Velvet Underground'' as its new name in November 1965.\n\nThe newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of [[Beat generation|beat]] poetry, with MacLise playing gentle \"pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Quoted by David Fricke in his liner notes for the ''Peel Slowly and See'' box set ([[Polydor]], 1995).</ref>\n\nIn July 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a [[demo tape]] at their [[Ludlow Street]] loft without MacLise, because he refused to be tied down to a schedule and would only turn up to band practice sessions when he wanted.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">{{cite web |author=Biography by Richie Unterberger |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/angus-maclise-mn0000756247/biography |title=Angus MacLise &#124; Biography & History |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Metzger |first=Richard |url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/angus_maclise_original_velvet_underground_drummer |title=DREAMWEAPON: The Art and Life of Angus MacLise, original Velvet Underground drummer |publisher=Dangerous Minds |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale attempted to give a copy of the tape to [[Marianne Faithfull]],<ref>John Cale & Victor Bockris ''What's Welsh For Zen'' London: Bloomsbury, 1999</ref> hoping she would pass it on to [[Mick Jagger]], lead singer of [[the Rolling Stones]]. Nothing ever came of this, but the demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set ''Peel Slowly and See''.\n\nManager and music journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] arranged for the group's first paying gig\u2014[[USD|$]]75 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|75|1965}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to play at [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]], in Summit, New Jersey, opening for [[the Myddle Class]]. When they decided to take the gig, MacLise abruptly left the group, protesting what he considered a [[sellout]]; he was also unwilling to be told when to start and stop playing. \"Angus was in it for art\", Morrison reported.<ref name=Fricke/>\n\nMacLise was replaced by [[Moe Tucker|Maureen \"Moe\" Tucker]], the younger sister of Morrison's friend Jim Tucker. Tucker's playing style was rather unusual: she generally played standing up rather than seated and had an abbreviated [[Drum kit|drum setup]] of [[tom-toms]], [[Snare drum|snare]] and an upturned [[bass drum]], using [[Mallets#percussion mallets|mallets]] as often as drumsticks, and rarely using [[cymbals]] (she admits that she always hated cymbals).<ref>{{cite web|last=Coston |first=Daniel |url=http://danielcoston.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/moe-tucker-interview-1997-part-one.html |title=The Coston Chronicles: Moe Tucker interview, 1997, part one |publisher=Danielcoston.blogspot.com.au |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> When the band asked her to do something unusual, she turned her bass drum on its side and played standing up. After her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans brought in from outside. Her rhythms, at once simple and exotic (influenced by the likes of [[Babatunde Olatunji]] and [[Bo Diddley]] records), became a vital part of the group's music, despite Cale's initial objections to the presence of a female drummer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bockris|first1=Victor|title=Transformer: The Lou Reed Story|date=1994|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-684-80366-6|pages=99, 101|quote=Cale, horrified by the mere suggestion that a 'chick' should play in their great group, had to be placated by the promise that it was strictly temporary.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/transformerlour000bock}}</ref> The group earned a regular paying gig at the Caf\u00e9 Bizarre and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble.\n\n===Andy Warhol and the ''Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' (1966\u20131967)===\nIn 1965, after being introduced to the Velvet Underground by filmmaker [[Barbara Rubin]],<ref name=\"boo-hooray\">{{cite web|last1=Kugelberg|first1=Johan|title=Christmas on Earth: Barbara Rubin|url=http://boo-hooray.com/exhibits/christmas-on-earth|website=Boo-Hooray Gallery |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614041743/http://boo-hooray.com/exhibits/christmas-on-earth |archivedate=June 14, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}</ref> Andy Warhol became the band's manager and suggested they use the German-born singer [[Nico]] (born Christa P\u00e4ffgen) on several songs. Warhol's reputation helped the band gain a higher profile. He helped the band secure a recording contract with MGM's Verve Records, with himself as nominal \"[[record producer|producer]]\", and gave the Velvets free rein over the sound they created.\n\nDuring their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow, ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'', which combined Warhol's films with the band's music, which made use of minimalist devices, such as drones. Warhol included the band with his show in an effort to \"use rock as a part of a larger, interdisciplinary-art work based around performance\" (McDonald).{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} They played shows for several months in New York City, then traveled throughout the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maxskansascity.com/classic/warhol/#section3|title=Andy Warhol Biography: From The Velvet Underground To Basquiat |website=Maxskansascity.com}}{{failed verification|date=January 2018}}</ref> During a short period in September 1966, when Cale was ill, the avant-garde musician [[Henry Flynt]], and Richard Mishkin, who had played in Reed's first group at university,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx7zCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=19|title=Notes from the Velvet Underground: The Life of Lou Reed|author=Howard Sounes|publisher=Random House|date= October 22, 2015|isbn=9781473508958}}</ref> took turns to cover for him.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx7zCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT67|page=67|title=Notes from the Velvet Underground: The Life of Lou Reed|author=Howard Sounes|publisher=Random House|date= October 22, 2015|isbn=9781473508958}}</ref>\n\nThe show included 16&nbsp;mm film projections by Warhol, combined with a stroboscopic-light show designed by Danny Williams.

This soon changed to \"the exploding plastic inevitable\".\n\nIn 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few ''EPI'' shows when Reed was suffering from [[hepatitis]] and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ, Tucker switched to bass guitar and MacLise was on drums. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed \"Booker T\", after musician [[Booker T. Jones]]. Some of these performances have been released as a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]; they remain the only record of MacLise with the Velvet Underground.\n\nAccording to Morrison, MacLise is said to have regretted leaving the Velvet Underground and wanted to rejoin, but Reed specifically prohibited this and made it clear that this stint was only temporary. MacLise still behaved eccentrically with time and commerce and went by his own clock: for instance, he showed up half an hour late to one show and carried on with a half-hour of drumming to compensate for his late arrival, long after the set had finished.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/>\n\nIn December 1966, Warhol and [[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]] designed Issue 3 of the multimedia [[Aspen (magazine)|''Aspen'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/aspen/aspen3/index.html |title=Aspen no. 3: The Pop Art issue |publisher=Ubu.com |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}</ref> Included in this issue of the \"magazine\", which retailed at $4 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) per copy and was packaged in a hinged box designed to look like Fab laundry detergent, were various leaflets and booklets, one of which was a commentary on rock and roll by Lou Reed, another an ''EPI'' promotional newspaper.

The album was recorded primarily in [[Scepter Studios]] in New York City during April 1966, but for reasons unclear, some songs were rerecorded at [[TTG Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], along with the new song \"[[Sunday Morning (The Velvet Underground song)|Sunday Morning]]\", later in the year with [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] producing. The album was released by Verve Records the following year in March 1967. The album cover is famous for its Warhol design: a yellow banana sticker with \"Peel slowly and see\" printed near the tip. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, peeled banana beneath.\n\nEleven songs showcased the Velvets' dynamic range, veering from the pounding attacks of \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man]]\" and \"[[Run Run Run (Lou Reed song)|Run Run Run]]\", the droning \"Venus in Furs\" and \"[[Heroin (The Velvet Underground song)|Heroin]]\", the chiming and celestial \"Sunday Morning\", to the quiet \"[[Femme Fatale (The Velvet Underground song)|Femme Fatale]]\" and the tender \"[[I'll Be Your Mirror]]\", as well as Warhol's own favorite song of the group, \"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\".<ref name=\"all\"/> [[Kurt Loder]] would later describe \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" as a \"mesmerizing [[gothic-rock]] masterpiece\".<ref name=\"all\">Kurt Loder, \"Liner notes&nbsp;\u2013 ''V.U.''

After several months of shows in the US, the band swiftly recorded their third album ''[[The Velvet Underground (album)|The Velvet Underground]]'' in late 1968 at [[TTG Studios]] in Hollywood, California. It was released in March 1969. The cover photograph was taken by [[Billy Name]]. The LP sleeve was designed by Dick Smith, then a staff artist at MGM/Verve. Released on March 12, 1969, the album failed to make ''Billboard'''s Top 200 album chart.\n\nThe harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent on their third album. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by [[folk music]], prescient of the songwriting style that would soon form Reed's solo career. While Reed had covered a vast range of lyrical subjects on the first two Velvet Underground albums, the lyrical themes of the third album were more \"intimate\" in nature. Reed's songwriting also covered new emotional ground as well, as heard in the songs \"Pale Blue Eyes\", \"Jesus\", \"Beginning to See the Light\", and \"I'm Set Free\". The personal tone of the album's subject matter resulted in Reed's desire to create a \"closet\" mix that boosted the vocals to the forefront, while reducing the album's instrumentation. The second (and more widely distributed) mix is the stereo mix done by MGM/Verve staff recording engineer Val Valentin. Another factor in the change of sound was the band's Vox amplifiers and assorted fuzzboxes were rumored to have been stolen from an airport while they were on tour and they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with [[Sunn]]. In addition, Reed and Morrison had purchased matching [[Fender Electric XII|Fender 12-string electric guitars]], but Doug Yule plays down the influence of the new equipment.\n\nMorrison's ringing guitar parts and Yule's melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are used prominently on the album.{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} Reed's songs and singing are subdued and confessional in nature,{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gq9Vp45cGx4C&pg=PT70#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=70|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Man Who Changed the World|author=Wim Hendrikse|publisher=New Generation Publishing|date= May 1, 2013|isbn=9780755250530}}</ref> Doug Yule sang the lead vocal on \"Candy Says\" (about the [[Warhol superstar]] [[Candy Darling]]), which opens the LP, and a rare Moe Tucker lead vocal is used on \"After Hours\", which closes the album, because Reed felt her \"innocent\" voice was more believable for a sad song.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Peter Hogan, Peter K. Hogan|publisher=Rough Guides|date= 2007|title=Velvet Underground|page=252}}</ref> The album has the experimental track \"The Murder Mystery\", which utilised all four band members (Reed, Yule, Tucker and Morrison) reading different lyrics, sometimes simultaneously, as well as the ballad \"Pale Blue Eyes\".\n\n===Year on the road and the \"lost\" fourth album (1969)===\nThe Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road both in the US and Canada, and not making much headway commercially. Despite these commercial setbacks, the band focused on performing live shows on the road, playing both re-worked songs from their past albums, and debuting new songs that would find their way onto the ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]'' album, such as \"New Age\", \"Rock and Roll\", and \"Sweet Jane\". While the band continued to do extended improvisations in their live shows, by 1969 they were focusing on tight live performances,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and several of the live shows the band played during this period would end up released as live albums many years later. The live album ''[[1969: The Velvet Underground Live]]'' (with Reed, Yule, Morrison & Tucker) was recorded in October 1969 but not released until 1974, on Mercury Records, at the urging of rock critic [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]], who worked in [[A&R]] for Mercury at the time. Nelson asked singer-songwriter [[Elliott Murphy]] to write liner notes for the double album. In his notes, Murphy described a scene 100 years in the future, with a student taking a class on \"classical rock'n'roll\" and listening to the Velvet Underground. He wondered what the student would make of the music and concluded, \"I wish it was a hundred years from today (I can't stand the suspense)\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21317-the-complete-matrix-tapes/amp/ |title=The Velvet Underground: ''The Complete Matrix Tapes'' |first=Douglas |last=Wolk |date=December 8, 2015 |website=Pitchfork.com |accessdate=February 5, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite liner notes |title=1969: The Velvet Underground Live |first=Elliott |last=Murphy |author-link=Elliott Murphy |year=1972 |url=http://www.elliottmurphy.com/downloads/vunotes.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=February 5, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this period the band played a series of shows in November 1969 at the Matrix and the Family Dog venues in San Francisco; recordings of these shows were released in 2001, as a triple live album, ''[[Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes]]'', which included the line up of Reed, Yule, Morrison and Tucker. During 1969 the band recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of promising material (both singles and one-offs) that were never officially released at the time due to disputes with their record label. What many consider to be the prime songs of these recording sessions were released years later, in 1985, in a compilation album called ''[[VU (album)|VU]]''. The album ''VU'' marks the transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album and the band's movement to the later pop rock song-style of their final record, ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]''.{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} Two of the songs the Velvets recorded during this period were later used on film soundtracks: \"Stephanie Says\" was used in the 2001 film ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''; \"I'm Sticking With You\" has a rare Moe Tucker\u2013Lou Reed dual-lead vocal track, with Doug Yule accompanying on piano, and was included in the film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]''.\n\nThe rest of the recordings, as well as some alternative takes and instrumental tracks were later bundled on ''[[Another View]]'' which was released in 1986. After Reed's departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records over the years: \"Stephanie Says\", \"Ocean\", \"I Can't Stand It\", \"Lisa Says\", and \"Andy's Chest\", as well as \"She's My Best Friend\", which had been originally sung by Doug Yule.\n\nBy 1969 the MGM and Verve record labels had been losing money for several years. A new president, [[Mike Curb]], was hired and he decided to cancel the recording contracts of 18 of their acts who supposedly glorified drugs in their lyrics, including their many controversial and unprofitable acts. The drug or [[hippie]]-related bands were released from MGM, and the Velvets were on his list, along with [[Eric Burdon and the Animals]] and [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[Mothers of Invention]]. Nonetheless MGM insisted on retaining ownership of all master tapes of their recordings and according to an MGM representative in a ''[[Rolling Stone magazine|Rolling Stone]]'' article from 1970, \"it wasn't eighteen groups, [Curb] was misquoted. The cuts were made partly to do with the drug scene\u2014like maybe a third of them had to do with drug reasons. The others were dropped because they weren't selling.\" Lou Reed would later remark in the 1987 issue of ''[[Creem]]'' that while he did not believe that MGM dropped the Velvets for drug associations, he did acknowledge, \"We wanted to get out of there.\"<ref name=\"richieunterberger.com\" />\n\n===''Loaded'', Tucker's pregnancy and Max's residency (1970)===\n{{Main|Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|l1=Loaded}}\n[[Cotillion Records]] (a subsidiary of [[Atlantic Records]] that specialized in blues and [[Southern soul]]) signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album with Lou Reed: ''Loaded''. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album \"loaded with hits\". Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the Velvet Underground had performed,{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} and two of Reed's best-known songs,{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\".\n\nBy the recording of ''Loaded'', Doug Yule played a more prominent role in the band, and with Reed's encouragement, sang the lead vocal on four songs: \"Who Loves the Sun\", which opened the album, \"New Age\", \"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\" and the final track, \"Oh! Sweet Nuthin\". Yule once commented on the recording of ''Loaded'': \"Lou leaned on me a lot in terms of musical support and for harmonies, vocal arrangements. I did a lot on ''Loaded''. It sort of devolved down to the Lou and Doug recreational recording.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/yule.html |title=Doug Yule interview- Perfect Sound Forever |publisher=Furious.com |date=October 21, 1995 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile the third Velvets' LP was recorded mostly live in a collaborative atmosphere, the bulk of ''Loaded'' was crafted in the studio.

Reed's last live performance with the band at Max's was informally recorded and was released two years later in 1972 as ''[[Live at Max's Kansas City]]'', also on Atlantic Records.\n\n===Reed's departure and release of ''Loaded'' (1970)===\nDisillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making, and facing pressure by manager [[Steve Sesnick]], Reed decided to quit the band during the last week of the Max's Kansas City shows in August 1970. Although Reed had informed Tucker, who was attending the show but not playing with the band because of her pregnancy, that he planned to leave the group on his last evening, he did not tell Morrison or Yule. In a 2006 interview, Yule said Sesnick waited until one hour before the band was scheduled to take the stage the following night before notifying him that Reed was not coming. \"I was expecting [Lou] to show up, I thought he was late.\" Yule blamed Sesnick for Reed's departure. \"Sesnick had engineered Lou's leaving the group. He and Lou had a relationship where Lou had depended on him for moral support, and he trusted him, and Sesnick basically said 'screw you.' ...

Due to publicity around the release, and growing interest in the Velvet Underground in Europe, Sesnick was able to secure a single album deal with Polydor in the UK, and a handful of promotional shows were booked in the UK in November and December 1972. After Sesnick reached out to Yule, a new Velvet Underground lineup was quickly assembled by Yule to do the UK shows. This brief lineup of the Velvet Underground consisted of Yule, guitarist Rob Norris (later of [[The Bongos]]), bassist George Kay (Krzyzewski), and drummer [[Mark Nauseef]]. After Sesnick failed to show up in London to meet the band with the necessary equipment and tour funds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/yule2.html |title=Doug Yule interview- Perfect Sound Forever |publisher=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> they played the handful of dates to secure enough money for flights back to the US, and Yule left the band when the brief tour ended in December 1972. It was during this brief period in the UK that Yule recorded the Polydor album (ultimately titled ''[[Squeeze (The Velvet Underground album)|Squeeze]]'') under the Velvet Underground name virtually by himself, with only the assistance of [[Deep Purple]] drummer [[Ian Paice]] and a few other session musicians in an unspecified [[London]] studio. While Yule intended to recruit Tucker to play drums on ''Squeeze'', Sesnick vetoed his decision and claimed she was \"too expensive\" to hire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/dougyule/dystory.html |title=Doug Yule \u2013 Story |publisher=Olivier.landemaine.free.fr |date=October 26, 2008 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Squeeze'' was released in February the following year, 1973, in Europe only, with minimal promotion by the label, and was held in low regard by fans and critics. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] notes that the album received \"uniformly terrible reviews\" upon initial release,<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine in the ''Allmusic'' [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r51960|pure_url=yes}} website article on ''Squeeze'']</ref> and in the early 1970s, the ''NME Book of Rock'' counted it as \"a Velvet Underground album in name only\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Nick Logan (Editor) |title=The New musical Express Book of Rock: Nick Logan: 9780352300744: Amazon.com: Books |isbn=0352300744 |year=1975 }}</ref> When asked about ''Squeeze'', Yule hinted that band manager Steve Sesnick orchestrated the album purely as a money ploy. \"Sesnick dumped the second iteration of the band in England with no money and no equipment and just left us there to find our way back. He gave me six copies of ''Squeeze'' as pay. I never got any money. When you sign with [[ASCAP]] or [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] you get an advance.

In 2011 music writer [[Steven Shehori]] included ''Squeeze'' in his \"Criminally Overlooked Albums\" series for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and in a lengthy review of the album, offered the following positive assessment of ''Squeeze'': \"if you pluck it from the shackles of its murky back-story, ''Squeeze'' is nothing short of a quintessential listening experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/steven-shehori/squeeze-velvet-underground_b_880182.html |title=Criminally Overlooked Albums: Squeeze by Doug Yule's Velvet Underground &#124; Steven Shehori |publisher=Huffingtonpost.ca |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> The UK band [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] took their name from its title according to band member [[Chris Difford]], who offered the following opinion of the album in a 2012 interview: \"It's an odd record, but the name came from that, definitely. ...

The band members objected to the billing (instigated by their tour manager); according to Yule, the promoter was not supposed to bill the band as the Velvet Underground.<ref name=\"olivier.landemaine.free.fr\"/> In late May 1973, the band and the tour manager parted ways, thus bringing the Velvet Underground to an end until the classic line-up of Reed, Tucker, Morrison and Cale would reunite in the 1990s.\n\n===Post-VU developments (1972\u20131990)===\nReed, Cale and Nico teamed up at the beginning of 1972 to play a concert in Paris at the [[Bataclan club]]. This concert was bootlegged, and finally received an official release as ''[[Le Bataclan '72]]'' in 2003. Before that, Cale and Nico had developed solo careers. Nico had also begun a solo career with Cale producing a majority of her albums. Reed started his solo career in 1972 after a brief sabbatical. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a [[tugboat]] captain in Houston for several years. Moe Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in several touring bands, including Tucker's band.\n\nYule subsequently toured with Lou Reed and played on the latter's ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' album, and Yule (at Reed's request) also contributed guitar and bass tracks to Reed's album ''[[Coney Island Baby]]'', which can be heard in the Bonus Edition of the album (released in 2002). Yule became a member of [[American Flyer (band)|American Flyer]], then dropped out of the music industry altogether before reappearing in the early 2000s.\n\nIn 1985 Polydor released the album ''VU'', which collected unreleased recordings that might have constituted the band's fourth album for MGM in 1969 but had never been released. Some of the songs had been recorded when Cale was still in the band. More unreleased recordings of the band, some of them demos and unfinished tracks, were released in 1986 as ''Another View''.\n\nOn July 18, 1988, Nico died of a cerebral haemorrhage following a bicycle accident.\n\nCzech dissident playwright [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] was a fan of the Velvet Underground, ultimately becoming a friend of Lou Reed. Though some attribute the name of the 1989 \"[[Velvet Revolution]]\", which ended more than 40 years of [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist]] rule in Czechoslovakia, to the band, Reed pointed out that the name ''Velvet Revolution'' derives from its peaceful nature\u2014that no one was \"actually hurt\" during those events.<ref name=Reedinterview>Lou Reed, [http://havel.columbia.edu/media_panels/video_window/?material=reed&timeline=havel7 ''Havel at Columbia'' interview: \"7: The Velvet Revolution and The Velvet Underground\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229073839/http://havel.columbia.edu/media_panels/video_window/?material=reed&timeline=havel7 |date=December 29, 2007 }}, accessed April 29, 2007.

Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the Velvet Underground had broken up, ''Songs for Drella'' was the first time the pair had worked together in decades, and speculation about a reunion began to form, fueled by the one-off appearance by Reed, Cale, Morrison and Tucker to play \"Heroin\" as the encore to a brief ''Songs for Drella'' set in [[Jouy-en-Josas]], France. Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison also joined John Cale for an encore at his show at New York University on December 5, 1992.\n\nThe Reed\u2013Cale\u2013Morrison\u2013Tucker lineup officially reunited without Yule (whose inclusion had been championed by Morrison) in 1992,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> commencing activities with a European tour beginning in Edinburgh on June 1, 1993, and including a performance at Glastonbury which appeared on an ''[[NME]]'' front cover. Cale sang most of the songs Nico had originally performed. As well as headlining (with [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]] as the opening act), the Velvets performed as supporting act for five dates of [[U2]]'s [[Zoo TV Tour]]. With the success of the Velvet Underground's European reunion tour, a series of US tour dates were proposed, as was an ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' broadcast, and possibly even some new studio recordings. Before any of this could come to fruition, Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nOn August 30, 1995, Sterling Morrison died of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] after returning to his hometown of Poughkeepsie, New York, at age 53.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> When the classic lineup of the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996, Reed, Tucker, and Cale reformed the Velvet Underground for the last time.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Doug Yule was not inducted and did not attend.
