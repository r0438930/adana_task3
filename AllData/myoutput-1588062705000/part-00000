The album was released on March 20, 2020, by [[XO (record label)|XO]] and [[Republic Records]]. Prior to the album's release, The Weeknd confirmed ''After Hours'' would face stylistic differences to his previous album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]'' (2016). It was also subject of widespread media anticipation leading up to its release. \n\nBeginning in 2018, recording for the album took place at New York's [[Jungle City Studios]], [[Noble Street Studios|Noble Street]] in Toronto, as well as [[Maratone Studios|MXM]] and The Weeknd's home studio (both in California). The album was produced primarily by The Weeknd, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as [[Jason Quenneville|DaHeala]], [[Illangelo]], and [[Metro Boomin]], all of whom The Weeknd had worked with previously. The standard edition has no features, although the remixes edition contains [[guest appearance]]s from [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. Music journalists have noted the album as an artistic reinvention for The Weeknd, with the introduction of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[dream pop]] influences, while thematically, ''After Hours'' explores promiscuity, overindulgence, and self-loathing. \n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' and ''[[Uncut Gems]]'' (both 2019). The album was supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\", with \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\" peaking at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and receiving [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification. Its [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single. In March 2020, ''After Hours'' broke the record for the most global pre-adds in [[Apple Music]] history, with over 1.02 million users.\n\n''After Hours'' received widespread acclaim, with some critics praising the album as The Weeknd's best piece of work. The album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 444,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, 275,000 of which were in pure sales. It is The Weeknd's fourth number-one album, and marks the biggest first week sales of 2020 for an album. The album also reached number one in 16 other countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom. ''After Hours'' will be promoted with [[the After Hours Tour]], which is set to span North America and Europe.\n\n==Background and release==\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd that \"''Chapter VI'' was coming soon.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weeknd-teases-chapter-vi-album-shares-new-artwork-2413493|title=The Weeknd teases 'Chapter VI' album, shares new artwork|website=NME|last=Krol|first=Charlotte|date=November 27, 2018|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> On January 12, 2019, Tesfaye then proceeded to further tease the project and its sound by tweeting \"no more daytime music\" to fans, making media outlets believe that he was set to continue the darker music found in ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weekend-says-new-album-will-be-less-pop-friendly-no-more-daytime-music-news.69193.html|title=The Weeknd Says New Album Will Be Less Pop-Friendly: \"No More Daytime Music\"|website=HotNewHipHop|last=Ch|first=Devin|date=January 13, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weekend-teases-new-album-chapter-6-2536077|title=Is The Weeknd's new album finally on its way?|website=NME|last=Skinner|first=Tom|date=August 7, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Then after a five-month period of silence,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-and-fans-are-convinced-chapter-vi-is-coming-news.96171.html|title=The Weeknd Returns To Instagram & Fans Are Convinced \"Chapter VI\" Is Coming|website=HotNewHipHop|last=A.|first=Aron|date=November 20, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095452/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-with-a-loading-message|title=The Weeknd Returns to Instagram With a \"Loading\" Message|publisher=[[E!

singer [[The Weeknd]]. The album was released on March 20, 2020, by [[XO (record label)|XO]] and [[Republic Records]]. Prior to the album's release, The Weeknd confirmed ''After Hours'' would face stylistic differences to his previous album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]'' (2016). It was also subject of widespread media anticipation leading up to its release. \n\nBeginning in 2018, recording for the album took place at New York's [[Jungle City Studios]], [[Noble Street Studios|Noble Street]] in Toronto, as well as [[Maratone Studios|MXM]] and The Weeknd's home studio (both in California). The album was produced primarily by The Weeknd, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as [[Jason Quenneville|DaHeala]], [[Illangelo]], and [[Metro Boomin]], all of whom The Weeknd had worked with previously. The standard edition has no features, although the remixes edition contains [[guest appearance]]s from [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. Music journalists have noted the album as an artistic reinvention for The Weeknd, with the introduction of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[dream pop]] influences, while thematically, ''After Hours'' explores promiscuity, overindulgence, and self-loathing. \n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' and ''[[Uncut Gems]]'' (both 2019). The album was supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\", with \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\" peaking at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and receiving [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification. Its [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single. In March 2020, ''After Hours'' broke the record for the most global pre-adds in [[Apple Music]] history, with over 1.02 million users.\n\n''After Hours'' received widespread acclaim, with some critics praising the album as The Weeknd's best piece of work. The album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 444,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, 275,000 of which were in pure sales. It is The Weeknd's fourth number-one album, and marks the biggest first week sales of 2020 for an album.
