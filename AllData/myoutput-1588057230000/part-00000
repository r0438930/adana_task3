Following an exchange of punts, Purdue took their first lead of the game on a nine-yard run by David Blough. Another field goal by McLaughlin cut Purdue's lead to one, but Purdue answered back the following drive with a 32-yard run by Brian Lankford-Johnson. Purdue looked to be taking charge of the game with a 3rd down stop, but it was nullified by a roughing the passer hit on [[Wes Lunt]] by Danny Ezechukwu, injuring Lunt to the point where he would not return to the game. Chayce Crouch, who had been rotating in with Lunt at quarterback was now the full-time quarterback for Illinois. Crouch's running ability on the zone-read proved difficult for Purdue to stop as Crouch lead the Fighting Illini to a 26-yard touchdown run. Purdue responded with a 45-yard pass from Blough to Malik Kimbrough. Just before the half, McLaughlin made another field goal to give Purdue just a 21-16 halftime lead. Crouch opened up the second half scoring with a 3-yard run, giving Illinois their second lead of the game. Purdue regained the lead once again with a 37-yard J. D.

On Purdue's ensuing drive Richie Worship scored on a 6-yard touchdown run to tie the game. Illinois would get a chance for the win when McLaughlin lined up for a field goal with seconds left. Darrell Hazell chose to use all three of his remaining timeouts in an attempt to ice McLaughlin. McLaughlin's kick would fall no good after hitting the right upright forcing overtime. Purdue won the toss and chose defense. Crouch fumbled on Illinois' first possession, recorded by Leroy Clark of Purdue.

Indiana responded on the next drive when Lagow found Mitchell Paige from 27-yards out for a touchdown. Purdue would turn their next possession over on downs, but got the ball back when Lagow was once again intercepted by Bailey. Purdue was forced to punt their next drive, in which Indiana responded with a 1-yard run by Zander Diamont for a touchdown, giving Indiana their first lead of the game. Purdue was able to respond with a 23-yard field goal on their next possession. After an Indiana punt, Blough was intercepted by Jonathan Crawford, who was able to return the ball in Purdue territory, setting up a 29-yard [[Griffin Oakes]] field goal. After the two teams exchanged punts, Purdue scored with 1:50 left in the first half on a 10-yard Cameron Posey touchdown from Blough, however Dellinger's point after attempt was blocked, giving Indiana a 17-16 halftime lead. Purdue regained the lead when DeAngelo Yancey scored on a 31-yard pass from Blough, the only score of the 3rd quarter. Indiana's first 4th quarter drive ended with a 46-yard Oakes field goal to draw Indiana within 2 points. After Purdue was forced to punt, Indiana drove 61 yards concluding with a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Devine Redding]] to re-gain the lead for the Hoosiers. Blough was able to drive and lead the Boilermakers to the Hoosiers 27 yard line, where on 4th and 14, he was intercepted again by Crawford in the end zone with 1:13 remaining. With two timeouts, Purdue forced a 4th and 3 for the Hoosiers with 11 seconds left. Indiana decided to attempt to run out the clock when Diamont ran backwards into his own end zone where he was tackled by Jake Replogle for a safety, making the score 26-24 with 1 second remaining. On the free kick, Brian Lankford-Johnson's lateral pass was caught by Crawford and he took a knee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=400869700 |title=Purdue-Indiana Box Score |date=November 26, 2016 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |work=www.espn.com |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref> Sealing Indiana's fourth straight victory over Purdue.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==2017 NFL Draft==\n{{Main|2017 NFL Draft}}\n\n{{NFLDraft-header | noteswidth=250pt}}\n\n{{NFLDraft-row |draftyear= 2017 |round=5 | picknum=175 | team=Green Bay Packers | first=DeAngelo | last=Yancey |dab= | position=WR | collegeyear=2016 | college=Purdue | collegeteam=Purdue Boilermakers | collegelink=Purdue | probowl= |note=from [[2017 New England Patriots season|New England]] via [[2017 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland]]&nbsp;{{refn|{{Anchor|MingoTrade}}'''No. 175: New England \u2192 Cleveland (PD).'''

Following an exchange of punts, Purdue took their first lead of the game on a nine-yard run by David Blough. Another field goal by McLaughlin cut Purdue's lead to one, but Purdue answered back the following drive with a 32-yard run by Brian Lankford-Johnson. Purdue looked to be taking charge of the game with a 3rd down stop, but it was nullified by a roughing the passer hit on [[Wes Lunt]] by Danny Ezechukwu, injuring Lunt to the point where he would not return to the game. Chayce Crouch, who had been rotating in with Lunt at quarterback was now the full-time quarterback for Illinois. Crouch's running ability on the zone-read proved difficult for Purdue to stop as Crouch lead the Fighting Illini to a 26-yard touchdown run. Purdue responded with a 45-yard pass from Blough to Malik Kimbrough. Just before the half, McLaughlin made another field goal to give Purdue just a 21-16 halftime lead. Crouch opened up the second half scoring with a 3-yard run, giving Illinois their second lead of the game. Purdue regained the lead once again with a 37-yard J. D. Dellinger field goal just before the end of the third quarter. Kendrick Foster's 3-yard run just gave Illinois their largest lead of the game with 12:34 to play. On Purdue's ensuing drive Richie Worship scored on a 6-yard touchdown run to tie the game. Illinois would get a chance for the win when McLaughlin lined up for a field goal with seconds left. Darrell Hazell chose to use all three of his remaining timeouts in an attempt to ice McLaughlin. McLaughlin's kick would fall no good after hitting the right upright forcing overtime. Purdue won the toss and chose defense. Crouch fumbled on Illinois' first possession, recorded by Leroy Clark of Purdue. After a first down run by Worship, Dellinger kicked a 28-yard field goal to give Purdue the victory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=400869667 |title=Purdue-Illinois Box Score |date=October 8, 2016 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |work=www.espn.com |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===vs. Iowa===\n{{see also|2016 Iowa Hawkeyes football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = '''Iowa at Purdue''' <br /> ([[Homecoming|Homecoming game]])\n| Visitor = '''Hawkeyes'''\n| Host = Boilermakers\n| V1 = 21 | V2 = 14 | V3 = 7 | V4 = 7\n| H1 = 0 | H2 = 7 | H3 = 7 | H4 = 21\n| Date = October 15\n| Location = Ross-Ade Stadium <br /> West Lafayette, IN\n| TimeZone = EDT\n| StartTime = 12:00 PM\n| ElapsedTime = 3:45\n| Attendance = 40,239\n| Weather = 67\u00b0F, Cloudy, SSW 14 MPH\n| Referee = Mike Cannon\n| TVAnnouncers = [[Anish Shroff]], [[Tom Ramsey]] & Kevin Weidl\n| TVStation = ESPN2\n}}\n*'''Sources:'''<ref>{{cite news|title=Iowa-Purdue Pre-game Notes|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=PurdueSports.com|accessdate=October 11, 2016|date=October 12, 2016|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/pur/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/release/release_20161010aaa.pdf}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1|Time=8:57|Team=IOWA|Event=LeShun Daniels 1-yard run (Keith Duncan kick)|Score=IOWA 7\u20130}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|Quarter=1|Time=2:20|Team=IOWA|Event=C.
