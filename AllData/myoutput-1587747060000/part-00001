Half of the tales feature his 'Berry' characters.\n\n== Plot==\n\nThe book includes two main groups of short stories, the first consisting of pre-[[World War I|war]] frivolities and the second post-war. The final story in the first group recounts the sudden end of the pre-war male characters, now serving in the Great War, who hear a sudden sound which some interpret as a ship's siren and others as the sound of a heavy gun. A moment later, all are killed in the crater of a great shell. The stories of the second group return to the entirely different 'Berry' set of characters from ''[[The Brother of Daphne]]'', with the introduction of Ad\u00e8le Feste, an American.\n\n== Background ==\nThe stories included in Book I consist largely of tales set before [[World War I|the Great War]] and published monthly in [[The Windsor Magazine|''The Windsor Magazine'']] in 1915, with the final story (which concludes during the War on the [[Macedonian front]], where Mercer himself served) being published in June 1919.{{sfn|Smithers|1982|pp=82, 93}} The first story has the characters in London, after which they proceed to the island of Rih (a thinly-disguised [[Madeira]]). \n\nThe story included in the Interlude features a unique set of characters, initially in Scotland on the day that the Great War began and subsequently on the Western Front. \n\nThe stories in Book II featuring Berry & Co can be divided into three groups. The first two continue the style of those collected in \"The Brother of Daphne\" and were serialised in the Windsor in the summer of 1914 immediately following on from the last of those stories. The second group consists of three stories when Berry & Co meet up in Egypt (where Mercer also served) at the end of the War and then travel home via Rome. The final story, \"Nemesis\", was originally intended for [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] and is therefore shorter than the normal Windsor stories. In the Windsor the protagonist is named Jeremy, but for its inclusion in the book the name was changed to Berry. \n\nAfter being released from war service, Mercer decided not to return to his pre-war work at [[Bar (law)|the bar]], but to concentrate on writing.{{sfn|Usborne|1974|pp=93}}\n\n== Chapters ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nBook I - How Some Passed Out Of The Courts For Ever\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | I\n| What's In A Name ?\n| December 1914\n| XLI\n| 240\n| 149-158\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | II\n| A Sister Ship\n| January 1915\n| XLI\n| 241\n| 250-258\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | III\n| To Seat Four\n| February 1915\n| XLI\n| 242\n| 389-398\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | IV\n| Love Thirty\n| March 1915\n| XLI\n| 243\n| 510-518\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| For Better Or For Worse\n| June 1919\n| L\n| 294\n| 17-26\n| Norah Schlegel\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nInterlude\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n| And The Other Left\n| November 1914\n| XL\n| 239\n| 661-671\n| Charles J Crombie\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nBook II - How Others Left The Courts Only To Return \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | I\n| A B\u00e9b\u00e9 In Arms\n| August 1914\n| XL\n| 236\n| 321-327\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | II\n| Contempt Of Court\n| September 1914\n| XL\n| 237\n| 429-436\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | III\n| Beauty Repeats Itself\n| July 1919\n| L\n| 295\n| 97-107\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | IV\n| The Desert Air\n| August 1919\n| L\n| 296\n| 181-192\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| As Rome Does\n| September 1919\n| L\n| 297\n| 275-284\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | VI\n| Nemesis\n| November 1919\n| L\n| 299\n| 483-486\n| Howard K Elcock\n|}\n\n== Illustrations ==\n\nThe illustrations from the Windsor stories were not included in the book version, although one of Norah Schlegel's illustrations from \"For Better Or For Worse\" was used to illustrate the dustjacket of the first edition.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe review in September's [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] was much less enthusiastic than that for the author's first collection, ''[[The Brother of Daphne]]'':{{sfn|Smithers|1982|p=95}} \"The main object of the characters in ''The Courts of Idleness'' ([[Ward Lock & Co|Ward, Lock]]) was to amuse themselves, and as their sprightly conversations were often punctuated by laughter I take it that they succeeded.
