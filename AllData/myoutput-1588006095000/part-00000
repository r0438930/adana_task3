{"title_page": "David Moses Bridges", "text_new": "'''David Moses Bridges''' (May 17, 1962 - January 20, 2017) was a Native American environmentalist and artist known for his traditional birchbark canoes and baskets. He was a member of the Passamaquoddy tribal community on the [[Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation]]. Bridges fought for tribal environmental rights and was a co-founder of Mulankeyutmonen Nkihtakmikon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpeoplesfund.org/artists/david-moses-bridges|title=David Moses Bridges|website=First Peoples Fund|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>, to preserve the [[Wabanaki Confederacy|Wabanaki]] culture.\n\nHe learned to build canoes from his great-grandfather Sylvester Gabriel and how to make baskets from his female relatives. \u00a0\n\n== Biography and education ==\nBridges was born in Portland, Maine, on May 17, 1962, and predominantly grew up with the Sipayik Native Community in South Portland. During the summertime, he spent most of his time with his grandfather Sylvester Gabriel. Bridges' family consisted of his parents, three siblings, and many relatives, most of whom were female. From his female relatives, he learned how to make baskets.\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1980, Bridges moved to San Francisco, California, where he lived for the next ten years. While living in San Francisco, he worked several jobs that included painting, carpeting, and group home counseling and was able to explore many different types of artwork. He would occasionally return home to work as a camp counselor. When he moved back home, Bridges's grandfather enlightened him on how to build canoes that were stable enough to go through rivers and bays smoothly. Bridges also took classes with Steve Cayard at the Woodenboat School in Brooklyn, Maine, and the two equally created workshops in Native and Anglo communities. He also took jobs at the Benjamin River and Brooklyn Boat Yard.\n\nIn 1993 Bridges and his wife Patricia Ayala Rocabado moved to Sipayik and decided to start a family. They would go on to have three children: Tobias, Sabattus, and Natanis. When his first son was four, Bridges began studying history at the University of Maine at Machias, after which point he moved to Bethel, Maine. Bridges held birch canoe workshops and together with his wife, held presentations at several anthropological, and archaeological conferences in North and South America. He also held presentations at universities and cultural institutions.\n\nWhen Bridges was 54, he was diagnosed with [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus cancer]], which led to his death on January 20, 2017. His most capable eldest son, Tobias, continued his work by joining the canoe project led by Cayard and Patricia, further pursuing her parent's careers in [[indigenous archaeology]]. Patricia also began working on an art book and a film on Bridges.\n\n== Early life ==\nDavid Moses Bridges was born on May 17, 1962. He mainly spent the majority of his childhood in the South of Portland, Maine. Bridges grew up with his father Earl Bridges, mother Hilda Lewis,  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://obituaries.bangordailynews.com/obituary/david-bridges-867651212/|title=Remembering the life of David Bridges 1962 - 2017|website=obituaries.bangordailynews.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>  his great-grandfather, Sylvester Gabriel, and his sister. Bridges' great-grandfather lived with them as a care-take for Bridges and his sister.\n\nGrowing up, Bridges attended many camps that were related to his tribal community. Bridges fell in love with the camp so much that when he got older he would come home from San Francisco to Portland during the summer to become a camp counselor.\n\nBridges' great-grandfather introduced Bridges to the birchbark canoe. Due to his great-grandfather's old age, they were not able to create a birchbark canoe together. Bridges' great-grandfather passed away in 1972 when Bridges was 10 years old but he left Bridges with tools such as a crooked knife, draw knife, and an awl<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asongbird.com/david-moses-bridges-the-trees-let-me-know/|title=David Moses Bridges \u2013 The Trees Let Me Know {{!}} Abena Songbird|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>.\n\nEver since then, Bridges had the heart to finish the canoe so he attended school and studied more about the traditions related to his tribal community and about boat making.\n\nBridges started making birchbark canoes to preserve the dying tradition. Bridges made canoes with his students, who were of all ages. He also went to Universities and Museums giving presentations about his work. \n\n== Artworks ==\n\n=== Traditional birchbark canoe ===\n[[File:Birchbark_canoe,_Abbe_Museum,_Bar_Harbor,_ME_IMG_2301.JPG|thumb|Traditional Birchbark Canoe.
