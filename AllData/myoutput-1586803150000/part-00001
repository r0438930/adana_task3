It runs east\u2013west in southwest Wisconsin from near [[Ferryville, Wisconsin|Ferryville]] to [[Boaz, Wisconsin|Boaz]].\n\n==Route description==\nThe highway begins at an intersection with [[Wisconsin Highway 35|WIS&nbsp;35]] east of [[Lake Winneshiek]], a lake along the [[Mississippi River]]. From there, it runs eastward, following Copper Creek until it ends just west of [[Mount Sterling, Wisconsin|Mount Sterling]], where it intersects [[Wisconsin Highway 27|WIS&nbsp;27]]. The highway then runs eastward before curving to the north to run along an unnamed creek, which the highway follows to the southeast until it drains into the [[Kickapoo River]], at which point the highway crosses it to run along Main Street in [[Gays Mills, Wisconsin|Gays Mills]]. East of Gays Mills, the highway curves up a hill and runs eastward, running concurrently with [[U.S. Route 61|US&nbsp;61]] for {{conv|0.2|mi|km}} in [[Rolling Ground, Wisconsin|Rolling Ground]]. From there, the highway runs eastward to meet an unnamed creek and the English Run before curving to follow a different tributary of the English Run. After that tributary ends, the highway intersects with County Trunk Highway (CTH) UU and then curves southeast to another unnamed creek which begins near CTH-F. The highway follows it until reaching CTH-E in [[Boaz, Wisconsin]] where it runs northward along Mill Creek before terminating at [[U.S. Route 14 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;14]].<ref name=gmaps/>\n{{-}}\n==Major intersections==\n{{Jcttop|length_ref=<ref name=\"gmaps\">{{google maps |url = https://www.google.com/maps/dir/43.3196265,-91.0613636/43.3384659,-90.6787739/43.3309953,-90.6610812/43.3184837,-90.6519802/43.3354932,-90.580076/43.3288167,-90.53/43.340344,-90.5257888/@43.3085834,-90.9500963,10.78z/am=t/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0 |title = Length and Route of WIS&nbsp;171 |access-date = April 13, 2020 }}</ref>}}\n{{WIint\n|county=Crawford\n|cspan=5\n|location=Seneca\n|ctdab=Crawford\n|mile=0.0\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WI|35}}\n}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Mount Sterling\n|ctdab=\n|mile=7.5\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WI|27}}\n}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Gays Mills\n|mile=12.9\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WIS|131}}\n}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Clayton\n|ctdab=Crawford\n|lspan=2\n|mile=19.1\n|mile2=19.3\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=WI|US|61}}\n|notes=Short concurrency with US 61\n}}\n{{WIint\n|mile=22.7\n|road={{jct|state=WI|CTH|H|dir1=north}}\n}}\n{{WIint\n|county=Richland\n|cspan=5\n|location=Akan\n|lspan=3\n|mile=23.8\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=WI|CTH|U|dir1=north}}\n|notes=Northern end of CTH-U concurrency\n}}\n{{WIint\n|type=concur\n|mile=24.8\n|road={{jct|state=WI|CTH|U|dir1=south}}\n|notes=Southern end of CTH-U concurrency\n}}\n{{WIint\n|mile=29.4\n|road={{jct|state=WI|CTH|F|dir1=south}}\n}}\n{{WIint\n|type=concur\n|location=Boaz\n|mile=32.3\n|road={{jct|state=WI|CTH|E|dir1=south}}\n|notes=Southern end of CTH-E concurrency\n}}\n{{WIint\n|type=concur\n|location=Dayton\n|ctdab=Richland\n|mile=33.3\n|road={{jct|state=WI|US|14|CTH|E|dir1=north}}\n|notes=Northern end of CTH-E concurrency\n}}\n{{Jctbtm|keys=concur}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Wisconsin Highway 171}}\n\n[[Category:State highways in Wisconsin|171]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Crawford County, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Richland County, Wisconsin]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox road\n|state=WI\n|type=WI\n|route=171\n|length_mi=33.39\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"WH1\">{{cite web |last = Bessert |first = Chris |title = Highways 170\u2013179 (Highway 171) |work = Wisconsin Highways |url = http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys170-179.html#STH-171 |access-date = March 20, 2007 }}{{sps|certain=yes|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n|direction_a=West\n|terminus_a={{Jct|state=WI|WI|35}} in [[Ferryville, Wisconsin|Ferryville]]\n|junction={{Jct|state=WI|US|61}} in [[Rolling Ground, Wisconsin|Rolling Ground]]\n|direction_b=East\n|terminus_b={{Jct|state=WI|US|14|CTH|E}} in [[Boaz, Wisconsin|Boaz]]\n|counties=[[Crawford County, Wisconsin|Crawford]], [[Richland County, Wisconsin|Richland]]\n|previous_type=WI\n|previous_route=170\n|next_type=WI\n|next_route=172\n}}\n[[File:WIS171EastTerminusUS14.jpg|thumb|left|Eastern terminus]]\n'''State Trunk Highway 171''' (often called '''Highway 171''', '''STH-171''' or '''WIS&nbsp;171''') is a [[state highway (US)|state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Wisconsin]].
