Brain capacity varied widely depending on the population, ranging from {{cvt|546\u20131251|cc}}, and maximum brain size was likely achieved early on in life, equating to a shorter childhood and reduced parental care compared to modern humans. Size also ranged widely from {{cvt|146\u2013185|cm|ftin|sigfig=1}} in height and {{cvt|40\u201368|kg}} in weight. ''H. erectus'' men and women may have been roughly the same size like modern humans, which could indicate [[monogamy]] in line with general trends exhibited in primates. Skin colour potentially varied with location.\n\n''H. erectus'' is associated with the [[Acheulean]] stone tool [[industry (archaeology)|industry]], and is thought to have been the earliest human ancestor capable of using fires, hunting and gathering in coordinated groups, caring for injured or sick group members, seafaring, and possibly art-making. Sites generally show consumption of medium to large animals, such as [[bovine]]s or [[elephant]]s, and a high reliance on meat is associated with increasing brain size. Though groups were more social than ancestor species, it is unclear if ''H. erectus'' was anatomically capable of speech, though it is postulated they communicated using some [[proto-language]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Naming===\n{{see|Trinil 2}}\n[[File:Pithecanthropus erectus-PeterMaas Naturalis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Java Man]]]]\nThe first remains, [[Java Man]], were described by Dutch anatomist [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]] in 1893, who set out to look for the \"[[missing link (human evolution)|missing link]]\" between apes and humans in Southeast Asia, because he believed [[gibbon]]s to be the closest living relatives to humans in accordance with the \"[[Out of Asia]]\" hypothesis. ''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright. However, few scientists recognized it as a \"missing link\", and, consequently, Dubois' discovery had been largely disregarded.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Homo erectus adult female - head model - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Forensic reconstruction of an adult female ''Homo erectus''.<ref>Reconstruction by [[John Gurche]] (2010), [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]], based on [[KNM ER 3733]] and [[KNM ER 992|992]].\nAbigail Tucker, \"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html?c=y&page=2&navigation=next#IMAGES A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces]\", Smithsonian.com, 25 February 2010.</ref>]]\nIn 1921, two teeth from [[Zhoukoudian]], China discovered by [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]] had prompted widely publicized interest.<ref name=\"doorKnock1\">{{cite news |title=The First Knock at the Door |publisher=Peking Man Site Museum |quote=In the summer of 1921, Dr. J.G.

Throughout much of the 20th century, anthropologists debated the role of ''H. erectus'' in [[human evolution]]. Early in the century, due in part to the discoveries at Java and Zhoukoudian, the belief that modern humans first evolved in Asia was widely accepted. A few naturalists\u2014[[Charles Darwin]] the most prominent among them\u2014theorized that humans' earliest ancestors were African.

The mandibular body resists torsion from the [[bite force]] or chewing, meaning their jaws could produce unusually powerful stresses while eating, but the practical application of this is unclear. Nonetheless, the mandibular bodies of ''H. erectus'' are somewhat thinner than those of early ''Homo''. The premolars and molars also have a higher frequency of pits than ''H. habilis'', suggesting ''H. erectus'' ate more brittle foods (which cause pitting).

This would have increased brain size indirectly while maintaining the same caloric requirements of ancestor species. ''H. erectus'' may have also been the first to use a [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] food collecting strategy as a response to the increasing dependence on meat.

Brain capacity varied widely depending on the population, ranging from {{cvt|546\u20131251|cc}}, and maximum brain size was likely achieved early on in life, equating to a shorter childhood and reduced parental care compared to modern humans. Size also ranged widely from {{cvt|146\u2013185|cm|ftin|sigfig=1}} in height and {{cvt|40\u201368|kg}} in weight. ''H. erectus'' men and women may have been roughly the same size like modern humans, which could indicate [[monogamy]] in line with general trends exhibited in primates. Skin colour potentially varied with location.\n\n''H. erectus'' is associated with the [[Acheulean]] stone tool [[industry (archaeology)|industry]], and is thought to have been the earliest human ancestor capable of using fires, hunting and gathering in coordinated groups, caring for injured or sick group members, seafaring, and possibly art-making. Sites generally show consumption of medium to large animals, such as [[bovine]]s or [[elephant]]s, and a high reliance on meat is associated with increasing brain size. Though groups were more social than ancestor species, it is unclear if ''H. erectus'' was anatomically capable of speech, though it is postulated they communicated using some [[proto-language]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Naming===\n{{see|Trinil 2}}\n[[File:Pithecanthropus erectus-PeterMaas Naturalis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Java Man]]]]\nThe first remains, [[Java Man]], were described by Dutch anatomist [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]] in 1893, who set out to look for the \"[[missing link (human evolution)|missing link]]\" between apes and humans in Southeast Asia, because he believed [[gibbon]]s to be the closest living relatives to humans in accordance with the \"[[Out of Asia]]\" hypothesis. ''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright. However, few scientists recognized it as a \"missing link\", and, consequently, Dubois' discovery had been largely disregarded.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Homo erectus adult female - head model - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Forensic reconstruction of an adult female ''Homo erectus''.<ref>Reconstruction by [[John Gurche]] (2010), [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]], based on [[KNM ER 3733]] and [[KNM ER 992|992]].\nAbigail Tucker, \"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html?c=y&page=2&navigation=next#IMAGES A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces]\", Smithsonian.com, 25 February 2010.</ref>]]\nIn 1921, two teeth from [[Zhoukoudian]], China discovered by [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]] had prompted widely publicized interest.<ref name=\"doorKnock1\">{{cite news |title=The First Knock at the Door |publisher=Peking Man Site Museum |quote=In the summer of 1921, Dr. J.G.

The [[Mandible#Body|bodies of the mandibles]] of ''H. erectus'', and all early ''Homo'', are thicker than those of modern humans and all living apes. The mandibular body resists torsion from the [[bite force]] or chewing, meaning their jaws could produce unusually powerful stresses while eating, but the practical application of this is unclear. Nonetheless, the mandibular bodies of ''H. erectus'' are somewhat thinner than those of early ''Homo''. The premolars and molars also have a higher frequency of pits than ''H. habilis'', suggesting ''H. erectus'' ate more brittle foods (which cause pitting). These all indicate that the ''H. erectus'' mouth was less capable of processing hard foods and more at shearing through tougher foods, thus reducing the variety of foods it could process, likely as a response to tool use.<ref name=Ungar2006>{{cite journal|first=P.
