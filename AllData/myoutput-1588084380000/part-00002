Within the area of the former urban district lies the [[model village]] of [[Woodlands, South Yorkshire|Woodlands]], built for [[Brodsworth Colliery]]. The old village is on the B1220, and meets the A638 to the south of the village at Adwick Grange, near the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/299866 Highwayman]'' pub.\n\nTo the west is the parish of [[Brodsworth]]. Highfields Country Park is adjacent to Brodsworth. The parish boundary with Brodsworth is mostly the Roman Ridge, except for a small section adjacent to [[Pickburn]], where it extends out to the [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]] near the country park, and follows ''Long Lands Lane'' from the motorway bypass. To the north, the parish boundary follows the Old Ea Beck, broadly following the ECML railway. It then follows a drain under ''Adwick Lane'', then Langthwaite Drain under the ECML, to the Highwayman roundabout; this roundabout is the southern edge of the (religious, no longer civil) parish of Adwick along the A638. The division between Woodlands and Adwick parish follows just east of the A638, to the west of the secondary school, meeting the A638 at the Red House junction.\n\nThe Woodlands parish from [[Hangthwaite]] meets the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/876381 A638] further south near the former Long Edge Quarry, then follows [[B6422 road|''Green Lane'' (B6422)]] until a point just east of [[Scawthorpe]], where it meets the Roman Ridge. It follows the present Roman Ridge north and along the present-day parish boundary to the A1(M). It follows the A1(M) all the way to the Red House junction (38), including the Red House industrial park, whereas the present-day parish boundary (with Brodsworth) follows the Roman Ridge, north of ''Long Lands Lane'' past Markham Grange [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/247478 garden centre].\n\n===Railway===\n[[Image:S6000130.JPG|thumb|left|Station flooded in 2007]]\nA main feature of the village is the [[Adwick railway station]], on the [[Adwick railway station|electrified line]], part of the [[East Coast Main Line]], to Wakefield and Leeds. It is also the terminus for trains from Sheffield, via Doncaster. Just north of the station, is an east-west connecting freight-only line that originates just outside [[Hatfield and Stainforth railway station]], passing the former [[Thorpe Marsh Power Station]]. The railway station originally closed in 1967, but re-opened in 1993.\n\n==History==\n\n===Romans===\nThe town derives its name from the great north British Roman routeway, [[Ermine Street]]. This road, also known as the [[Roman Ridge]], follows the A638 (former A1) northwards through the centre of Doncaster (former Danum) until the junction of the A635 and A638. It follows to the west of the A638, and passes along the western perimeter of Woodlands, dividing the estate from the Red House industrial park. It rejoins the Great North Road (the A1 at this point) at the Red House interchange.\n\n===Anglo Saxons===\nIn December 2007, archaeologists from ARCUS were called in after site workers preparing for the construction of the brand new North Ridge Community School unearthed human remains. The new School, for special needs children, was to be built adjacent to North Doncaster Technology College (now Outwood Academy Adwick). 40 graves were discovered; 37 containing skeletal remains dating between 660 AD and 880 AD, the Middle Saxon period. There was some erosion and disturbance on the site. Few grave goods were found but in the future any artifacts will be archived in Doncaster Museum. This is believed to be the first Anglo-Saxon or early Medieval cemetery of this type found in South Yorkshire and one of the most significant Anglo-Saxon finds in the country.\n\n===Normans===\nThe earliest references to the town are found in [[Domesday Book]] (1086), and the parish church of St. Laurence dates from the 12th century.\n\n===Churches===\n[[File:Adwick - St Laurence Church.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt= |[[Church of St Laurence, Adwick le Street|St Laurence Church]]]]There are two churches - the main one is dedicated to [[Church of St Laurence, Adwick le Street|St Laurence]] in the old village to the north, and the other is in Woodlands, and is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/235525 All Saints]. The religious parish of St Laurence, also includes the southern part of [[Hampole]] parish (from Hampole Wood to Harry Wood further north), but not the northern [[Skelbrooke]] part of this parish.\n\n===Amenities===\nIn the past, there was a pub in the village called the ''Red House''. This was north of the main village, on the former A1 (now the [[A638 road|A638]]), and gave its name to the Red House [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2040687 interchange] (former roundabout before 1979) of the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1(M)]] and A638; nearby is the Red House industrial park. Until August 1961, the A1 passed through the parish.\n\n===Local economy===\n[[File:The Nu Tool factory, A1M junction with the A638 at Red House. - geograph.org.uk - 249352.jpg|thumb|right|Red House industrial park]]\nOn the nearby Red House industrial park, next to the A1(M), is a [[B&Q]] [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/864905 distribution centre], and the headquarters of [[DFS (United Kingdom retailer)|dfs]]. The industrial park is in the parish of [[Brodsworth]].\n\nIn the 1920s, the Adwick le Street Urban District had a population of around 12,000.\n\n===Floods===\n[[File:S6000129.JPG|thumb|left|Floods in June 2007]]\nIn June 2007, similar to many areas in the north of Doncaster, the village suffered extensive flooding. The [[East Coast Main Line]] was under feet of water.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Adwick - Primary School.jpg|thumb|top|right|Park Primary School (Caxton Road frontage)]]\nOn Windmill Balk Lane was [[Outwood Academy Adwick]], an Academy, since 1 September 2009. This replaced [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1563301 North Doncaster Technology College]. Previous to this it had been Adwick School which had made a successful bid for Technology College status in 2001. Before that it was the co-educational [[Percy Jackson Grammar School]] of 1939, which became a comprehensive (Adwick School) in 1968 when it merged with Adwick High School of 1965. On 25 February 2013, a new Outwood Academy building, adjacent to the A638, was completed and opened to pupils. The unused complex of old school buildings on the site were demolished and new outdoor sporting facilities and Sports Hall provided on the 'Old School' field. Immediately to the north of Outwood Academy, stands the newly built Outwood Institute of Education offering leadership, professional development and training to young people.  \nOn the southern side of Windmill Balk Lane is Park Primary School opposite the Outwood Academy Entrance and tennis courts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adwick upon Dearne]], a village and civil parish, to the west, also in Doncaster\n\n==References==\n[[Image:Longlands Lane Bridge, crossing the A1(M) - geograph.org.uk - 247466.jpg|thumb|right|''Long Lands Lane'' bridge over the A1(M)]]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Adwick le Street}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121133849/http://www.doncasterfhs.co.uk/content/adwick Village history]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110104200424/http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/Leisure_in_Doncaster/Sports_and_games/Sports_and_leisure_centres/Adwick_Leisure_Centre/Adwick_Leisure_Centre.asp Leisure centre]\n* [http://allsaintswoodlands.blogspot.com All Saints Church]\n* {{OpenDomesday|SE5408|adwick-le-street|Adwick &#91;le Street&#93;}}\n\n{{South Yorkshire}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adwick Le Street}}\n[[Category:Adwick le Street| ]]\n[[Category:Villages in Doncaster]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Village in South Yorkshire, England}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2018}}\n{{more footnotes|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|static_image_name        = Foresters Arms, Adwick (Geograph 3952230 by Dave Bevis).jpg\n|static_image_caption     = Foresters Arms on Village Street                                 \n|country =                  England\n|coordinates =              {{coord|53.56765|N|1.19313|W|type:city(2000)_region:GB|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name =            Adwick le Street\n|population =               15,911\n|population_ref =           (Adwick Ward.
