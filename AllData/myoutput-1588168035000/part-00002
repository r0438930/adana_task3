{"title_page": "Multi-sport event", "text_new": "{{Short description|Organized sporting event involving multiple sports}}\n{{Distinguish|Multiple-stage competition{{!}}Multiple-stage competition (disambiguation)}}\n\nA '''multi-sport event''' is an organized [[sport|sporting]] event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports among organized teams of athletes from (mostly) [[nation state|nation-states]]. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the [[Olympic Games]], first held in modern times in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] in Athens, Greece and inspired by the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], one of a number of such events held in antiquity. Most modern multi-sports events have the same basic structure. Games are held over the \ncourse of several days in and around a \"host city\", which changes for each competition. Countries send national teams to each competition, consisting of individual athletes and teams that compete in a wide variety of sports.  Athletes or teams are awarded [[gold medal|gold]], [[silver medal|silver]] or [[bronze medal]]s for first, second and third place respectively. Each games are generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Ancient Olympic Games]], first held in 776 BC, was the precursor to the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympic Games]], although its first edition only featured a footrace and the number of sporting competitions expanded at later editions.\n\nThere were several other \"games\" held in Europe in the [[classical antiquity|classical era]]:\n\n* [[Panhellenic Games]]:\n** ''The [[Pythian Games]]'' (founded 527 BC) held in [[Delphi]] every four years\n** ''The [[Nemean Games]]'' (founded 516 BC) held in [[Argolid]] every two years\n** ''The [[Isthmian Games]]'' (founded 523 BC) held on the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] every two years\n* The [[Roman Games]]&nbsp;\u2013 Arising from Etruscan rather than purely Greek roots, the Roman Games deemphasized footraces and throwing. Instead, the Greek sports of chariot racing and [[wrestling]], as well as the Etruscan sport of gladiatorial combat, took center stage.\n\nOther multi-sport festivals emerged in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, including the [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]] in [[England]] in the 1600s, the [[Highland Games]] in [[Scotland]], and the Olympiade de la R\u00e9publique in [[France]] in the 1800s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, athletes at multi-sport events were almost exclusively male. As international [[women's sport]] began to develop, events such as the [[Women's World Games]] and [[Olympics of Grace]] were held to allow women to engage in sport on the international stage. Though short-lived, events such as these led to greater inclusion of women at multi-sport events over the course of the 20th century.<ref name=\"LeighBonin\">{{Cite journal | last = Leigh | first = Mary H. |author2=Bonin, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se M. | title = The Pioneering Role Of Madame Alice Milliat and the FSFI in Establishing International Trade and Field Competition for Women  | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 72\u201383 | publisher = North American Society for Sport History | year = 1977 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1977/JSH0401/jsh0401f.pdf | accessdate = 3 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Audience ==\nSince the establishment of the Olympics, most serial multi-sport events have been organized for specific audiences and participating countries or communities.
