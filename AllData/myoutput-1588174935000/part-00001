He said that the project had been developed by him and his team at [[BMW]]'s Prague works until April 1945, when he fled [[Czechoslovakia]].

Klein identified two types of supposed German flying disks:\n\n* A non-rotating disk developed at [[Breslau]] by [[V-2 rocket]] engineer Richard Miethe, which was captured by the Soviets, while Miethe fled to the US via France, and ended up working for Avro.\n* A disk developed by Rudolf Schriever and Klaus Habermohl at Prague, which consisted of a ring of moving turbine blades around a fixed cockpit.

Fedden (who was also chief of the technical mission to Germany for the Ministry of Aircraft Production) stated in 1945: {{quote|I have seen enough of their designs and production plans to realize that if they (the Germans) had managed to prolong the war some months longer, we would have been confronted with a set of entirely new and deadly developments in air warfare.<ref>[http://www.burlingtonnews.net/hitlersufo.html Hitler's UFO, Burlington UFO and Paranormal Research and Educational Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}\n\nFedden also added that the Germans were working on a number of very unusual aeronautical projects, though he did not elaborate upon his statement.<ref>{{cite book|\nlast=Gunston|\nfirst=Bill|\ntitle=By Jupiter!
