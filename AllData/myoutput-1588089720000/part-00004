He is featured in the [[Pilot (Smallville)|pilot episode]] until the [[Smallville (season 7)|season seven]] finale, and has been played continuously by [[Michael Rosenbaum]], with various actors portraying the character as a child throughout the series. The character of [[Lex Luthor]], first created for [[comic book]]s by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] in 1940 as [[Archenemy|nemesis]] of [[Superman]], was adapted to television in 2001 by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]&mdash;this is only the third time the character has been adapted to a [[live action]] television series. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the ''Smallville'' television series, none of which directly continues from or into the television episodes.\n\nIn this 2001 series, Lex Luthor is sent to Smallville, by his father [[Lionel Luthor]], to run the local LuthorCorp fertilizer plant. After driving his car off a bridge, he is saved by [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and quickly develops a new friendship with the farm boy. As the series unfolds, Lex's curiosity about Clark and all things connected to Clark ultimately destroys their friendship. Lex's relationship with his father is tension-filled from the start of the show, and eventually comes to an end when Lex murders his father in an effort to discover Clark's secret.\n\nThe ''Smallville'' incarnation of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks a fine line between good and evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses\u2014it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a [[Saturn Award]] and a [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]] for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on ''Smallville''. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the [[Finale (Smallville)|two-hour series finale]].\n\n==Role in ''Smallville''==\n[[Lex Luthor]], introduced in the [[Pilot (Smallville)|pilot]] as the son of billionaire [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), is sent to [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] by his father to run the local fertilizer plant.

Gough and Millar wanted to cast a comedian for the series, on the belief that comedians always want to \"please and be loved at the same time.\"<ref name=\"genesis\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion) pp. 8\u201317</ref> Michael Rosenbaum auditioned for Lex Luthor twice. Feeling he did not take his first audition seriously, Rosenbaum outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene, indicating all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing.<ref name=\"Mike\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.120\u2013123</ref> His audition went so well that everyone agreed he was \"the guy\".<ref name=\"genesis\"/>\n\nBefore Rosenbaum got the part, [[Martin Cummins]] auditioned for the role of Lex Luthor; Cummins would go on to play Dr. Garner, a neuro-scientist who experiments on Clark, in multiple episodes of ''Smallville'' spanning season two and three.<ref name=\"memoria com\">{{cite video|people=Al Gough, Miles Millar, Greg Beeman, Kent Horton, and Michael Rosenbaum|title=\"Memoria\" commentary|format=|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

There have been four other actors that have performed the role; Matthew Munn, [[Wayne Dalgish]], [[Lucas Grabeel]], and Connor Stanhope have all portrayed Lex Luthor as a child in various episodes throughout the series. Rosenbaum relished the opportunities he gets to show Lex's evil side, even if it is only for a few seconds in earlier seasons. Specifically, he delighted in the chance to \"go overboard\", like he did in \"Hug\" where his character pulls out a machine gun and shoots everything in sight; to the actor, this gave the audience a glimpse into who Lex was becoming.<ref name=\"MR1\"/> To portray Lex's signature bald head, Rosenbaum had to go through more than just a regular [[head shaving]]. Not only was his head shaved every day, but he had to undergo hours of make-up treatments on his head, in various color combinations, so that his natural hairline did not show up on film.<ref name=\"memoria com\"/> After seven seasons of portraying Lex Luthor on ''Smallville'', Michael Rosenbaum decided to move on with his acting career, so he departed from the show.<ref name=\"Mike gone\">{{cite news|author=Kristin Dos Santos|url=http://www.eonline.com/gossip/kristin/detail/index.jsp?uuid=a046f94b-8880-408d-afd6-ed1ea9b2fedd|title=Breaking: Michael Rosenbaum Has Left Smallville|publisher=Eonline|date=May 1, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2008}}</ref> On February 11, 2011, Michael Ausiello reported that after the back and forth speculation as to whether Rosenbaum would return to the series, the actor finally agreed to appear in the series finale.

Rosenbaum wanted the audience to see that Lex was really contemplating what his life would be like if Lionel was no longer around.<ref name=\"MR1\"/> As Rosenbaum explained the scene:\n\n{{quote|I think the thing that separates a murderer from a regular person who's sane is that one moment of decision. Murderers can make the decision to commit that act and kill, which most people probably never have to face. You or I have never been pushed that far, and in comparison to Lex's life, our lives haven't been that [[psychological trauma|traumatic]]. For that moment in the library, Lex forgot who he was. That's the way I played it, and that's the way I wanted it to come across. And it's those decisions that you make that make you realize that there's such a fine line between rational and irrational. When you're driving down the road, your day's just gone to hell, and you're really upset for a moment you just want to jerk the wheel off the road. Most people just think that for a second then let it go, but at the moment when you think it, are you really contemplating it? Would you really do that? Most people wouldn't, but when he sees his father lying there, it's one of those moments where Lex is like that driver.<ref name=\"MR1\"/>}}\n\nSeason two delved deeper into Lex's darker moments, from the time he wavers to save his father's life, to his outburst at Jonathan for what he feels is unfair treatment. These moments play into Lex's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].<ref name=\"MR2\">{{cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 2|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 1, 2005|pages=124\u2013127|isbn=1-84023-947-6}}</ref> Season three's \"Memoria\" finally explained the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Lex's infant brother, Julian. Gough explains that they had known the story of Julian Luthor back in season one, when the character was first mentioned in \"Stray\", but they wanted to find the right time to explain the situation. The creative team wanted the audience to think that Lex was responsible for Julian's death as an infant, before finally revealing that Lex was merely covering for his mother.<ref name=\"Memoria\">Simpson, Paul, pp.100-111</ref>\n\nSeason four began expanding on the series long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were planted in the second episode of the first season, it was not until season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from [[Characters of Smallville#Jason Teague|Jason Teague]] ([[Jensen Ackles]]), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer [[Darren Swimmer]] questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: \"You have to ask yourself, in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?\"<ref name=\"MR4\"/> Writer [[Todd Slavkin]] described season five as \"the darkening of Lex Luthor\". By the time \"Aqua\" came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face.<ref name=\"MR5\"/> Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of \"Lexmas\" that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In \"Lexmas\", Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always \"go for the prize\".<ref name=\"MR5\"/>\n\n===Characterization===\nOne of Lex's key characteristics is his curiosity for the unexplained. Lex's primary motive for his \"shady\" actions derives from his curiosity, specifically beginning from the moment he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche. Clark always appearing when something strange happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex's curiosity. Rosenbaum believes that Lex's only sees two options: \"For Lex, it's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work with his dad, or find out what's going on with this strong, strange fellow, Clark Kent.\"<ref name=\"MR1\"/> Another characteristic of ''Smallville'' 's Lex Luthor\u2014one that is being developed over the course of the series\u2014is his evilness. Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of.<ref name=\"MR3\"/> In the season two premiere \"Vortex\", Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close-up of him after he shoots Nixon, in an effort to open a window into Lex's darker side. Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience. As Beeman explains Rosenbaum's thoughts, \"... either Lex is horrified and appalled, or he liked it, and it felt good to him\".<ref name=\"Vortex\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion) pp.14\u201317</ref> According to Rosenbaum, when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind, and \"really flips out\", that is the point where the \"world needs to hide\".<ref name=\"MR3\">{{cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 3|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 1, 2005|pages=120\u2013123|isbn=1-84023-952-2}}</ref> Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti-hero, but also, given that the audience familiar with Lex's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman's greatest enemy, make ''Smallville'''s Lex Luthor a \"tragic figure [of] almost Shakespearean grandeur\".<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nTaking a page out of [[Chazz Palminteri]]'s ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk for the season six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that she is going to leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the audience. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.<ref name=\"MR6\"/>\n\n{{quote box\n|style=background:#c6dbf7;width:35em;max-width:40%;\n|quote= \n'''Lex:''' Do you think I'd look better with hair?\n\n'''Lana:''' I don't know.

Clark has nice hair.\n|source= \u2014Writer Steven DeKnight describes this exchange of dialogue, from season five's \"Lockdown\", as providing an insight into Lex's feelings of inadequacy and envy of Clark.<ref name=\"KK5\"/>}}\n\nAs the seasons progressed, and the character began to grow darker and more sinister, Rosenbaum sought more opportunities to bring humor to the scene, either with physical subtleties like little smiles at key moments, or \"self-deprecating humor\". One such instance, which became popular with audiences, was in the season six episode \"Justice\", where Lex made a joke about wanting a ponytail. The producers were concerned over the piece of dialogue, but Rosenbaum convinced them that he could pull it off. To Rosenbaum, this quip by Lex makes him more credible as a person, because it is well known that Lex always wanted hair.<ref name=\"MR6\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 6|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 2008|pages=120\u2013123|location=London|isbn=978-1-84576-656-6}}</ref> This moment reflects an earlier episode, where Lex reveals his feelings of meagerness when comparing himself to Clark. In season five's \"Lockdown\", Lex provides a window into his thoughts about his place in Smallville. As writer [[Steven S. DeKnight]] describes it, the audience gets to see a moment where Lex shows how he still feels like an outsider, and that he views Clark as this \"perfect person\". DeKnight believes that, from how Clark sees it, Lex is driven by his desire to attain everything that Clark has, like his family and girlfriend.<ref name=\"MR5\"/>\n\nLex also develops a craving for power, with that hunger expanding in season five. Al Gough believes that Lex's political motivations are based on his lust for power. Rosenbaum echoes that opinion, believing that Lex can never get enough; \"Lex is an insatiable character\". Rosenbaum believes that nothing will satisfy Lex's hunger, and that he will keep going until he is president of the United States. Even then, he will keep trying to make the majority of people like and believe in him.<ref name=\"MR5\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 5|publisher=Titan Books|date=November 2007|pages=120\u2013123|isbn=978-1-84576-542-2}}</ref>\n\nVisually, the character of Lex Luthor has his own characteristics. In ''Smallville'', Lex is usually given a \"glass, steel [colored] background\", and dressed in a lot of black, grey, and \"cool tones\" like purples and blues.<ref name=\"memoria com\"/>\n\n===Relationships===\nRosenbaum realizes that the friendship between Lex and Clark is destined to fail, but that Clark's friendship truly is important to Lex early in the series.<ref name=\"MR1\"/> The actor also believes that if Clark could see the darkness that Lex is constantly fighting then he would understand more of Lex's actions.<ref name=\"MR4\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 4|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 4, 2007|pages=120\u2013123|isbn=978-1-84023-957-7}}</ref> Reviewer Brian Byun expressed that the choice to explore the friendship between Clark and Lex, before they become sworn enemies, which was something that had been used in the past but never to the depth of what ''Smallville'' is doing, helped keep the show from becoming \"''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' with superpowers\".<ref name=\"Byun\">{{cite news|author=Brian Byun |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |title=Smallville season 1 review |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=November 24, 2003 |accessdate=September 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704144317/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nLike Lana, who held emptiness inside her after the loss of her parents, which she tried to fill with the men in her life, Lex attempts to fill his own void, over the loss of his mother, with the women in his life. According to writer Holly Harold, Lex \"needs and wants to be loved\".<ref name=\"MR5\"/> Rosenbaum agrees, and feels that Lex is searching for that \"unconditional love\". The actor likens this feeling to one that everyone can relate to, but that Lex fails to achieve with not only the women he develops relationships with, but also with his own father. Rosenbaum and [[Annette O'Toole]] ([[Characters of Smallville#Martha Kent|Martha Kent]]) agree that the only person that could give Lex that love is his mother, who died when he was a child. Whenever they have scenes together, O'Toole and Rosenbaum try and hint around the idea that Martha wants to provide that love for Lex, because she recognizes that he needs it, and that Lex really wants her to provide it as well.<ref name=\"MR1\"/>\n\nAfter various failed relationships, Lex finally believes he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In \"Hypnotic\", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer [[Darren Swimmer]] explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons.<ref name=\"KK5\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp.116-119</ref> Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on\u2014he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was \"tired of the boy and wanted a man around\". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship \"turned into much more\". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because \"she knows she will never really love him.\" Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in \"Void\", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of \"Lexmas\", then Lana would have been able to truly love him.<ref name=\"KK5\"/>\n\nAs Rosenbaum describes it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming girl with a little na\u00efvet\u00e9. It is this na\u00efvet\u00e9 that allows Lex to believe that he can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex.<ref name=\"MR5\"/> Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 138</ref> In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem lies in the fact that every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past.<ref name=\"MR6\"/> Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.<ref name=\"MR6\"/>\n\nIt is not just the women in his life that Lex has a difficult time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over. For Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will no longer be able to come back from.<ref name=\"MR3\"/> In \"Vortex\", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was\u2014evil.<ref name=\"MR2\"/> As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the \"monster\" that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma\u2014he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not\u2014and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions\u2014using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.<ref name=\"MR3\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nMichael Rosenbaum was nominated multiple times for the [[Saturn Award]] category of [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television|Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series]] for his performance as Lex Luthor.

He is featured in the [[Pilot (Smallville)|pilot episode]] until the [[Smallville (season 7)|season seven]] finale, and has been played continuously by [[Michael Rosenbaum]], with various actors portraying the character as a child throughout the series. The character of [[Lex Luthor]], first created for [[comic book]]s by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] in 1940 as [[Archenemy|nemesis]] of [[Superman]], was adapted to television in 2001 by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]&mdash;this is only the third time the character has been adapted to a [[live action]] television series. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the ''Smallville'' television series, none of which directly continues from or into the television episodes.\n\nIn this 2001 series, Lex Luthor is sent to Smallville, by his father [[Lionel Luthor]], to run the local LuthorCorp fertilizer plant. After driving his car off a bridge, he is saved by [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and quickly develops a new friendship with the farm boy. As the series unfolds, Lex's curiosity about Clark and all things connected to Clark ultimately destroys their friendship. Lex's relationship with his father is tension-filled from the start of the show, and eventually comes to an end when Lex murders his father in an effort to discover Clark's secret.\n\nThe ''Smallville'' incarnation of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks a fine line between good and evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses\u2014it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a [[Saturn Award]] and a [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]] for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on ''Smallville''. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the [[Finale (Smallville)|two-hour series finale]].\n\n==Role in ''Smallville''==\n[[Lex Luthor]], introduced in the [[Pilot (Smallville)|pilot]] as the son of billionaire [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), is sent to [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] by his father to run the local fertilizer plant.

Gough and Millar wanted to cast a comedian for the series, on the belief that comedians always want to \"please and be loved at the same time.\"<ref name=\"genesis\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion) pp. 8\u201317</ref> Michael Rosenbaum auditioned for Lex Luthor twice. Feeling he did not take his first audition seriously, Rosenbaum outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene, indicating all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing.<ref name=\"Mike\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.120\u2013123</ref> His audition went so well that everyone agreed he was \"the guy\".<ref name=\"genesis\"/>\n\nBefore Rosenbaum got the part, [[Martin Cummins]] auditioned for the role of Lex Luthor; Cummins would go on to play Dr. Garner, a neuro-scientist who experiments on Clark, in multiple episodes of ''Smallville'' spanning season two and three.<ref name=\"memoria com\">{{cite video|people=Al Gough, Miles Millar, Greg Beeman, Kent Horton, and Michael Rosenbaum|title=\"Memoria\" commentary|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

There have been four other actors that have performed the role; Matthew Munn, [[Wayne Dalgish]], [[Lucas Grabeel]], and Connor Stanhope have all portrayed Lex Luthor as a child in various episodes throughout the series. Rosenbaum relished the opportunities he gets to show Lex's evil side, even if it is only for a few seconds in earlier seasons. Specifically, he delighted in the chance to \"go overboard\", like he did in \"Hug\" where his character pulls out a machine gun and shoots everything in sight; to the actor, this gave the audience a glimpse into who Lex was becoming.<ref name=\"MR1\"/> To portray Lex's signature bald head, Rosenbaum had to go through more than just a regular [[head shaving]]. Not only was his head shaved every day, but he had to undergo hours of make-up treatments on his head, in various color combinations, so that his natural hairline did not show up on film.<ref name=\"memoria com\"/> After seven seasons of portraying Lex Luthor on ''Smallville'', Michael Rosenbaum decided to move on with his acting career, so he departed from the show.<ref name=\"Mike gone\">{{cite news|author=Kristin Dos Santos|url=http://www.eonline.com/gossip/kristin/detail/index.jsp?uuid=a046f94b-8880-408d-afd6-ed1ea9b2fedd|title=Breaking: Michael Rosenbaum Has Left Smallville|publisher=Eonline|date=May 1, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2008}}</ref> On February 11, 2011, Michael Ausiello reported that after the back and forth speculation as to whether Rosenbaum would return to the series, the actor finally agreed to appear in the series finale.

Rosenbaum wanted the audience to see that Lex was really contemplating what his life would be like if Lionel was no longer around.<ref name=\"MR1\"/> As Rosenbaum explained the scene:\n\n{{quote|I think the thing that separates a murderer from a regular person who's sane is that one moment of decision. Murderers can make the decision to commit that act and kill, which most people probably never have to face. You or I have never been pushed that far, and in comparison to Lex's life, our lives haven't been that [[psychological trauma|traumatic]]. For that moment in the library, Lex forgot who he was. That's the way I played it, and that's the way I wanted it to come across. And it's those decisions that you make that make you realize that there's such a fine line between rational and irrational. When you're driving down the road, your day's just gone to hell, and you're really upset for a moment you just want to jerk the wheel off the road. Most people just think that for a second then let it go, but at the moment when you think it, are you really contemplating it? Would you really do that? Most people wouldn't, but when he sees his father lying there, it's one of those moments where Lex is like that driver.<ref name=\"MR1\"/>}}\n\nSeason two delved deeper into Lex's darker moments, from the time he wavers to save his father's life, to his outburst at Jonathan for what he feels is unfair treatment. These moments play into Lex's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].<ref name=\"MR2\">{{cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 2|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 1, 2005|pages=124\u2013127|isbn=1-84023-947-6}}</ref> Season three's \"Memoria\" finally explained the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Lex's infant brother, Julian. Gough explains that they had known the story of Julian Luthor back in season one, when the character was first mentioned in \"Stray\", but they wanted to find the right time to explain the situation. The creative team wanted the audience to think that Lex was responsible for Julian's death as an infant, before finally revealing that Lex was merely covering for his mother.<ref name=\"Memoria\">Simpson, Paul, pp.100-111</ref>\n\nSeason four began expanding on the series long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were planted in the second episode of the first season, it was not until season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from [[Characters of Smallville#Jason Teague|Jason Teague]] ([[Jensen Ackles]]), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer [[Darren Swimmer]] questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: \"You have to ask yourself, in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?\"<ref name=\"MR4\"/> Writer [[Todd Slavkin]] described season five as \"the darkening of Lex Luthor\". By the time \"Aqua\" came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face.<ref name=\"MR5\"/> Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of \"Lexmas\" that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In \"Lexmas\", Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always \"go for the prize\".<ref name=\"MR5\"/>\n\n===Characterization===\nOne of Lex's key characteristics is his curiosity for the unexplained. Lex's primary motive for his \"shady\" actions derives from his curiosity, specifically beginning from the moment he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche. Clark always appearing when something strange happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex's curiosity. Rosenbaum believes that Lex's only sees two options: \"For Lex, it's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work with his dad, or find out what's going on with this strong, strange fellow, Clark Kent.\"<ref name=\"MR1\"/> Another characteristic of ''Smallville'' 's Lex Luthor\u2014one that is being developed over the course of the series\u2014is his evilness. Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of.<ref name=\"MR3\"/> In the season two premiere \"Vortex\", Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close-up of him after he shoots Nixon, in an effort to open a window into Lex's darker side. Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience. As Beeman explains Rosenbaum's thoughts, \"... either Lex is horrified and appalled, or he liked it, and it felt good to him\".<ref name=\"Vortex\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion) pp.14\u201317</ref> According to Rosenbaum, when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind, and \"really flips out\", that is the point where the \"world needs to hide\".<ref name=\"MR3\">{{cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 3|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 1, 2005|pages=120\u2013123|isbn=1-84023-952-2}}</ref> Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti-hero, but also, given that the audience familiar with Lex's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman's greatest enemy, make ''Smallville'''s Lex Luthor a \"tragic figure [of] almost Shakespearean grandeur\".<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nTaking a page out of [[Chazz Palminteri]]'s ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk for the season six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that she is going to leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the audience. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.<ref name=\"MR6\"/>\n\n{{quote box\n|style=background:#c6dbf7;width:35em;max-width:40%;\n|quote= \n'''Lex:''' Do you think I'd look better with hair?\n\n'''Lana:''' I don't know.

Clark has nice hair.\n|source= \u2014Writer Steven DeKnight describes this exchange of dialogue, from season five's \"Lockdown\", as providing an insight into Lex's feelings of inadequacy and envy of Clark.<ref name=\"KK5\"/>}}\n\nAs the seasons progressed, and the character began to grow darker and more sinister, Rosenbaum sought more opportunities to bring humor to the scene, either with physical subtleties like little smiles at key moments, or \"self-deprecating humor\". One such instance, which became popular with audiences, was in the season six episode \"Justice\", where Lex made a joke about wanting a ponytail. The producers were concerned over the piece of dialogue, but Rosenbaum convinced them that he could pull it off. To Rosenbaum, this quip by Lex makes him more credible as a person, because it is well known that Lex always wanted hair.<ref name=\"MR6\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 6|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 2008|pages=120\u2013123|location=London|isbn=978-1-84576-656-6}}</ref> This moment reflects an earlier episode, where Lex reveals his feelings of meagerness when comparing himself to Clark. In season five's \"Lockdown\", Lex provides a window into his thoughts about his place in Smallville. As writer [[Steven S. DeKnight]] describes it, the audience gets to see a moment where Lex shows how he still feels like an outsider, and that he views Clark as this \"perfect person\". DeKnight believes that, from how Clark sees it, Lex is driven by his desire to attain everything that Clark has, like his family and girlfriend.<ref name=\"MR5\"/>\n\nLex also develops a craving for power, with that hunger expanding in season five. Al Gough believes that Lex's political motivations are based on his lust for power. Rosenbaum echoes that opinion, believing that Lex can never get enough; \"Lex is an insatiable character\". Rosenbaum believes that nothing will satisfy Lex's hunger, and that he will keep going until he is president of the United States. Even then, he will keep trying to make the majority of people like and believe in him.<ref name=\"MR5\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 5|publisher=Titan Books|date=November 2007|pages=120\u2013123|isbn=978-1-84576-542-2}}</ref>\n\nVisually, the character of Lex Luthor has his own characteristics. In ''Smallville'', Lex is usually given a \"glass, steel [colored] background\", and dressed in a lot of black, grey, and \"cool tones\" like purples and blues.<ref name=\"memoria com\"/>\n\n===Relationships===\nRosenbaum realizes that the friendship between Lex and Clark is destined to fail, but that Clark's friendship truly is important to Lex early in the series.<ref name=\"MR1\"/> The actor also believes that if Clark could see the darkness that Lex is constantly fighting then he would understand more of Lex's actions.<ref name=\"MR4\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 4|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 4, 2007|pages=120\u2013123|isbn=978-1-84023-957-7}}</ref> Reviewer Brian Byun expressed that the choice to explore the friendship between Clark and Lex, before they become sworn enemies, which was something that had been used in the past but never to the depth of what ''Smallville'' is doing, helped keep the show from becoming \"''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' with superpowers\".<ref name=\"Byun\">{{cite news|author=Brian Byun |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |title=Smallville season 1 review |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=November 24, 2003 |accessdate=September 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704144317/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nLike Lana, who held emptiness inside her after the loss of her parents, which she tried to fill with the men in her life, Lex attempts to fill his own void, over the loss of his mother, with the women in his life. According to writer Holly Harold, Lex \"needs and wants to be loved\".<ref name=\"MR5\"/> Rosenbaum agrees, and feels that Lex is searching for that \"unconditional love\". The actor likens this feeling to one that everyone can relate to, but that Lex fails to achieve with not only the women he develops relationships with, but also with his own father. Rosenbaum and [[Annette O'Toole]] ([[Characters of Smallville#Martha Kent|Martha Kent]]) agree that the only person that could give Lex that love is his mother, who died when he was a child. Whenever they have scenes together, O'Toole and Rosenbaum try and hint around the idea that Martha wants to provide that love for Lex, because she recognizes that he needs it, and that Lex really wants her to provide it as well.<ref name=\"MR1\"/>\n\nAfter various failed relationships, Lex finally believes he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In \"Hypnotic\", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer [[Darren Swimmer]] explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons.<ref name=\"KK5\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp.116-119</ref> Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on\u2014he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was \"tired of the boy and wanted a man around\". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship \"turned into much more\". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because \"she knows she will never really love him.\" Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in \"Void\", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of \"Lexmas\", then Lana would have been able to truly love him.<ref name=\"KK5\"/>\n\nAs Rosenbaum describes it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming girl with a little na\u00efvet\u00e9. It is this na\u00efvet\u00e9 that allows Lex to believe that he can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex.<ref name=\"MR5\"/> Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 138</ref> In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem lies in the fact that every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past.<ref name=\"MR6\"/> Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.<ref name=\"MR6\"/>\n\nIt is not just the women in his life that Lex has a difficult time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over. For Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will no longer be able to come back from.<ref name=\"MR3\"/> In \"Vortex\", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was\u2014evil.<ref name=\"MR2\"/> As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the \"monster\" that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma\u2014he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not\u2014and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions\u2014using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.<ref name=\"MR3\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nMichael Rosenbaum was nominated multiple times for the [[Saturn Award]] category of [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television|Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series]] for his performance as Lex Luthor.
