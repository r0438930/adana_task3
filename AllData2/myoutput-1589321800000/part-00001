The flavoring is usually in a separate packet, although in the case of [[cup noodle]], the flavoring is often loose in the cup. Some instant noodle products are seal packed; these can be reheated or eaten straight from the packet/container. Dried noodle blocks are designed to be cooked or soaked in boiling water before eating but can be consumed dry.\n\nThe main ingredients used in dried noodles are usually [[wheat flour]], [[palm oil]], and salt. Common ingredients in the flavoring powder are [[salt]], [[monosodium glutamate]], seasoning, and [[sugar]]. The dried noodle block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still the main method used in Asian countries, but air-dried noodle blocks are favored in Western countries.\n\nInstant noodles were invented by [[Momofuku Ando]] of [[Nissin Foods]] in Japan.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6237013.stm \"Inventor of instant noodles dies\"] [[BBC News]]. 6 January 2007</ref> They were launched in 1958 under the brand name [[Chikin Ramen]]. In 1971, Nissin introduced [[Cup Noodles]], the first [[cup noodle]] product. Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under [[List of instant noodle brands|many brand names]].\n\n[[Ramen]], a Japanese [[noodle soup]], is sometimes used as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese instant noodle manufacturers. It has become synonymous in America for all instant noodle products.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=y0xVkgXZOfUC&pg=PA137#v=onepage|page=137|title=Culture and Customs of Indonesia|first = Jill | last = Forshee | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-313-33339-2}}</ref>\n\nDue to the versatility of instant noodles, it can be used as an alternative to typical long noodles such as spaghetti. It is used to make dishes such as ramen carbonara, [[Budae-jjigae|Korean army stew]], and even [[chow mein]].\n\n==History==\nInstant noodles were created by the Taiwanese-Japanese inventor [[Momofuku Ando]] in Japan. It was first marketed on 25 August 1958 by Ando's company, [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]], under the brand name [[Chikin Ramen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_instant_noodle |title=The Eternal Life of the Instant Noodle|publisher=BBC|date= 28 September 2018|accessdate=10 March 2020|author=Celia Hatton}}</ref> Ando developed the entire production method of flash frying noodles from processes of noodle-making, steaming, seasoning, to dehydrating in oil heat, creating the \"instant\" noodle. This dried the noodles and gave them a longer shelf life, even exceeding that of [[frozen noodles]]. Each noodle block was pre-seasoned and sold for 35 yen. The instant noodle became ready to eat just in two minutes by adding boiling water. Due to its price and novelty, Chikin Ramen was considered a luxury item initially, as Japanese grocery stores typically sold fresh noodles for one-sixth their price.<ref>{{cite news | last=Beech| first=Hannah| title=Momofuku Ando|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1554981,00.html| work=Time| date=13 November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nissin Foods \u2013 About Us |url=http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024113621/http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |archivedate=24 October 2007 |date=2018-11-22 }}</ref> Despite this, instant noodles eventually gained immense popularity, especially after being promoted by [[Mitsubishi Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Inventor of the Week Archive: Momofuku Ando|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/ando.html| publisher=MIT}}</ref> Initially gaining popularity across [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], where they are now firmly embedded within the local cultures of those regions, instant noodles eventually spread to and gained popularity across most other parts of the world.<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/3790-instant-noodles-will-either-save-the-world-or-ruin-it |title=Instant Noodles Will Either Save the World or Ruin It|last=Burmon|first= Andrew |date=11 June 2015 |publisher=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2016/01/25/embrace-instant-noodle |title=Embrace the instant noodle\n|last=Bartholomeusz|first= Rachel |date=11 May 2016 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nWith better quality concern, manufacturers further improved the taste of instant noodles by adding flavoring powder in a separate packet. In 1971, Nissin introduced [[Nissin Cup Noodles]], a [[cup noodle]] to which boiling water is added to cook the noodles. A further innovation added dried vegetables to the cup, creating a complete instant soup dish. It combined the functions of packaging material, cooker when boiling water, and a bowl when eating noodles.

For instant noodles, flours which have 8.5-12.5% protein are optimal because noodles must be able to withstand the drying process without breaking apart, which requires a higher amount of protein in flour, and during frying, high protein content can help decrease the fat uptake.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Gluten]], which is made up of glutenin and gliadin, is the most important wheat protein that forms the continuous viscoelastic dough of noodles. The development of gluten structures and the networking between gluten and starches during [[kneading]] is very important to the elasticity and continuity of the dough.\n\n=== Water ===\nWater is the second most important raw material for making noodles after flour. The hydration of dough determines the development of gluten structure, which affects the viscoelastic properties of dough. The water absorption level for making noodles is about 30% - 38% of flour weight; if the water absorption level is too high, hydration of flour can not be completed, and if the water absorption level is too low, the dough will be too sticky to handle during processing.<ref name=\":0\" /> For instant noodles, dehydration is an important step after noodles are made because water can offer a hospitable environment for microorganisms. Depending on dehydration methods, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has regulation on moisture content of instant noodles: for instant noodles dehydrated by frying, moisture content cannot exceed 8%, and for those dehydrated by methods other than frying, moisture content cannot exceed 14.5%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Salt ===\nSalt is added when making the flour dough to strengthen gluten structures and enhance the sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the off-flavor generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is to slow down the activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures and microbial growth. Alkaline salt, such as sodium and potassium carbonates, could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because [[flavonoid]] pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese [[ramen]], this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content.<ref name=\":0\" /> One pack of ramen contains well over half the daily recommended amount of sodium.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/ramen-facts-you-did-not-know|title=7 Fast Facts About Instant Ramen|date=2015-04-02|work=Spoon University|accessdate=2017-11-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Kansui ===\nKansui, an alkaline solution consisting usually of a 9:1 ratio of sodium carbonate to potassium carbonate, is added to the flour and water when making ramen to help develop several of its unique characteristics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Asian noodles : science, technology, and processing|others=Hou, Gary G.|isbn=9780470179222|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=907642187|last1=Hou|first1=Gary G.|date=26 October 2010}}</ref> The addition of kansui aids in the gluten development of the noodle as well as promotion of gelatinization of starches, both of which contribute to the springiness and chewiness characteristic of ramen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Man|last2=Sun|first2=Qing-Jie|last3=Han|first3=Chuan-Wu|last4=Chen|first4=Hai-Hua|last5=Tang|first5=Wen-Ting|title=Comparative study of the quality characteristics of fresh noodles with regular salt and alkali and the underlying mechanisms|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=246|pages=335\u2013342|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.020|pmid=29291858|year=2018}}</ref> Additionally, the addition of kansui enhances the yellow color of ramen noodles by bringing about [[Chromophore|chromophoric]] shift of several compounds called [[flavonoid]]s that are native to wheat flour.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Oil ===\n[[Frying]] is a common dehydration process for producing instant noodles. Therefore, oil becomes an important component of instant noodles. According to USDA regulation, oil-fried instant noodles should not have fat content higher than 20% of total weight, which means theoretically, the amount of oil uptake during frying process could go even higher. [[Palm oil]] is always chosen as the frying oil for instant noodles due to its heat stability and low cost. However, overall, due to the high-fat content and low moisture content, instant noodles are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation, and relatively high amount of preservatives are added. Hence, to avoid the generation of off-flavours and health-risking compounds, some instant noodles were dehydrated by ways other than frying to reduce the fat content. According to USDA, un-fried instant noodles should have fat content lower than 3%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Starches ===\nPotato starches are commonly added in instant noodles to enhance gelling properties and water-holding capacities of noodles. Gelling properties could enhance the elasticity and chewiness of instant noodles, and water holding capacities could improve the smooth and shiny look of noodles after cooking and shorten the cooking time.\n\n=== Polyphosphates ===\n[[Polyphosphate]] is used in instant noodles as additive to improve [[starch gelatinization]] during cooking (rehydration) to allow more water retention in the noodles. Normally 0.1% of flour weight phosphate compounds are added to water before mixing and making the dough.\n\n=== Hydrocolloids ===\nHydrocolloids such as guar gum are widely used in instant noodles production to enhance water binding capacity during rehydration and shorten the cooking time. Gums are dispersed in water before mixing and making noodles dough.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Gulia|first=Neelam|last2=Dhaka|first2=Vandana|last3=Khatkar|first3=B.

There are variations to the ingredients used depending on the country of origin in terms of the salt content and the flour content.\n\nNoodle production starts with dissolving the salt, starch, and flavoring in water to form a mixture which is then added to the flour. The dough is then left for a period of time to mature, then for even distribution of the ingredients and hydration of the particles in the dough, it is kneaded. After it is kneaded, the dough gets made into two sheets compounded into one single noodle belt by being put through two rotating rollers. This process is repeated to develop [[gluten]] more easily as the sheet is folded and passed through the rollers several times. This will create the stringy and chewy texture found in instant noodles. When the noodle belt is made to the desired thickness by adjusting the gap in the rolls, it is then cut right away. Wavy noodles are made in a slow-paced conveyor belt and are hindered by metal weights when coming out of the slitter which gives the noodle its wavy appearance. If the strands are to be molded into other shapes, liquid seasoning could be added as well. Once the noodles are shaped, they are ready to be steamed for 1\u20135 minutes at {{convert|100|C}} to improve its texture by [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinizing]] the starch of the noodles. When steaming, the addition of water and heat breaks up the helix structure and crystallinity of amylose. Amylose begins to diffuse out of the starch granule and forms a gel matrix around the granule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xteiARU46SQC&dq=food+chemistry+book|title=Food Chemistry|last=Belitz|first=H.-D.|last2=Grosch|first2=Werner|last3=Schieberle|first3=Peter|date=2009-01-15|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783540699330|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Drying ===\nNext, noodles can be dried in one of two ways: by frying or by hot air drying. Fried instant noodles are dried by oil frying for 1\u20132 minutes at a temperature of {{convert|140|\u2013|160|C}}. The frying process decreases the moisture content from 30\u201350% to 2\u20135%. Common oils used for frying in North America consist of [[Canola oil|canola]], [[Cottonseed oil|cottonseed]] and palm oil mixtures, while only palm oil or palm olein are used in Asia. Air-dried noodles are dried for 30\u201340 minutes in hot air at a temperature of {{convert|70|\u2013|90|C}}, resulting in a moisture content of 8\u201312%. During the drying process, the rapid evaporation of water creates pores throughout the food matrix, which allows for short cooking times in the finished product. In the case of fried noodles, the creation of pores is directly related to the uptake of fat into the noodles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellema|first=M.|title=Mechanism and reduction of fat uptake in deep-fat fried foods|journal=Trends in Food Science & Technology|volume=14|issue=9|pages=364\u2013373|doi=10.1016/s0924-2244(03)00050-5|year=2003}}</ref> More than 80% of instant noodles are fried as it gives more evenly dried noodles than hot air drying which can cause an undesired texture in finished noodles, and also taking longer time to cook. However, with fried noodles, the oil content is about 15\u201320% and decreases the shelf life of the noodles due to oxidation whereas in hot air-dried noodles it has only 3% oil content maximum.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Packaging ===\nBefore packaging with seasoning, the noodles are cooled after drying, and their quality of moisture, color, and shape are checked. Packaging of the noodles include films impermeable to air and water. There are two forms of packaged instant noodles, one in a bag with the provided seasoning in small sachets inside, or [[Cup noodle|in a cup]] with seasoning on the top of the noodles. There are a variety of flavors to the noodles depending on which ones are added to the seasoning. Such flavors include beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, oriental, etc. In [[Cup noodle|instant noodle cups]], soy protein and dehydrated vegetables and meats are often added for further flavor.\n\nThe shelf life of instant noodles ranges from 4\u201312 months, depending on environmental factors. Their stability comes from the high sodium content with low moisture, and low water activity. Instant noodles can be served after 1\u20132 minutes in boiled water or soaked in hot water for 3\u20134 minutes.<ref>USAID. ''Fortification Basis.

After mixing, kneading, compounding, and rolling, a continuous viscous noodle dough sheet is made and cut by roll slitters. The conveyor belt which transports the noodle dough sheet moves slower than the rotation speed of the blades on the slitters; therefore, the sheet could be pressed multiple times up and down to produce the unique wavy form of instant noodles. After slitting, the sheets undergo steaming and frying, which triggers starch gelatinization to increase the water retention during cooking in boiling water to shorten the cooking time of the noodles.\n\n=== Elasticity ===\nAlthough dry instant noodles may not appear elastic, cooked instant noodles generally have higher elasticity than other types of noodles when they are cooked, and the unique wavy form also differentiates instant noodles from other common noodles like udon or flat noodles. The wavy form of instant noodles sometimes creates random spirals after noodles are cooked, giving the noodle strands spring-like qualities. The wavy form of the noodles is created when noodle dough sheets are being cut by rotation slitters. As mentioned above, due to the difference between the velocities of the conveyor belt and blade rotation, noodle dough sheets could be pressed by blades multiple times within a certain area, creating the unique wavy form of instant noodles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Binxiao|year=2007|title=Asian noodles: History, classification, raw materials, and processing|url=|journal=Food Research International|volume=41|issue=9|pages=888\u2013902|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2007.11.007}}</ref> During pressing by the heavy blades, the continuous gluten structure is ruptured at certain points and does not return to its original shape, but the remaining gluten structures are strong enough to keep it hanging; therefore, wavy noodle strands are formed and maintained during processing. Other than the physical springiness, the selection of ingredients also ensures the high elasticity of instant noodles. Instant noodles require wheat flour with high protein content to ensure noodle strands are broken during processing,<ref name=\":0\" /> resulting in more viscoelastic noodle dough and thus more elastic noodles. Furthermore, [[potato starch]], a key ingredient in instant noodles, has the important characteristics of low gelatinization temperature, high viscosity, and rapid swelling.<ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, the addition of starch could further increase the elasticity of noodles. High salt content in instant noodles also increases the elasticity of noodle strands, as its dissolved ions strengthen the interaction between gluten structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rombouts|first=Ine|last2=Jansens|first2=Koen J.A.|last3=Lagrain|first3=Bert|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|last5=Zhu|first5=Ke-Xue|title=The impact of salt and alkali on gluten polymerization and quality of fresh wheat noodles|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=60|issue=3|pages=507\u2013513|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2014.09.003|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Short cooking time ===\nThe initial purpose of inventing instant noodles was to shorten the cooking time of conventional noodles. Therefore, a short cooking time could be regarded as the most decisive characteristic of instant noodles. Instant noodles are cooked in boiled water; therefore, enhancing water retention is the major method to shorten cooking time.\n\n[[Starch gelatinization]] is the most important feature in instant noodles that can enhance water retention during cooking. Two key steps in instant noodle processing serve the function to trigger starch gelatinization, which are steaming and oil-frying. Starch gelatinization occurs when starch granules swell in water with heat, [[amylose]]s leak out of starch granules, which could bind to water and increase the viscosity of gluten matrix. Steaming offers an optimal condition for the gelatinization of potato starches. After steaming, rapid oil-frying vaporize the free water, and gelatinization continues until all the free water is dehydrated. During frying, water in noodle strands migrates from central region outwards to replace the surface water that is dehydrated during frying. Therefore, a porous sponge structure in the noodle is created due to vaporization. During the migration of water, it carries thermal energy from oil to the surroundings and bound water to offer the heat for finishing starch gelatinization. Furthermore, the heat transfer during evaporation protects instant noodles from burning or being overcooked during frying.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, as a common additive, [[guar gum]] can not only increase the elasticity and viscosity of noodles to enhance the mouthfeel, it can also increase the water binding ability of noodles when cooking in boiling water. Hydrocolloids could bind large amounts of water; the more water they bind, the faster heat will transfer to the center of noodles.\n\n== Health and safety concerns ==\n===Nutritional value===\n[[File:Indomie Mie Goreng Iga Penyet 2.JPG|thumb|A serving of [[Indomie]] [[iga penyet]], with [[fried egg]] and vegetables.

Despite being called \"Chinese soup\", the first brands on the market were produced in Vietnam and had a somewhat spicy, garlic-flavored taste. The noodle packages contained pouches of flavored soup base, spicy oil, dried vegetables or even minuscule shrimps.\n\nThe product gained particular popularity among students due to its affordability and convenience. \"Kaczka \u0142agodna\" (''Mild duck''), \"Kurczakowa \u0142agodna\" (''Mild chicken'') and \"Krewetkowa ostra\" (''Spicy shrimp'') were the most common flavors. Today, the local Kim Lan and worldwide [[Knorr (brand)|Knorr]] brands offer varieties ranging from cheese-and-herb flavored noodles to local Polish specialties like [[barszcz czerwony]] or [[\u017curek]].\n\nNgoc Tu Tao, who emigrated to [[Poland]] from [[Vietnam]] and established the Tan-Viet Group in 1990, is credited with introducing the instant noodle to Poland. His VIFON brand holds a 35% share of the Polish instant soup market, selling over 100 million packages a year.

The typical method of cooking is by adding boiled water, but Thais typically add meat, pork, chicken or egg to spice up the instant noodles. Sometimes they will cook the noodles and combine the noodles in a dish called a noodle salad known as \"yum Mama\". This dish is often prepared with meat balls, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. Another method is to [[stir fry]] the cooked noodles with pork, chicken, eggs, and vegetables to give the noodles extra flavor. They are also sometimes consumed directly as a snack without further cooking by crushing the noodles in the packet, adding seasoning powder in the packet and shaking the packet to coat the crushed dried noodles evenly with the seasoning. Instant noodle products have become successful in Thailand, because they are cheap, easy to eat, can be easily found, and offer a range of flavors. Recently some brands of instant noodles include real dehydrated meat such as pork or beef. The average retail price is about six baht for the regular size<ref name=\"ST-20160202\" /> and 10 baht for Yum Yum Jumbo packs.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFor years, sales of MAMA noodles was considered a barometer of the Thai economy, with consumption rising when times were lean. This has not been the case recently. In 2014, when the political crisis slowed Thailand's economic growth to 0.9 percent and eventually led to a military coup, the growth of MAMA noodle sales hit a low of one percent. In 2015, when the military government could not lift the country beyond an estimated 2.8 percent growth, sales of MAMA noodles only grew 0.4 percent\u2014a record low. Saha Pathanapibul's vice-president, Vathit Chokwatana, attributed the poor sales to falling commodity prices, which have weakened the purchasing power of rural people.<ref name=\"ST-20160202\" />\n\n===United Kingdom===\nA common form of instant noodles in Britain is [[Pot Noodle]], a [[cup noodle]] first marketed by [[Golden Wonder]] in the late 1970s, and acquired by [[Unilever]] in 1995.

It was first marketed on 25 August 1958 by Ando's company, [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]], under the brand name [[Chikin Ramen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_instant_noodle |title=The Eternal Life of the Instant Noodle|publisher=BBC|date= 28 September 2018|accessdate=10 March 2020|author=Celia Hatton}}</ref> Ando developed the entire production method of flash frying noodles from processes of noodle-making, steaming, seasoning, to dehydrating in oil heat, creating the \"instant\" noodle. This dried the noodles and gave them a longer shelf life, even exceeding that of [[frozen noodles]]. Each noodle block was pre-seasoned and sold for 35 yen. The instant noodle became ready to eat just in two minutes by adding boiling water. Due to its price and novelty, Chikin Ramen was considered a luxury item initially, as Japanese grocery stores typically sold fresh noodles for one-sixth their price.<ref>{{cite news | last=Beech| first=Hannah| title=Momofuku Ando|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1554981,00.html| work=Time| date=13 November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nissin Foods \u2013 About Us |url=http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024113621/http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |archivedate=24 October 2007 |date=2018-11-22 }}</ref> Despite this, instant noodles eventually gained immense popularity, especially after being promoted by [[Mitsubishi Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Inventor of the Week Archive: Momofuku Ando|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/ando.html| publisher=MIT}}</ref> Initially gaining popularity across [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], where they are now firmly embedded within the local cultures of those regions, instant noodles eventually spread to and gained popularity across most other parts of the world.<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/3790-instant-noodles-will-either-save-the-world-or-ruin-it |title=Instant Noodles Will Either Save the World or Ruin It|last=Burmon|first= Andrew |date=11 June 2015 |publisher=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2016/01/25/embrace-instant-noodle |title=Embrace the instant noodle\n|last=Bartholomeusz|first= Rachel |date=11 May 2016 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nWith better quality concern, manufacturers further improved the taste of instant noodles by adding flavoring powder in a separate packet. In 1971, Nissin introduced [[Nissin Cup Noodles]], a [[cup noodle]] to which boiling water is added to cook the noodles. A further innovation added dried vegetables to the cup, creating a complete instant soup dish. It combined the functions of packaging material, cooker when boiling water, and a bowl when eating noodles.

For instant noodles, flours which have 8.5-12.5% protein are optimal because noodles must be able to withstand the drying process without breaking apart, which requires a higher amount of protein in flour, and during frying, high protein content can help decrease the fat uptake.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Gluten]], which is made up of glutenin and gliadin, is the most important wheat protein that forms the continuous viscoelastic dough of noodles. The development of gluten structures and the networking between gluten and starches during [[kneading]] is very important to the elasticity and continuity of the dough.\n\n=== Water ===\nWater is the second most important raw material for making noodles after flour. The hydration of dough determines the development of gluten structure, which affects the viscoelastic properties of dough. The water absorption level for making noodles is about 30% - 38% of flour weight; if the water absorption level is too high, hydration of flour can not be completed, and if the water absorption level is too low, the dough will be too sticky to handle during processing.<ref name=\":0\" /> For instant noodles, dehydration is an important step after noodles are made because water can offer a hospitable environment for microorganisms. Depending on dehydration methods, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has regulation on moisture content of instant noodles: for instant noodles dehydrated by frying, moisture content cannot exceed 8%, and for those dehydrated by methods other than frying, moisture content cannot exceed 14.5%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Salt ===\nSalt is added when making the flour dough to strengthen gluten structures and enhance the sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the off-flavor generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is to slow down the activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures and microbial growth. Alkaline salt, such as sodium and potassium carbonates, could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because [[flavonoid]] pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese [[ramen]], this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content.<ref name=\":0\" /> One pack of ramen contains well over half the daily recommended amount of sodium.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/ramen-facts-you-did-not-know|title=7 Fast Facts About Instant Ramen|date=2015-04-02|work=Spoon University|accessdate=2017-11-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Kansui ===\nKansui, an alkaline solution consisting usually of a 9:1 ratio of sodium carbonate to potassium carbonate, is added to the flour and water when making ramen to help develop several of its unique characteristics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Asian noodles : science, technology, and processing|others=Hou, Gary G.|isbn=9780470179222|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=907642187|last1=Hou|first1=Gary G.|date=26 October 2010}}</ref> The addition of kansui aids in the gluten development of the noodle as well as promotion of gelatinization of starches, both of which contribute to the springiness and chewiness characteristic of ramen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Man|last2=Sun|first2=Qing-Jie|last3=Han|first3=Chuan-Wu|last4=Chen|first4=Hai-Hua|last5=Tang|first5=Wen-Ting|title=Comparative study of the quality characteristics of fresh noodles with regular salt and alkali and the underlying mechanisms|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=246|pages=335\u2013342|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.020|pmid=29291858|year=2018}}</ref> Additionally, the addition of kansui enhances the yellow color of ramen noodles by bringing about [[Chromophore|chromophoric]] shift of several compounds called [[flavonoid]]s that are native to wheat flour.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Oil ===\n[[Frying]] is a common dehydration process for producing instant noodles. Therefore, oil becomes an important component of instant noodles. According to USDA regulation, oil-fried instant noodles should not have fat content higher than 20% of total weight, which means theoretically, the amount of oil uptake during frying process could go even higher. [[Palm oil]] is always chosen as the frying oil for instant noodles due to its heat stability and low cost. However, overall, due to the high-fat content and low moisture content, instant noodles are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation, and relatively high amount of preservatives are added. Hence, to avoid the generation of off-flavours and health-risking compounds, some instant noodles were dehydrated by ways other than frying to reduce the fat content. According to USDA, un-fried instant noodles should have fat content lower than 3%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Starches ===\nPotato starches are commonly added in instant noodles to enhance gelling properties and water-holding capacities of noodles. Gelling properties could enhance the elasticity and chewiness of instant noodles, and water holding capacities could improve the smooth and shiny look of noodles after cooking and shorten the cooking time.\n\n=== Polyphosphates ===\n[[Polyphosphate]] is used in instant noodles as additive to improve [[starch gelatinization]] during cooking (rehydration) to allow more water retention in the noodles. Normally 0.1% of flour weight phosphate compounds are added to water before mixing and making the dough.\n\n=== Hydrocolloids ===\nHydrocolloids such as guar gum are widely used in instant noodles production to enhance water binding capacity during rehydration and shorten the cooking time. Gums are dispersed in water before mixing and making noodles dough.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Gulia|first=Neelam|last2=Dhaka|first2=Vandana|last3=Khatkar|first3=B.

There are variations to the ingredients used depending on the country of origin in terms of the salt content and the flour content.\n\nNoodle production starts with dissolving the salt, starch, and flavoring in water to form a mixture which is then added to the flour. The dough is then left for a period of time to mature, then for even distribution of the ingredients and hydration of the particles in the dough, it is kneaded. After it is kneaded, the dough gets made into two sheets compounded into one single noodle belt by being put through two rotating rollers. This process is repeated to develop [[gluten]] more easily as the sheet is folded and passed through the rollers several times. This will create the stringy and chewy texture found in instant noodles. When the noodle belt is made to the desired thickness by adjusting the gap in the rolls, it is then cut right away. Wavy noodles are made in a slow-paced conveyor belt and are hindered by metal weights when coming out of the slitter which gives the noodle its wavy appearance. If the strands are to be molded into other shapes, liquid seasoning could be added as well. Once the noodles are shaped, they are ready to be steamed for 1\u20135 minutes at {{convert|100|C}} to improve its texture by [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinizing]] the starch of the noodles. When steaming, the addition of water and heat breaks up the helix structure and crystallinity of amylose. Amylose begins to diffuse out of the starch granule and forms a gel matrix around the granule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xteiARU46SQC&dq=food+chemistry+book|title=Food Chemistry|last=Belitz|first=H.-D.|last2=Grosch|first2=Werner|last3=Schieberle|first3=Peter|date=2009-01-15|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783540699330|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Drying ===\nNext, noodles can be dried in one of two ways: by frying or by hot air drying. Fried instant noodles are dried by oil frying for 1\u20132 minutes at a temperature of {{convert|140|\u2013|160|C}}. The frying process decreases the moisture content from 30\u201350% to 2\u20135%. Common oils used for frying in North America consist of [[Canola oil|canola]], [[Cottonseed oil|cottonseed]] and palm oil mixtures, while only palm oil or palm olein are used in Asia. Air-dried noodles are dried for 30\u201340 minutes in hot air at a temperature of {{convert|70|\u2013|90|C}}, resulting in a moisture content of 8\u201312%. During the drying process, the rapid evaporation of water creates pores throughout the food matrix, which allows for short cooking times in the finished product. In the case of fried noodles, the creation of pores is directly related to the uptake of fat into the noodles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellema|first=M.|title=Mechanism and reduction of fat uptake in deep-fat fried foods|journal=Trends in Food Science & Technology|volume=14|issue=9|pages=364\u2013373|doi=10.1016/s0924-2244(03)00050-5|year=2003}}</ref> More than 80% of instant noodles are fried as it gives more evenly dried noodles than hot air drying which can cause an undesired texture in finished noodles, and also taking longer time to cook. However, with fried noodles, the oil content is about 15\u201320% and decreases the shelf life of the noodles due to oxidation whereas in hot air-dried noodles it has only 3% oil content maximum.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Packaging ===\nBefore packaging with seasoning, the noodles are cooled after drying, and their quality of moisture, color, and shape are checked. Packaging of the noodles include films impermeable to air and water. There are two forms of packaged instant noodles, one in a bag with the provided seasoning in small sachets inside, or [[Cup noodle|in a cup]] with seasoning on the top of the noodles. There are a variety of flavors to the noodles depending on which ones are added to the seasoning. Such flavors include beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, oriental, etc. In [[Cup noodle|instant noodle cups]], soy protein and dehydrated vegetables and meats are often added for further flavor.\n\nThe shelf life of instant noodles ranges from 4\u201312 months, depending on environmental factors. Their stability comes from the high sodium content with low moisture, and low water activity. Instant noodles can be served after 1\u20132 minutes in boiled water or soaked in hot water for 3\u20134 minutes.<ref>USAID. ''Fortification Basis.

After mixing, kneading, compounding, and rolling, a continuous viscous noodle dough sheet is made and cut by roll slitters. The conveyor belt which transports the noodle dough sheet moves slower than the rotation speed of the blades on the slitters; therefore, the sheet could be pressed multiple times up and down to produce the unique wavy form of instant noodles. After slitting, the sheets undergo steaming and frying, which triggers starch gelatinization to increase the water retention during cooking in boiling water to shorten the cooking time of the noodles.\n\n=== Elasticity ===\nAlthough dry instant noodles may not appear elastic, cooked instant noodles generally have higher elasticity than other types of noodles when they are cooked, and the unique wavy form also differentiates instant noodles from other common noodles like udon or flat noodles. The wavy form of instant noodles sometimes creates random spirals after noodles are cooked, giving the noodle strands spring-like qualities. The wavy form of the noodles is created when noodle dough sheets are being cut by rotation slitters. As mentioned above, due to the difference between the velocities of the conveyor belt and blade rotation, noodle dough sheets could be pressed by blades multiple times within a certain area, creating the unique wavy form of instant noodles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Binxiao|year=2007|title=Asian noodles: History, classification, raw materials, and processing|url=|journal=Food Research International|volume=41|issue=9|pages=888\u2013902|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2007.11.007}}</ref> During pressing by the heavy blades, the continuous gluten structure is ruptured at certain points and does not return to its original shape, but the remaining gluten structures are strong enough to keep it hanging; therefore, wavy noodle strands are formed and maintained during processing. Other than the physical springiness, the selection of ingredients also ensures the high elasticity of instant noodles. Instant noodles require wheat flour with high protein content to ensure noodle strands are broken during processing,<ref name=\":0\" /> resulting in more viscoelastic noodle dough and thus more elastic noodles. Furthermore, [[potato starch]], a key ingredient in instant noodles, has the important characteristics of low gelatinization temperature, high viscosity, and rapid swelling.<ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, the addition of starch could further increase the elasticity of noodles. High salt content in instant noodles also increases the elasticity of noodle strands, as its dissolved ions strengthen the interaction between gluten structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rombouts|first=Ine|last2=Jansens|first2=Koen J.A.|last3=Lagrain|first3=Bert|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|last5=Zhu|first5=Ke-Xue|title=The impact of salt and alkali on gluten polymerization and quality of fresh wheat noodles|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=60|issue=3|pages=507\u2013513|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2014.09.003|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Short cooking time ===\nThe initial purpose of inventing instant noodles was to shorten the cooking time of conventional noodles. Therefore, a short cooking time could be regarded as the most decisive characteristic of instant noodles. Instant noodles are cooked in boiled water; therefore, enhancing water retention is the major method to shorten cooking time.\n\n[[Starch gelatinization]] is the most important feature in instant noodles that can enhance water retention during cooking. Two key steps in instant noodle processing serve the function to trigger starch gelatinization, which are steaming and oil-frying. Starch gelatinization occurs when starch granules swell in water with heat, [[amylose]]s leak out of starch granules, which could bind to water and increase the viscosity of gluten matrix. Steaming offers an optimal condition for the gelatinization of potato starches. After steaming, rapid oil-frying vaporize the free water, and gelatinization continues until all the free water is dehydrated. During frying, water in noodle strands migrates from central region outwards to replace the surface water that is dehydrated during frying. Therefore, a porous sponge structure in the noodle is created due to vaporization. During the migration of water, it carries thermal energy from oil to the surroundings and bound water to offer the heat for finishing starch gelatinization. Furthermore, the heat transfer during evaporation protects instant noodles from burning or being overcooked during frying.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, as a common additive, [[guar gum]] can not only increase the elasticity and viscosity of noodles to enhance the mouthfeel, it can also increase the water binding ability of noodles when cooking in boiling water. Hydrocolloids could bind large amounts of water; the more water they bind, the faster heat will transfer to the center of noodles.\n\n== Health and safety concerns ==\n===Nutritional value===\n[[File:Indomie Mie Goreng Iga Penyet 2.JPG|thumb|A serving of [[Indomie]] [[iga penyet]], with [[fried egg]] and vegetables.

Despite being called \"Chinese soup\", the first brands on the market were produced in Vietnam and had a somewhat spicy, garlic-flavored taste. The noodle packages contained pouches of flavored soup base, spicy oil, dried vegetables or even minuscule shrimps.\n\nThe product gained particular popularity among students due to its affordability and convenience. \"Kaczka \u0142agodna\" (''Mild duck''), \"Kurczakowa \u0142agodna\" (''Mild chicken'') and \"Krewetkowa ostra\" (''Spicy shrimp'') were the most common flavors. Today, the local Kim Lan and worldwide [[Knorr (brand)|Knorr]] brands offer varieties ranging from cheese-and-herb flavored noodles to local Polish specialties like [[barszcz czerwony]] or [[\u017curek]].\n\nNgoc Tu Tao, who emigrated to [[Poland]] from [[Vietnam]] and established the Tan-Viet Group in 1990, is credited with introducing the instant noodle to Poland. His VIFON brand holds a 35% share of the Polish instant soup market, selling over 100 million packages a year. Ngoc Tu Tao has appeared in ''[[Wprost]]'' magazine's annual ranking of the 100 most wealthy Polish citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200505/200505230014.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208205416/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200505/200505230014.html |archivedate=8 December 2007 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=8 December 2007 |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nInexpensive supermarket private-label brands and regular mid-market products do not differ much in taste, while their prices can range from PLN 0.8 to PLN 2.00.

Instant noodles have been popular in Russia's Far East region since the late 1980s and made their way west in the early 1990s. In Russia, like most noodle products, they are still considered a lesser-quality option to turn to in lean economic times.

The typical method of cooking is by adding boiled water, but Thais typically add meat, pork, chicken or egg to spice up the instant noodles. Sometimes they will cook the noodles and combine the noodles in a dish called a noodle salad known as \"yum Mama\". This dish is often prepared with meat balls, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. Another method is to [[stir fry]] the cooked noodles with pork, chicken, eggs, and vegetables to give the noodles extra flavor. They are also sometimes consumed directly as a snack without further cooking by crushing the noodles in the packet, adding seasoning powder in the packet and shaking the packet to coat the crushed dried noodles evenly with the seasoning. Instant noodle products have become successful in Thailand, because they are cheap, easy to eat, can be easily found, and offer a range of flavors. Recently some brands of instant noodles include real dehydrated meat such as pork or beef. The average retail price is about six baht for the regular size<ref name=\"ST-20160202\" /> and 10 baht for Yum Yum Jumbo packs.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFor years, sales of MAMA noodles was considered a barometer of the Thai economy, with consumption rising when times were lean. This has not been the case recently. In 2014, when the political crisis slowed Thailand's economic growth to 0.9 percent and eventually led to a military coup, the growth of MAMA noodle sales hit a low of one percent. In 2015, when the military government could not lift the country beyond an estimated 2.8 percent growth, sales of MAMA noodles only grew 0.4 percent\u2014a record low. Saha Pathanapibul's vice-president, Vathit Chokwatana, attributed the poor sales to falling commodity prices, which have weakened the purchasing power of rural people.<ref name=\"ST-20160202\" />\n\n===United Kingdom===\nA common form of instant noodles in Britain is [[Pot Noodle]], a [[cup noodle]] first marketed by [[Golden Wonder]] in the late 1970s, and acquired by [[Unilever]] in 1995. These use artificial flavorings and are generally suitable for [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] (there is no chicken in Chicken Pot Noodles, for example) and are sold by virtually every major supermarket chain, general groceries shops, and convenience stores.\n\nPacket noodles such as [[Batchelors]]' [[Super Noodles]] are also sold. Several of the larger supermarkets sell eastern brands such as [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]], [[Koka noodles]] and [[Shin Ramyun]], which once could only be found in Asian groceries. Larger retail chains may offer their own brand in basic packaging and a variety of flavors, e.g., [[Asda]], while noodles such as [[Maggi]] can also be found in many groceries, but are less widespread.

Some prominent brands are [[Nissin Foods]] brand [[Top Ramen]] (originally Top Ramen's Oodles of Noodles), [[Maruchan]] Ramen, and [[Sapporo Ichiban]]. A wide range of popular brands imported from other countries are available at many Asian grocery stores and some supermarkets.
