It was written by co-creator [[Steven Moffat]], and directed by [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]]. The episode was based on \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", a short story by  [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].\n\nThe episode depicts Sherlock Holmes' ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) confrontation with [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), a [[dominatrix]] who has compromising photographs taken with a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]]. The photographs are stored inside her [[mobile phone]], along with other valuable information which makes her a target of various political factions. Sherlock spends much of the episode keeping the device out of enemy hands while trying to deduce its password. Besides referring to the Doyle short story, the episode title names [[Belgravia]], a district of London adjacent to the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]].\n\nAfter its broadcast on BBC One, the episode was given consolidated figures of 10.663 million viewers in the United Kingdom. Critical reactions toward the episode were largely positive, with reviewers praising the writing, acting and direction. The episode sparked controversy for showing the character of Irene Adler in the nude; carefully using camera angles to avoid exposing private areas, [[Watershed (television)|pre-watershed]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n\nContinuing the ending of [[The Great Game (Sherlock) | The Great Game]], [[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes| Sherlock Holmes]] ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) and [[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson | John Watson]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) are confronting [[List of Sherlock characters#James 'Jim' Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]).\nMoriarty intends at first to kill them, but as a phone call interrupts, he changes his mind, and dismisses the snipers.\n\nHolmes has become a minor celebrity after Watson blogs about the cases they solved.\nOne day, Holmes and Watson are brought to meet [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] ([[Mark Gatiss]]) in [[Buckingham Palace]].\nMycroft reveals that [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), took compromising photographs of herself and a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]].\nThe authority wants to retrieve Adler's [[smartphone]], which contains those photographs.\nHolmes and Watson try to get into Adler's home by deception, but she has been expecting them. Holmes meets Adler stark naked leaving him unable to deduce anything about her. \n\nAs Watson deliberately triggers the fire alarm, Holmes finds Adler's hidden safe, which Adler has glanced at nervously.\nSuddenly several [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operatives led by Neilson ([[Todd Boyce]]) break into the house and demand that Holmes open the safe.\nHolmes solves the password, and in subsequent chaos, some agents are killed, Holmes gets the phone first, and Adler then sedates Holmes, takes the phone instead, and escapes.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Holmes learns via text message that Adler has sent him her phone.\nConsidering the phone's importance, Holmes thinks she might die soon.\nIndeed, the police find a mutilated body, identified to be Adler.\n\nLater, on New Year's Eve, Watson is taken to see Adler, who is alive and faked her death.\nHolmes followed them and learns this, too.\nMeanwhile, Neilson's team holds [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] ([[Una Stubbs]]) hostage, and Holmes subdues Neilson.\nAdler comes, and reveals that she is still being hunted.\nShe asks Holmes to decipher a code stolen from [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]].\nSherlock effortlessly cracks it, revealing it to be [[airline seat]] allocation numbers. Adler conveys this information to Moriarty, who taunts Mycroft Holmes that he (Moriarty) now knows their plan.\n\nA government official brings Holmes to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].\nMycroft confirms that the government had planned to fly a plane full of corpses, so as not to alert the terrorists planning to bomb the plane that they know of their plans, reminiscent of the [[Coventry myth]].\nHowever, as Holmes unwittingly helped Adler (and thus Moriarty) crack the code, the scheme was foiled.\nAdler reveals a list of demands to Mycroft, including protection, in exchange for the contents of her phone.\nHowever, Holmes figures out the unlocking password to be \"SHER\", so that words on the screen together reads \"I AM SHER-LOCKED\".\nNow without her leverage, Adler pleads for protection, but Sherlock and Mycroft turn her down.\n\nSome months later, Mycroft informs Watson that Adler has been killed by terrorists, but intends to tell Holmes instead that she has entered a [[witness protection]] programme in America.\nHolmes asks for Adler's phone, and says that Adler's last text message was \"Goodbye, Mr Holmes\", suggesting her death.\nAfter Watson leaves, in the flashback it is shown that Holmes was disguised as the executioner and had rescued Adler.\n\n==Sources and allusions==\n[[File:Statue of Sherlock Holmes in Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sherlock Holmes in [[Edinburgh]]. \"A Scandal in Belgravia\" alludes to this 'classic' image of Holmes created by illustrator [[Sidney Paget]].]]\nThe episode is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's short story \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", and also alludes to several other adventures.<ref name=\"wollaston\"/><ref name=\"crompton\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8987577/The-timeless-appeal-of-Holmess-sexy-logic.html|title=The timeless appeal of Holmes's sexy logic|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=1 January 2012|first=Sarah|last=Crompton |accessdate=5 January 2012|location=London}}</ref> There are humorous references to numerous famous Holmes stories, such as \"[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter|The Greek Interpreter]]\" (in this episode, the \"Geek Interpreter\"),<ref name=\"RT\" /> \"[[The Adventure of the Speckled Band|The Speckled Band]]\" (in the episode, the \"Speckled Blonde\"),<ref name=\"crompton\"/> \"[[The Adventure of the Naval Treaty|The Naval Treaty]]\" (in the episode, \"The Navel Treatment\"), \"[[The Adventure of the Illustrious Client|The Illustrious Client]]\" and \"[[The Adventure of the Priory School|The Priory School]]\".

As Holmes opens Adler's safe, he says \"Vatican cameos\", a reference to a mystery that is mentioned in ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.\n\n==Production==\n\n[[Lara Pulver]] decided to audition for the role of Irene Adler when she read the script shortly after wrapping on the espionage series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'', in which she had played Erin Watts.

Although Chater's playing is on the actual soundtrack, Cumberbatch was required to appear to be an expert violinist. To achieve this, Chater was positioned on set so that she could synchronise her playing with his. She says, \"On set I need to see him; to play when he lifts his violin and stop when he stops. And he needs to see me; to copy my bowings, to ghost what I'm doing. In one scene I have to stand outside on two boxes on a [[scissor lift]], watching him while he watches me out of the window.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2012/jan/04/how-taught-sherlock-holmes-violin?newsfeed=true |title=How I taught Sherlock Holmes to play the violin |first=Eos |last=Chater |authorlink=Eos Chater |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\"A Scandal in Belgravia\" was first broadcast on BBC One on Sunday, 1 January 2012.

It is ''Sherlock's'' highest rated episode since the show's first episode, \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", which attracted 7.5 million.

It was written by co-creator [[Steven Moffat]], and directed by [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]]. The episode was based on \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", a short story by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].\n\nThe episode depicts Sherlock Holmes' ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) confrontation with [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), a [[dominatrix]] who has compromising photographs taken with a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]]. The photographs are stored inside her [[mobile phone]], along with other valuable information which makes her a target of various political factions. Sherlock spends much of the episode keeping the device out of enemy hands while trying to deduce its password. Besides referring to the Doyle short story, the episode title names [[Belgravia]], a district of London adjacent to the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]].\n\nAfter its broadcast on BBC One, the episode was given consolidated figures of 10.663 million viewers in the United Kingdom. Critical reactions toward the episode were largely positive, with reviewers praising the writing, acting and direction. The episode sparked controversy for showing the character of Irene Adler in the nude; carefully using camera angles to avoid exposing private areas, [[Watershed (television)|pre-watershed]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n\nContinuing the ending of [[The Great Game (Sherlock) | The Great Game]], [[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes| Sherlock Holmes]] ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) and [[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson | John Watson]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) are confronting [[List of Sherlock characters#James 'Jim' Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]).\nMoriarty intends at first to kill them, but as a phone call interrupts, he changes his mind, and dismisses the snipers.\n\nHolmes has become a minor celebrity after Watson blogs about the cases they solved.\nOne day, Holmes and Watson are brought to meet [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] ([[Mark Gatiss]]) in [[Buckingham Palace]].\nMycroft reveals that [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), took compromising photographs of herself and a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]].\nThe authority wants to retrieve Adler's [[smartphone]], which contains those photographs.\nHolmes and Watson try to get into Adler's home by deception, but she has been expecting them. Holmes meets Adler stark naked leaving him unable to deduce anything about her. \n\nAs Watson deliberately triggers the fire alarm, Holmes finds Adler's hidden safe, which Adler has glanced at nervously.\nSuddenly several [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operatives led by Neilson ([[Todd Boyce]]) break into the house and demand that Holmes open the safe.\nHolmes solves the password, and in subsequent chaos, some agents are killed, Holmes gets the phone first, and Adler then sedates Holmes, takes the phone instead, and escapes.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Holmes learns via text message that Adler has sent him her phone.\nConsidering the phone's importance, Holmes thinks she might die soon.\nIndeed, the police find a mutilated body, identified to be Adler.\n\nLater, on New Year's Eve, Watson is taken to see Adler, who is alive and faked her death.\nHolmes followed them and learns this, too.\nMeanwhile, Neilson's team holds [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] ([[Una Stubbs]]) hostage, and Holmes subdues Neilson.\nAdler comes, and reveals that she is still being hunted.\nShe asks Holmes to decipher a code stolen from [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]].\nSherlock effortlessly cracks it, revealing it to be [[airline seat]] allocation numbers. Adler conveys this information to Moriarty, who taunts Mycroft Holmes that he (Moriarty) now knows their plan.\n\nA government official brings Holmes to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].\nMycroft confirms that the government had planned to fly a plane full of corpses, so as not to alert the terrorists planning to bomb the plane that they know of their plans, reminiscent of the [[Coventry myth]].\nHowever, as Holmes unwittingly helped Adler (and thus Moriarty) crack the code, the scheme was foiled.\nAdler reveals a list of demands to Mycroft, including protection, in exchange for the contents of her phone.\nHowever, Holmes figures out the unlocking password to be \"SHER\", so that words on the screen together reads \"I AM SHER-LOCKED\".\nNow without her leverage, Adler pleads for protection, but Sherlock and Mycroft turn her down.\n\nSome months later, Mycroft informs Watson that Adler has been killed by terrorists, but intends to tell Holmes instead that she has entered a [[witness protection]] programme in America.\nHolmes asks for Adler's phone, and says that Adler's last text message was \"Goodbye, Mr Holmes\", suggesting her death.\nAfter Watson leaves, in the flashback it is shown that Holmes was disguised as the executioner and had rescued Adler.\n\n==Sources and allusions==\n[[File:Statue of Sherlock Holmes in Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sherlock Holmes in [[Edinburgh]]. \"A Scandal in Belgravia\" alludes to this 'classic' image of Holmes created by illustrator [[Sidney Paget]].]]\nThe episode is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's short story \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", and also alludes to several other adventures.<ref name=\"wollaston\"/><ref name=\"crompton\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8987577/The-timeless-appeal-of-Holmess-sexy-logic.html|title=The timeless appeal of Holmes's sexy logic|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=1 January 2012|first=Sarah|last=Crompton |accessdate=5 January 2012|location=London}}</ref> There are humorous references to numerous famous Holmes stories, such as \"[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter|The Greek Interpreter]]\" (in this episode, the \"Geek Interpreter\"),<ref name=\"RT\" /> \"[[The Adventure of the Speckled Band|The Speckled Band]]\" (in the episode, the \"Speckled Blonde\"),<ref name=\"crompton\"/> \"[[The Adventure of the Naval Treaty|The Naval Treaty]]\" (in the episode, \"The Navel Treatment\"), \"[[The Adventure of the Illustrious Client|The Illustrious Client]]\" and \"[[The Adventure of the Priory School|The Priory School]]\".

As Holmes opens Adler's safe, he says \"Vatican cameos\", a reference to a mystery that is mentioned in ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.\n\n==Production==\n\n[[Lara Pulver]] decided to audition for the role of Irene Adler when she read the script shortly after wrapping on the espionage series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'', in which she had played Erin Watts.

Although Chater's playing is on the actual soundtrack, Cumberbatch was required to appear to be an expert violinist. To achieve this, Chater was positioned on set so that she could synchronise her playing with his. She says, \"On set I need to see him; to play when he lifts his violin and stop when he stops. And he needs to see me; to copy my bowings, to ghost what I'm doing. In one scene I have to stand outside on two boxes on a [[scissor lift]], watching him while he watches me out of the window.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2012/jan/04/how-taught-sherlock-holmes-violin?newsfeed=true |title=How I taught Sherlock Holmes to play the violin |first=Eos |last=Chater |authorlink=Eos Chater |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\"A Scandal in Belgravia\" was first broadcast on BBC One on Sunday, 1 January 2012.
