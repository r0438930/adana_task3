Recording 70 goals and 126 points in 60 games, he was named AJHL and Canadian Junior A Player of the Year.\n\nThe following season, he began his two-year tenure with the [[Wisconsin Badgers|University of Wisconsin Badgers]] of the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA). As a freshman, he was named to the WCHA First All-Star Team and NCAA West Second All-American Team, in addition to earning WCHA Rookie of the Year honours. In the off-season, he was drafted second overall by the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] in the [[2000 NHL Entry Draft]], behind goaltender [[Rick DiPietro]]. After his sophomore year, in which he was named to the 2001 WCHA Second All-Star and NCAA West First All-American Teams, Heatley chose to forgo his final two years of college eligibility to turn pro with the Thrashers.\n\n===Professional===\n====Atlanta Thrashers (2001\u20132004)====\nHeatley made his NHL debut with the Thrashers in [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302]], leading all rookies in points (67) and assists (41) and was second in team goal-scoring (26) behind [[Ilya Kovalchuk]].

The team started to look like a real team again. And then to be kind of blindsided, in his way of thinking anyway, by one of your players \u2013 not wanting to fit in.

Sports writers across Canada criticized Heatley's behaviour, calling him a \"brat\", \"pathetic\", and \"reprehensible\".<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> \"I was surprised at it, but I understood it\", Atlanta Thrashers' GM [[Don Waddell]] said of Heatley's desire to leave Atlanta in the aftermath of Dan Snyder's death. \"This one, I really don't understand. He asked to get out (of Atlanta) and he went to a team that he obviously approved of and had some success. They went to the (2007 Stanley Cup) finals. What I can see is that he got a lot of support in Ottawa. I don't think (the trade request) says a lot of positive things on the surface... It sure doesn't show a good team attitude.\"<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> Graham Snyder, father of Dan Snyder, played a significant role in helping Heatley avoid prison time after the crash that killed his son. He was confused by Heatley's decision to force a trade from Ottawa, saying \"I'm surprised because he signed a long-term deal (with Ottawa) and was playing in a market that seemed to embrace him.\" Snyder said there were \"a lot of ways\" Heatley could have dealt with the decision by Clouston to reduce his playing time and bump him down to the second power-play unit, rather than demanding a trade. \"Certainly, (talking with Clouston) behind the scenes would be a lot more effective, and trying to work through it.\"<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> An Atlanta Thrashers' employee cryptically told the [[Vancouver Sun]] \"We know Dany very well.

And the attacks are all personal stuff, about his character\", Molloy lamented, adding that \"Nobody mentions that this is a guy who gives up a month of his summer every year to play for Team Canada.\" Molloy went as far as to blame the Senators' organization for Heatley's decision, claiming \"This is an organizational thing.

Further complicating matters was the partial no-trade clause in Heatley's contract which limited the number of teams Ottawa could negotiate a potential deal with. A trade was worked out to send Heatley to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in exchange for [[Andrew Cogliano]], [[Dustin Penner]] and [[Ladislav \u0160m\u00edd]] on June 30, 2009, but Heatley again surprised the hockey world when he refused to waive the no-trade clause which would have finalized the deal, further angering fans in both Ottawa and Edmonton.<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> NHL Deputy Commissioner [[Bill Daly]] suggested that the Senators may have grounds to file a grievance, as Heatley's contract stipulated the team pay a bonus (due July 1, 2009) of US$4 million. The Edmonton trade would have spared the Senators that expense.\n\nAs Ottawa GM Murray began again to try to accommodate the trade demand, Heatley was still a member of the Senators as the team opened training camp on September 12, 2009. Heatley had little choice but to report for training camp, and the atmosphere between him and his Senators' teammates was described as \"awkward\", \"tense\", and \"untenable\". Team captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]] admitted days earlier that a scenario in which Heatley showed up in Ottawa as an unhappy camper would create a massive media headache for the rest of the team. \"If he comes back there's going to be a lot of focus and attention,\" Alfredsson said at the time, adding \"If somebody hits him in practice or something occurs, everything is going to get blown out proportion.\" Heatley himself snuck back into [[Scotiabank Place]], avoiding the cameras and throng of media awaiting some clarification regarding his desire to leave Ottawa. \"When I looked (Heatley) in the eye, I knew the minute he walked out the door that I had to trade him,\" GM Bryan Murray said a short time later. \"I didn\u2019t think there was any chance.

Several fans who attended the game held up their #15 Heatley jerseys with certain letters covered up, so the name plate would spell out the word \"H-A-T-E\". Late in the game, a group of 10 fans came down to ice level and simultaneously threw their Heatley jerseys onto the ice in a coordinated protest. Another fan held up a sign reading \"Even Yashin Thinks You\u2019re A Jerk\", a reference to former Senators' player [[Alexei Yashin]] who left the team amid controversy in 2001.<ref name=\"mendes\" /> The Sharks won the game 4\u20130, and Heatley had an assist.\n\nIn the [[2010\u201311 NHL season|following season]], Heatley put up the worst full-season point totals of his career, registering only 26 goals and 64 points in 80 games.

He asked to get out (of Atlanta) and he went to a team that he obviously approved of and had some success. They went to the (2007 Stanley Cup) finals.

It sure doesn't show a good team attitude.\"<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> Graham Snyder, father of Dan Snyder, played a significant role in helping Heatley avoid prison time after the crash that killed his son. He was confused by Heatley's decision to force a trade from Ottawa, saying \"I'm surprised because he signed a long-term deal (with Ottawa) and was playing in a market that seemed to embrace him.\" Snyder said there were \"a lot of ways\" Heatley could have dealt with the decision by Clouston to reduce his playing time and bump him down to the second power-play unit, rather than demanding a trade. \"Certainly, (talking with Clouston) behind the scenes would be a lot more effective, and trying to work through it.\"<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> An Atlanta Thrashers' employee cryptically told the [[Vancouver Sun]] \"We know Dany very well.

Further complicating matters was the partial no-trade clause in Heatley's contract which limited the number of teams Ottawa could negotiate a potential deal with. A trade was worked out to send Heatley to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in exchange for [[Andrew Cogliano]], [[Dustin Penner]] and [[Ladislav \u0160m\u00edd]] on June 30, 2009, but Heatley again surprised the hockey world when he refused to waive the no-trade clause which would have finalized the deal, further angering fans in both Ottawa and Edmonton.<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> NHL Deputy Commissioner [[Bill Daly]] suggested that the Senators may have grounds to file a grievance, as Heatley's contract stipulated the team pay a bonus (due July 1, 2009) of US$4 million. The Edmonton trade would have spared the Senators that expense.\n\nAs Ottawa GM Murray began again to try to accommodate the trade demand, Heatley was still a member of the Senators as the team opened training camp on September 12, 2009. Heatley had little choice but to report for training camp, and the atmosphere between him and his Senators' teammates was described as \"awkward\", \"tense\", and \"untenable\". Team captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]] admitted days earlier that a scenario in which Heatley showed up in Ottawa as an unhappy camper would create a massive media headache for the rest of the team. \"If he comes back there's going to be a lot of focus and attention,\" Alfredsson said at the time, adding \"If somebody hits him in practice or something occurs, everything is going to get blown out proportion.\" Heatley himself snuck back into [[Scotiabank Place]], avoiding the cameras and throng of media awaiting some clarification regarding his desire to leave Ottawa. \"When I looked (Heatley) in the eye, I knew the minute he walked out the door that I had to trade him,\" GM Bryan Murray said a short time later. \"I didn\u2019t think there was any chance.

The Sharks were eliminated in the 2010 Conference Finals as, with Dany Heatley in the penalty box, the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] scored the game-winning goal, sweeping the series. However, Head Coach [[Todd McLellan]] revealed that Heatley had been playing the entire playoffs with a torn groin muscle.\n\nOn December 2, 2010, in his first return to Ottawa, Heatley was frequently booed. Though he had said that the city of Ottawa and the fans there had nothing to do with his desire to be moved, Senators fans were in no mood to forgive. Several fans who attended the game held up their #15 Heatley jerseys with certain letters covered up, so the name plate would spell out the word \"H-A-T-E\". Late in the game, a group of 10 fans came down to ice level and simultaneously threw their Heatley jerseys onto the ice in a coordinated protest. Another fan held up a sign reading \"Even Yashin Thinks You\u2019re A Jerk\", a reference to former Senators' player [[Alexei Yashin]] who left the team amid controversy in 2001.<ref name=\"mendes\" /> The Sharks won the game 4\u20130, and Heatley had an assist.\n\nIn the [[2010\u201311 NHL season|following season]], Heatley put up the worst full-season point totals of his career, registering only 26 goals and 64 points in 80 games.
