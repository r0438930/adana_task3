This method claimed to make lackluster and brittle hair become soft and luxurious.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Walker's product line had several competitors.

Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, in addition to Walker's frequent travels to promote her products, helped make Walker and her products well known in the United States.\n\nIn addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own businesses, and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the [[National Association of Colored Women]], Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).<ref name=\"indiana-history\" /> Its first annual conference convened in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees.

J. Walker Manufacturing Company. She initially purchased a house and factory at 640 North West Street.<ref name=GS361>Gugin and Saint Clair, p. 361.</ref> Walker later built a factory, hair salon, and beauty school to train her sales agents, and added a laboratory to help with research.<ref name=ingham/> She also assembled a staff that included [[Freeman Ransom]], [[Robert Brokenburr|Robert Lee Brokenburr]], Alice Kelly, and [[Marjorie Joyner]], among others, to assist in managing the growing company.<ref name=BWA1210-11/> Many of her company's employees, including those in key management and staff positions, were women.<ref name=Success/>\n[[File:MadameCJWalkerdrivingautomoblie.png|thumb|left|Madam Walker and several friends in her automobile, 1911.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/03/self-made-madam-cj-walker-company-true-story Vanity Fair, Self Made: What Happened to Madam C.J.

This method claimed to make lackluster and brittle hair become soft and luxurious.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Walker's product line had several competitors. Similar products were produced in Europe and manufactured by other companies in the United States, which included her major rivals, Annie Turnbo Malone's Poro System from which she derived her original formula and later, Sarah Spencer Washington's Apex System.<ref name=Science/>\n\nBetween 1911 and 1919, during the height of her career, Walker and her company employed several thousand women as sales agents for its products.<ref name=indiana-history/> By 1917 the company claimed to have trained nearly 20,000 women.<ref name=GS361/> Dressed in a characteristic uniform of white shirts and black skirts and carrying black satchels, they visited houses around the United States and in the [[Caribbean]] offering Walker's hair pomade and other products packaged in tin containers carrying her image. Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, in addition to Walker's frequent travels to promote her products, helped make Walker and her products well known in the United States.\n\nIn addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own businesses, and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the [[National Association of Colored Women]], Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).<ref name=\"indiana-history\" /> Its first annual conference convened in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees. The conference is believed to have been among the first national gatherings of women entrepreneurs to discuss business and commerce.<ref name=\"Riquier\" /><ref name=\"bundles\" /> During the convention Walker gave prizes to women who had sold the most products and brought in the most new sales agents. She also rewarded those who made the largest contributions to charities in their communities.<ref name=\"bundles\" />\n\nWalker's name became even more widely known by the 1920s, after her death, as her company's business market expanded beyond the United States to [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Panama]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref name=\"bundles\" /><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\" /><ref name=\"Success\" /><ref name=\"Science\">{{cite web | title=Madame C.

In 1912, Walker addressed an annual gathering of the [[National Negro Business League]] (NNBL) from the convention floor, where she declared: \"I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there, I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there, I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations. I have built my own factory on my own ground.\"<ref name=GS361/> The following year she addressed convention-goers from the podium as a keynote speaker.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/>\n\nShe helped raise funds to establish a branch of [[YMCA]] in Indianapolis's black community, pledging $1,000 to the building fund for Senate Avenue YMCA. Walker also contributed scholarship funds to the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]]. Other beneficiaries included Indianapolis's Flanner House and [[Bethel A.M.E. Church (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church]]; Mary McLeod Bethune's Daytona Education and Industrial School for Negro Girls (which later became [[Bethune-Cookman University]]) in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]; the [[Palmer Memorial Institute]] in [[North Carolina]]; and the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Walker was also a [[patron of the arts]].<ref name=indiana-history/><ref name=bundles/>\n\nAbout 1913, Walker's daughter, A'Lelia, moved to a new townhouse in [[Harlem]], and in 1916, Walker joined her in New York, leaving the day-to-day operation of her company to her management team in Indianapolis.<ref name=Bundles-website/><ref name=GS361/> In 1917, Walker commissioned [[Vertner Tandy]], the first licensed black architect in New York City and a founding member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity, to design her house in [[Irvington-on-Hudson, New York|Irvington-on-Hudson]], New York. Walker intended for [[Villa Lewaro]], which cost $250,000 to build, to become a gathering place for community leaders and to inspire other African Americans to pursue their dreams.<ref name=Science/><ref>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867\u20131919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v.

She delivered lectures on political, economic, and social issues at conventions sponsored by powerful black institutions. Her friends and associates included [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref name=indiana-history/> During [[World War I]] Walker was a leader in the Circle For Negro War Relief and advocated for the establishment of a training camp for black army officers.<ref name=GS361/> In 1917 she joined the executive committee of New York chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which organized the [[Silent Parade|Silent Protest Parade]] on New York City's [[Fifth Avenue]]. The public demonstration drew more than 8,000 African Americans to protest a riot in East Saint Louis that killed 39 African-Americans.<ref name=bundles/>\n\nProfits from her business significantly impacted Walker's contributions to her political and philanthropic interests. In 1918 the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]] (NACWC) honored Walker for making the largest individual contribution to help preserve [[Frederick Douglass]]'s [[Anacostia]] house.<ref>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867\u20131919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v.

At the time it was the largest gift from an individual that the NAACP had ever received. Walker bequeathed nearly $100,000 to orphanages, institutions, and individuals; her will directed two-thirds of future net profits of her estate to charity.<ref name=Philanthropy>{{cite web | title=Madam C.
