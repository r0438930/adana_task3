A temple was constructed on the site between 60-70CE in the first few decades of [[Roman Britain]]. Its presence led to the development of the small Roman urban settlement known as ''[[Aquae Sulis]]'' around the site. The Roman baths, which were used for [[public bathing]], were used until the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|end of Roman rule in Britain]] in the 5th Century CE. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the original Roman baths were in ruins a century later. The area around the natural springs was  redeveloped several times during the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]] and [[Late Middle Ages]].  \n\nThe Roman Baths are preserved in four main features: the Sacred Spring, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House, and a museum which holds [[artefact (archaeology)|artefacta]] from ''Aquae Sulis''. However, all buildings at street level date from the 19th century. It is a major [[Tourism in England|tourist attraction]] in the UK, and together with the [[Grand Pump Room]], receives more than 1.3 million visitors annually.<ref name=\"ALVA 2018 visitor numbers\">{{cite web |title=ALVA - Association of Leading Visitor Attractions |url=http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423 |website=www.alva.org.uk |accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> Visitors can tour the baths and museum but cannot enter the water.\n\n==Hot spring==\nThe water which bubbles up from the ground at Bath falls as rain on the nearby [[Mendip Hills]].

A temple was constructed on the site between 60-70CE in the first few decades of [[Roman Britain]]. Its presence led to the development of the small Roman urban settlement known as ''[[Aquae Sulis]]'' around the site. The Roman baths, which were used for [[public bathing]], were used until the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|end of Roman rule in Britain]] in the 5th Century CE. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the original Roman baths were in ruins a century later. The area around the natural springs was  redeveloped several times during the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]] and [[Late Middle Ages]].  \n\nThe Roman Baths are preserved in four main features: the Sacred Spring, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House, and a museum which holds [[artefact (archaeology)|artefacta]] from ''Aquae Sulis''. However, all buildings at street level date from the 19th century. It is a major [[Tourism in England|tourist attraction]] in the UK, and together with the [[Grand Pump Room]], receives more than 1.3 million visitors annually.<ref name=\"ALVA 2018 visitor numbers\">{{cite web |title=ALVA - Association of Leading Visitor Attractions |url=http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423 |website=www.alva.org.uk |accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> Visitors can tour the baths and museum but cannot enter the water.\n\n==Hot spring==\nThe water which bubbles up from the ground at Bath falls as rain on the nearby [[Mendip Hills]].
