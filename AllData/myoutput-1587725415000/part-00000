The party is led by [[Kaja Kallas]] and has 34 members in the 101-member [[Riigikogu]], making it the largest party in the legislature.\n\nThe party was founded by then-President of the [[Bank of Estonia]] [[Siim Kallas]] as a split from [[National Coalition Party Pro Patria]]. At the [[1995 Estonian parliamentary election|1995 election]], it won 19 seats in the Riigikogu, making it the second largest party. The Reform Party replaced the [[Estonian Centre Party]] in government in autumn 1995, and remained there until 1996. [[1999 Estonian parliamentary election|In 1999]], the party lost a seat, but returned to the cabinet in coalition with the [[Pro Patria Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Moderate People's Party]]. The party has remained in various coalitions since then, with [[Andrus Ansip]] as Prime Minister since 2005. At the [[2007 Estonian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], the party won 31 seats, becoming the largest party for the first time, and increased its seat tally again [[2011 Estonian parliamentary election|in 2011]], with 33 seats. It narrowly won the [[2015 Estonian parliamentary election|2015 general election]], losing 3 mandates compared to its 2011 result, ending up with 30 seats. After being in opposition since November 2016, the party won the [[2019 Estonian parliamentary election|2019 parliamentary election]] with a convincing lead and expanded its number of mandates to 34.\n\nAs the Reform Party has participated in most of the government coalitions in Estonia since the mid-1990s, its influence has been significant, especially regarding Estonia's [[free market]] and low taxes policies. The party has been a full member of [[Liberal International]] since 1996, having been an observer member between 1994\u20131996, and a full member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE). The founder and the first chairman of the Reform Party, [[Siim Kallas]], was a Commissioner of the [[European Commission]] between 2004 and 2014. He was also one of the five Vice Presidents of the [[Barroso Commission]].\n\n==History==\nThe Estonian Reform Party was founded on 18 November 1994,<ref name=\"Bugajski 64\">Bugajski (2002), p. 64</ref> joining together the [[Reform Party (Estonia, 1994)|Reform Party]] \u2013 a splinter from the [[Pro Patria National Coalition]] (RKEI) \u2013 and the [[Estonian Liberal Democratic Party]] (ELDP).

The party is led by [[Kaja Kallas]] and has 34 members in the 101-member [[Riigikogu]], making it the largest party in the legislature.\n\nThe party was founded by then-President of the [[Bank of Estonia]] [[Siim Kallas]] as a split from [[National Coalition Party Pro Patria]]. At the [[1995 Estonian parliamentary election|1995 election]], it won 19 seats in the Riigikogu, making it the second largest party. The Reform Party replaced the [[Estonian Centre Party]] in government in autumn 1995, and remained there until 1996. [[1999 Estonian parliamentary election|In 1999]], the party lost a seat, but returned to the cabinet in coalition with the [[Pro Patria Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Moderate People's Party]]. The party has remained in various coalitions since then, with [[Andrus Ansip]] as Prime Minister since 2005. At the [[2007 Estonian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], the party won 31 seats, becoming the largest party for the first time, and increased its seat tally again [[2011 Estonian parliamentary election|in 2011]], with 33 seats. It narrowly won the [[2015 Estonian parliamentary election|2015 general election]], losing 3 mandates compared to its 2011 result, ending up with 30 seats. After being in opposition since November 2016, the party won the [[2019 Estonian parliamentary election|2019 parliamentary election]] with a convincing lead and expanded its number of mandates to 34.\n\nAs the Reform Party has participated in most of the government coalitions in Estonia since the mid-1990s, its influence has been significant, especially regarding Estonia's [[free market]] and low taxes policies. The party has been a full member of [[Liberal International]] since 1996, having been an observer member between 1994\u20131996, and a full member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE). The founder and the first chairman of the Reform Party, [[Siim Kallas]], was a Commissioner of the [[European Commission]] between 2004 and 2014. He was also one of the five Vice Presidents of the [[Barroso Commission]].\n\n==History==\nThe Estonian Reform Party was founded on 18 November 1994,<ref name=\"Bugajski 64\">Bugajski (2002), p. 64</ref> joining together the [[Reform Party (Estonia, 1994)|Reform Party]] \u2013 a splinter from the [[Pro Patria National Coalition]] (RKEI) \u2013 and the [[Estonian Liberal Democratic Party]] (ELDP).
