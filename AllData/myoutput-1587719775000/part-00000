They feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recent pieces were designed to reflect the monarch's role as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].\n\nUse of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to when it was converted to Christianity in the Middle Ages. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to [[Edward the Confessor]], was established after he was made a saint in the 12th&nbsp;century. They were holy relics kept at [[Westminster Abbey]] \u2013 venue of coronations since 1066. Another set was used at religious feasts and [[State Openings of Parliament]]. Collectively, these objects came to be known as the Jewels of [[the Crown]]. Most of the present collection dates from around 350 years ago when [[Charles II of England|Charles&nbsp;II]] ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649 during the [[English Civil War]]. Only four original items pre-date the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]: a late 12th-century anointing spoon (the oldest object) and three early 17th-century swords. Upon the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs; the Scottish regalia are known today as the [[Honours of Scotland]].\n\nThe regalia contain 23,578 stones, among them [[Cullinan&nbsp;I]] ({{convert|530|carat|g|0}}), the largest clear cut diamond in the world, set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the Cullinan, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to [[Edward&nbsp;VII]]. On the [[Imperial State Crown]] are [[Cullinan&nbsp;II]] ({{convert|317|carat|g|0}}), the [[Stuart Sapphire]], [[St&nbsp;Edward's Sapphire]], and the [[Black Prince's Ruby]]&nbsp;\u2013 a large spinel given to [[Edward the Black Prince]] by a Spanish king in 1367. The [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond ({{convert|105|carat|g|0}}), originally from India, was forfeited to [[Queen Victoria]] and has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of historical objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystals.\n\nAt a coronation the monarch is anointed using [[Chrism|holy oil]] poured from an [[ampulla]] into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with [[St&nbsp;Edward's Crown]]. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings are invested with a plainer set of regalia,{{efn|Husbands of [[queens regnant]] are not crowned in the United Kingdom.<ref>Allison and Riddell, p. 451.</ref>}} and since 1831 a new crown has been made specially for each [[queen consort]]. Also regarded as [[Crown Jewels]] are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. They are part of the [[Royal Collection]] and belong to the institution of monarchy, passing from one sovereign to the next. When not in use the Jewels are on public display in the [[Jewel House]] and Martin Tower where they are seen by 2.5&nbsp;million visitors every year.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150&nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]].

A [[heptarchy]] of new kingdoms began to emerge.

The monk, [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made that was usually buried with him or her upon death.<ref>Keay, pp. 13\u201318.</ref> In 9th-century Europe, gold crowns in the [[Byzantine]] tradition were replacing bronze, and gold soon became the standard material for English royal crowns.<ref name=\"royalgold\">{{cite podcast|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/resources/lecture-podcast-royal-gold-reflections-of-power|title=Royal Gold: Reflections of Power|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|author=Kathryn Jones|date=17 December 2014|access-date=14 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c6thelstan]] ascended the throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the [[Kingdom of England]].

The monks at his burial place of [[Westminster Abbey]] claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity and they were to be used at the coronations of all future kings.<ref name=\"keay1820\"/> A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a [[tunicle]], [[dalmatic]], [[pallium]], and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the [[Holy Communion]] a [[chalice]] of [[onyx]] stone and a [[paten]] made of gold&nbsp;\u2013 all of which were considered precious relics.<ref>Strong, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref> Although the Abbey's claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact,<ref name=\"keay1820\"/> thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.<ref>Rose, p. 13.</ref> Westminster Abbey is owned by a monarch,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11795159|title=Profile: Westminster Abbey|website=BBC News|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref> and the regalia had always been royal property \u2013 the abbots were mere custodians.

Being crowned and invested with regalia owned by a previous monarch who was also a saint reinforced the king's authority.<ref name=\"rose14\">Rose, p. 14.</ref> It was also wrongly thought to have been originally owned by [[Alfred the Great]] because an inscription on the lid of its box, translated from Latin, read: \"This is the chief crown of the two, with which were crowned Kings Alfred, Edward and others\".<ref>Holmes, p. 216.</ref> The crown would be used in many subsequent coronations until its eventual destruction 400 years later. Few descriptions survive, although one 17th-century historian noted that it was \"ancient Work with Flowers, adorn'd with Stones of somewhat a plain setting\",<ref>Holmes, p. 217.</ref> and an inventory described it as \"gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells\", weighing {{convert|79.5|oz|kg|order=flip}}.<ref>Twining, p. 132.</ref> It had arches and may have been decorated with [[filigree]] and [[cloisonn\u00e9]] enamels.<ref>Rose, p. 24.</ref> Also in the Royal Collection in this period was an item called a [[state crown]].

Following the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|defeat in 1282]] of the Welsh prince [[Llewelyn ap Gruffydd]] by [[Edward I of England|Edward&nbsp;I]], the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary [[King Arthur]], were surrendered to England.

Edward&nbsp;II pawned his Great Crown in [[Flanders]]. Three crowns and other jewels were held by the [[Bishop of London]] and the [[Earl of Arundel]] as security for \u00a310,000 in the 1370s.<ref name=\"steane35\">Steane, p. 35.</ref> One crown was handed over to the [[Corporation of London]] in exchange for a \u00a34,000 loan in 1386. Sometimes objects were temporarily released from pawn by mayors, knights, peers, bankers, and other wealthy subjects in both England and continental Europe for the king to use at state occasions, then returned after the ceremony. Kings also distributed plate and jewels to their troops in lieu of money.<ref>Collins, p. 75.</ref>\n\nAt some point in the 14th&nbsp;century, all of the state regalia were moved to the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] at the Tower of London owing to a series of successful and attempted thefts in Westminster Abbey.{{efn|[[Thomas Frederick Tout]] gives an illuminating second-hand account of one such theft in ''[https://archive.org/details/mediaevalburglar00toutuoft A&nbsp;Medi\u00e6val Burglary]'' (1916).}} The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey.<ref>Keay, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> After a long absence, two arches topped with a [[monde]] and cross were added to new images of St&nbsp;Edward's Crown by the time of Henry&nbsp;IV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor [[Henry V of England|Henry&nbsp;V]],<ref name=\"steane35\"/> though arches did not feature on the Great Seal until 1471.<ref name=\"collins11\">Collins, p. 11.</ref> Known as a closed or [[imperial crown]], the arches and cross symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>Dale Hoak in Hoak, \"The iconography of the crown imperial\", pp. 55, 63.</ref>\n\n===Tudor and early Stuart periods===\nThe traditions established in the medieval period continued later. By the middle of the 15th&nbsp;century, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], Easter, Whitsun, [[All Saints' Day]], and one or both feasts of St&nbsp;Edward.<ref>Keay, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>{{efn|Edward the Confessor's feast day was 13 October and [[Edward the Martyr]]'s 18 March.}} A crown was displayed and worn at the annual [[State Opening of Parliament]],<ref>David Dean in Hoak, \"Image and ritual in the Tudor parliaments\", p. 243.</ref> and three were placed on the heads of monarchs at a coronation: St&nbsp;Edward's Crown, the state crown, and a \"rich crown\" made specially for the king or queen.<ref>Arnold, pp. 731\u2013732.</ref>\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Coronation portrait of Elizabeth I in a gold robe trimmed with ermine and decorated with silver-coloured Tudor roses.

The best known example of this was [[Henry&nbsp;VIII's Crown]]. Its date of manufacture is unknown, but it was probably created at the beginning of the Tudor dynasty, maybe in the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry&nbsp;VII]]. The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in English law when [[James I of England|James&nbsp;I]] decreed in 1605: \"Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme\".<ref name=\"keay32\"/>{{efn|For a schedule of royal jewels see John Nichols (1828), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DaLUvAQAAMAAJ&pg{{=}}PA45 ''The Progresses, etc. of King James the First''], vol. 2, p. 45.}} After James died in 1625, [[Charles I of England|Charles&nbsp;I]] succeeded to the throne. Desperate for money, one of his first acts as king was to load 41 masterpieces from the Jewel House onto a ship bound for [[Amsterdam]] \u2013 the hub of Europe's jewel trade. This hoard of unique bejewelled pieces, like the [[Mirror of Great Britain]], a {{convert|4.7|kg|lb|adj=on}} gold salt cellar known as the Morris Dance, and much fine Elizabethan plate, was expected to swell the king's coffers by \u00a3300,000, but they fetched \u00a370,000.<ref>Philippa Glanville in Abramova and Dmitrieva, \"The Goldsmiths and the Court: Silver in London 1600\u201365\", p. 52; Collins, p. 168.</ref>\n\nCharles's many conflicts with Parliament, stemming from his belief in the [[divine right of kings]] and the many religious conflicts that pervaded his reign, triggered the [[English Civil War]] in 1642.<ref>Keay, pp. 37\u201338.</ref> Parliament deemed the regalia as \"Jewels of the Crown\", vested in the monarch because of his public role as king, and not owned by him personally.<ref>Barker, p. 46.</ref> To avoid putting his own subjects at risk, Charles and his wife once again raised money by exporting royal jewels at a heavy discount.

Less than a week after the king's execution, the [[Rump Parliament]] voted to abolish the monarchy. The newly created [[English Republic]] found itself short of money.

Gold spurs are first known to have been used in 1189 at the coronation of Richard&nbsp;I, though it is likely they were introduced for [[Henry the Young King]] in 1170, and this element of the service was probably inspired by the initiation ceremony of knights.

Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband George&nbsp;VI in 1937. For the coronation of Mary&nbsp;II, the wife and joint sovereign of William&nbsp;III, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689.

They feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recent pieces were designed to reflect the monarch's role as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].\n\nUse of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to when it was converted to Christianity in the Middle Ages. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to [[Edward the Confessor]], was established after he was made a saint in the 12th&nbsp;century. They were holy relics kept at [[Westminster Abbey]] \u2013 venue of coronations since 1066. Another set was used at religious feasts and [[State Openings of Parliament]]. Collectively, these objects came to be known as the Jewels of [[the Crown]]. Most of the present collection dates from around 350 years ago when [[Charles II of England|Charles&nbsp;II]] ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649 during the [[English Civil War]]. Only four original items pre-date the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]: a late 12th-century anointing spoon (the oldest object) and three early 17th-century swords. Upon the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs; the Scottish regalia are known today as the [[Honours of Scotland]].\n\nThe regalia contain 23,578 stones, among them [[Cullinan&nbsp;I]] ({{convert|530|carat|g|0}}), the largest clear cut diamond in the world, set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the Cullinan, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to [[Edward&nbsp;VII]]. On the [[Imperial State Crown]] are [[Cullinan&nbsp;II]] ({{convert|317|carat|g|0}}), the [[Stuart Sapphire]], [[St&nbsp;Edward's Sapphire]], and the [[Black Prince's Ruby]]&nbsp;\u2013 a large spinel given to [[Edward the Black Prince]] by a Spanish king in 1367. The [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond ({{convert|105|carat|g|0}}), originally from India, was forfeited to [[Queen Victoria]] and has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of historical objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystals.\n\nAt a coronation the monarch is anointed using [[Chrism|holy oil]] poured from an [[ampulla]] into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with [[St&nbsp;Edward's Crown]]. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings are invested with a plainer set of regalia,{{efn|Husbands of [[queens regnant]] are not crowned in the United Kingdom.<ref>Allison and Riddell, p. 451.</ref>}} and since 1831 a new crown has been made specially for each [[queen consort]]. Also regarded as [[Crown Jewels]] are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. They are part of the [[Royal Collection]] and belong to the institution of monarchy, passing from one sovereign to the next.

Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity.

Also known as [[St&nbsp;George]]'s Spurs, they are one of the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as head of the Armed Forces. Gold spurs are first known to have been used in 1189 at the coronation of Richard&nbsp;I, though it is likely they were introduced for [[Henry the Young King]] in 1170, and this element of the service was probably inspired by the initiation ceremony of knights. A pair of  mid 14th-century spurs were added to St&nbsp;Edward's regalia at the Abbey in 1399 and used at all coronations until they were destroyed in 1649.<ref>Rose, pp. 50\u201352.</ref> Historically, spurs were fastened to a monarch's feet, but since the Restoration they are simply brushed against the heels of kings or shown to queens.<ref>Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 22.</ref>\n\n===Armills===\nThe [[Armill]]s are gold bracelets of sincerity and wisdom.<ref>Barker, p. 94.</ref> Like spurs, they were first used at English coronations in the 12th&nbsp;century.<ref>Rose, p. 52.</ref> By the 17th century, armills were no longer delivered to the monarch, but simply carried at the coronation.

The gold ring has a large ruby etched with a [[St&nbsp;George's Cross]] and bordered by 26 diamonds.

Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband George&nbsp;VI in 1937. For the coronation of Mary&nbsp;II, the wife and joint sovereign of William&nbsp;III, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689.
