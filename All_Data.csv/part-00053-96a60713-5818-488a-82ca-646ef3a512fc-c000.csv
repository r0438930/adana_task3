''The Voice'' garnered mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s. [[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries gave praise to the album's three singles and \"Give Me a Call\" but felt the rest of the track listing contained \"redundant cuts and overdone party numbers\" with Jones' overused gimmicky catchphrases. He called the record a \"significant step up\" from ''[[The American Dream (Mike Jones album)|The American Dream]]'' EP.<ref name=\"AM\"/> Nathan Slavik of DJBooth highlighted both \"Next to You\" and \"Cuddy Buddy\" as potential radio chart-toppers but found the album going into \"unlistenable territory\" with tracks ranging from a \"half-baked\" dance craze (\"Drop & Gimmie 50\"), butchering of a celebratory anthem (\"Happy Birthday\") and full-on misogyny (\"Scandalous Hoes II\"). Slavik concluded by giving his take on Jones' next project: \"Sadly expectations will be low after ''The Voice'', here's hoping he truly delivers something unexpected.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/> Conversely, Steve 'Flash' Juon from ''RapReviews'' praised Jones for delivering a decently paced album that has catchy beats to invigorate the collaborative tracks while also showcasing both his lyrical and vocal improvements from the past four years, concluding with \"Regardless of the reasons it's clear that Mike Jones is a more seasoned and polished pro of the rap game, and ''The Voice'' is planning to have a long career in hip-hop music. Let's hope there's no more politics and bullshit getting in the way of his career.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/>

'''Werner Olk''' (born 18 January 1938) is a German former professional [[Association football|footballer]] and coach.

He spent his career in the 1960s through to 1970 with German club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[Bundesliga]].  His honors with Bayern include the [[DFB-Pokal]] in 1966, 1967 and 1969; winner of the German Championship in 1969; and winner of the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1967. After the promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965 until 1970 Olk served as Bayern's captain, a function in which he was succeeded by [[Franz Beckenbauer]].

Olk started his football career as a youth player with SG Letter 05 (Hannover region) in 1948 and eventually switched into the youth team of TuS Seelze in Nachbarort. Before his transfer to Bayern Munich, he played 1956/57 in the [[Oberliga Nord]] with [[Arminia Hannover]] and after the relegation of the club from 1957 to 1960 in the second tier, which in this part of Northern Germany was the [[Amateuroberliga Niedersachsen]].

Olk played his only cap for the [[German National Football Team]] in 1961.  He was an available member of the German squad at the 1962 [[FIFA World Cup]] in Chile. In the Amateur squad of the German National Team, Olk was called up three times. He was also called up into the Youth National Team in 1961 for a match against England.

After his time with Bayern he became [[player-manager]] with Swiss second division side [[FC Aarau]]. He stayed there until 1973, although he had been relieved of his manager duties by December 1972 and been replaced in this function by [[Jiří Sobotka|Jiří \"Georges\" Sobotka]].<ref>''[https://www.tagblatt.ch/sport/fcstgallen/st-galler-trainer-der-sechste-deutsche-ld.152072 St. Galler Trainer: Der sechste Deutsche]'', [[St. Galler Tagblatt]], 17 September 2015</ref> After this Olk became a manager for German clubs such as [[Eintracht Braunschweig]], [[SV Darmstadt 98]] (with which he achieved promotion to the Bundesliga in 1981), [[SC Freiburg]], [[SC Preußen Münster]] and [[Karlsruher SC]] (with which he achieved promotion to the Bundesliga in 1984).

'''Lapua''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈlɑpuɑ|lang}}; {{lang-sv|Lappo}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Finland|town]] and [[municipalities of Finland|municipality]] of [[Finland]].

It is located next to the Lapua River in the [[regions of Finland|region]] of [[South Ostrobothnia]]. The town has a population of {{formatnum:
{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Lapua}}}}
({{#time: j F Y|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate}}
}})<ref name=\"population_count\" /> and covers an area of {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/total area|Lapua}}|km2}} of
which {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/waters area|Lapua}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name=\"total_area\" /> The [[population density]] is {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population density|Lapua|round=2}}|PD/km2}}. The municipality is unilingually [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

==History==
In the early 14th century, permanent settlement began to spread to the Lapuanjoki Valley. Residents came from, among other areas, the settlement center of Suur-Sastamala in Upper Satakunta, which had good land and water connections to the north. The focus of Ostrobothnia's settlement was initially on the lower reaches of the Kyrönjoki River. The proximity to the sea of the Kvarken area, which is rich in natural resources, was especially attractive. Lapua at that time had some Lapps who considered the region their wilderness area. The name Lapuan was probably given by the coastal Swedes precisely because of the Lapps who lived in the area.

The [[Battle of Lapua]] was fought between Swedish and [[Russia]]n forces near the outskirts of the town on 14 July 1808 as part of the [[Finnish War]].
Lapua is the seat of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran]] [[Diocese of Lapua]]. The [[Lapua Cathedral]], designed by [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], was built in 1827. In the 1930s the radical [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ''[[Lapua Movement]]'' was founded and named after the town.

== Lapua State Cartridge Factory ==
Lapua is also home to a large [[ammunition]] factory, which commenced operations in 1927 as the ''State Cartridge Factory''.  This factory was the primary supplier of [[ammunition]] to the [[Finnish Army]] during the [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War|World War II]]. [[Lapua Cartridge Factory explosion|An explosion occurred]] in a warehouse of this factory on 13 April 1976, resulting in the deaths of 40 employees, mainly women. Sixty children lost a parent in the disaster. This is the worst accidental disaster in Finland's modern history.  After the explosion, the factory was relocated {{convert|5|km|0}} away from the town centre and continues production today as part of the Nordic Ammunition Group ([[Nammo]]) as [[Nammo Lapua]]. The original site of the factory and the surviving buildings are now an arts centre, a library and a theater.

LGA stands for [[land grid array]]. Its incompatible successor is [[LGA 1155]].

The last processors supporting it ceased production in 2011. 

LGA 1156, along with [[LGA 1366]], were designed to replace [[LGA 775]]. Whereas LGA 775 processors connect to a [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] using the [[Front Side Bus]], LGA 1156 processors integrate the features traditionally located on a northbridge within the processor itself.  The LGA 1156 socket allows the following connections to be made from the processor to the rest of the system:

* PCI-Express 2.0 ×16 for communication with a graphics card.  Some processors allow this connection to be divided into two ×8 lanes to connect two graphics cards.  Some motherboard manufacturers use [[Nvidia|Nvidia's]] NF200 chip to allow even more graphics cards to be used.
* [[Direct Media Interface|DMI]] for communication with the [[Platform Controller Hub]] (PCH).  This consists of a PCI-Express 2.0 ×4 connection.
* [[Flexible Display Interface|FDI]] for communication with the [[Platform Controller Hub|PCH]]. This consists of two [[DisplayPort]] connections.
* Two memory channels for communication with DDR3 SDRAM.  The clock speed of the memory that is supported will depend on the processor.

The LGA 1156 and LGA 1366 sockets and processors were discontinued sometime in 2012,<ref name=\"1366dis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.techspot.com/news/46589-intel-to-discontinue-lga-1366-and-lga-1156-processors-in-2012.html |title=Intel to discontinue LGA 1366 and LGA 1156 processors in 2012 |date=December 8, 2011<!--, 11:30 AM EST  -->|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> having been superseded by the [[LGA 1155]] and [[LGA 2011]] respectively.

All LGA 1156 processors and motherboards made to date are interoperable, making it possible to switch between a Celeron, Pentium, Core i3 or Core i5 with integrated graphics and a Core i5 or Core i7 without graphics. However, using a chip with integrated graphics on a P55 motherboard will (in addition to likely requiring a BIOS update) not allow use of the on-board graphics processor, and likewise, using a chip without integrated graphics on a H55, H57 or Q57 motherboard will not allow use of the motherboard's graphics ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techreport.com/articles.x/18216/3|title=Intel's Core i3 and i5 dual-core processors|publisher=}}</ref>

'''Nammo''', short for '''Nordic Ammunition Company''', is a Norwegian/Finnish aerospace and defence group specialized in production of [[ammunition]], [[rocket engine]]s and space applications. The company has subsidiaries in  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. The company is owned 50/50 by the Norwegian Government (represented by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries]]) and the Finnish defence company [[Patria (company)|Patria]]. The company has its [[headquarter]]s in [[Raufoss|Raufoss, Norway]].

The company has five business units: Small Caliber Division, Medium & Large Caliber Division, Missile Products Division, Demil Division and '''Nammo Talley'''.

==History==
Nammo was founded in 1998 by [[Raufoss Ammunisjonsfabrikk|Raufoss]] (Norway), Patria (Finland) and [[Celsius AB|Celsius]] (Sweden). The [[Lapua]] cartridge factory in Finland is also part of the Nammo group as Nammo Lapua Oy. In 2005, the present joint ownership between Patria and the Norwegian Government was established.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapua.com/en/lapua/history-of-lapua.html|title=History of Lapua|website=Nammo Lapua|language=en|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122071902/http://www.lapua.com/en/lapua/history-of-lapua.html|archive-date=22 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2007, Nammo acquired the US munitions company Talley, Inc. after purchasing 100% of its shares. In 2009, it was revealed the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] purchased 28,000 [[M72 LAW|M72 LAWs]] from Nammo Talley, along with weapons parts and training missiles valued at NOK 600 million. These munitions would later be used in [[Operation Cast Lead]].<ref name=nrk>{{cite news |last1=Leer-Salvesen |first1=Tarjei |last2=Thorleifsson |first2=Renie |last3=Martiniussen |first3=Erik |date=10 February 2009 |access-date=24 October 2018 |language=norwegian |trans-title=Norway Profits from Weapon Sales to Israel |title=Norge tjener på våpensalg til Israel |agency=NRK |url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/israel-bruker-norske-vapen-1.6467936}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |access-date=24 October 2018 |language=en |title=Israel - M72A7 Light Anti-Armor Weapons (LAAWs) |agency=DSCA |url=https://fido.nrk.no/8d471ebe842e561d6c3c6f62e55ce640a74b7913fe6d809d25c3bd262569cc5e/israel_08-87.pdf}}</ref> According Nammo Raufoss Administrative Director Lars Harald Lied, the company also produces 12.7mm \"multi-purpose\" ammunition<ref>{{cite web |last=Vingelsgård |first=Lars |date=10 February 2010 |access-date=24 October 2018 |title=«Deler kroppen i to» |language=Norwegian |trans-title=\"Splits the Body in Two\" |url=https://dusken.no/artikkel/21771/deler-kroppen-i-to/ |publisher=Under Dusken}}</ref> that is used by both American and Norwegian soldiers in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], often in contravention of [[Expanding_bullet#International_law|international law]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Nilas |last=Johnsen |date=7 October 2008 |access-date=24 October 2018 |agency=VG |title=Dreper fra 1380 meter |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Kills from 1380 meters |url=https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/WQ2qQ/dreper-fra-1380-meter}}</ref>

In addition to alleged international law violations, the company has also caused controversy in Norway, whose laws prohibit Norwegian companies from selling munitions for conflict purposes. Nammo Information Director Sissel Solum alleges that Nammo bears no responsibility for the use of their munitions after purchase, although some claim (including the [[Norwegian Church Aid]] and [[Peace Research Institute Oslo|PRIO]]) that this is a breach of the intended spirit of national export regulations.<ref name=nrk /><ref>{{cite news |last=Løkeland-Stai |first=Espen |trans-title=From Nammo to Israel |language=Norwegian |title=Fra Nammo til Israel |date=26 November 2015 |access-date=24 October 2018 |agency=Dagsavisen |url=https://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/fra-nammo-til-israel-1.468054}}</ref> The company has also been able to circumvent Norwegian laws and avoid prosecution by outsourcing manufacturing to plants in the US, Finland, and Sweden.<ref name= nrk />

'''Nammo''', short for '''Nordic Ammunition Company''', is a Norwegian/Finnish aerospace and defence group specialized in production of [[ammunition]], [[rocket engine]]s and space applications. The company has subsidiaries in  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. The company is owned 50/50 by the Norwegian Government (represented by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries]]) and the Finnish defence company [[Patria (company)|Patria]]. The company has its [[headquarter]]s in [[Raufoss|Raufoss, Norway]].

The company has five business units: Small Caliber Division, Medium & Large Caliber Division, Missile Products Division, Demil Division and '''Nammo Talley'''.

==History==
Nammo was founded in 1998 by [[Raufoss Ammunisjonsfabrikk|Raufoss]] (Norway), Patria (Finland) and [[Celsius AB|Celsius]] (Sweden). The [[Lapua]] cartridge factory in Finland is also part of the Nammo group as Nammo Lapua Oy. In 2005, the present joint ownership between Patria and the Norwegian Government was established.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapua.com/en/lapua/history-of-lapua.html|title=History of Lapua|website=Nammo Lapua|language=en|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122071902/http://www.lapua.com/en/lapua/history-of-lapua.html|archive-date=22 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2007, Nammo acquired the US munitions company Talley, Inc. after purchasing 100% of its shares. In 2009, it was revealed the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] purchased 28,000 [[M72 LAW|M72 LAWs]] from Nammo Talley, along with weapons parts and training missiles valued at NOK 600 million. These munitions would later be used in [[Operation Cast Lead]].<ref name=nrk>{{cite news |last1=Leer-Salvesen |first1=Tarjei |last2=Thorleifsson |first2=Renie |last3=Martiniussen |first3=Erik |date=10 February 2009 |access-date=24 October 2018 |language=norwegian |trans-title=Norway Profits from Weapon Sales to Israel |title=Norge tjener på våpensalg til Israel |agency=NRK |url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/israel-bruker-norske-vapen-1.6467936}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |access-date=24 October 2018 |language=en |title=Israel - M72A7 Light Anti-Armor Weapons (LAAWs) |agency=DSCA |url=https://fido.nrk.no/8d471ebe842e561d6c3c6f62e55ce640a74b7913fe6d809d25c3bd262569cc5e/israel_08-87.pdf}}</ref> According Nammo Raufoss Administrative Director Lars Harald Lied, the company also produces 12.7mm \"multi-purpose\" ammunition<ref>{{cite web |last=Vingelsgård |first=Lars |date=10 February 2010 |access-date=24 October 2018 |title=«Deler kroppen i to» |language=Norwegian |trans-title=\"Splits the Body in Two\" |url=https://dusken.no/artikkel/21771/deler-kroppen-i-to/ |publisher=Under Dusken}}</ref> that is used by both American and Norwegian soldiers in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], often in contravention of [[Expanding_bullet#International_law|international law]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Nilas |last=Johnsen |date=7 October 2008 |access-date=24 October 2018 |agency=VG |title=Dreper fra 1380 meter |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Kills from 1380 meters |url=https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/WQ2qQ/dreper-fra-1380-meter}}</ref>

In addition to alleged international law violations, the company has also caused controversy in Norway, whose laws prohibit Norwegian companies from selling munitions for conflict purposes. Nammo Information Director Sissel Solum alleges that Nammo bears no responsibility for the use of their munitions after purchase, although some claim (including the [[Norwegian Church Aid]] and [[Peace Research Institute Oslo|PRIO]]) that this is a breach of the intended spirit of national export regulations.<ref name=nrk /><ref>{{cite news |last=Løkeland-Stai |first=Espen |trans-title=From Nammo to Israel |language=Norwegian |title=Fra Nammo til Israel |date=26 November 2015 |access-date=24 October 2018 |agency=Dagsavisen |url=https://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/fra-nammo-til-israel-1.468054}}</ref> The company has also been able to circumvent Norwegian laws and avoid prosecution by outsourcing manufacturing to plants in the US, Finland, and Sweden.<ref name= nrk />

LGA stands for [[land grid array]]. Its incompatible successor is [[LGA 1155]].

The last processors supporting it ceased production in 2011. 

LGA 1156, along with [[LGA 1366]], were designed to replace [[LGA 775]]. Whereas LGA 775 processors connect to a [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] using the [[Front Side Bus]], LGA 1156 processors integrate the features traditionally located on a northbridge within the processor itself.  The LGA 1156 socket allows the following connections to be made from the processor to the rest of the system:

* PCI-Express 2.0 ×16 for communication with a graphics card.  Some processors allow this connection to be divided into two ×8 lanes to connect two graphics cards.  Some motherboard manufacturers use [[Nvidia|Nvidia's]] NF200 chip to allow even more graphics cards to be used.
* [[Direct Media Interface|DMI]] for communication with the [[Platform Controller Hub]] (PCH).  This consists of a PCI-Express 2.0 ×4 connection.
* [[Flexible Display Interface|FDI]] for communication with the [[Platform Controller Hub|PCH]]. This consists of two [[DisplayPort]] connections.
* Two memory channels for communication with DDR3 SDRAM.  The clock speed of the memory that is supported will depend on the processor.

The LGA 1156 and LGA 1366 sockets and processors were discontinued sometime in 2012,<ref name=\"1366dis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.techspot.com/news/46589-intel-to-discontinue-lga-1366-and-lga-1156-processors-in-2012.html |title=Intel to discontinue LGA 1366 and LGA 1156 processors in 2012 |date=December 8, 2011<!--, 11:30 AM EST  -->|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> having been superseded by the [[LGA 1155]] and [[LGA 2011]] respectively.

For [[LGA 1156]] the 4 holes for fastening the heatsink to the motherboard are placed in a square with a lateral length of 75&nbsp;mm. This configuration was retained for the later, LGA 1155, [[LGA 1150]], and [[LGA 1151]] sockets meaning that cooling solutions should generally be interchangeable.

All LGA 1156 processors and motherboards made to date are interoperable, making it possible to switch between a Celeron, Pentium, Core i3 or Core i5 with integrated graphics and a Core i5 or Core i7 without graphics. However, using a chip with integrated graphics on a P55 motherboard will (in addition to likely requiring a BIOS update) not allow use of the on-board graphics processor, and likewise, using a chip without integrated graphics on a H55, H57 or Q57 motherboard will not allow use of the motherboard's graphics ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techreport.com/articles.x/18216/3|title=Intel's Core i3 and i5 dual-core processors|publisher=}}</ref>

==Supported chipsets==
{{main|Intel 5 Series}}
The Desktop chipsets that support LGA 1156 are Intel's H55, H57, [[Intel P55|P55]], and Q57. Server chipsets supporting the socket are Intel's 3400, 3420 and 3450.

All LGA 1156 processors and motherboards made to date are interoperable, making it possible to switch between a Celeron, Pentium, Core i3 or Core i5 with integrated graphics and a Core i5 or Core i7 without graphics. However, using a chip with integrated graphics on a P55 motherboard will (in addition to likely requiring a BIOS update) not allow use of the on-board graphics processor, and likewise, using a chip without integrated graphics on a H55, H57 or Q57 motherboard will not allow use of the motherboard's graphics ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techreport.com/articles.x/18216/3|title=Intel's Core i3 and i5 dual-core processors|publisher=}}</ref>

==Supported chipsets==
{{main|Intel 5 Series}}
The Desktop chipsets that support LGA 1156 are Intel's H55, H57, [[Intel P55|P55]], and Q57. Server chipsets supporting the socket are Intel's 3400, 3420 and 3450.

'''Sanskrit Cinema''' is a part of [[Indian cinema]]. Very few films in [[Sanskrit]] have been made so far. There is no separate industry set for Sanskrit films.

==Testimony and media==

Haney has served as an [[expert witness]] in several influential [[United States Federal Court]] cases related to the prison environment and punishment, including: Toussaint v. McCarthy (1984), Madrid v. Gomez (1995), Coleman v. Brown (1995), and Ruiz v. Johnson (1999).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://studentorgs.law.unc.edu/crcge/conferences/2016/panelists/|title=Panelists' Biographies|website=studentorgs.law.unc.edu|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> Moreover, Haney's work was influential in the [[United States Supreme Court]] 5-4 ruling of [[Brown v. Plata]] (2011), which upheld a lower court ruling that the California prison population be reduced.<ref name=\"Sant Cruz Sentinel\">{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/ZZ/20141017/NEWS/141019110|publisher=Santa cruz Sentinel|title=UCSC Professor Honored for Prison Research|author=Kara Guzman|date=October 17, 2014|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref> Commenting on this last case, Haney stated: \"When prisons are unduly painful, they become harmful and the system begins to break down and fail.\" He noted further, \"Prisoners can carry the consequences of that harm back out into the free world once they're released. I was very gratified to see the Supreme Court embrace that concept”.

In 2012, Haney testified before the [[Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights]] of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] at a hearing on “Reassessing [[Solitary confinement|Solitary Confinement]]”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://solitarywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/transcript-of-the-hearing.pdf|title=Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights Holds Hearing on Reassessing Solitary Confinement, Panel 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

'''Craig Haney''' is an American social psychologist and a  professor at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], noted for his work on the study of capital punishment and the psychological impact of imprisonment and prison isolation since the 1970s.<ref name=psychology.ucsc.edu>{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz_id=psylaw|title= University of California faculty profile for Craig Haney|accessdate=November 7, 2016}}</ref> He was a researcher on [[The Stanford Prison Experiment]].

==Education==

Haney obtained his B.A from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and his M.A., Ph.D. in Psychology and J.D. in Law from [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ucjusticehealth.com/uc-santa-cruz|title=UC Santa Cruz|website=University of California Criminal Justice & Health Consortium|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

==Career==

In 1971, while at Stanford, Haney collaborated with [[Philip Zimbardo]] in conducting what is known today as The Stanford Prison Experiment,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prisonexp.org/escape|title=7. Escape|website=Stanford Prison Experiment|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> for which Haney served as a principal researcher.  This experience help to set in course Haney’s subsequent career and work with prison systems. It ingrained in Haney that “context matters, prisoners are people, mistreatment has consequences”, and perpetuated his passion about the psychological impact of incarceration, and his advocacy for humanization and reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fenichel.com/ZimSPE40.shtml|title=Fenichel's Current Topics in Psychology - Phillip Zimbardo: 40th Anniversary of the Stanford Prison Experiment - APA Convention 2011|website=www.fenichel.com|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/health/solitary-confinement-mental-illness.html?_r=2|title=Solitary Confinement Mental Illness|publisher=The New York Times|author=Erica Goode|date=August 9, 2015}}</ref>

Haney is a Distinguished Professor of Psychology and the UCSC Presidential Chair (for a three-year term which runs from 2015 until 2018) at the [[University of California Santa Cruz]]<ref>http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/presidential-chair.html</ref> where he has been a member the faculty for some 39 years.

==Testimony and media==

Haney has served as an [[expert witness]] in several influential [[United States Federal Court]] cases related to the prison environment and punishment, including: Toussaint v. McCarthy (1984), Madrid v. Gomez (1995), Coleman v. Brown (1995), and Ruiz v. Johnson (1999).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://studentorgs.law.unc.edu/crcge/conferences/2016/panelists/|title=Panelists' Biographies|website=studentorgs.law.unc.edu|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> Moreover, Haney's work was influential in the [[United States Supreme Court]] 5-4 ruling of [[Brown v. Plata]] (2011), which upheld a lower court ruling that the California prison population be reduced.<ref name=\"Sant Cruz Sentinel\">{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/ZZ/20141017/NEWS/141019110|publisher=Santa cruz Sentinel|title=UCSC Professor Honored for Prison Research|author=Kara Guzman|date=October 17, 2014|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref> Commenting on this last case, Haney stated: \"When prisons are unduly painful, they become harmful and the system begins to break down and fail.\" He noted further, \"Prisoners can carry the consequences of that harm back out into the free world once they're released. I was very gratified to see the Supreme Court embrace that concept”.

In 2012, Haney testified before the [[Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights]] of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] at a hearing on “Reassessing [[Solitary confinement|Solitary Confinement]]”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://solitarywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/transcript-of-the-hearing.pdf|title=Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights Holds Hearing on Reassessing Solitary Confinement, Panel 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

'''''Atrypa''''' is a genus of [[brachiopod]] with shells round to short egg-shaped, covered with many fine radial ridges (or costae), that split further out and growthlines perpendicular to the costae and 2-3 times wider spaced. The pedunculate valve is a little convex, but tends to level out or even become slightly concave toward the anterior margin (that is: opposite hinge and pedicle). The brachial valve is highly convex. There is no interarea (that is a flat area bordering the hinge line approximately perpendicular with the rest of the valve) in either valve. ''Atrypa'' was a cosmopolitan and occurred from the late Lower Silurian ([[Telychian]]) to the early Upper Devonian ([[Frasnian]]).<ref name='Treatise'>{{cite book|last= Moore|first= R.C.|year= 1965|title= Brachiopoda|publisher= Geological Society of America/University of Kansas Press|series= [[Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology]]|volume= Part H., Volume 1 and 2|pages= |location= Boulder, Colorado/Lawrence, Kansas|isbn= 0-8137-3015-5}}</ref> Other sources expand the range from the [[Ordovician|Late Ordovician]] to [[Carboniferous]], approximately from 449 to 336 Ma.<ref name=FWAtrypa>[http://fossilworks.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo&taxon_no=21443 ''Atrypa''] at [[Fossilworks]].org</ref> A proposed new species, ''A. harrisi'', was found in the trilobite-rich [[Floresta Formation]] in [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], Colombia.<ref name=FWFloresta>[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&collection_no=36012 Floresta Series Fauna] at [[Fossilworks]].org</ref>

'''''Inside Out V''''' is the sixth record by [[MC Hammer]], released in 1995. It marks his fifth official major-label [[Album#Studio|studio album]]. After the decrease in popularity and sales of his previous album, ''[[The Funky Headhunter]]'', Hammer returned to his previous [[Pop music|pop]] [[persona|image]].

''Inside Out'' featured dance gospel, and emotionally driven tracks{{cn|date=May 2018}} and spawned two singles, \"Sultry Funk\" and the gospel single \"Goin' Up Yonder\", while another track, \"Nothing But Love (A Song for Eazy)\", was dedicated to [[Eazy-E]], who had died in 1995. In contrast to his prior albums, the singles did not go as far as previous releases. 

The album peaked at number 23 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart but only reached number 119 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], causing [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] to drop Hammer and his Oaktown Records subsidiary from the label.

'''Maryam Amid Semnani''' ({{lang-fa|مریم عمید سمنانی}}), was an intellectual and a journalist during the [[Qajar era]]. In 1913, she published the second Iranian women's magazine called ''Shokoufeh Newspaper''. She was also the founder of Iranian Women's Society, which was popular with a reported peak of five thousand memberships. <ref>https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=L-T-ng2v47QC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=Maryam+Amid&source=bl&ots=Wr8cqnmByp&sig=ACfU3U1yVVgATI-Gub-DVegkfbzLhrNb-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5le3I8N3oAhXHDGMBHdX-DM84ChDoATADegQICxAw#v=onepage&q=Maryam%20Amid&f=false</ref>

[[File:Maryam amid.jpg|thumb|Maryam amid]]

°== Biography ==
Maryam Amid was the third Mir Seyed Razi Semnani's daughter, the first representative of [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] and [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] in the [[National Assembly]], who was also known as \"Reyis Al-Atabeh,\" doctor of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] and Mirza Ibrahim Amid al-Saltanah. Maryam Amid was born in Semnan and studied primary education with her father. Later, she learned French and photography. At age 16, she married Hosseini Prince Mirza Emad al-Saltanah Salvar.  After only one year of marriage, Maryam secured a divorce. 

Seven years later, Maryam married an intellectual named Qawamul Hakmah. They had two kids together. Seven years after her marrige, Qawamul died leaving Maryam to raise their two children by herself.<ref> Truth, Abdul Rafiee. The first female journalist in Iran, Ghohar, numbers 11–12 (December 1973 – January 1974) .</ref>

== Career ==
Maryam did a lot of important things in her life. Maryam Amid Semnani published a [[women's magazine]] named ''Shokoufeh,'' which provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].

== The establishment of a girls’ school ==
The establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and most enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.

Due to the patriarchal circumstances of society at the time and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school until the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches and one of which was Dar al-'Elm. Various subjects were taught in this branch including reading, writing, mathematics, geography, and foreign languages. The condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This branch was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>

== First Iranian woman journalist ==
At a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, was published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. 

Maryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.

The following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />
{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}

== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==
The ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second significant dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910–1911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.

The features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.

=== From copies to caricaturing	===
The newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nastaʿlīq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also the final page of each issue was decorated with a [[caricature]], referring to the subject matter that the issue was about.  From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />

== Hemat Association ==
The Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls’ schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. 

== War with superstition ==
The struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose oppression  and her reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and compared the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially  of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and fundamental way to improve women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Death ==
Maryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack.

°== Biography ==
Maryam Amid was the third Mir Seyed Razi Semnani's daughter, the first representative of [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] and [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] in the [[National Assembly]], who was also known as \"Reyis Al-Atabeh,\" doctor of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] and Mirza Ibrahim Amid al-Saltanah. Maryam Amid was born in Semnan and studied primary education with her father. Later, she learned French and photography. At age 16, she married Hosseini Prince Mirza Emad al-Saltanah Salvar.  After only one year of marriage, Maryam secured a divorce. 

Seven years later, Maryam married an intellectual named Qawamul Hakmah. They had two kids together. Seven years after her marrige, Qawamul died leaving Maryam to raise their two children by herself.<ref> Truth, Abdul Rafiee. The first female journalist in Iran, Ghohar, numbers 11–12 (December 1973 – January 1974) .</ref>

== Career ==
Maryam Amid Semnani published a [[women's magazine]] named ''Shokoufeh,'' which provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].

== The establishment of a girls’ school ==
The establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and most enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.

Due to the patriarchal circumstances of society at the time and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school until the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches and one of which was Dar al-'Elm. Various subjects were taught in this branch including reading, writing, mathematics, geography, and foreign languages. The condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This branch was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>

== First Iranian woman journalist ==
At a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, was published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. 

Maryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.

The following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />
{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}

== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==
The ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second significant dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910–1911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.

The features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.

=== From copies to caricaturing	===
The newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nastaʿlīq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also the final page of each issue was decorated with a [[caricature]], referring to the subject matter that the issue was about.  From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />

== Hemat Association ==
The Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls’ schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. 

== War with superstition ==
The struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose oppression  and her reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and compared the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially  of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and fundamental way to improve women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Death ==
Maryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack.

The '''Brazilian three-banded armadillo''' (''Tolypeutes tricinctus'') is an [[armadillo]] [[species]] endemic to eastern [[Brazil]], where it is known as {{lang|pt|tatu-bola}} ({{IPA-pt|tɐˈtu ˈbɔlɐ}}, lit. ball armadillo). It is one of only two species of armadillo that can roll into a ball (the other is the [[Southern Three-banded Armadillo|southern three-banded armadillo]]). It has suffered a 30% decline in population in the last 10 years.

==Names==
It was known as '''kwaráu''' in the extinct [[Huamoé language]] of the [[Serra Negra Biological Reserve|Serra Negra]] in [[Pernambuco]] State, Brazil.<ref name=\"Pompeu\">Pompeu Sobrinho, Thomaz. 1958. ''Línguas Tapuias desconhecidas do Nordeste: Alguns vocabulários inéditos''. Boletim de Antropologia (Fortaleza-Ceará) 2. 3-19.</ref>

==Habitat==
The Brazilian three-banded armadillo lives primarily in open [[savannah]]s (''[[Cerrado]]'') and dry [[woodland]]s (''[[Caatinga]]''), where low rainfall and poor soil limit the vegetation to tall, woody [[grass]]es, scattered bushes, and gnarled trees. There is an abundance of [[cactus]]-like plants in the northern reaches of its range.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\">''Wildlife Explorer: Three-Banded Armadillo''. USA: International Masters Publishers, 1998.</ref>

==Range==
As its name suggests, the Brazilian three-banded armadillo is indigenous to Brazil, living primarily in the northeastern part of the country, just south of the [[equator]]. They are rarely seen west of 50°W longitude.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Diet==
The main staples of its diet are [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s, which it can smell through up to 20 centimeters of soil. It finds food by shuffling slowly along with its nose to the ground. When it detects prey, it frantically digs a hole and thrust its nose into it, using its long, sticky tongue to lap up any [[insect]]s it may find. Other foods include [[mollusk]]s, [[worm]]s, [[fruit]], and [[carrion]].<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Anatomy==
[[File: Dasypodidae - Tolypeutes tricinctus.JPG|thumb|220px|left|''Tolypeutes tricinctus''. Museum specimen]]
Brazilian three-banded armadillos have a head-and-body length of about {{convert|22|to|27|cm|abbr=on}} and the tail is between {{convert|6|and|8|cm|abbr=on}} long. They weigh {{convert|1|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=ArmOn>Armadillo Online: ''[http://armadillo-online.org/tolypeutes.html Tolypeutes tricinctus.]'' Retrieved 14 June 2014.</ref> The armor is composed of [[ossification|ossified dermal scutes]] covered by nonoverlapping, [[keratinization|keratinized]] epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, ears, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside of the body and the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection, and are covered instead by long, coarse hair. The [[genus]] ''Tolypeutes'', which includes both the Brazilian and southern species of three-banded armadillos, is unique in the ability to roll up in a tight, almost impenetrable ball. This is because their armor is slightly looser than that of other armadillo genera, which allows for greater freedom of movement. The loose armor also creates a layer of air between the shell and the body, which insulates the animal. This higher capacity for [[thermoregulation]] allows them to survive in climates too arid for some of the other armadillo species. When the armadillo rolls into a defensive ball, the ears are tucked into the shell and the head and tail interlock to seal the shell completely. The teeth are soft and peg-like, adapted solely for smashing the exoskeletons of insects.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Behavior==
[[File:Brazilian three-banded armadillo (Tolypeutes tricinctus) 2, Natural History Museum, London, Mammals Gallery.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''Tolypeutes tricinctus'' rolled into a defensive ball]]
Armadillos are chiefly solitary, but this species will occasionally travel in small family groups of up to three members. They are largely nocturnal, but have been known to forage during the day. All the armadillos are spectacular diggers, but unlike most of the other species, three-banded armadillos do not dig in defense or to find shelter. They prefer to rest under bushes, rather than dig burrows, and their ability to roll into a ball makes defensive digging unnecessary. When they are not foraging, they move with a sort of trot, bouncing on the tips of their front toes, while their hind feet slap flatly on the ground. They mark their territories with secretions from glands on their face, feet, and rump. When threatened, they occasionally do not seal their armor completely, but wait until they are touched. They then quickly snap shut in an effort to startle the predator.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Reproduction==
The mating season lasts from October to January, during which there is a brief courtship before mating. The female carries the young for a [[gestation period]] of 120 days at the end of which single, blind offspring is born. The newborn’s armor is soft, but its claws are fully developed, and it can walk and roll into a ball within hours of birth. The armor hardens by the third or fourth week, around the same time the eyes and earflaps open. The young armadillo is weaned at 10 weeks and reaches sexual maturity at 9–12 months.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Threats==
The defense system of the Brazilian three-banded armadillo makes it safe from the majority of predators. Adult [[Cougar|pumas]] and [[jaguar]]s are the only [[South America]]n mammals powerful enough to be a natural threat. The real danger to armadillos is the destruction of their habitats to make room for [[livestock]].<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==2014 FIFA World Cup mascot==
The Caatinga Association, a Brazilian environmental NGO, launched in January 2012 a national campaign proposing the three-banded armadillo to become mascot of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Brazil.  In March 2012, the Brazilian weekly, [[Veja (magazine)|''Veja'']], reported the three-banded armadillo would be [[Fuleco|the official mascot]] for the FIFA World Cup. Official announcement came in September 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fifa faz registro e confirma tatu-bola como mascote da Copa de 2014|url=http://espn.estadao.com.br/noticia/280876_fifa-faz-registro-e-confirma-tatu-bola-como-mascote-da-copa-de-2014|accessdate=11 September 2012|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=11 September 2012|language=Portuguese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913043133/http://espn.estadao.com.br/noticia/280876_fifa-faz-registro-e-confirma-tatu-bola-como-mascote-da-copa-de-2014|archivedate=13 September 2012|df=}}</ref>

When it detects prey, it frantically digs a hole and thrust its nose into it, using its long, sticky tongue to lap up any [[insect]]s it may find. Other foods include [[mollusk]]s, [[worm]]s, [[fruit]], and [[carrion]].<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Anatomy==
[[File: Dasypodidae - Tolypeutes tricinctus.JPG|thumb|220px|left|''Tolypeutes tricinctus''. Museum specimen]]
Brazilian three-banded armadillos have a head-and-body length of about {{convert|22|to|27|cm|abbr=on}} and the tail is between {{convert|6|and|8|cm|abbr=on}} long. They weigh {{convert|1|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=ArmOn>Armadillo Online: ''[http://armadillo-online.org/tolypeutes.html Tolypeutes tricinctus.]'' Retrieved 14 June 2014.</ref> The armor is composed of [[ossification|ossified dermal scutes]] covered by nonoverlapping, [[keratinization|keratinized]] epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, ears, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside of the body and the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection, and are covered instead by long, coarse hair. The [[genus]] ''Tolypeutes'', which includes both the Brazilian and southern species of three-banded armadillos, is unique in the ability to roll up in a tight, almost impenetrable ball. This is because their armor is slightly looser than that of other armadillo genera, which allows for greater freedom of movement. The loose armor also creates a layer of air between the shell and the body, which insulates the animal. This higher capacity for [[thermoregulation]] allows them to survive in climates too arid for some of the other armadillo species. When the armadillo rolls into a defensive ball, the ears are tucked into the shell and the head and tail interlock to seal the shell completely. The teeth are soft and peg-like, adapted solely for smashing the exoskeletons of insects.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Behavior==
[[File:Brazilian three-banded armadillo (Tolypeutes tricinctus) 2, Natural History Museum, London, Mammals Gallery.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''Tolypeutes tricinctus'' rolled into a defensive ball]]
Armadillos are chiefly solitary, but this species will occasionally travel in small family groups of up to three members. They are largely nocturnal, but have been known to forage during the day. All the armadillos are spectacular diggers, but unlike most of the other species, three-banded armadillos do not dig in defense or to find shelter. They prefer to rest under bushes, rather than dig burrows, and their ability to roll into a ball makes defensive digging unnecessary. When they are not foraging, they move with a sort of trot, bouncing on the tips of their front toes, while their hind feet slap flatly on the ground. They mark their territories with secretions from glands on their face, feet, and rump. When threatened, they occasionally do not seal their armor completely, but wait until they are touched. They then quickly snap shut in an effort to startle the predator.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Reproduction==
The mating season lasts from October to January, during which there is a brief courtship before mating. The female carries the young for a [[gestation period]] of 120 days at the end of which single, blind offspring is born. The newborn’s armor is soft, but its claws are fully developed, and it can walk and roll into a ball within hours of birth. The armor hardens by the third or fourth week, around the same time the eyes and earflaps open. The young armadillo is weaned at 10 weeks and reaches sexual maturity at 9–12 months.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==Threats==
The defense system of the Brazilian three-banded armadillo makes it safe from the majority of predators. Adult [[Cougar|pumas]] and [[jaguar]]s are the only [[South America]]n mammals powerful enough to be a natural threat. The real danger to armadillos is the destruction of their habitats to make room for [[livestock]].<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />

==2014 FIFA World Cup mascot==
The Caatinga Association, a Brazilian environmental NGO, launched in January 2012 a national campaign proposing the three-banded armadillo to become mascot of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Brazil.  In March 2012, the Brazilian weekly, [[Veja (magazine)|''Veja'']], reported the three-banded armadillo would be [[Fuleco|the official mascot]] for the FIFA World Cup. Official announcement came in September 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fifa faz registro e confirma tatu-bola como mascote da Copa de 2014|url=http://espn.estadao.com.br/noticia/280876_fifa-faz-registro-e-confirma-tatu-bola-como-mascote-da-copa-de-2014|accessdate=11 September 2012|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=11 September 2012|language=Portuguese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913043133/http://espn.estadao.com.br/noticia/280876_fifa-faz-registro-e-confirma-tatu-bola-como-mascote-da-copa-de-2014|archivedate=13 September 2012|df=}}</ref>

==Tuckpointing tools==

[[File:Tuck pointing on The Elms, 18th Century house in Acton - geograph.org.uk - 251637.jpg|thumb|Here red mortar is used. The white fillets are laid out at regular spacing, which does not always coincide with the rough spacing of the joints.]] 
Professional \"tuckpointers\" use tuckpointing tools, which depending on country and local trade terminology sometimes may be termed \"jointers\", \"tuck irons\"<ref name=\":0\" /> or \"tuckpointing irons\" (primarily in London where the trade originated).

Tuckpointing tools were originally made from [[Wrought_iron|wrought iron]] by blacksmiths in England during the 18th century. Over time these tools have evolved, and are today constructed from hardened tool steel. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.

The thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools is heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.

There are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:
\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\",
\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",
\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", 
\"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer
\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".

Standard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.

Tuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.

The lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.

Square beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.

\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. 

The process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.

Tuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.

The [[Battle of the Java Sea]] from February to March 1942, was one of the costliest [[naval battle]]s of [[World War II]]. The naval forces of the Netherlands, Britain, Australia, and the United States were nearly destroyed trying to defend Java from Japanese attack.<ref>Oosten, F.

==Economic activities==

The southern section of the seafloor has long been recognized as geologically similar to northern Java, where oil fields occur and extend under the sea. Prospects are also favourable for oil fields in the waters off southeast [[Kalimantan]]. As the site of successful exploration for petroleum and natural gas, the Java Sea has become the basis of Indonesia's export program.

Fishing is an important economic activity in the Java Sea. Over 3,000 species of marine life are found in the area. A number of national parks exist in the area such as [[Karimunjawa]]. The [[Thousand Islands (Indonesia)|Thousand Islands]] are located north of the national capital [[Jakarta]], and are the city's only [[Regency (Indonesia)|regency]].

The area around the Java Sea is also a popular [[tourist]] destination. [[Scuba diving]] offers a chance to explore and photograph underwater [[cave]]rns, [[Shipwreck|wrecks]], [[coral]], [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, and other marine life.<ref>[[Nina Epton|Epton, Nina]].

The '''Java Sea''' ({{lang-id|Laut Jawa}}) is an extensive shallow sea on the [[Sunda Shelf]]. It lies between the [[Indonesia]]n islands of [[Borneo]] to the north, [[Java]] to the south, [[Sumatra]] to the west, and [[Sulawesi]] to the east. [[Karimata Strait]] to its northwest links it to the [[South China Sea]]. It is a part of the western [[Pacific Ocean]]<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/airasia-flight-qz8501-5-things-about-java-sea-where-search-for-plane-is-taking-place AirAsia flight QZ8501: 5 things about Java Sea, where search for plane is taking place]. [[The Straits Times]]. December 28, 2014</ref><ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Java-Sea Java Sea]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].</ref>.

==Geography==
The Java Sea covers the southern section of the {{convert|1790000|sqkm|abbr=on}} [[Sunda Shelf]].
A shallow sea, it has a mean depth of {{convert|46|m|abbr=on}}. It measures about {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on}} east-west by {{convert|380|km|abbr=on}} north-south<ref name=\"goog\">[[GoogleEarth]]</ref> and occupies a total surface area of {{convert|320000|sqkm|abbr=on}}.

It formed as sea levels rose at the end of the last [[ice age]].<ref>{{cite news

  | accessdate =  }}</ref> The almost uniform flatness of the sea bottom and the presence of drainage channels (traceable to the mouths of island rivers) indicate that the Sunda Shelf was once a stable, dry, low-relief land area ([[peneplain]]) above which were left standing a few [[monadnocks]] (granite hills that by virtue of their resistance to erosion form the present islands).

Subsequent [[ślokas]] go on to say that those who have no attachments go on to find the [[Brahman]] (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe).

'''Blackwater fever''' is a complication of [[malaria infection]] in which [[RBCs|red blood cells]] burst in the bloodstream ([[hemolysis]]), releasing [[hemoglobinemia|hemoglobin directly into the blood vessels]] and [[hemoglobinuria|into the urine]], frequently leading to [[kidney failure]]. The disease was first linked to malaria by the [[Sierra Leon]]ean physician Dr [[John Farrell Easmon]] in his 1884 pamphlet entitled ''The Nature and Treatment of Blackwater Fever.'' Easmon coined the name \"blackwater fever\" and was the first to successfully treat such cases following the publication of his pamphlet.

==Signs and symptoms==
Within a few days of onset there are chills, with [[rigor (medicine)|rigor]], high [[fever]], [[jaundice]], vomiting, rapidly progressive [[anemia]], and dark red or black urine.

==Causes==
The cause of [[hemolysis|hemolytic]] crises in this disease is unknown (mainly due to intravascular haemolysis). There is rapid and massive destruction of [[red blood cells]] resulting in [[hemoglobinemia]] ([[hemoglobin]] in the blood, but outside the red blood cells), [[hemoglobinuria]] (hemoglobin in urine), intense jaundice, [[anuria]] (passing less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day), and finally death in the majority of cases.{{fact}}

The most probable explanation for blackwater fever is an [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] reaction apparently caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. Blackwater fever is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. There has been at least one case, however, attributed to ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Katongole-Mbidde E, Banura C, Kizito A |title=Blackwater fever caused by ''Plasmodium vivax'' infection in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=296 |issue=6625 |pages=827 |date=1988-03-19 |pmid=3130932 |pmc=2545111 |doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6625.827}}</ref>

Blackwater fever is a serious complication of malaria, but [[cerebral malaria]] has a higher [[mortality rate]]. Blackwater fever is much less common today than it was before 1950.<ref name=pmid12355996>{{cite journal |author1=Bruneel, F. |author2=B. Gacho |author3=M. Wolff |title=Blackwater fever |language=French |publisher=Presse médicale (Paris, France: 1983) |volume=31 |issue=28 |pages=1329–34 |year=2002 |pmid=12355996 |doi=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> It may be that [[quinine]] plays a role in triggering the condition{{fact}}, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria [[prophylaxis]]. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria.{{fact}}

==Treatment==
The treatment is [[malaria|antimalarial]] chemotherapy, [[intravenous]] fluid and sometimes supportive care such as [[intensive care]] and [[dialysis]].

==Prominent victims==
*Prior to his photography career, [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/features/Henri-Cartier-Bresson-8466-1.aspx|title=10 things to know about HenriCartier-Bresson {{!}} Christie's’|access-date=2017-09-16}}</ref> contracted blackwater fever while hunting in Western Africa. Expecting to die, he sent instructions to his family on his wishes for a funeral. He made a full recovery.

*Actor [[Don Adams]], best known as Maxwell Smart from the popular sitcom ''[[Get Smart]]'' and as the title character in ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'', contracted blackwater fever after being shot in combat at [[Guadalcanal]] during [[World War II]]. Adams was evacuated from his [[United States Marine Corps]] unit to a hospital in [[New Zealand]] where he ultimately made a full recovery.{{fact}}
*Humanitarian and MMA fighter [[Justin Wren]] contracted malaria, which devolved into blackwater fever, while drilling water-wells for [[Congo Pygmies]] in 2013.

'''Blackwater fever''' is a complication of [[malaria infection]] in which [[RBCs|red blood cells]] burst in the bloodstream ([[hemolysis]]), releasing [[hemoglobinemia|hemoglobin directly into the blood vessels]] and [[hemoglobinuria|into the urine]], frequently leading to [[kidney failure]]. The disease was first linked to malaria by the [[Sierra Leon]]ean physician Dr [[John Farrell Easmon]] in his 1884 pamphlet entitled ''The Nature and Treatment of Blackwater Fever.'' Easmon coined the name \"blackwater fever\" and was the first to successfully treat such cases following the publication of his pamphlet.

==Signs and symptoms==
Within a few days of onset there are chills, with [[rigor (medicine)|rigor]], high [[fever]], [[jaundice]], vomiting, rapidly progressive [[anemia]], and dark red or black urine.

==Causes==
The cause of [[hemolysis|hemolytic]] crises in this disease is unknown (mainly due to intravascular haemolysis). There is rapid and massive destruction of [[red blood cells]] resulting in [[hemoglobinemia]] ([[hemoglobin]] in the blood, but outside the red blood cells), [[hemoglobinuria]] (hemoglobin in urine), intense jaundice, [[anuria]] (passing less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day), and finally death in the majority of cases.{{fact}}

The most probable explanation for blackwater fever is an [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] reaction apparently caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. Blackwater fever is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. There has been at least one case, however, attributed to ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Katongole-Mbidde E, Banura C, Kizito A |title=Blackwater fever caused by ''Plasmodium vivax'' infection in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=296 |issue=6625 |pages=827 |date=1988-03-19 |pmid=3130932 |pmc=2545111 |doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6625.827}}</ref>

Blackwater fever is a serious complication of malaria, but [[cerebral malaria]] has a higher [[mortality rate]]. Blackwater fever is much less common today than it was before 1950.<ref name=pmid12355996>{{cite journal |author1=Bruneel, F. |author2=B. Gacho |author3=M. Wolff |title=Blackwater fever |language=French |publisher=Presse médicale (Paris, France: 1983) |volume=31 |issue=28 |pages=1329–34 |year=2002 |pmid=12355996 |doi=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> It may be that [[quinine]] plays a role in triggering the condition{{fact}}, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria [[prophylaxis]]. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria.{{fact}}

==Treatment==
The treatment is [[malaria|antimalarial]] chemotherapy, [[intravenous]] fluid and sometimes supportive care such as [[intensive care]] and [[dialysis]].

==Prominent victims==
*Prior to his photography career, [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/features/Henri-Cartier-Bresson-8466-1.aspx|title=10 things to know about HenriCartier-Bresson {{!}} Christie's’|access-date=2017-09-16}}</ref> contracted blackwater fever while hunting in Western Africa. Expecting to die, he sent instructions to his family on his wishes for a funeral. He made a full recovery. 
*Zoologist John Samuel Budgett died from the disease in 1904, after returning from a collecting trip to West Africa, in search of specimens of the fish [[Polypterus]]<ref>\"John Samuel Budgett(1872–1904): In Pursuit of Polypterus\" BioScience May 2001 / Vol. 51 No. 5</ref>.
*Missionary and explorer [[George Grenfell]] died after a bad attack of blackwater fever at [[Basoko]] on 1 July 1906.
*Jesse Brand, a missionary to the Chat Mountains in India, died of blackwater fever in 1928.
*Actor [[Don Adams]], best known as Maxwell Smart from the popular sitcom ''[[Get Smart]]'' and as the title character in ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'', contracted blackwater fever after being shot in combat at [[Guadalcanal]] during [[World War II]]. Adams was evacuated from his [[United States Marine Corps]] unit to a hospital in [[New Zealand]] where he ultimately made a full recovery.
*Humanitarian and MMA fighter [[Justin Wren]] contracted malaria, which devolved into blackwater fever, while drilling water-wells for [[Congo Pygmies]] in 2013. The affliction nearly claimed Wren's life. He was misdiagnosed four times and required airlift to Uganda, where he narrowly recovered from severe symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/8/27/9213895/justin-wren-has-returned-from-the-congo-but-his-fight-for-the-pygmies|title=Wren back in MMA to 'Fight for the Forgotten'|date=27 August 2015|publisher=}}</ref>

'''Chris Langford''' (born 2 January 1963) is a former professional [[Australian rules football]]er who has been an [[AFL Commission]]er since 1999.

==Player==
Langford is best known for his 303-game career for the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] between 1983 and 1997.

Langford played his early games for Hawthorn on the wing or as the second ruckman. He had a good leap which compensated for his lack of height. It was after the retirement of Peter Knights and David O'Halloran he switched to full back . It was that position in which he won his first All-Australian selection in 1987.

A defender, Langford won four premierships with Hawthorn, in 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1991. He captained the club in the 1994 season and earned a second [[All-Australian]] selection.

He holds a place on the interchange bench in Hawthorn's official 'Team of the Century'.

Late in his career, Langford moved to [[Sydney]] where he worked as an accountant, commuting to Melbourne to training and play with his club. In 2012, he moved back to Melbourne.

===Merger game===
Langford's antics at the end of the [[Melbourne Hawks|merger game]] against Melbourne in 1996 inspired many Hawthorn members to vote against the merger proposal. Langford (Hawthorn's full back) took off his Hawthorn jumper and proudly held it above his head while leaving the field. Langford was only one of the then playing list to display his disapproval of the plan.

'''''The Bird That Drinks Tears''''' ({{Korean|hangul=눈물을 마시는 새|rr=Nunmureul masineun sae}}; abbreviated as {{Korean|hangul=눈마새|rr=Nunmasae|labels=no}}) is a series of [[Korean fantasy]] novels by [[Lee Yeongdo]]. A rare example of the genre [[Korean Fantasy]], the [[stock characters]] and clichés of normal western fantasy such as [[elves]], magic, dragons and Latin languages are instead replaced by Korean concepts such as [[dokkaebi]], [[ssirum]], and the [[Arajit]] language, which is based on [[Proto-Korean]].

== Publishing ==

The novel was first serialized in [[Hitel]], an internet forum site, continuing the tradition that all novels by Lee Yeongdo are first serialized in the internet. After the conclusion of the serial, the book was later published through [[Golden Bough]], a publishing company of [[South Korea]]. Due to its length, the story was published in four hardcover volumes.

*Book 1: ''Nagas Who Extract Their Hearts'' 
*Book 2: ''Lekons Who Pursue Their Desire''
*Book 3: ''Dokkaebis Who Play Their Fire''
*Book 4: ''Humans Who Seek Their King''

==Main characters==

; Beehyung Srable ({{Korean|hangul=비형 스라블|rr=Bihyeong seurabeul|labels=no}})

; Ryoon Pei ({{Korean|hangul=륜 페이|rr=Ryun pei|labels=no}})
: A young naga who is haunted by the murder of his father, which he witnessed when he was eleven years old. He is sent on a mission to leave Keyboren and reach Haensha Archtemple, where he must try to save all four races. Because of the death of his father, he fears extracting his heart and ran away from the heart extraction ritual. His name derives from [[hanja]] ''ryoon'' (輪), which means 'wheel'.

; Samo Pei ({{Korean|hangul=사모 페이|rr=Samo pei|labels=no}})
: A female naga renowned for her dancing and swordsmanship. She is also kind to naga males, which is uncommon behavior in naga society. As a result, the Pei family is popular among males, and Samo becomes an object of jealousy among other families. She is the elder sister of Ryoon Pei. When Ryoon is accused of murder, she sets out to assassinate her brother, according to naga tradition. She later becomes the King of the northern army and fights against the Naga's invasion.

== Races ==

The fictional world of ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' is inhabited by four major intelligent races - Human, [[naga (The Bird Series)|naga]], [[lekon]] and [[dokkaebi (The Bird Series)|dokkaebi]]. Other than the humankind, the races that appear in ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' are in most respects [[Lee Yeongdo]]'s original creations, even though the race of naga and dokkaebi originates from Indian and Korean legends, respectively.

Each race has an individual god, who have their own element that they command. They also gave their respective races a gift.

; Human
: The God who is Nowhere ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: 어디에도 없는 신). His element is wind; wind comes and goes, but is never at one place. His gift is ''Naneui'' (나늬), a human woman who is perceived as beautiful to all four races.

; Naga
: The Goddess who Leaves No Trail ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: 발자국 없는 여신). Her element is water; water does not leave a trail in its path. Her gift is her name, which the protectors (male naga priests) can use to directly communicate with the goddess.

; [[Dokkaebi (The Bird Series)|Dokkaebi]]
: The God who Kills Himself ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: 자신을 죽이는 신). His element is fire; fire uses up fuel in order to keep burning, eventually killing itself. His gift is the power to control fire.

; Lekon
: The Goddess who is Lower Than All ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: 모든 이보다 낮은 여신). Her element is earth; the earth is beneath everyone. Her gift is Star-steel (별철), which cannot be broken and never rusts.

== Animals ==
; [[Dragon]] ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; 용 ''Yong'')
: Unlike in other fantasy novels, dragons in this world are a plant-like species that propagate with [[spore]]s. When the environment is favorable for the dragon to grow, leaves and flower sprout from the spore while its root develops into a ''Yonggeun'' (Dragon root). Then the root grows into a dragon. Like plants, the growth of a dragon reflects the environment that it is raised in; if it grows with horses, the dragon may become a flying horse. If it grows in the sea, the dragon can develop webbed feet. If necessary, a dragon can become nearly humanoid. It was hunted to extinction by the naga, because dragon can set fire to the forest.

; Black Lion ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; 흑사자 ''Heuksaja'')
: They possess fur that emits heat. They were hunted to extinction by the naga, who wished to use their heat-emitting hide as a means to attack the north.

; Sky Fish ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; 하늘치 ''Haneulchi'')
:  Huge flying fish. They carry mysterious ruins on their backs. Beetles seem to fear Sky Fish for some unknown reason.

; Beetle ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; 딱정벌레 ''Ttakjeongbeolle'')
: Instead of horses, Dokkaebi breed huge flying beetles as a means of transportation. Dokkaebi managed to teach beetles sign language, and beetles use their antennae to communicate with Dokkaebi. They are usually large enough to carry up to two people (one if the person happens to be a Lekon).

; King Eagle ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; 왕독수리 ''Wangdoksuri'')
: Giant eagles, bigger than alligators

; Big Tiger ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; 대호 ''Daeho'')

== Sequels ==

Currently, Lee Yeongdo has written only one sequel to ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' which is ''[[The Bird That Drinks Blood]]''. 

It is expected that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels, because of the quote in the series that mentions four birds. In the book there is a riddle about [[Four Bird Brothers|four bird brothers]]. One bird drank water, one drank poison, one drank blood and one drank tears. The riddle asks who of the four birds will die first. This riddle appears repeatedly throughout both ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' and ''[[The Bird That Drinks Blood]]'', and is entwined with many of the themes that run through two series.

Because of this riddle, many people expect that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels to this Bird series, ''The Bird That Drinks Poison'' and ''The Bird That Drinks Water''. However, Lee Yeongdo has not yet confirmed this rumour and whether he would actually continue to finish all four birds is still unknown.

'''''The Bird That Drinks Tears''''' ({{Korean|hangul=눈물을 마시는 새|rr=Nunmureul masineun sae}}; abbreviated as {{Korean|hangul=눈마새|rr=Nunmasae|labels=no}}) is a series of [[Korean fantasy]] novels by [[Lee Yeongdo]]. A rare example of the genre [[Korean Fantasy]], the [[stock characters]] and clichés of normal western fantasy such as [[elves]], magic, dragons and Latin languages are instead replaced by Korean concepts such as [[dokkaebi]], [[ssirum]], and the [[Arajit]] language, which is based on [[Proto-Korean]].

== Publishing ==

The novel was first serialized in [[Hitel]], an internet forum site, continuing the tradition that all novels by Lee Yeongdo are first serialized in the internet. After the conclusion of the serial, the book was later published through [[Golden Bough]], a publishing company of [[South Korea]]. Due to its length, the story was published in four hardcover volumes.

*Book 1: ''Nagas Who Extract Their Hearts'' 
*Book 2: ''Lekons Who Pursue Their Desire''
*Book 3: ''Dokkaebis Who Play Their Fire''
*Book 4: ''Humans Who Seek Their King''

'''Siyarafina''' (foaled 24 April 2016) is a French [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse. In a brief racing career that lasted from April to June 2019 she won three of her four races including the [[Group races|Group 1]] [[Prix Saint-Alary]]. After winning a [[maiden race]] on her debut she took the Prix de Louvre and then recorded her biggest success when she defeated ten opponents to win the Prix Saint-Alary at Longchamp. She finished unplaced when favourite for the [[Prix de Diane]] and was retired from racing soon afterwards.

==Background==
Siyarafina is a bay mare with white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]] on her hind legs bred in France by her owner [[Aga Khan IV]]. She was sent into training with [[Alain de Royer-Dupre]] at [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]].

She was from the nineteenth crop of foals sired by Pivotal, a top class sprinter who won the [[King's Stand Stakes]] and the [[Nunthorpe Stakes]] in 1996. He went on to become an “excellent” sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including [[Sariska (horse)|Sariska]], [[Somnus (horse)|Somnus]], [[Farhh]], [[Kyllachy]] and [[Immortal Verse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/profile/horse/107700/pivotal/progeny |title=Pivotal Stud Record|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref>

Siyarafina's dam Siyenica showed good racing ability, winning two races including the [[Listed race|Listed]] Prix de Bagatelle as well as finishing third in the [[Prix Daniel Wildenstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/profile/horse/820082/siyenica/form|title=Siyenica race record|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref> Her dam Sichilla also produced [[Siyouni]] ([[Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere]]) and [[Siyouma]] and was a half-sister to the [[Grand Prix de Paris]] winner [[Slickly]].<ref name=\"tbl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Families/Family12bJoD2.htm|title=Family 12-b Jack of Diamonds Mare #2 (mtDNA - group I2 type)|work=Thoroughbred Bloodlines}}</ref>

==Racing career==
===2019: three-year-old season===
After failing to appear on the track as a juvenile, Siyarafina made her debut on 4 April in a [[maiden race]] over 1600 metres at [[Saint-Cloud Racecourse]] in which she was ridden, as in all of her races, by [[Christophe Soumillon]]. Starting the [[Fractional odds|2.9/1]] second favourite she took the lead inside the last 200 metres from the finish and won by two [[Horse length|lengths]] from Wishfully with [[Villa Marina]] taking third.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/219/saint-cloud/2019-04-04/726756|title=Prix Parade d'Amour result|date=4 April 2019|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref> Eighteen days after her maiden win Siyarafina was stepped up in class for the Prix du Louvre over the same distance at [[Longchamp Racecourse]] and started the 0.6/1 favourite against six opponents. She won again, coming from off the pace in a slowly-run race to win by half a length and a half from Commes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/211/longchamp/2019-04-22/728394|title=Prix du Louvre result|date=22 April 2019|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref>

Siyarafina was then aimed at the [[Group races|Group 1]] [[Poule d'Essai des Pouliches]] but was withdrawn from the race after performing poorly in a training gallop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/siyarafina-to-miss-french-1000-guineas-after-failing-to-sparkle-in-gallop/379579|title=Siyarafina to miss French 1,000 Guineas after failing to sparkle in gallop|first=Scott|last=Burton|date=7 May 2019|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref> On her return to the track on 26 May Siyarafina was moved up in distance and started the 0.7/1 favourite for the Prix Saint-Alary over 2000 metres on [[Going (horse racing)|good to soft ground]] at Longchamp. Her ten opponents included Platane ([[Prix Vanteaux]]), Fount (unbeaten in two starts), Imperial Charm (fourth in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Phoceene (Listed [[Prix Rose de Mai]]), Cala Tarida ([[Prix des Reservoirs]]) and Olendon (Listed [[Prix Finlande]]). Siyarafina raced in mid-division before moving up to take second place behind Imperial Charm in the straight. She overtook the British-trained leader 100 metres from the finish and kept on to win by a length from Olendon, with Imperial Charm half a length back in third.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/211/longchamp/2019-05-26/731885|title=Prix Saint-Alary result|date=26 May 2019|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref> Her victory was the first Group 1 win for the Aga Khan in almost two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/233906/aga-khan-back-in-group-1-limelight-thanks-to-siyarafina|title=Aga Khan Back in Group 1 Limelight Thanks to Siyarafina|date=27 May 2019|first=Scott|last=Burton|publisher=[[The Blood-Horse]]}}</ref> After the race Soumillon said \"She had been working better for a few days, but she is far from 100 per cent. However, winning her Group 1 after three outings, it's great - especially as she is not yet in the best of shape. She blows a lot like a mare who lacks a real preparation. It was just a prep race. She's run three times for three wins, which leaves great hopes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/news/super-siyarafina-in-saint-alary/167018|title=Prix Saint Alary report: Siyarafina wins in good style|date=27 May 2019|author=Press Association staff|publisher=sportinglife.com}}</ref>

On 16 June at [[Chantilly Racecourse]] Siyarafina was made the 6/4 favourite in a sixteen-runner field for the 2100 metre [[Prix de Diane]].

She overtook the British-trained leader 100 metres from the finish and kept on to win by a length from Olendon, with Imperial Charm half a length back in third.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/211/longchamp/2019-05-26/731885|title=Prix Saint-Alary result|date=26 May 2019|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref> Her vicory was the first Group 1 win for the Aga Khan in almost two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/233906/aga-khan-back-in-group-1-limelight-thanks-to-siyarafina|title=Aga Khan Back in Group 1 Limelight Thanks to Siyarafina|date=27 May 2019|first=Scott|last=Burton|publisher=[[The Blood-Horse]]}}</ref> After the race Soumillon said \"She had been working better for a few days, but she is far from 100 per cent.

== Plot ==
The film opens as Jiang Zhishu is riding his bike. Yuan Xiangqin walks past Jiang Zhishu and trips on the stairs, taking along Zhishu's phone. As Jiang Zhishu tries to figure how to save Yuan Xiangqin and his phone from breaking, Xiangqin reluctantly grabs on to his tie and their lips meet, signalling their first meeting. She then meets Jiang Zhishu again at a school assembly as he talks about his ongoing project in Boston, and finds out he's an extraordinarily smart person with a 200IQ score in the A class.

Two years later, she still is fawning over Jiang Zhishu, over his social media page. Whilst trying to get rid of the F class for bees, she sees a social media update for his account saying that he's walking back to the A building and hundreds of fans including herself start running. As the A class gate closes, she has an ultimatum to confess to him. Later on in F class, she notices that a fire drill will start, shutting down all technology and thus allowing her to get through the A gate. She runs, finds Jiang Zhishu and confesses, to which he cold-heartedly rejects. All students in the A grade recorded this embarrassing moment and thus make fun of Yuan Xiangqin whilst the principal scolds her for wasting Zhishu's time.

Xiangqin's house later collapses due to poor construction, combined with the previous confession, she is the centre of everyone's attention. As Jiang Zhishu walks past, Xiangqin challenges Zhishu that an F grader can get on the top 100 list for a trial exam. He agrees. Xiangqin moves in to her father's friend's house, without knowing that it is where Jiang Zhishu resides. Over the course of time, Xiangqin and Zhishu get closer through Zhishu's mother where she encourages their relationship and encounters at school and at his house.

To save Xiangqin from embarrassment over not making the top 100, she begs Zhishu to help her study for the mock exam which he reluctantly agrees to due to her having an embarrassing video of his received by his mother. She makes 100th tied, whilst Zhishu still remains 1st. Zhishu and his cohort then embarrasses Xiangqin at an athletics carnival as she is revealed to reside in Zhishu's house, into which she streams the embarrassing video of his at his house. Xiangqin and Zhishu then quarrel before Zhishu kisses Xiangqin on the lips before leaving.

Two years later, Xiangqin is seen to support Zhishu at Zhishu's mother's request but is left out of his life as Zhishu wants to live his own life and become a veterinary doctor. Xiangqin follows Zhishu around to see another woman living at his apartment but finds out that she is there for business only. She is relieved and Zhishu kisses Xiangqin one more time before finding out his father becoming sick and thus takes over his business, adding stress and pressure to his life. Caring for Xiangqin but prioritising the business, he throws away Xiangqin in order to marry another woman to combine their businesses and thus save his father's business. Xiangqin then promptly rejects his love and runs away. Zhishu's father and mother disagree with Zhishu's decision to marry and tells him it should be from his heart whom he should marry.

Another year passes by, and we see Xiangqin looking through Zhishu's social media. Zhishu then posts an update at the school hall in which he will talk at an assembly, in which Xiangqin goes to reluctantly. She then enters the hall and sees that no one is there but him. Zhishu then hides away and Xiangqin calls Zhishu's brother, into which he responds that only certain people can see what he posts. She then realises that the posts were meant for her. Zhishu then proposes to Xiangqin in which she agrees. A flashback occurs at the end in which Zhishu wakes up from his slumber during his time where he tutors Xiangqin and sees the love letter Xiangqin wrote for him. At that time, the audience finds out that Zhishu was in love with her.

Their marriage is seen in the post-credits scene.

'''Salvador Mazza''' (June 6, 1886{{spaced ndash}}November 9, 1946) was a noted Argentine physician and epidemiologist, best known for his strides in helping control [[American trypanosomiasis]], an endemic disease among the rural, poor majority of early 20th century [[South America]].<ref name=fac>[http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm Historia de la enfermedad de Chagas {{in lang|es}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204113113/http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |date=2009-12-04 }}</ref>

==Life and work==
===Early career===
Mazza was born in [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]], [[Buenos Aires]]<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939D-R89M-N4?i=516&cc=1974184&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AXN8P-9WL Baptismal record of Salvador Mazza]</ref>, to Francesco Mazza and Giuseppa Alfisi (both immigrants from [[Sicily]]), in 1886, and was raised in [[Rauch, Buenos Aires|Rauch]], a small [[pampas]] town. A precocious student, Mazza was accepted into the prestigious, public [[college preparatory school]], the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]], at age ten. Upon graduation he applied for enlistment in the [[Argentine Navy|Argentine Naval Academy]]; but was rejected on medical grounds. He enrolled, instead, at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (UBA) School of Medicine, graduating in 1903.<ref name=chagas>[http://www.chagaspace.org/eng/chagas/salvador_mazza.htm Chagas space: Salvador Mazza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319161255/http://www.chagaspace.org/eng/chagas/salvador_mazza.htm |date=2009-03-19 }}</ref>

During his graduate studies, he accepted a post as Health Inspector for the then-rural [[Province of Buenos Aires]], where he focused on [[Prophylaxis|disease prevention]] and [[vaccination]]. Following his 1903 graduation, he specialized in [[microbiology]] and [[pathology]]. He organized and briefly directed the [[lazaretto|quarantine facility]] for [[cholera]]-stricken seafarers and immigrants on [[Martín García Island]], and then performed his [[medical residency]] in a number of European hospitals before earning his degree of [[Doctor of Medicine]] and returning to Argentina, in 1910.  He then met a fellow [[Italian Argentine]], Clorinda Brígida Razori, and they married in 1914—creating a lasting professional partnership, as well as marriage.<ref name=chagas/>

The onset of [[World War I]] returned Mazza to [[Europe]], where he was commissioned in 1916 by the [[Argentine Army]] to study the crisis of infectious disease in the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]s. There, he befriended a well-known [[Brazil]]ian epidemiologist, [[Carlos Chagas]], who in 1909 had discovered [[American trypanosomiasis]]. Mazza was named Laboratories Director of the Clinical Hospital and Dean of the [[Bacteriology]] Course at the UBA, in 1920. Traveling to [[France]] in 1923, he and his wife accepted noted bacteriologist [[Charles Nicolle]]'s invitation to the [[Pasteur Institute]]'s [[Algiers]] branch, where they studied Dr. Nicolle's methods in the treatment of [[typhus]] (Nicolle was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for his efforts). Returning to Argentina in 1925, Mazza was given a prominent post in the UBA Surgical Clinic and shortly afterwards invited Nicolle to Buenos Aires, where they discussed the need for more vigorous action against the contagious diseases affecting the country's poor.<ref name=chagas/>

===Struggle against disease and indifference===
These discussions resulted in support from the school's Dean of Anatomy, Dr. [[José Arce]], for the establishment of a medical mission in Argentina's underdeveloped north. The Regional Pathologies Study Mission (MEPRA) was established in then-feudal [[Jujuy Province]], in February 1926. Installed in a railway car, Mazza laboratory undertook studies on trypanosomiasis and [[leishmaniasis]], among other diseases. Publishing regular reports, the mobile lab traveled from village to village to not only inform the then-mostly illiterate population of the nature of their common diseases; but also to help control the known disease vector ''[[Triatoma infestans]]'', a true bug ([[Hemiptera]]) known locally as the ''winchuka''<ref>{{Ref Laime}}</ref> ''(vinchuca)''. The death of a symptomatic [[dog]] in 1926 ultimately led to Mazza's confirmation of the existence of the causal pathogen,''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', in Argentina, in 1927.<ref name=chagas/>

Mazza established Scientific Societies in seven northern provinces in 1926-27 to help coordinate his studies and diffuse information. He was assisted by, among others, Dr. Guillermo Paterson, an [[English Argentine]] epidemiologist known for his work on [[malaria]]. His efforts, however, encountered indifference and, then, resistance from the area's landed gentry, who generally saw squalor and contagious disease as an externality, and feared that Mazza's efforts might trigger a peasant revolt.

'''Salvador Mazza''' (June 6, 1886{{spaced ndash}}November 9, 1946) was a noted Argentine physician and epidemiologist, best known for his strides in helping control [[American trypanosomiasis]], an endemic disease among the rural, poor majority of early 20th century [[South America]].<ref name=fac>[http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm Historia de la enfermedad de Chagas {{in lang|es}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204113113/http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |date=2009-12-04 }}</ref>

==Life and work==
===Early career===
Mazza was born in [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]], [[Buenos Aires]]<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939D-R89M-N4?i=516&cc=1974184&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AXN8P-9WL Baptismal record of Salvador Mazza]</ref>, to Francesco Mazza and Giuseppa Alfise (both immigrants from [[Sicily]]), in 1886, and was raised in [[Rauch, Buenos Aires|Rauch]], a small [[pampas]] town. A precocious student, Mazza was accepted into the prestigious, public [[college preparatory school]], the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]], at age ten. Upon graduation he applied for enlistment in the [[Argentine Navy|Argentine Naval Academy]]; but was rejected on medical grounds. He enrolled, instead, at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (UBA) School of Medicine, graduating in 1903.<ref name=chagas>[http://www.chagaspace.org/eng/chagas/salvador_mazza.htm Chagas space: Salvador Mazza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319161255/http://www.chagaspace.org/eng/chagas/salvador_mazza.htm |date=2009-03-19 }}</ref>

During his graduate studies, he accepted a post as Health Inspector for the then-rural [[Province of Buenos Aires]], where he focused on [[Prophylaxis|disease prevention]] and [[vaccination]]. Following his 1903 graduation, he specialized in [[microbiology]] and [[pathology]]. He organized and briefly directed the [[lazaretto|quarantine facility]] for [[cholera]]-stricken seafarers and immigrants on [[Martín García Island]], and then performed his [[medical residency]] in a number of European hospitals before earning his degree of [[Doctor of Medicine]] and returning to Argentina, in 1910.  He then met a fellow [[Italian Argentine]], Clorinda Brígida Razori, and they married in 1914—creating a lasting professional partnership, as well as marriage.<ref name=chagas/>

The onset of [[World War I]] returned Mazza to [[Europe]], where he was commissioned in 1916 by the [[Argentine Army]] to study the crisis of infectious disease in the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]s. There, he befriended a well-known [[Brazil]]ian epidemiologist, [[Carlos Chagas]], who in 1909 had discovered [[American trypanosomiasis]]. Mazza was named Laboratories Director of the Clinical Hospital and Dean of the [[Bacteriology]] Course at the UBA, in 1920. Traveling to [[France]] in 1923, he and his wife accepted noted bacteriologist [[Charles Nicolle]]'s invitation to the [[Pasteur Institute]]'s [[Algiers]] branch, where they studied Dr. Nicolle's methods in the treatment of [[typhus]] (Nicolle was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for his efforts). Returning to Argentina in 1925, Mazza was given a prominent post in the UBA Surgical Clinic and shortly afterwards invited Nicolle to Buenos Aires, where they discussed the need for more vigorous action against the contagious diseases affecting the country's poor.<ref name=chagas/>

===Struggle against disease and indifference===
These discussions resulted in support from the school's Dean of Anatomy, Dr. [[José Arce]], for the establishment of a medical mission in Argentina's underdeveloped north. The Regional Pathologies Study Mission (MEPRA) was established in then-feudal [[Jujuy Province]], in February 1926. Installed in a railway car, Mazza laboratory undertook studies on trypanosomiasis and [[leishmaniasis]], among other diseases. Publishing regular reports, the mobile lab traveled from village to village to not only inform the then-mostly illiterate population of the nature of their common diseases; but also to help control the known disease vector ''[[Triatoma infestans]]'', a true bug ([[Hemiptera]]) known locally as the ''winchuka''<ref>{{Ref Laime}}</ref> ''(vinchuca)''. The death of a symptomatic [[dog]] in 1926 ultimately led to Mazza's confirmation of the existence of the causal pathogen,''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', in Argentina, in 1927.<ref name=chagas/>

Mazza established Scientific Societies in seven northern provinces in 1926-27 to help coordinate his studies and diffuse information. He was assisted by, among others, Dr. Guillermo Paterson, an [[English Argentine]] epidemiologist known for his work on [[malaria]]. His efforts, however, encountered indifference and, then, resistance from the area's landed gentry, who generally saw squalor and contagious disease as an externality, and feared that Mazza's efforts might trigger a peasant revolt. His campaign to incinerate rural [[thatch]]ed roofs, a habitat for vinchucas, was particularly controversial. A fascist, 1930 [[coup d'état]] against the aging President [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]], moreover, led to the elimination of funding for the MEPRA the following year, after which Mazza maintained the facility with donations and his own funds. His efforts forced the South American medical community to accept the validity of trypanosomiasis (making it the special topic of the prestigious VI National Congress of Medicine, in 1939), and yielded the first detailed description of the dynamic between living conditions, trypanosomiasis, and its insect vector.<ref name=fac/>

'''Tmesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|t|ə|ˈ|m|iː|-}};<ref>Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tmesis \"Oxford Dictionary: 'tmesis'\"], ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Retrieved 19 August, 2014.</ref><ref>Dictionary.com, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tmesis \"Dictionary.com: 'tmesis'\"], ''Dictionary.com'', Retrieved 19 August, 2014.</ref> [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|τμῆσις}} ''tmēsis'', \"a cutting\" < {{lang|grc|τέμνω}} ''temnō'', \"I cut\") is a linguistic phenomenon in which a word or phrase is separated into two parts, with other words between them.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press (1992), p. 1044 {{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}</ref>

==Verbs==
Tmesis of [[Prefix|prefixed]] verbs (whereby the prefix is separated from the simple verb) was an original feature of the [[Ancient Greek]] language, common in [[Homer]] (and later poetry), but not used in [[Attic Greek|Attic]] prose.  Such [[separable verb]]s are also part of the normal grammatical usage of some modern languages, such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]].

===Ancient Greek===
Tmesis in [[Ancient Greek]] is something of a misnomer, since there is not necessarily a splitting of the prefix from the verb; rather the consensus now seems to be that the separate prefix or pre-verb reflects a stage in the language where the prefix had not yet joined onto the verb.  There are many examples in Homer's epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', both of which preserve archaic features.  One common and oft-cited example is {{lang|grc|κατὰ δάκρυα λείβων}} (''kata dakrua leibōn;'' \"shedding tears\"), in which the pre-verb {{lang|grc|κατά}} ''kata'' \"down\" has not yet joined the verbal participle {{lang|grc|λείβων}} ''leibōn'' \"shedding\". In later Greek, these would combine to form the compound verb {{lang|grc|καταλείβων}} ''kataleibōn'' \"shedding (in a downwards direction)\".

===Latin===
Tmesis is found as a poetic or rhetorical device in classical [[Latin]] poetry, such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. Words such as ''circumdare'' (\"to surround\") are split apart with other words of the sentence in between, e.g. ''circum virum dant'': \"they surround the man\". This device is used in this way to create a visual image of surrounding the man by means of the words on the line. In the work of the poet [[Ennius]], the literal splitting of the word ''cerebrum'' creates a vivid image: ''saxo cere comminuit brum'' \"he shattered his brain with a rock.\"<ref name=\"Cruttwell\">{{cite book |last=Cruttwell |first= Charles Thomas |authorlink=Charles Thomas Cruttwell |title=A History of Roman Literature: From the Earliest Period to the Death of Marcus Aurelius  |url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_histromlit_1_6.htm}}</ref>

===Old Irish===
Tmesis can be found in some early Old Irish texts, such as [[Audacht Morainn]]. Old Irish verbs are found at the beginning of clauses (in a VSO word order) and often possess prepositional pre-verbal particles, e.g. ''ad-midethar'' \"evaluates, estimates\". Tmesis occurs when the pre-verbal particle is separated from the verbal stem and the verbal stem is placed in clause final position while the pre-verbal particle remains at the beginning of the clause. This results in an abnormal word order, e.g. ''ad- cruth caín -cichither'' \"[the] fair form will be seen\" (where ''ad-chichither'' is the future third-person singular passive of ''ad-cí'' \"sees\").<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Paul |authorlink= |title=An Introduction to the Celtic Languages |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |location=London |pages=288 |url=}}</ref>

===Old Norse===
Examples of tmesis have been found in [[Skald|skaldic poetry]]. In addition to the use of [[kennings]], [[skald]]s used tmesis to obscure the meaning of the poem.<ref name=\"Ross\">{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Margaret Clunies |authorlink= |title=A History of Old Norse Poetry and Poetics |publisher=D. S. Brewer |year=2005 |location=Cambridge |pages=109–110 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvROUzj4DBoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=1-84384-034-0}}</ref> One use of tmesis was to divide the elements of personal names.<ref name=\"Ross\"/>

===German===
Many German verbs have a separable prefix that changes the meaning of the root verb, but that does not always remain attached to the root verb. German sentence structure normally places verbs in second position or final position. For separable prefix verbs, the prefix always appears in final position. If a particular sentence's structure places the entire verb in final position then the prefix and root verb appear together. If a sentence places the verb in second position then only the root verb will appear in second position; the separated prefix remains at the end of the sentence. For example, the separable verb ''anfangen'' (\"to start\") consists of the separable prefix ''an'' and the root ''fangen'':

:Root verb in second position: ''Ich '''fange''' die Arbeit '''an'''.'' (\"I start the work.\")
:Root verb in final position: ''Morgens trinke ich heiße Schokolade, weil ich dann die Arbeit '''anfange'''.'' (\"In the morning I drink hot chocolate, because afterwards I begin the work.\")

However, in many other German verbs the prefix (such as ''be-'' or ''ent-'') is inseparable, always staying with the root verb.

===English===
Colloquial examples include the common \"un-[bloody]-believable\"<!--this formatting looks incorrect--> and variants of it; multiple English words are joined with the vulgar [[interfix]] -fucking-, such as \"[[Wiktionary:unfuckingbelievable|unfuckingbelievable]]\". The phrase ''A whole nother...(story / kettle of fish / ball game)'' is an example of tmesis in English. The word ''another'' is being split by the qualifier ''whole''. The insertion is probably caused by the fact that the word consists of an indefinite article plus the word ''other'', and it is still easily analysable as such. But the word is still so much a unit that some speakers will find it incomplete to say ''a whole other''. And so, the word is reanalysed as ''a nother'' to keep the ''n'', which allows for the use of a qualifier while retaining all the letters of the word.

In that sense, words such as ''apron'' and ''uncle'' may be seen as the result of tmesis of ''napron'' and ''nuncle''.

English employs a large number of [[phrasal verb]]s, consisting of a core verb and a particle which could be an adverb or a preposition; while the phrasal verb is written as two words, the two words are analyzed semantically as a unit because the meaning of the phrasal verb is often unrelated (or only loosely related) to the meaning of the core verb. For example, ''turn off'' has a meaning unrelated to ''turn'' in ''Turn off the television set and the light''.

Many English phrasal verbs are separable, in the sense that if they are transitive then the object is placed between the core verb and the particle if the object is a pronoun (and optionally if it is a short noun phrase, but not if it is a long noun phrase as in the example above). For example:

:''Turn off the light''  OR  ''Turn the light off'' (optional tmesis)
:''Turn it off'' (mandatory tmesis)

This intervention of the object in the middle of the phrasal verb can be viewed as a form of tmesis even though the semantic unit being separated is written as two words even when not separated.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

==Early life==

He was born near [[Madison, Virginia|Madison]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], in 1773, the son of Joel Early and Lucy Smith.  He had a sister Lucy, who later married [[Mathews family|Charles Lewis Mathews]].<ref name=Patrick>Patrick, Rembert W. (2010). ''Florida Fiasco: Rampant Rebels on the Georgia-Florida Border, 1810-1815''. University of Georgia Press, 2010. {{ISBN|0820335495}}, 9780820335490</ref> His cousin, Jubal Early, became the grandfather of [[Jubal Early|Jubal Anderson Early]] (1816–1894), later a prominent Confederate general. 

Peter Early graduated from the Lexington Academy (current-day [[Washington and Lee University]]). He later graduated from [[Princeton College]], in 1792. His family moved to [[Wilkes County, Georgia]], on the central eastern border, that same year. Early was [[reading law|studying law]] with [[Jared Ingersoll]] in [[Philadelphia]]. After finishing his legal studies, Peter Early joined his family in Wilkes County. 

There he married Ann Adams Smith in 1793. In 1796 he began his [[practice of law|law practice]] in [[Washington, Georgia|Washington]], the county seat of Wilkes County.

==Political life==

Early was elected as a [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from Georgia to the [[8th United States Congress]] to serve the remainder of the term left vacant by the resignation of [[John Milledge]], who had been elected as Governor of Georgia. Early was re-elected to the [[9th United States Congress|9th Congress]]. During his congressional service, Early was one of the managers of the prosecution in the [[impeachment]] trials against [[John Pickering (judge)|John Pickering]], [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire|New Hampshire United States District Court judge]], in January 1804, and [[Samuel Chase]], [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]], in December of that year. Early did not seek re-election in 1806.

After his congressional service,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Early|first1=Peter|title=Letter, 1806 Apr. 19, Washington City, [to] Governor [John] Milledge / Peter Early|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/zlna/id:tcc380|website=Southeastern Native American Documents, 1730-1842|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}</ref> Early was elected by the [[Georgia General Assembly]] as judge of the Superior Court, Ocmulgee Circuit, serving in that court from 1807 until 1813. The respect and popularity he gained from his service on the bench propelled him to be elected the [[List of Governors of Georgia|28th Governor of Georgia]] in 1813. He served one term, through 1815, during which he was instrumental in committing funds on several occasions from the state treasury to help raise and supply additional troops from Georgia to the [[United States|American]] military forces during the latter half of the [[War of 1812]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Early|first1=Peter|title=[Letter], 1813 Nov.

Early moved to [[Greene County, Georgia|Greene County]] after his gubernatorial term, where he was elected to the [[Georgia Senate]].

==Death==
During his term in the Georgia Senate, Peter Early died on August 15, 1817, at his summer home near Scull Shoals in Greene County. He was buried on the west bank of the [[Oconee River]] near his Fontenoy Plantation home,<ref>{{cite web|title=Governor Peter Early historical marker|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/greene/governor-peter-early|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}</ref> with a simple monument to mark his grave.

In 1914, his family had his remains reinterred in the [[Greensboro, Georgia|Greensboro]] City Cemetery.
