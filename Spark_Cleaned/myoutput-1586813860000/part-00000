The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) mandates the specificities of this integration. IDEA protects students who are typically a part of the special education classroom by granting the right to enroll in the general education classroom. This applies to situations that may be in the best interest of these special education students. In terms of deaf students, deafness is considered a low-incidence disability. This translates to the possibility of one deaf child belonging to a classroom with other \u201chearing\u201d children<ref>Stinson, M., & Antia, S. (1999). \"Considerations in Educating Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in Inclusive Settings\".

For example, students within the mainstream setting may not know sign language will serve as significant communication barriers for deaf students.

Bi-Bi emphasizes that deaf children learn visually and education should be provided through a [[visual language]]. Bi-Bi supporters' argue because of the variability in [[cochlear implant]] and [[hearing aid]] outcomes, sign language access is crucial for preventing deaf and hard-of-hearing children from experiencing language deprivation.\n\nThis approach began to emerge in schools during the late 1980s in the United States, Denmark, and Sweden.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Shawn Neal|date=1991|title=The Transition toward Bilingual Education of Deaf Children in Sweden &amp; Denmark: Perspectives on Language|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=1071|issue=1|pages=169\u2013195|doi=10.1353/sls.1991.0023|issn=1533-6263}}</ref> Congruently, in America, the ASL/English Bi- Bi is designed to facilitate academic success and provide education to deaf students by learning [[sign language]], as a first language, followed by a written or spoken language (such as English) as their second language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmeister|first=Robert J.|last2=Caldwell-Harris|first2=Catherine L.|date=August 2014|title=Acquiring English as a second language via print: The task for deaf children|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=132|issue=2|pages=229\u2013242|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.014|pmid=24813574}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=Stephen|date=October 2002|title=Educating deaf students: from research to practice.

The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) mandates the specificities of this integration. IDEA protects students who are typically a part of the special education classroom by granting the right to enroll in the general education classroom. This applies to situations that may be in the best interest of these special education students. In terms of deaf students, deafness is considered a low-incidence disability. This translates to the possibility of one deaf child belonging to a classroom with other \u201chearing\u201d children<ref>Stinson, M., & Antia, S. (1999). \"Considerations in Educating Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in Inclusive Settings\".

For example, students within the mainstream setting may not know sign language will serve as significant communication barriers for deaf students. These deaf students may use accommodations in their general classroom setting such as a [[ASL interpreting|sign language interpreters]], communication access real-time translation (CART), or a [[Hearing aid|FM system]].\n\n=== Bilingual-Bicultural ===\nDeaf children without early access to signed language remain at risk for starting school unprepared for the rigors of academic learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=David|date=2006|title=The young deaf or hard of hearing child: a family-centered approach to early education.

This is where an educational philosophy known as the [[Bilingual-bicultural education|Bilingual-bicultural]] (Bi-Bi) found in [[Deaf education|deaf schools]] can be beneficial for deaf students. Bi-Bi emphasizes that deaf children learn visually and education should be provided through a [[visual language]]. Bi-Bi supporters' argue because of the variability in [[cochlear implant]] and [[hearing aid]] outcomes, sign language access is crucial for preventing deaf and hard-of-hearing children from experiencing language deprivation.\n\nThis approach began to emerge in schools during the late 1980s in the United States, Denmark, and Sweden.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Shawn Neal|date=1991|title=The Transition toward Bilingual Education of Deaf Children in Sweden &amp; Denmark: Perspectives on Language|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=1071|issue=1|pages=169\u2013195|doi=10.1353/sls.1991.0023|issn=1533-6263}}</ref> Congruently, in America, the ASL/English Bi- Bi is designed to facilitate academic success and provide education to deaf students by learning [[sign language]], as a first language, followed by a written or spoken language (such as English) as their second language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmeister|first=Robert J.|last2=Caldwell-Harris|first2=Catherine L.|date=August 2014|title=Acquiring English as a second language via print: The task for deaf children|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=132|issue=2|pages=229\u2013242|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.014|pmid=24813574}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=Stephen|date=October 2002|title=Educating deaf students: from research to practice.
