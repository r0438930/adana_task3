The name is derived from [[Sanskrit]], as another name for the Moon. \u015aa\u015b\u0101nka-deva therefore loosely translates to Moon god. The Hindu god [[Shiva]] is also known as ''Shashank Sekhar'' as He holds the moon on his head.\n\nThe Chinese monk [[Xuanzang]]'s writings, he is mentioned as She-Shang-Kia. He is also called \u015aa\u015b\u0101nka Narendragupta, which initially lent credence to the claim that he was descended from the later Guptas.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Indian Antiquary |journal=Journal of Oriental Research (Ed.

On top of that, starting circa 480 C.E. [[Alchon Huns|Alchon Hun]] armies began attacking the declining empire from multiple sides. Defence of the vast empire put a strain on the royal treasury. Though the Huns were initially driven out, the protracted invasions quickened the downfall of the Gupta kings. It may be noted that Indian archeologist Shanker Sharma has argued that the empire's end was precipitated by a massive deluge around the middle of the sixth century C.E.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raj |first1=Dev |title=Deluge drowned mighty Guptas: Study |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/deluge-drowned-mighty-guptas-study/cid/1685500 |website=www.telegraphindia.com |accessdate=14 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nNear the end of the sixth century, the empire was ruled over by a feeble ruler belonging to the [[Later Gupta dynasty]], Mahasenagupta (r. c. 562-601 C.E.).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Bindeshwari Prasad |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=India |pages=129\u2013131 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> The [[Gupta Empire#Decline of the empire|decline of the Gupta empire]] had left the disintegrating empire in chaos. Numerous local kings and rulers like [[Yashodharman]] emerged, and started vying for control of the many pieces of the former empire. Shashanka emerged as one of these ambitious local rulers, aiming to seize control of Gauda and its surrounding region.\n\n[[File:Rohtasgarh Fort Inside Side View.jpg|thumb|The Rohtasgarh Fort, built circa 7th century]]\nThe first mention of Shashanka is found in the 7th century hill fort [[Rohtas Fort|Rohtasgarh]] in the small town of Rohtas in the kingdom of Magadha. The seal bore a curt inscription, \"Mahasamanta Shashankadeva.\"\n\nSome historians believe that Shashanka began his career as a feudatory chief (maha [[samanta]]) under Mahasenagupta, of the [[Later Gupta dynasty|Later Gupta Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=N. S. |title=Ancient Indian history and civilization |date=1999 |publisher=New Age International |location=India |isbn=81-224-1198-3 |edition=Second |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books/about/Ancient_Indian_History_and_Civilization.html?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> And that after the death of Mahasenagupta, Shashanka drove the later Guptas and other prominent nobles out of the region and established his own kingdom with his capital at [[Karnasubarna]]. Other historians like Sailendra Nath Sen is of the opinion that Mahasenagupta - already under pressure from the Maukharis (for failing to provide adequate protection) - wouldn't have knowingly appointed Shashanka to such an important position. Middleton (2015) argues in a similar vein that Shashanka served as ''maha samanta'' to a Gauda king, possibly Jayanaga.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Middleton |first1=John |title=World Monarchies and Dynasties |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317451587 |page=330 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=R63ACQAAQBAJ |accessdate=15 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhether Shashanka was a feudatory under the Maukharis or the Guptas is not known. By 605 C.E. following Mahasenagupta's death, Shashanka had established what became known as the [[Gauda Kingdom]]. From there, he issued gold coins to celebrate his triumph, and came to be addressed as ''Maharajadhiraja'' (king of great kings).\n\n== Military campaigns and warfare ==\nNot many historical references to the Gauda Army are available. Like its predecessor, the Late Gupta army, Shashanka's army had infantry and cavalry units. D. C. Sircar (1990) reports that the Gauda army also fielded a strong elephant corps in Kamarupa.<ref name=\"Sircar_Assam\">{{cite book |last1=Sircar |first1=D C |title=Political History, in Barpujari, H K (ed.), The Comprehensive History of Assam (Vol-1) |date=1990 |publisher=Publication Board, Assam |location=Guwahati, India |pages=94\u2013171}}</ref>\n\nKamarupa king [[Bhaskaravarman]] describes the Gauda army as fielding a strong naval force.<ref name=\"Sircar_Geography_1971\">{{cite book |last1=Sircar |first1=Dineschandra |title=Studies in the Geography of Ancient and Medieval India |date=1971 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |location=India |isbn=9788120806900 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=AqKw1Mn8WcwC |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Campaign against the Varmans of Kamarupa (Assam) ===\nIt appears that between 595-600 C.E. the Gauda army had carried out attacks against the [[Varman dynasty|Varman King]] of Kamrupa (Assam). The Varman king died early in the war, and his two sons stepped up. The Doobi Copper Plate inscriptions tell us that the Gauda army fought and defeated the king, and princes Supratisthita and Bhaskara of Kamrupa.<ref name=\"Bakker_Skandapurana\">{{cite book |last1=Bakker |first1=Hans |title=The World of the Skandapur\u0101\u1e47a |date=2014 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004277144 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=6p2XCgAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref> The princes are described as fighting a mighty elephantry force.\n\nThe princes were brought back to Gauda as prisoners, but released shortly thereafter. They supposedly returned to their kingdom as feudatories under Shashanka. The younger of the two would soon turn against the Gauda.\n\n=== Campaign against the Maukharis of Kanyakubja (Kanauj) ===\nHans Bakker argues that the army that set out to attack the Maukharis in Kanyakubja was more of a \"confederation of all those who held a grudge\", and that it was led by Shashanka.<ref name=\"Bakker_Skandapurana\" />\n\nNow because the ruling dynasties of Kanyakubja and Sthaniswara were related by matrimony, Thanesar king [[Rajyavardhana]] immediately set out with 10,000 cavalrymen to recapture Kanyakubja and avenge his sister Rajyashri. Rajyavardhana fought and killed Devagupta on the way. As he continued towards Kanyakubja, he came across Shashanka's army. Circa 606 C.E. Rajyavardhana was killed by Shashanka. No conclusive evidence exists but it is possible that Shashanka, who joined the battle as an ally of [[Devagupta]], murdered him. The only source available in this matter is the ''[[Harshacharita]]'' by [[B\u0101\u1e47abha\u1e6d\u1e6da]], who was a childhood friend and constant companion of [[Harsha]]; neither of these men were present at the death.\n\n=== War with [[Harsha]] of Sthanisvara (Thanesar) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nHarsha succeeded his brother as ruler of Thanesar in 606 C.E. and he once again gathered the army and attacked Kannauj. Shashanka and his allies fought a major war with the then emperor of [[Thanesar]], [[Harsha]], and his allies. It is evident that Shashanka had to retreat from Kannauj. The result of the battle was inconclusive as Shashanka is documented to have retained dominion over his lands. Shashanka continued to rule Gauda with frequent attacks from Harsha, which he is known to have faced bravely.\n\n== Extent of kingdom ==\n\nShashanka first established himself in [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]], and set his eyes on Magadha. Magadha at that time was under Maukhari rule, and Shashanka vowed to free it again.\n\nSen (1977) has shown that none other than Shashanka could have defeated the [[Maukhari dynasty|Maukhari]] rulers of Magadha.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Bindeshwari Prasad |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=India |pages=129\u2013131 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> Next,\nhe focused on extending his kingdom to [[Odissi|Odissa]], parts of Central Provinces, and Bihar.\n\nThough Shashanka remains known, and referred to, as the Lord of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]], his kingdom included more than just that region. By the end of his reign, his domain stretched from [[Vanga (Bengal)|Vanga]] to [[Bhubaneswar|Bhuvanesha]] while in the east, his kingdom bordered [[Kamarupa]].\n\n=== Peak of Gauda Kingdom's expansion ===\nAt its peak, Shashanka's kingdom and conquests included the following small kingdoms, provinces, principalities and feudatory estates (in alphabetical order):<ref name=\"History_UK\" /> \n* Chandradwipa (southern Bangladesh) \n* Dandabhukti (southern West Bengal) \n* Gauda (parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh) \n* Harikela (north-eastern Bangladesh) \n* Kamrupa (Assam)\n* Karna Subarna (part of West Bengal) \n* Lukhnauti (North Bengal and Bihar) \n* Navyabakashika (central and southern Bangladesh) \n* Pundra Vardhana (now northern Bangladesh) \n* Rarh (southern areas of West Bengal) \n* Samatata (eastern Bangladesh)\n* Subarnabithi (central Bangladesh)\n* Summha Desa (south-western West Bengal) \n* Vanga (central Bangladesh)\n* Vangala (southern Bangladesh) \n* Varendra (northern Bangladesh)\n\nWhether all of the above came into the folds of the kingdom during Shashanka's lifetime, is not known. Also, while Shashanka is known to have occupied both Kamrupa and Kanyakubja, he could/did not hold on to either for long. Some historians maintain that Shashanka annexed Jharkhand as well.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Rajak |first=Jay Prakash |date=October 2012 |title=Geographical analysis of the dimensions of population characteristics in Jharkhand State |type=PhD |chapter=History and Location of Jharkhand |chapter-url=https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/103438/9/09_chapter%203.pdf |publisher=Visva-Bharati University |page=42 |hdl=10603/103438 |access-date=}}</ref>{{better source|reason=Citation is to a background chapter of the thesis of a geographer, not a historian, and they cite no sources for their statement that Shashank controled Jharkhand.|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Rule and administration ==\n\n[[File:Sasanka Deva king of Gauda circa 600-630.jpg|thumb|Coin of \u015aa\u015b\u0101nka-deva, king of Gauda, circa 600\u2013630.

The villagers replied that they suffered from an acute shortage of water.\n\nSo Shashank's mother urged her son to do something for the villagers, so that they still had water during the lean season. Not one to disobey his mother's wishes, Shashanka reportedly pulled out an arrow from his sheath, and announced that he would excavate a reservoir as long as the arrow's trajectory. And thus, over a period of three years, and with help from local nobles, Sarasanka came into existence.\n\n=== Shashanka (fiction) ===\nPublished in 1914, Shashanka is a historical novel penned by the famous Indian archaeologist [[R. D. Banerji|Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay]], who is best known for his discoveries in [[Mohenjo Daro]].

The name is derived from [[Sanskrit]], as another name for the Moon. \u015aa\u015b\u0101nka-deva therefore loosely translates to Moon god. The Hindu god [[Shiva]] is also known as ''Shashank Sekhar'' as He holds the moon on his head.\n\nThe Chinese monk [[Xuanzang]]'s writings, he is mentioned as She-Shang-Kia.

On top of that, starting circa 480 C.E. [[Alchon Huns|Alchon Hun]] armies began attacking the declining empire from multiple sides. Defence of the vast empire put a strain on the royal treasury. Though the Huns were initially driven out, the protracted invasions quickened the downfall of the Gupta kings. It may be noted that Indian archeologist Shanker Sharma has argued that the empire's end was precipitated by a massive deluge around the middle of the sixth century C.E.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raj |first1=Dev |title=Deluge drowned mighty Guptas: Study |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/deluge-drowned-mighty-guptas-study/cid/1685500 |website=www.telegraphindia.com |accessdate=14 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  \n\nNear the end of the sixth century, the empire was ruled over by a feeble ruler belonging to the [[Later Gupta dynasty]], Mahasenagupta (r. c. 562-601 C.E.).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Bindeshwari Prasad |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=India |pages=129\u2013131 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> The [[Gupta_Empire#Decline_of_the_empire|decline of the Gupta empire]] had left the disintegrating empire in chaos. Numerous local kings and rulers like [[Yashodharman]] emerged, and started vying for control of the many pieces of the former empire. Shashanka emerged as one of these ambitious local rulers, aiming to seize control of Gauda and its surrounding region. \n\n[[File:Rohtasgarh Fort Inside Side View.jpg|thumb|The Rohtasgarh Fort, built circa 7th century]]\nThe first mention of Shashanka is found in the 7th century hill fort [[Rohtas Fort|Rohtasgarh]] in the small town of Rohtas in the kingdom of Magadha. The seal bore a curt inscription, \"Mahasamanta Shashankadeva.\" \n\nSome historians believe that Shashanka began his career as a feudatory chief (maha [[samanta]]) under Mahasenagupta, of the [[Later_Gupta_dynasty|Later Gupta Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=N. S. |title=Ancient Indian history and civilization |date=1999 |publisher=New Age International |location=India |isbn=81-224-1198-3 |edition=Second |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books/about/Ancient_Indian_History_and_Civilization.html?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> And that after the death of Mahasenagupta, Shashanka drove the later Guptas and other prominent nobles out of the region and established his own kingdom with his capital at [[Karnasubarna]]. Other historians like Sailendra Nath Sen is of the opinion that Mahasenagupta - already under pressure from the Maukharis (for failing to provide adequate protection) - wouldn't have knowingly appointed Shashanka to such an important position. Middleton (2015) argues in a similar vein that Shashanka served as ''maha samanta'' to a Gauda king, possibly Jayanaga.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Middleton |first1=John |title=World Monarchies and Dynasties |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317451587 |page=330 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=R63ACQAAQBAJ |accessdate=15 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>   \n\nWhether Shashanka was a feudatory under the Maukharis or the Guptas is not known. By 605 C.E. following Mahasenagupta's death, Shashanka had established what became known as the [[Gauda Kingdom]]. From there, he issued gold coins to celebrate his triumph, and came to be addressed as ''Maharajadhiraja'' (king of great kings).\n\n== Military campaigns and warfare ==\nNot many historical references to the Gauda Army are available. Like its predecessor, the Late Gupta army, Shashanka's army had infantry and cavalry units. D. C. Sircar (1990) reports that the Gauda army also fielded a strong elephant corps in Kamarupa.<ref name=\"Sircar_Assam\">{{cite book |last1=Sircar |first1=D C |title=Political History, in Barpujari, H K (ed.), The Comprehensive History of Assam (Vol-1) |date=1990 |publisher=Publication Board, Assam |location=Guwahati, India |pages=94\u2013171}}</ref>  \n\nKamarupa king [[Bhaskaravarman]] describes the Gauda army as fielding a strong naval force.<ref name=\"Sircar_Geography_1971\">{{cite book |last1=Sircar |first1=Dineschandra |title=Studies in the Geography of Ancient and Medieval India |date=1971 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |location=India |isbn=9788120806900 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=AqKw1Mn8WcwC |language=en}}</ref>  \n\n=== Campaign against the Varmans of Kamarupa (Assam) ===\nIt appears that between 595-600 C.E. the Gauda army had carried out attacks against the [[Varman dynasty|Varman King]] of Kamrupa (Assam). The Varman king died early in the war, and his two sons stepped up. The Doobi Copper Plate inscriptions tell us that the Gauda army fought and defeated the king, and princes Supratisthita and Bhaskara of Kamrupa.<ref name=\"Bakker_Skandapurana\">{{cite book |last1=Bakker |first1=Hans |title=The World of the Skandapur\u0101\u1e47a |date=2014 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004277144 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=6p2XCgAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref> The princes are described as fighting a mighty elephantry force.\n\nThe princes were brought back to Gauda as prisoners, but released shortly thereafter. They supposedly returned to their kingdom as feudatories under Shashanka. The younger of the two would soon turn against the Gauda.\n\n=== Campaign against the Maukharis of Kanyakubja (Kanauj) ===\nHans Bakker argues that the army that set out to attack the Maukharis in Kanyakubja was more of a \"confederation of all those who held a grudge\", and that it was led by Shashanka.<ref name=\"Bakker_Skandapurana\" />\n\nNow because the ruling dynasties of Kanyakubja and Sthaniswara were related by matrimony, Thanesar king [[Rajyavardhana]] immediately set out with 10,000 cavalrymen to recapture Kanyakubja and avenge his sister Rajyashri. Rajyavardhana fought and killed Devagupta on the way. As he continued towards Kanyakubja, he came across Shashanka's army. Circa 606 C.E. Rajyavardhana was killed by Shashanka. No conclusive evidence exists but it is possible that Shashanka, who joined the battle as an ally of [[Devagupta]], murdered him. The only source available in this matter is the ''[[Harshacharita]]'' by [[B\u0101\u1e47abha\u1e6d\u1e6da]], who was a childhood friend and constant companion of [[Harsha]]; neither of these men were present at the death.\n\n=== War with [[Harsha]] of Sthanisvara (Thanesar) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nHarsha succeeded his brother as ruler of Thanesar in 606 C.E. and he once again gathered the army and attacked Kannauj. Shashanka and his allies fought a major war with the then emperor of [[Thanesar]], [[Harsha]], and his allies. It is evident that Shashanka had to retreat from Kannauj. The result of the battle was inconclusive as Shashanka is documented to have retained dominion over his lands. Shashanka continued to rule Gauda with frequent attacks from Harsha, which he is known to have faced bravely.\n\n== Extent of kingdom ==\n\nShashanka first established himself in [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]], and set his eyes on Magadha. Magadha at that time was under Maukhari rule, and Shashanka vowed to free it again. \n\nSen (1977) has shown that none other than Shashanka could have defeated the [[Maukhari dynasty|Maukhari]] rulers of Magadha.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Bindeshwari Prasad |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=India |pages=129\u2013131 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> Next,\nhe focused on extending his kingdom to [[Odissi|Odissa]], parts of Central Provinces, and Bihar. \n\nThough Shashanka remains known, and referred to, as the Lord of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]], his kingdom included more than just that region. By the end of his reign, his domain stretched from [[Vanga (Bengal)|Vanga]] to [[Bhubaneswar|Bhuvanesha]] while in the east, his kingdom bordered [[Kamarupa]].\n\n=== Peak of Gauda Kingdom's expansion ===\nAt its peak, Shashanka's kingdom and conquests included the following small kingdoms, provinces, principalities and feudatory estates (in alphabetical order):<ref name=\"History_UK\" /> \n* Chandradwipa (southern Bangladesh) \n* Dandabhukti (southern West Bengal) \n* Gauda (parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh) \n* Harikela (north-eastern Bangladesh) \n* Kamrupa (Assam)\n* Karna Subarna (part of West Bengal) \n* Lukhnauti (North Bengal and Bihar) \n* Navyabakashika (central and southern Bangladesh) \n* Pundra Vardhana (now northern Bangladesh) \n* Rarh (southern areas of West Bengal) \n* Samatata (eastern Bangladesh)\n* Subarnabithi (central Bangladesh)\n* Summha Desa (south-western West Bengal) \n* Vanga (central Bangladesh)\n* Vangala (southern Bangladesh) \n* Varendra (northern Bangladesh)\n\nWhether all of the above came into the folds of the kingdom during Shashanka's lifetime, is not known. Also, while Shashanka is known to have occupied both Kamrupa and Kanyakubja, he could/did not hold on to either for long. Some historians maintain that Shashanka annexed Jharkhand as well.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Rajak |first=Jay Prakash |date=October 2012 |title=Geographical analysis of the dimensions of population characteristics in Jharkhand State |type=PhD |chapter=History and Location of Jharkhand |chapter-url=https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/103438/9/09_chapter%203.pdf |publisher=Visva-Bharati University |page=42 |hdl=10603/103438 |access-date=}}</ref>{{better source|reason=Citation is to a background chapter of the thesis of a geographer, not a historian, and they cite no sources for their statement that Shashank controled Jharkhand.|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Rule and administration ==\n\n[[File:Sasanka Deva king of Gauda circa 600-630.jpg|thumb|Coin of \u015aa\u015b\u0101nka-deva, king of Gauda, circa 600-630.

However Gauda was soon divided amongst [[Harsha]] and [[Bhaskaravarman]] of [[Kamarupa]], the latter even managing to conquer [[Karnasuvarna]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nSasanka was the first fully sovereign ruler of Bengal, and he occupies a prominent place in its history and collective memory.<ref name=\"History_UK\" /> Shashanka's legacy is closely related to that of the kingdom that he founded, and the kingdom that rose and fell with him. But its legacy continued, leading later kings and sultans to accept Gauda's political demarcation. Later rulers built their edifices and monuments on older sites, and [[Pala Dynasty|Pala kings]] even retained Shashanka's unique title of ''Gaureshwara'' (the lord of Gauda) for themselves.<ref name=\"Gaur-legacy\">{{cite book |last1=Chatterjee |first1=Ratnabali |title=The Making of History: Essays Presented to Irfan Habib |date=2002 |publisher=Wimbledon Publishing Company |location=United Kingdom |isbn=1843310538 |page=505 |edition=First |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=ejrBraqBaLQC |accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref> \n\nCommenting on the symbolism of Gauda, [[Akshay Kumar Maitreya]] remarked, \u201cThe whole of Gaur was once known as Gaura Desh.

Many historians and commentators argue that Shashanka was the first independent king of not only Gauda, but of Bengal. As such he is a symbolic figure in the region's aspirations for independence and self-rule.\n\nShashanka's feat in bringing the many tribes and kingdoms under a single flag becomes clear only after his death. Chaos broke out in Bengal with the demise of the Gauda Kingdom. In Pala inscriptions, this time is called Matsyanyayam, implying times of 'jungle rule' when big fish swallow up small fish.<ref>{{cite web |title=Matsyanyayam |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Matsyanyayam |website=Banglapedia |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> \n   \nIt is thought that the development of the [[Bengali calendar]] took place under Shashanka's reign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shashanka|title=Shashanka|website=Banglapedia|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/dynasty/shashanakadynasty.html|title=Shashanka Dynasty|website=indianmirror.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V0GEtXp-GsUC&pg=PA104&dq=king+shashanka#v=onepage|title= A History of India|year = 1998|isbn=0203443454}}</ref>\n\n== In folk and popular culture ==\n\n=== Sarasanka Dighi (folk legend) ===\nSituated in present day [[Midnapore]], Sarasanka is a massive ''dighi'' (manmade lake) measuring over 140 acres.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maity |first1=Atanunandan |title=A Note on Sarasanka Dighi |url=http://www.chitrolekha.com/V4/n1/07_Sarasanka_Dantan_Medinipur.pdf |website=Chitrolekha International Magazine on Art and Design |accessdate=16 September 2019 |ref=sarasanka}}</ref> That is nearly equal to the total area of 80 football fields.

The villagers replied that they suffered from an acute shortage of water. \n\nSo Shashank's mother urged her son to do something for the villagers, so that they still had water during the lean season. Not one to disobey his mother's wishes, Shashanka reportedly pulled out an arrow from his sheath, and announced that he would excavate a reservoir as long as the arrow's trajectory. And thus, over a period of three years, and with help from local nobles, Sarasanka came into existence. \n\n=== Shashanka (fiction) ===\nPublished in 1914, Shashanka is a historical novel penned by the famous Indian archaeologist [[R._D._Banerji|Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay]], who is best known for his discoveries in [[Mohenjo Daro]]. Commentators have claimed that Bandyopadhyay was frustrated with the lack of historical and archaeological resources in Bengal. He found Shashanka to be a potent symbol of Bengal's glorious past and future political aspirations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bhattacharya |first1=Asok K. |title=Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay |date=1999 |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |isbn=8126008482 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=b5axYviGjO8C |accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref> This led him to use fiction as a vehicle for re-constructing Bengal's historical narrative.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of rulers of Bengal]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[R.
