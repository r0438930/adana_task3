The applicants, all of whom were given anonymity, complained that part of the [[Damage|compensation]] they received because of the contamination was not being afforded an annual reassessment according to the [[inflation rate]]. Following transfusions or the administration of blood derivatives, the applicants were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and/or hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C. Forty of the applicants or their relatives suffered from [[haemophilia]], a condition which requires frequent infusions of [[blood products]]. The other applicants were infected through blood [[transfusions]] carried out during the course of hospital treatment.\n\nThe compensation was to include a supplementary indemnity, in Italian ''\u2033indennit\u00e0 integrativa speciale\u2033'', abbreviated to \u2033IIS\u2033. This indemnity component (IIS) was to be subject to reassessment based on the annual rate of inflation and was intended to prevent or reduce the effects of currency devaluation. However, the Italian government made interventions as to the re-assessment of this supplementary allowance (the IIS) as they believed that it was not possible to uprate the amount in line with inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://def.finanze.it/DocTribFrontend/executePrintArticolo.do?id={147A06D6-9990-42F4-ADF0-C57A278A9C82}&codiceOrdinamento=200001100000000&articolo=Articolo%2011 |title=Decreto-legge del 31/05/2010 n. 78 (Articolo 11) |last= |first= |date=31 May 2010 |website= |publisher=Dipartimento delle Finanze |at=[13] |language=Italian |format= pdf|access-date=2020-04-29 |quote=''Il comma 2 dell\u2032articolo 2 della legge 25 febbraio 1992, n. 210 e successive modificazioni si interpreta nel senso che la somma corrispondente all\u2032importo dell\u2032indennita\u2032 integrativa speciale non e\u2032 rivalutata secondo il tasso d\u2032inflazione...''}}</ref> In the absence of the annual revaluation, the monetary value of the IIS was fated to gradually decrease.  In addition, the IIS was thought to represent between 90% and 95% of the total amount of the compensation.

The infection with contaminated blood and blood products had led to some suffering liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or a combination of several pathologies, in some, AIDS and hepatitis.  In some cases this was often accompanied by the underlying condition of haemophilia. One applicant suffered from a nervous breakdown leading to several suicide attempts.\n\nFrom the point the case application had been communicated to the Italian government, six applicants unfortunately died. Their heirs were then established in the Court proceedings.\n\nThe applicants provided medical certificates and expert medical reports showing the reduced life expectancy of people infected with the hepatitis virus and HIV.  The expert evidence made out a strict link between the applicant\u2019s prognosis of survival and the beneficial effect of the compensation allowances in question. \n\nThe Court considered that they were obligated to take the pathologies of the applicants into account. In particular, how six of them had died during the proceedings. The judges also attached particular importance to the fact that the annual reassessment (the IIS) represented more than 90% of the total amount of the compensation paid to the applicants.\n\n==Relevant law==\nUnder Law No. 210/1992, the applicants received compensation from the Italian Ministry of Health for the permanent damage they suffered as a result of their contamination.\n\nLaw No. 210/1992 stated that additional compensation, ''\u2033indennizzo ulteriore\u2033'', is to be granted to persons who have suffered damage as a result of compulsory vaccinations and that this additional compensation should be subject to an annual reassessment based on the rate of inflation.\n\nThe applicant's arguments relied on various articles and protocols of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] as follows: Article 6 section 1, Article 13, Article 14, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12.<ref>{{cite court|litigants= Affaire M.
