Starting his political career in the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], he [[party switching|switched]] to the Labour Party around the turn of the 20th century. He represented that party in the [[B\u00e6rum]] municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of [[Stortinget|Parliament]], but served nonetheless as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1935 to 1940, as part of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government-in-exile]] following [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Germany's invasion of Norway]]. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, a decision that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to his academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAs an academic he was a professor of history at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] (now the University of Oslo) from 1910 to 1935, having become a [[research fellow]] in 1900 and [[docent]] in 1908. Among many honors, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was a prolific writer, and touched on numerous subjects during his long academic career. He wrote several biographies; his works on [[Johan Sverdrup]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]] spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian [[nation]]. He was also interested in the [[United States]] and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.\n\nKoht's views on the [[Norwegian language]] also gave him nationwide academic recognition. He championed the [[Norwegian language#Danish to Norwegian|Samnorsk]] language reform, the declared aim of which was to consolidate the two standards of written Norwegian. A reform pushing the formal written language in this direction was indeed implemented in 1938, but historical events led to the failure of this policy. A pertinacious and unyielding advocate of international peace, Koht was a founding member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]] and an ordinary member of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]. As an activist and politician he was described as a strong-willed and individualistic person, who nurtured a strong belief in taking an academic and legal perspective on political problems.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Paul_Koht_by_L_Szacinski.jpg|left|thumb|Koht's father [[Paul Steenstrup Koht]] (1844\u20131892)|alt=photograph of elderly man with glasses]]\nHalvdan Koht was born on 7 August 1873 in [[Troms\u00f8]], one of the larger cities in Northern Norway.

The family moved to Skien when Halvdan was twelve years old, where his father again immersed himself in politics: he served as mayor as well as parliamentarian for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]].

One child died in infancy, but the remaining two had distinguished careers: [[\u00c5se Gruda Skard]] (n\u00e9e Koht) became a child psychologist and [[Paul Koht]] an ambassador.

He rarely had responsibility for any teaching of the students, and since he was often busy with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'' he remained a research fellow until 1907. In 1908 he took his [[dr.philos.]] degree on the thesis ''Die Stellung Norwegens und Schwedens im Deutsch-D\u00e4nischen Konflikt 1863\u20131864''.<ref name=innleiing7/> Opponents at the dissertation were [[Ebbe Hertzberg]] and [[Yngvar Nielsen]].<ref name=p119>Koht, 1951: pp. 119\u2013122.</ref>\n\nKoht was then hired as a [[docent]] at the University in 1908. Because Koht had internal opponents at the university, the docenture was designated to cover \"cultural history\" instead of \"history\". A while later the university changed it to \"history\". The [[L\u00f8vland's Cabinet|cabinet]] changed it back to \"cultural history\", before the Parliament finally decided on \"history\".<ref name=p119/> Koht was going to start his tenure as a docent, but argued with [[Waldemar Christofer Br\u00f8gger (geologist)|Waldemar Christofer Br\u00f8gger]] that he deserved to travel abroad first.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 124.</ref> From 1908 to 1909 Koht travelled around in the United States, England and Sweden, visiting the peace conferences in London (1908), [[Chicago]] (1909) and Stockholm (1910).<ref name=innleiing7/> During these years, his wife, daughter and her nanny lived in Eidsvoll.<ref>Skard, 1974: p. 123.</ref> Koht then returned to Norway and the university, and remained docent until being promoted to professor in 1910. He remained professor until 1935, and also served as the [[dean (education)|dean]] of his Faculty from 1912 to 1917.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n===Fields of research===\nKoht faced considerable skepticism among academics when announcing his intentions to study [[social history]] from the farmers' perspective. Gustav Storm claimed that farmers in Norway had \"done no effort of their own\".<ref name=p35/> [[Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae]] exclaimed that a person whom Koht wanted to study, the farmer-politician [[John G. Neergaard]], was a \"crook&nbsp;... oh well, trahit sua quemque voluptas\".<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 34.</ref> Koht was given {{NOK|100}} to do research in [[Nordm\u00f8re]] on Neergaard.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 104.</ref> In 1896 professor [[Cathrinus Bang]] replied to Koht's wish to study social history: \"Yes, do not go out and become a socialist!\"<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 106.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, Koht completed the dissertation ''Bonde mot borgar i nynorsk historie'', in which he further developed his theories on the role of the farmers in history.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 152.</ref> Published in the journal ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Oslo)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' in 1912, it featured an elaboration on Koht's theory about class and the nation. According to Koht, the community of the nation was expanded in a democratic way when the agrarian movement, then the labour movement, both rose from political passivity to demand a place in the political and national sphere.<ref name=nbl/> He wrote about this in the 1910 article ''Norsk folkesamling'' as well.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 153.</ref> The book ''Norsk bondereisning'', published in 1926 as a compilation of Koht's presented material in his university lectures, represented the culmination of Koht's work on the topic of [[class conflict]] between the agrarian and the urban population. Koht argued that the peasant movement had abandoned the cause of [[class interest]] in favour of universal rights and social reforms. The same perspective had to be applied to the struggle of the labour movement, Koht maintained.<ref name=nbl/> An economic background for the farmers' rising was presented in 1912, in ''Priser og politikk i norsk historie'', originally a lecture for the second Norwegian conference of historians.<ref name=p155>Koht, 1951: pp. 154\u2013155.</ref> This lecture was also where his [[historical materialism]] came to fruition.<ref name=nbl/> In 1951 he stated that he \"has never thought that the theories could be foundational for a political or social uprising\".<ref name=p155/>\n\nKoht's stay in the United States affected his historical views and adaptation of historical materialism,<ref name=nbl/> and he also tried to encourage the study of [[History of the United States|American history]] in Norway.<ref name=p150>Koht, 1951: pp. 150\u2013151.</ref> American culture did not have a particularly high standing in Norway at the time. In school, Koht did not learn proper English.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 58.</ref> Before he embarked to the US, some historian colleagues insinuated that the country \"barely had any history\" and was not worth visiting.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 123.</ref> Koht's first writing on the subject came in 1910 with the lecture ''Genesis of American Independence''. He followed with ''Pengemakt og arbeid i Amerika'' (\"Monetary Power and Labor in America\", 1910), which was based on \"People's Academy\" lectures,<ref name=p150/> then ''Amerikansk kultur'' (\"American Culture\", 1912) and ''Den amerikanske nasjonen'' (\"The American Nation\", 1920).<ref name=nsd/> He would return briefly to American academia during his career, for instance in the autumn of 1930 to hold a course at [[Harvard University]].<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 165.</ref>\n\nWishing to unite materialism and idealism, Koht became interested in psychology and the role of individuals in history. The latter focus led to his becoming, in the words of his biographer [[\u00c5smund Svendsen]], \"one of the greatest biographers of the 20th century\".<ref name=nbl/> Inspired by the work with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'', he wrote a life of the author [[Henrik Wergeland]] in 1908. Later he published biographies both of Norwegians and foreigners: [[Otto von Bismarck]] (1911), [[Ivar Aasen]] (1913), [[Johan Sverdrup]] in three volumes between 1916 and 1925, [[Marcus Thrane]] in 1917, [[Henrik Ibsen]] in two volumes in 1928 and 1929, and [[Haakon VII of Norway]] in 1943.<ref name=nsd/> He also wrote about 400 pieces in the first edition of ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]'', a [[biographical dictionary]] which would become a preeminent source on important figures in Norwegian history.<ref name=nbl/> Between 1909 and 1932 he published letters and original writings of Henrik Ibsen, [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]], [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]] and Henrik Wergeland. He chaired ''Kjeldeskriftfondet'' from 1918 to 1927 and ''Norsk historisk kjeldeskriftr\u00e5d'' from 1923 to 1928, two institutions that dealt with publishing of source texts.<ref name=nsd/> He also chaired the [[Norwegian Historical Association]] from 1912 to 1927 and 1932 to 1936,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|title=Historikk|publisher=[[Norwegian Historical Association]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155500/http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|archive-date=13 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> the [[Norwegian Genealogical Society]] from 1928 to 1940 and the [[Comit\u00e9 International des Sciences Historiques]] from 1926 to 1933.<ref name=nbl/><ref name=innleiing7/>\n\n===Honorary positions===\nKoht became a fellow of the learned society [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] in 1908.

Koht's first political arena was the [[Norwegian Students' Society]], where he vehemently argued that the [[flag of Norway]] should not contain the [[Union badge of Norway and Sweden|union badge]] (the \"flag case\").<ref>Koht, 1951: pp. 63\u201364.</ref> In 1893 he left this forum, co-founded a new students' association called ''Den Frisinnede Studenterforening'', and, as the students' association collectively entered the Liberal Party, became a board member of the local party branch in Kristiania.<ref name=p65/> He continued his fight against the union badge, and the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union]] as a whole. In 1905, when the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|union was dissolved altogether]], he agitated for the establishment of a republic, but [[1905 Norwegian monarchy plebiscite|a plebiscite]] decided to keep the monarchy.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nThough he never adhered to Christianity in his adolescent or adult life,<ref name=p58/> Koht valued the faith in the perfectability of human beings, as prompted \"the greatest religions\",<ref>See a lecture showing his attitude toward religion:\"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1931/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1931 \u2013 Presentation Speech]\", by Halvdan Koht.

He did so because fellow historian and Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1928, [[Edvard Bull Sr.]], had died, making Koht the \"Foreign Minister-designate\". The Labour Party also polled well in the [[1933 Norwegian parliamentary election]], leading them to prepare for office.<ref>\u00d8rvik, 1960.</ref> The Labour government was formed on 20 March 1935. Koht became Minister of Foreign Affairs in [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]'s [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Cabinet]].<ref name=nygaardsvold>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/the-government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/norway-at-war/johan-nygaardsvolds-government.html?id=438691|title=Johan Nygaardsvold's Government|publisher=[[Government.no]]|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> Among Koht's first actions as minister was to persuade the Labour Party not to pull Norway out of the [[League of Nations]], something the party had declared that it would do as recently as 1934.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 37.</ref> In foreign policy matters Koht and Nygaardsvold usually made decisions without consulting the other ministers, merely informing the rest of the cabinet of the decisions that had been made.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 207.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nygaardsvold Cabinet.jpg|thumb|[[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet]]. Koht is the third from left, standing between [[Fredrik Monsen]] and [[Johan Nygaardsvold]].]]\nAfter the League of Nations failed as an effective international body, Koht again favoured the strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] policy to which Norway had adhered before the League of Nations membership. For many years, he was reluctant to an expansion of a Norwegian military defense capacity.<ref name=nbl/> He did not vehemently and principally oppose such an expansion, and [[#Peace activism|had been]] quite friendly to the principle of a national defense in the past. His neutrality policy nonetheless put him on the \"defense-skeptical\" side together with Johan Nygaardsvold and most of his cabinet. Among the more \"defense-friendly\" in and around the cabinet, not the least from 1936, were [[Trygve Bratteli]], [[Haakon Lie]], [[Finn Moe]], [[Trygve Lie]], [[Oscar Torp]], [[Martin Tranm\u00e6l]] and Minister of Defense [[Fredrik Monsen]].<ref>Pryser, 1988: pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> In 1936 Koht expressed great concern for the consequences of the arms race taking place in Europe, which he felt could easily lead to war.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 38.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1936 outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]] in the conflict between [[Second Spanish Republic|the Spanish government]] and rebels led by [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government for the duration of the civil war.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;28\u201329.</ref> The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. [[Martin Tranm\u00e6l]], a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper ''[[Arbeiderbladet]]'', led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranm\u00e6l and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;39\u201341.</ref> Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the [[International Brigades]].<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;92\u201394.</ref> On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 164.</ref>\n\nFor Koht personally the civil war in Spain came close to ending his cabinet career on several occasions. On 9 April 1937, following a series of incidents where Francoist warships intercepted Norwegian vessels sailing on Spanish ports and confiscated both cargoes and ships, and Norwegian protests failing to gain results, Koht made a formal proposal to dispatch the Norwegian minelayer [[HNoMS Olav Tryggvason|''Olav Tryggvason'']] to Spain to protect Norwegian shipping. After the proposal met opposition in parliament and was set to fail, Koht offered to resign. Prime Minister Nygaardsvold refused to accept Koht's resignation, stating that he \"would rather be shot than lose Koht\". The case came close to causing the whole cabinet's fall in parliament, before it was agreed that it would be dropped.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;170\u201381.</ref> When Koht in 1938 attempted to establish a trade agreement with Franco, he was blocked by his own party and the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]]. Again requesting to be allowed to resign, Koht stayed after months of debating ended with the party giving the cabinet free rein to do what it saw as best with regards to trade with Franco. By October 1938 Koht had negotiated a trade agreement with Franco. The formal Norwegian recognition of the Franco government as the representative of Spain followed on 31 March 1939, three days after the [[Siege of Madrid|fall of Madrid]] to the nationalist forces.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;199\u2013208, 260, 271.</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n\n====Pre-war phase====\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Norwegian government declared the country neutral in the conflict. Both warring sides subsequently stated that they would respect Norway's neutrality, provided that she protect her neutrality against trespasses by the other side. Koht was clear from early on that Norway should remain neutral, but also that in the event of her being forced to enter the war it was critical that it was on the side of the British.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 2, 4.</ref>\n\nOver the first months of the Second World War Norwegian neutrality was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February [[Altmark Incident]] in [[J\u00f8ssingfjorden]]. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;26\u201332.</ref> Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.<ref>Lunde, 2009: p. 49.</ref>\n\nOn 5 April the Allies sent notes to both Norway and Sweden warning that they would take any action necessary if the Germans were allowed to use the neutral countries' territory to their advantage. Koht responded with a speech in which he said that the Allies had nothing to gain by interfering with Norwegian shipping lanes\u2014the British had a more significant trade with Norway than the Germans. The next day the Allies decided to launch [[Operation Wilfred|a mining operation]] on the Norwegian coast, and to land troops at Narvik in case the Germans responded to the mining by landing in Norway. Shortly before the mining was carried out, Koht warned the British that no further neutrality violations would be tolerated, and that in the future the Norwegians would respond with force.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;37\u201339.</ref> The Germans too repeatedly violated Norwegian neutrality, and, following a visit from the Norwegian fascist leader [[Vidkun Quisling]] to Hitler in December 1939, began serious planning for a possible occupation of Norway. Following the Altmark Incident, Hitler ordered the invasion of Norway.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;54\u201366.</ref> In response to the British mining operation on 8 April 1940, the Norwegian government lodged formal protests with the British and French governments, while secretly remaining set on avoiding war with the Allies at all cost. Koht told the Norwegian parliament that he believed that the Allies were trying to bring Norway into the war. The Allied mining of the Norwegian coast coincidentally distracted the Norwegian government from realising that large German forces had been on their way to invade Norway for several days prior.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 97, 222.</ref>\n\n====German invasion and war====\nAt the advent of the Nazi German [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasion of Norway of 9 April 1940, Germany sent the envoy [[Curt Br\u00e4uer]] to present demands of capitulation. Koht personally met with Br\u00e4uer, and rejected his demands and threats of war, stating that \"war had already started\". Koht and the cabinet fled Norway's capital in the morning of 9 April. Even though Koht rejected Br\u00e4uer's initial contact, he did convince the cabinet to listen to further German proposals for negotiations later the same day. All Norwegian negotiations with the Germans ended after a failed attempt to capture the Norwegian king and government [[Battle of Midtskogen|in Midtskogen]] early on 10 April.<ref name=nbl/><ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 226\u2013229.</ref> Koht was willing to take up the fight against the invaders. He wrote several key speeches, some of which were delivered by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], to convey staunch resistance to the German demands.<ref name=nkl/>\n\nVital to the Norwegian effort to try to halt the German advance was assistance from the Allies, which Koht requested in the early hours of 9 April, although skeptical of the potential of Allied aid.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 223, 227.</ref> When the rest of the government fled from [[Molde]] to [[Troms\u00f8]], landing on 1 May, Koht and [[Birger Ljungberg|Ljungberg]] (Minister of Defense) continued from there with the cruiser [[HMS Glasgow (C21)|HMS ''Glasgow'']] to London. Here, from 5 May they negotiated with British government representatives ([[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Philips]]) on British aid to Norway. Koht also made a radio speech from London on the BBC, broadcasting to Norway, and a speech on American radio. On 8 and 9 May he met [[Reynaud]], [[Maurice Gamelin|Gamelin]] and [[Daladier]] in Paris. The Norwegian Ministers departed from London on 11 May, arriving back in Norway on 17 May.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&bokid=innstillbilag2&sideid=149&innhaldid=4 |author=Parliament of Norway 1947 |title=pp. 298\u2013299 }}</ref> The talks with the Allies resulted in concrete promises and plans for large French reinforcements for the Norwegian front. These plans were however abandoned by the Allies on 24 May 1940, following the worsening situation for the Allies in France, and an evacuation decided.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 514\u2013515.</ref> Koht was informed by British Minister to Norway [[Cecil Dormer|Sir Cecil Dormer]] on 1 June that the Allied Forces had decided to retreat from Norway, owing to the difficult situation at the Western Front.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&bokid=innstillbilag2&sideid=149&innhaldid=4 |author=Parliament of Norway 1947 |title=pp. 300\u2013301 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to the Allied decision to evacuate, the cabinet sent Koht to [[Lule\u00e5]] in Sweden to try to reinvigorate a previously rejected plan to create a demarcation line between the Germans and Norwegian in Northern Norway. Swedish troops were planned to occupy Narvik. The plan was named the Mowinckel plan, after its initiator, the former prime minister [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]]. During a meeting with the Swedish minister of foreign affairs, [[Christian G\u00fcnther]], who was to act as a middle man with Germans in relation to the plan, Koht revealed that the Allies were about to evacuate Norway. Although G\u00fcnther never revealed the evacuation plans to the Germans, Koht was heavily criticised for doing so by his colleagues upon his return to Norway.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 518\u2013519.</ref>\n\n====In exile====\nThe cabinet eventually fled the country on 7 June. Koht landed in London on 19 June 1940, now heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile.<ref name=nbl/> Norway was now a close ally of the United Kingdom, but Koht was seen as clinging somewhat to his neutrality policy, and not embracing the alliance with the United Kingdom enough.<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Halvdan Koht|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Halvdan_Koht|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> From the autumn of 1940, Trygve Lie championed a change in policy which meant seeking lasting allies in the western world. Koht viewed this as \"distrust\". A schism between him and the rest of the cabinet grew as it also became known that Koht's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received reports of a possible forthcoming assault on Norway, without Koht having informed the cabinet thoroughly. Furthermore, there was discontent over Koht's decision to establish the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile in [[Bracknell]], several miles west of the cabinet headquarters.<ref name=nkl/>\n\nKoht was granted leave of absence on 19 November 1940, and ultimately left the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs on 20 February 1941,<ref name=nygaardsvold/> being succeeded by Trygve Lie.<ref name=nkl/> Koht decided to travel to Canada and then the United States. He lived with his daughter \u00c5sa and her family in [[Washington, DC]], returning to Norway after the end of the Second World War.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n===Political legacy===\n[[File:Professor Kohts vei og Gamle Drammensvei - 2012-03-11 at 12-16-31.jpg|thumb|Professor Kohts vei (lit. \"Professor Koht's street\") in [[B\u00e6rum]] was named after Halvdan Koht in 1967.]]\nTrygve Lie, who after the war had become the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations#List of Secretaries-General|first Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]], characterised Koht in his memoirs as an expert on foreign affairs, but introverted. He had relatively little contact with other politicians, kept to himself to study in peace, and spent much time on his extensive writing. Koht reportedly preferred to solve a problem by himself instead of involving co-workers and employees, even the experts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His way of thinking was logical and rational, but he allegedly nurtured an \"exaggerated belief in paragraphs\" and a \"dogmatic belief in international law\", and wrongly thought that other countries would obey formal regulations at most times.<ref>Lie, 1955: pp. 68\u201369.</ref> Koht had few or no alternatives to his neutrality policy, and in many ways he based his entire career in foreign affairs on that policy. Trygve Lie claimed that before the Second World War, the neutrality policy had \"become a religion\" for Koht.<ref>Lie, 1955: pp. 266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nKoht's role in the weak and unorganised defense against Operation Weser\u00fcbung was debated during and after the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation]]. After the World War, a commission named ''[[Unders\u00f8kelseskommisjonen av 1945]]'' (\"Scrutiny Commission of 1945\") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions.<ref name=snl/> After receiving ''Unders\u00f8kelseskommisjonen''{{'s}} analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an [[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] trial. The Parliament of Norway did not find it necessary, and no such trial took place.<ref name=snl/>\n\nSince Koht lived in Lysaker, B\u00e6rum Municipality wanted to honor him by naming a street after him. When the street was named in 1967, Koht was still controversial. The street was therefore named ''Professor Kohts vei'' (\"Professor Koht's Road\") to emphasise his academic, rather than his political career.<ref name=basbl>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|title=Professor Kohts vei.|encyclopedia=Budstikkas store Asker og B\u00e6rum-leksikon|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Bakken, Tor Chr.|url=http://www.ableksikon.no/Professor_Kohts_vei|access-date=4 May 2011|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-573-1534-4|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322091434/http://www.ableksikon.no/Professor_Kohts_vei|archive-date=22 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Language views==\nHailing from Troms\u00f8, Koht spoke a [[Northern Norway|Northern Norwegian]] dialect in his early life. In Skien his dialect provoked negative reactions from his peers. He was inspired by the dialects of Skien's surroundings ([[Telemark]]); from 1891 he wrote the \"rural\" [[Norwegian language conflict|language form]] [[Landsm\u00e5l]] with strong tinges of [[B\u00f8, Telemark|B\u00f8]] dialect.<ref name=nbl/><ref name=p43/> Before this he had attempted to write both \"[[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knudsen]] [[Riksm\u00e5l]]\" and \"[[Ivar Aasen|Aasen]] Landsm\u00e5l\", but neither stuck.<ref name=p58>Koht, 1951: pp. 58\u201359.</ref> Early publications on the [[Norwegian language struggle|Norwegian language controversy]] were ''Det norske m\u00e5lstr\u00e6vs historie'' (1898) and ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for m\u00e5lstr\u00e6ve'' (1900).<ref name=nsd/> He became a board member of the Landsm\u00e5l-based publishing house [[Det Norske Samlaget]], and edited the Landsm\u00e5l periodical ''Syn og Segn'' from 1901 to 1908, until 1905 together with [[Rasmus Flo]].<ref name=\"p43\"/> He chaired [[Noregs M\u00e5llag]], an association the propagation of Landsm\u00e5l, from 1921 to 1925.<ref name=nbl/> In 1929, Landsm\u00e5l was renamed [[Nynorsk]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=nynorsk|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|url=http://www.snl.no/nynorsk|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nKoht spoke of language in a social context in general and of the [[class struggle]] in particular. He eventually used the Labour Party as a vehicle for his language activism, especially after being asked by the party to write ''Arbeidarreising og m\u00e5lsp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l'' in 1921. In it, he synthesised the class struggle and language struggle in Norway, and because he was an integrationist he wanted a popular gathering around one written language.<ref name=nbl/> Koht became a member of ''Rettskrivingsnemnda'' in 1934,<ref name=nsd/> and in 1936 the Labour Party agreed that a language reform should be carried out, moving the two language forms [[Bokm\u00e5l]] and Nynorsk closer to one another. The language reforms took place in 1938 and promoted the [[Samnorsk]] ideal.<ref name=nbl/> The reforms were reversed in 1941 under Nazi rule; the original changes were reinstated after the end of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=S\u00f8rensen|first=\u00d8ystein|authorlink=\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|editor-first=Hans Fredrik|editor-last=Dahl|editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=rettskrivningsreformen av 1941|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|access-date=16 December 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231073302/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|archive-date=31 December 2009}}</ref> According to historian [[K\u00e5re Lunden]], Koht was much hated by many because of his language reforms, which were routinely perceived as attacks and degradations on their preferred language. His ideals were dubbed \"det kohtske knot\", i.e. \"the Kohtian mishmash\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Det kohtske knot|last=Hustad|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Hustad|date=15 January 2005|work=[[Klassekampen]]|language=Norwegian}}</ref> For his own part, Koht often used spellings that contrasted with both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l. The [[definite article]], which is formally the suffix \"-et\", was substituted with the suffix \"-e\", such as in the titles of his publications ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for m\u00e5lstr\u00e6ve'' and ''Sosialdemokratie''.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Peace activism==\nKoht's first travel abroad was in 1890, when he accompanied his father as well as [[Hans Jacob Horst]] and [[John Theodor Lund]] to an interparliamentary peace conference in London.<ref name=p58/> In 1895 he was a founding member and board member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]], serving as chairman from 1900 to 1902.<ref name=nbl/> From 1901 to 1902 he edited his own monthly periodical named ''Fredstidende'' (\"Peace Times\").<ref name=nsd/>\n\nThe Peace Association was dominated by Liberal Party politicians\u2014from a Marxist perspective, \"[[bourgeois]]\" people. Historian [[Nils Ivar Ag\u00f8y]] had noted that the socialists who were active in the bourgeois peace movement\u2014the most prominent being Koht, [[Adam Egede-Nissen]] and [[Carl Bonnevie]]\u2014were \"radicalised sons of the bourgeoisie\". This meant that they were \"capable of asserting themselves among the ship-owners and county governors in the board\" of the Norwegian Peace Association. Koht also followed his own goals during his first period as chairman. He wanted to tie the \"apolitical\" peace movement closer to the labour movement, to create \"economic justice\" and to employ the use of [[arbitration]] in labour conflicts. These goals were not embraced by all of the members, particularly not those who wanted to keep the Peace Association politically neutral. A larger problem, however, was that Koht rated Norwegian nationalism higher than pacifism. He had thus carried out his [[compulsory military service]] \"with fervor\", notes Ag\u00f8y. Koht demanded that the Peace Association did not resist to an armed defense of the \"fatherland\". The national convention in 1902 refused to acknowledge this principle, and Koht therefore resigned his membership.<ref>Ag\u00f8y, 2000: pp. 86\u201387.</ref> He was followed by others, as a result of a schism in the Peace Association between the pacifists and the more pragmatic peace activists. Koht has also been assessed as an ineffective organisational leader.<ref name=ringsp52>R\u00f8nning and Ringsby, 2010: p. 52.</ref> The defense question more or less solved itself when the Swedish-Norwegian union was [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|peacefully dissolved in 1905]].

He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940,<ref>{{cite book|title=Aarsberetninger fra Det Norske Stortings Nobelkomit\u00e9 1931\u20131945|author=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]|publisher=[[Parliament of Norway]]|language=Norwegian}}</ref> but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.<ref>{{cite web | title = All Nobel Peace Prize Laureates | publisher = Nobel Foundation| url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/ |accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nKoht's academic writing also encompassed the peace issue. His books on the subject include ''Histoire du mouvement de la paix en Norv\u00e8ge'' (\"History of the Peace Movement in Norway\", 1900) and ''Fredstanken i Noregs-sogo'' (\"The Notion of Peace in the History of Norway\", 1906).<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Post-political life==\nHaving stepped down from the exiled cabinet in 1941, Koht lived in the United States for the remainder of the war. There he continued his literary production;<ref name=snl/> however, the books ''Norway Neutral and Invaded'' (1941) and ''The Voice of Norway'' (1944) were both released in London. The first book dealt directly with the advent of war in Norway, and was released in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of Norway. It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948. Koht returned to Norway at the end of war.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nUpon returning to Norway, Koht published three books on the war-time events in Norway: ''For fred og fridom i krigstid 1939\u20131940'', ''Fr\u00e5 skanse til skanse. Minne fr\u00e5 krigsm\u00e5nadene i Noreg 1940'' and ''Norsk utanrikspolitikk fram til 9. april 1940. Synspunkt fr\u00e5 hendingstida'', all of which were released in 1947. These memoir-like books have been analysed as putting a self-apologetic message forth.<ref name=nbl/> His political career was effectively ended, but some of his ideas had prevailed. For instance, his analysis of the class situation in Norway became a part of the general social-democratic ideology of the post-war years.<ref name=snl/>\n\nDespite not holding the professor chair any longer, Koht continued his academic writing; his principal work from the post-war epoch was the six-volume ''Krise\u00e5r i norsk historie''. The six volumes each describe a decisive moment in Norwegian history. The first volume, released in 1950, centers on \"[[Vincens Lunge]] contra [[Henrik Krummedige]]\". The second volume (1951) describes [[Olav Engelbriktsson]] and Norway's descent into dependency to Denmark in 1537.

Starting his political career in the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], he [[party switching|switched]] to the Labour Party around the turn of the 20th century. He represented that party in the [[B\u00e6rum]] municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of [[Stortinget|Parliament]], but served nonetheless as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1935 to 1940, as part of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government-in-exile]] following [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Germany's invasion of Norway]]. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, a decision that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to his academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAs an academic he was a professor of history at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] (now the University of Oslo) from 1910 to 1935, having become a [[research fellow]] in 1900 and [[docent]] in 1908. Among many honors, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was a prolific writer, and touched on numerous subjects during his long academic career. He wrote several biographies; his works on [[Johan Sverdrup]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]] spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian [[nation]]. He was also interested in the [[United States]] and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.\n\nKoht's views on the [[Norwegian language]] also gave him nationwide academic recognition. He championed the [[Norwegian language#Danish to Norwegian|Samnorsk]] language reform, the declared aim of which was to consolidate the two standards of written Norwegian. A reform pushing the formal written language in this direction was indeed implemented in 1938, but historical events led to the failure of this policy. A pertinacious and unyielding advocate of international peace, Koht was a founding member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]] and an ordinary member of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]. As an activist and politician he was described as a strong-willed and individualistic person, who nurtured a strong belief in taking an academic and legal perspective on political problems.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:File:Paul_Koht_by_L_Szacinski.jpg|left|thumb|Koht's father [[Paul Steenstrup Koht]] (1844\u20131892)|alt=photograph of elderly man with glasses]]\nHalvdan Koht was born on 7 August 1873 in [[Troms\u00f8]], one of the larger cities in Northern Norway.

Gustav Storm claimed that farmers in Norway had \"done no effort of their own\".<ref name=p35/> [[Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae]] exclaimed that a person whom Koht wanted to study, the farmer-politician [[John G.

According to Koht, the community of the nation was expanded in a democratic way when the agrarian movement, then the labour movement, both rose from political passivity to demand a place in the political and national sphere.<ref name=nbl/> He wrote about this in the 1910 article ''Norsk folkesamling'' as well.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 153.</ref> The book ''Norsk bondereisning'', published in 1926 as a compilation of Koht's presented material in his university lectures, represented the culmination of Koht's work on the topic of [[class conflict]] between the agrarian and the urban population. Koht argued that the peasant movement had abandoned the cause of [[class interest]] in favour of universal rights and social reforms. The same perspective had to be applied to the struggle of the labour movement, Koht maintained.<ref name=nbl/> An economic background for the farmers' rising was presented in 1912, in ''Priser og politikk i norsk historie'', originally a lecture for the second Norwegian conference of historians.<ref name=p155>Koht, 1951: pp. 154\u2013155.</ref> This lecture was also where his [[historical materialism]] came to fruition.<ref name=nbl/> In 1951 he stated that he \"has never thought that the theories could be foundational for a political or social uprising\".<ref name=p155/>\n\nKoht's stay in the United States affected his historical views and adaptation of historical materialism,<ref name=nbl/> and he also tried to encourage the study of [[History of the United States|American history]] in Norway.<ref name=p150>Koht, 1951: pp. 150\u2013151.</ref> American culture did not have a particularly high standing in Norway at the time. In school, Koht did not learn proper English.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 58.</ref> Before he embarked to the US, some historian colleagues insinuated that the country \"barely had any history\" and was not worth visiting.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 123.</ref> Koht's first writing on the subject came in 1910 with the lecture ''Genesis of American Independence''. He followed with ''Pengemakt og arbeid i Amerika'' (\"Monetary Power and Labor in America\", 1910), which was based on \"People's Academy\" lectures,<ref name=p150/> then ''Amerikansk kultur'' (\"American Culture\", 1912) and ''Den amerikanske nasjonen'' (\"The American Nation\", 1920).<ref name=nsd/> He would return briefly to American academia during his career, for instance in the autumn of 1930 to hold a course at [[Harvard University]].<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 165.</ref>\n\nWishing to unite materialism and idealism, Koht became interested in psychology and the role of individuals in history. The latter focus led to his becoming, in the words of his biographer [[\u00c5smund Svendsen]], \"one of the greatest biographers of the 20th century\".<ref name=nbl/> Inspired by the work with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'', he wrote a life of the author [[Henrik Wergeland]] in 1908. Later he published biographies both of Norwegians and foreigners: [[Otto von Bismarck]] (1911), [[Ivar Aasen]] (1913), [[Johan Sverdrup]] in three volumes between 1916 and 1925, [[Marcus Thrane]] in 1917, [[Henrik Ibsen]] in two volumes in 1928 and 1929, and [[Haakon VII of Norway]] in 1943.<ref name=nsd/> He also wrote about 400 pieces in the first edition of ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]'', a [[biographical dictionary]] which would become a preeminent source on important figures in Norwegian history.<ref name=nbl/> Between 1909 and 1932 he published letters and original writings of Henrik Ibsen, [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]], [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]] and Henrik Wergeland.

Koht's first political arena was the [[Norwegian Students' Society]], where he vehemently argued that the [[flag of Norway]] should not contain the [[Union badge of Norway and Sweden|union badge]] (the \"flag case\").<ref>Koht, 1951: pp. 63\u201364.</ref> In 1893 he left this forum, co-founded a new students' association called ''Den Frisinnede Studenterforening'', and, as the students' association collectively entered the Liberal Party, became a board member of the local party branch in Kristiania.<ref name=p65/> He continued his fight against the union badge, and the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union]] as a whole. In 1905, when the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|union was dissolved altogether]], he agitated for the establishment of a republic, but [[1905 Norwegian monarchy plebiscite|a plebiscite]] decided to keep the monarchy.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nThough he never adhered to Christianity in his adolescent or adult life,<ref name=p58/> Koht valued the faith in the perfectability of human beings, as prompted \"the greatest religions\",<ref>See a lecture showing his attitude toward religion:\"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1931/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1931 \u2013 Presentation Speech]\", by Halvdan Koht.

It was proclaimed by [[Jesus Christ]]; it inspired the work of men like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Henrik Wergeland|Wergeland]].\"</ref> and he started to feel solidarity with the labour movement and the working classes, leading to the [[Political radicalism|radicalisation]] of his views: from 1900 he voted for the [[Norwegian Labour Party]],<ref name=nbl/> and had four years prior to that began to consider himself a [[socialist]].<ref name=innleiing7>Kj\u00e6rheim, 1985: p. 7.</ref> While living in the United States, he developed a form of historical materialism, which led to a fusion of history scholarship and political views. He viewed the Liberal Party as an important agent in Norwegian history, since it pronounced the rights of the farmers, but he now viewed the [[working class]] as the next class to be included in the political life, and specifically through the Labor Party.<ref name=nbl/> In Koht's Liberal Party period, he cooperated with some of their more radical members, among them [[Carl Jeppesen]], who later would join the Labour Party.<ref name=p65/> He joined the Labour Party when he returned from the United States and moved to [[B\u00e6rum]] in 1909.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 159.</ref> He lived with his family in [[Stabekk]], but commissioned a house in [[Lysaker]] in 1910.

The negotiations led to an agreement on Norwegian trade rights in the area, but a question of sovereignty over Eastern Greenland remained unsolved. In 1931, forces in and outside of the then-[[Centre Party (Norway)|Agrarian]] [[Kolstad's Cabinet|government]] annexed \"[[Erik the Red's Land]]\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|title=C J Hambro|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Paul|last=Thyness|authorlink=Paul Thyness|editor-first=Knut|editor-last=Helle|editor-link=Knut Helle|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|volume=4|edition=2nd|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/C_J_Hambro/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s Koht became the foremost international politician of the Labour Party. He positioned himself in the Labour Party as the prospective [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] should the party form a government. He did so because fellow historian and Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1928, [[Edvard Bull Sr.]], had died, making Koht the \"Foreign Minister-designate\". The Labour Party also polled well in the [[1933 Norwegian parliamentary election]], leading them to prepare for office.<ref>\u00d8rvik, 1960.</ref> The Labour government was formed on 20 March 1935. Koht became Minister of Foreign Affairs in [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]'s [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Cabinet]].<ref name=nygaardsvold>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/the-government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/norway-at-war/johan-nygaardsvolds-government.html?id=438691|title=Johan Nygaardsvold's Government|publisher=[[Government.no]]|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> Among Koht's first actions as minister was to persuade the Labour Party not to pull Norway out of the [[League of Nations]], something the party had declared that it would do as recently as 1934.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 37.</ref> In foreign policy matters Koht and Nygaardsvold usually made decisions without consulting the other ministers, merely informing the rest of the cabinet of the decisions that had been made.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 207.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nygaardsvold Cabinet.jpg|thumb|[[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet]]. Koht is the third from left, standing between [[Fredrik Monsen]] and [[Johan Nygaardsvold]].]]\nAfter the League of Nations failed as an effective international body, Koht again favoured the strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] policy to which Norway had adhered before the League of Nations membership. For many years, he was reluctant to an expansion of a Norwegian military defense capacity.<ref name=nbl/> He did not vehemently and principally oppose such an expansion, and [[#Peace activism|had been]] quite friendly to the principle of a national defense in the past. His neutrality policy nonetheless put him on the \"defense-skeptical\" side together with Johan Nygaardsvold and most of his cabinet. Among the more \"defense-friendly\" in and around the cabinet, not the least from 1936, were [[Trygve Bratteli]], [[Haakon Lie]], [[Finn Moe]], [[Trygve Lie]], [[Oscar Torp]], [[Martin Tranm\u00e6l]] and Minister of Defense [[Fredrik Monsen]].<ref>Pryser, 1988: pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> In 1936 Koht expressed great concern for the consequences of the arms race taking place in Europe, which he felt could easily lead to war.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 38.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1936 outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]] in the conflict between [[Second Spanish Republic|the Spanish government]] and rebels led by [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government for the duration of the civil war.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;28\u201329.</ref> The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. [[Martin Tranm\u00e6l]], a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper ''[[Arbeiderbladet]]'', led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranm\u00e6l and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;39\u201341.</ref> Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the [[International Brigades]].<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;92\u201394.</ref> On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 164.</ref>\n\nFor Koht personally the civil war in Spain came close to ending his cabinet career on several occasions. On 9 April 1937, following a series of incidents where Francoist warships intercepted Norwegian vessels sailing on Spanish ports and confiscated both cargoes and ships, and Norwegian protests failing to gain results, Koht made a formal proposal to dispatch the Norwegian minelayer [[HNoMS Olav Tryggvason|''Olav Tryggvason'']] to Spain to protect Norwegian shipping. After the proposal met opposition in parliament and was set to fail, Koht offered to resign. Prime Minister Nygaardsvold refused to accept Koht's resignation, stating that he \"would rather be shot than lose Koht\". The case came close to causing the whole cabinet's fall in parliament, before it was agreed that it would be dropped.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;170\u201381.</ref> When Koht in 1938 attempted to establish a trade agreement with Franco, he was blocked by his own party and the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]]. Again requesting to be allowed to resign, Koht stayed after months of debating ended with the party giving the cabinet free rein to do what it saw as best with regards to trade with Franco. By October 1938 Koht had negotiated a trade agreement with Franco. The formal Norwegian recognition of the Franco government as the representative of Spain followed on 31 March 1939, three days after the [[Siege of Madrid|fall of Madrid]] to the nationalist forces.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;199\u2013208, 260, 271.</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n\n====Pre-war phase====\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Norwegian government declared the country neutral in the conflict. Both warring sides subsequently stated that they would respect Norway's neutrality, provided that she protect her neutrality against trespasses by the other side. Koht was clear from early on that Norway should remain neutral, but also that in the event of her being forced to enter the war it was critical that it was on the side of the British.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 2, 4.</ref>\n\nOver the first months of the Second World War Norwegian neutrality was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February [[Altmark Incident]] in [[J\u00f8ssingfjorden]]. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;26\u201332.</ref> Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.<ref>Lunde, 2009: p. 49.</ref>\n\nOn 5 April the Allies sent notes to both Norway and Sweden warning that they would take any action necessary if the Germans were allowed to use the neutral countries' territory to their advantage. Koht responded with a speech in which he said that the Allies had nothing to gain by interfering with Norwegian shipping lanes\u2014the British had a more significant trade with Norway than the Germans. The next day the Allies decided to launch [[Operation Wilfred|a mining operation]] on the Norwegian coast, and to land troops at Narvik in case the Germans responded to the mining by landing in Norway. Shortly before the mining was carried out, Koht warned the British that no further neutrality violations would be tolerated, and that in the future the Norwegians would respond with force.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;37\u201339.</ref> The Germans too repeatedly violated Norwegian neutrality, and, following a visit from the Norwegian fascist leader [[Vidkun Quisling]] to Hitler in December 1939, began serious planning for a possible occupation of Norway. Following the Altmark Incident, Hitler ordered the invasion of Norway.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;54\u201366.</ref> In response to the British mining operation on 8 April 1940, the Norwegian government lodged formal protests with the British and French governments, while secretly remaining set on avoiding war with the Allies at all cost. Koht told the Norwegian parliament that he believed that the Allies were trying to bring Norway into the war. The Allied mining of the Norwegian coast coincidentally distracted the Norwegian government from realising that large German forces had been on their way to invade Norway for several days prior.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 97, 222.</ref>\n\n====German invasion and war====\nAt the advent of the Nazi German [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasion of Norway of 9 April 1940, Germany sent the envoy [[Curt Br\u00e4uer]] to present demands of capitulation. Koht personally met with Br\u00e4uer, and rejected his demands and threats of war, stating that \"war had already started\". Koht and the cabinet fled Norway's capital in the morning of 9 April. Even though Koht rejected Br\u00e4uer's initial contact, he did convince the cabinet to listen to further German proposals for negotiations later the same day. All Norwegian negotiations with the Germans ended after a failed attempt to capture the Norwegian king and government [[Battle of Midtskogen|in Midtskogen]] early on 10 April.<ref name=nbl/><ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 226\u2013229.</ref> Koht was willing to take up the fight against the invaders. He wrote several key speeches, some of which were delivered by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], to convey staunch resistance to the German demands.<ref name=nkl/>\n\nVital to the Norwegian effort to try to halt the German advance was assistance from the Allies, which Koht requested in the early hours of 9 April, although skeptical of the potential of Allied aid.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 223, 227.</ref> When the rest of the government fled from [[Molde]] to [[Troms\u00f8]], landing on 1 May, Koht and [[Birger Ljungberg|Ljungberg]] (Minister of Defense) continued from there with the cruiser [[HMS Glasgow (C21)|HMS ''Glasgow'']] to London. Here, from 5 May they negotiated with British government representatives ([[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Philips]]) on British aid to Norway. Koht also made a radio speech from London on the BBC, broadcasting to Norway, and a speech on American radio. On 8 and 9 May he met [[Reynaud]], [[Maurice Gamelin|Gamelin]] and [[Daladier]] in Paris. The Norwegian Ministers departed from London on 11 May, arriving back in Norway on 17 May.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&bokid=innstillbilag2&sideid=149&innhaldid=4 |author=Parliament of Norway 1947 |title=pp. 298\u2013299 }}</ref> The talks with the Allies resulted in concrete promises and plans for large French reinforcements for the Norwegian front.

Swedish troops were planned to occupy Narvik. The plan was named the Mowinckel plan, after its initiator, the former prime minister [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]]. During a meeting with the Swedish minister of foreign affairs, [[Christian G\u00fcnther]], who was to act as a middle man with Germans in relation to the plan, Koht revealed that the Allies were about to evacuate Norway. Although G\u00fcnther never revealed the evacuation plans to the Germans, Koht was heavily criticised for doing so by his colleagues upon his return to Norway.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 518\u2013519.</ref>\n\n====In exile====\nThe cabinet eventually fled the country on 7 June. Koht landed in London on 19 June 1940, now heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile.<ref name=nbl/> Norway was now a close ally of the United Kingdom, but Koht was seen as clinging somewhat to his neutrality policy, and not embracing the alliance with the United Kingdom enough.<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Halvdan Koht|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Halvdan_Koht|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> From the autumn of 1940, Trygve Lie championed a change in policy which meant seeking lasting allies in the western world. Koht viewed this as \"distrust\". A schism between him and the rest of the cabinet grew as it also became known that Koht's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received reports of a possible forthcoming assault on Norway, without Koht having informed the cabinet thoroughly. Furthermore, there was discontent over Koht's decision to establish the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile in [[Bracknell]], several miles west of the cabinet headquarters.<ref name=nkl/>\n\nKoht was granted leave of absence on 19 November 1940, and ultimately left the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs on 20 February 1941,<ref name=nygaardsvold/> being succeeded by Trygve Lie.<ref name=nkl/> Koht decided to travel to Canada and then the United States.

He had relatively little contact with other politicians, kept to himself to study in peace, and spent much time on his extensive writing. Koht reportedly preferred to solve a problem by himself instead of involving co-workers and employees, even the experts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His way of thinking was logical and rational, but he allegedly nurtured an \"exaggerated belief in paragraphs\" and a \"dogmatic belief in international law\", and wrongly thought that other countries would obey formal regulations at most times.<ref>Lie, 1955: pp. 68\u201369.</ref> Koht had few or no alternatives to his neutrality policy, and in many ways he based his entire career in foreign affairs on that policy. Trygve Lie claimed that before the Second World War, the neutrality policy had \"become a religion\" for Koht.<ref>Lie, 1955: pp. 266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nKoht's role in the weak and unorganised defense against Operation Weser\u00fcbung was debated during and after the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation]]. After the World War, a commission named ''[[Unders\u00f8kelseskommisjonen av 1945]]'' (\"Scrutiny Commission of 1945\") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions.<ref name=snl/> After receiving ''Unders\u00f8kelseskommisjonen''{{'s}} analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an [[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] trial. The Parliament of Norway did not find it necessary, and no such trial took place.<ref name=snl/>\n\nSince Koht lived in Lysaker, B\u00e6rum Municipality wanted to honor him by naming a street after him. When the street was named in 1967, Koht was still controversial.

He eventually used the Labour Party as a vehicle for his language activism, especially after being asked by the party to write ''Arbeidarreising og m\u00e5lsp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l'' in 1921. In it, he synthesised the class struggle and language struggle in Norway, and because he was an integrationist he wanted a popular gathering around one written language.<ref name=nbl/> Koht became a member of ''Rettskrivingsnemnda'' in 1934,<ref name=nsd/> and in 1936 the Labour Party agreed that a language reform should be carried out, moving the two language forms [[Bokm\u00e5l]] and Nynorsk closer to one another. The language reforms took place in 1938 and promoted the [[Samnorsk]] ideal.<ref name=nbl/> The reforms were reversed in 1941 under Nazi rule; the original changes were reinstated after the end of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=S\u00f8rensen|first=\u00d8ystein|authorlink=\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|editor-first=Hans Fredrik|editor-last=Dahl|editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=rettskrivningsreformen av 1941|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|access-date=16 December 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231073302/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|archive-date=31 December 2009}}</ref> According to historian [[K\u00e5re Lunden]], Koht was much hated by many because of his language reforms, which were routinely perceived as attacks and degradations on their preferred language. His ideals were dubbed \"det kohtske knot\", i.e. \"the Kohtian mishmash\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Det kohtske knot|last=Hustad|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Hustad|date=15 January 2005|work=[[Klassekampen]]|language=Norwegian}}</ref> For his own part, Koht often used spellings that contrasted with both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l. The [[definite article]], which is formally the suffix \"-et\", was substituted with the suffix \"-e\", such as in the titles of his publications ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for m\u00e5lstr\u00e6ve'' and ''Sosialdemokratie''.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Peace activism==\nKoht's first travel abroad was in 1890, when he accompanied his father as well as [[Hans Jacob Horst]] and [[John Theodor Lund]] to an interparliamentary peace conference in London.<ref name=p58/> In 1895 he was a founding member and board member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]], serving as chairman from 1900 to 1902.<ref name=nbl/> From 1901 to 1902 he edited his own monthly periodical named ''Fredstidende'' (\"Peace Times\").<ref name=nsd/>\n\nThe Peace Association was dominated by Liberal Party politicians\u2014from a Marxist perspective, \"[[bourgeois]]\" people. Historian [[Nils Ivar Ag\u00f8y]] had noted that the socialists who were active in the bourgeois peace movement\u2014the most prominent being Koht, [[Adam Egede-Nissen]] and [[Carl Bonnevie]]\u2014were \"radicalised sons of the bourgeoisie\". This meant that they were \"capable of asserting themselves among the ship-owners and county governors in the board\" of the Norwegian Peace Association. Koht also followed his own goals during his first period as chairman. He wanted to tie the \"apolitical\" peace movement closer to the labour movement, to create \"economic justice\" and to employ the use of [[arbitration]] in labour conflicts. These goals were not embraced by all of the members, particularly not those who wanted to keep the Peace Association politically neutral. A larger problem, however, was that Koht rated Norwegian nationalism higher than pacifism. He had thus carried out his [[compulsory military service]] \"with fervor\", notes Ag\u00f8y. Koht demanded that the Peace Association did not resist to an armed defense of the \"fatherland\". The national convention in 1902 refused to acknowledge this principle, and Koht therefore resigned his membership.<ref>Ag\u00f8y, 2000: pp. 86\u201387.</ref> He was followed by others, as a result of a schism in the Peace Association between the pacifists and the more pragmatic peace activists. Koht has also been assessed as an ineffective organisational leader.<ref name=ringsp52>R\u00f8nning and Ringsby, 2010: p. 52.</ref> The defense question more or less solved itself when the Swedish-Norwegian union was [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|peacefully dissolved in 1905]]. Koht later returned to the Peace Association to serve as a board member from 1910 to 1912.<ref name=nsd/>\n\nHe became a member of [[Institut International de la Paix]] in 1913.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bio \u2013 Halvdan Koht |publisher=Nobelprize.org |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/bios/koht.html |accessdate=9 October 2010 }}</ref> He was a consultant for the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]] from 1904 to 1913,<ref name=nsd/> with the task of examining proposed candidates for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940,<ref>{{cite book|title=Aarsberetninger fra Det Norske Stortings Nobelkomit\u00e9 1931\u20131945|author=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]|publisher=[[Parliament of Norway]]|language=Norwegian}}</ref> but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.<ref>{{cite web | title = All Nobel Peace Prize Laureates | publisher = Nobel Foundation| url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/ |accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nKoht's academic writing also encompassed the peace issue. His books on the subject include ''Histoire du mouvement de la paix en Norv\u00e8ge'' (\"History of the Peace Movement in Norway\", 1900) and ''Fredstanken i Noregs-sogo'' (\"The Notion of Peace in the History of Norway\", 1906).<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Post-political life==\nHaving stepped down from the exiled cabinet in 1941, Koht lived in the United States for the remainder of the war. There he continued his literary production;<ref name=snl/> however, the books ''Norway Neutral and Invaded'' (1941) and ''The Voice of Norway'' (1944) were both released in London. The first book dealt directly with the advent of war in Norway, and was released in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of Norway. It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948. Koht returned to Norway at the end of war.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nUpon returning to Norway, Koht published three books on the war-time events in Norway: ''For fred og fridom i krigstid 1939\u20131940'', ''Fr\u00e5 skanse til skanse. Minne fr\u00e5 krigsm\u00e5nadene i Noreg 1940'' and ''Norsk utanrikspolitikk fram til 9. april 1940. Synspunkt fr\u00e5 hendingstida'', all of which were released in 1947. These memoir-like books have been analysed as putting a self-apologetic message forth.<ref name=nbl/> His political career was effectively ended, but some of his ideas had prevailed. For instance, his analysis of the class situation in Norway became a part of the general social-democratic ideology of the post-war years.<ref name=snl/>\n\nDespite not holding the professor chair any longer, Koht continued his academic writing; his principal work from the post-war epoch was the six-volume ''Krise\u00e5r i norsk historie''. The six volumes each describe a decisive moment in Norwegian history. The first volume, released in 1950, centers on \"[[Vincens Lunge]] contra [[Henrik Krummedige]]\". The second volume (1951) describes [[Olav Engelbriktsson]] and Norway's descent into dependency to Denmark in 1537. The third and fourth volumes, released in 1952 and 1955, are about medieval kings: [[Sverre I of Norway|Sverre I]] and [[Harald I of Norway|Harald I]]. The fifth volume (1956) focuses on \"[[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margaret]] and the [[Kalmar Union]]\". The sixth and final volume (1960) chronicles the years from 1657 to 1661, when Denmark (and thus Norway) transitioned into an [[absolute monarchy]].<ref name=nbl/>\n\nKoht died on 12 December 1965 in B\u00e6rum.<ref name=nbl/> He was buried at [[Nordre gravlund]] in Oslo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disnorge.no/gravminner/index.php?language=engelsk|title=Cemeteries in Norway|publisher=DIS-Norge|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> Two works by Koht have been released posthumously: the memoirs ''Minne fr\u00e5 unge \u00e5r'' in 1968 and the diary ''Rikspolitisk dagbok 1933\u20131940'' in 1985.<ref name=innleiing12>Kj\u00e6rheim, 1985: p. 12.</ref> His son-in-law Sigmund Skard wrote a biography of him, ''Mennesket Halvdan Koht'' (\"Halvdan Koht the Man\") in 1982.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n== References and notes ==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite journal|last=Ag\u00f8y|first=Nils Ivar|authorlink=Nils Ivar Ag\u00f8y|year=2000|title=Et floket partnerskap.
