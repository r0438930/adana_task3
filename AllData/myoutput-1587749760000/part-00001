Bratenahl is a small community of fewer than 1,200 population inhabiting approximately 700 households, some of which are stately estates, townhouses, and condominiums on the lakefront.  Its famous Lake Shore Boulevard has been featured in many magazines including ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]''.\n\nBratenahl is home to a once controversial luxury high-rise condominium complex named [[Bratenahl Place]]. Though many residents opposed it at the time, in 1967 two large multi-occupancy buildings of [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] architectural design were built on the lakefront. One of the two structures was originally intended to be a 180-unit rental apartment building, while the other, smaller one was a condominium from its inception.
