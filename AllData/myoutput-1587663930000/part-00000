Formerly, the 71st Infantry was a regiment of the New York State Militia and then the Army National Guard from 1850 to 1993. The regiment was not renumbered during the 1918 national reorganization due to being broken up to staff other units from 1917\u20131919,<ref name=Sut1>Sutliffe, pp. 1-4, 34-39</ref> and never received a National Guard number.\n\n==History==\nIn the fall of 1849, the Order of United Americans, related to the [[Know Nothing Party]], held a meeting to organize a \"distinctively American regiment.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1894/04/01/archives/seventyfirsts-new-home-the-regiment-takes-possession-of-its-armory.html \"Seventy-First's New Home\"].

Parker, [[Hamilton Fish|Hamilton W. Fish, Sr]], Hamilton W. Fish, Jr. and William Kellock, had political links to the [[Know-Nothing Party]]. Initially there were six companies recruited. One officer in A Company, Captain Parker, resigned after hearing a \"foreigner\" paraded with the \"American Rifles.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nIn Spring 1852, the American Rifles had eight companies, enough to be enrolled as a regiment of the state militia, and were assigned the regimental number of 71st. Its first commander was Colonel Abraham S. Vosburgh, previously its quartermaster. Vosburgh would remain commanding officer until his death on May 20, 1861. Henry P. Martin, previously adjutant, became lieutenant colonel in 1854. He would remain with the 71st through the first years of the Civil War. Its arsenal was located at Seventh Avenue and 35th Street.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nThe regiment became the \"American Guard\" in 1853 when their Ogden long rifles were replaced with muskets, which could carry bayonets. These, in turn, were replaced with Minie rifles in 1857.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nOn July 4, 1857, the regiment, along with the seventh New York, served as riot control personnel during the riots in the Sixth Ward between the [[Dead Rabbits]] and the Bowery Boys. During this action, Dead Rabbit leader Mickey Free was killed and the regiment captured an 8-lb howitzer from the rioters. The regiment was called into action again during the [[Bayley Seton Hospital#History|quarantine riot]] of September 1858 in Staten Island.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\"/><ref name=\"DNMA\">{{cite web|url=http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/spanAm/infantry/71stInf/71stInfMain.htm|title=71st Regiment Infantry, New York Volunteers during the Spanish\u2013American War \u2013 NY Military Museum and Veterans Research Center|website=dmna.ny.gov}}</ref>\n\nIn 1858, the \"Light Guard,\" New York's oldest military unit, detached from the 55th New York and became A Company.

The 71st militia served in the defense of Harrisburg during the battle of Gettysburg.\n\n====Return to New York====\nAfter the battle, the 71st was recalled to New York City to help suppress the 1863 draft riots (the militia unit that was mobilized to defend Harrisburg, not the volunteer unit that was involved with the actual battle at Gettysburg). The regiment was mustered out of service in 1864. Many members of the 71st joined the 124th New York, which carried on the name \"The American Guard.\" and took part in the Petersburg campaign. Others joined other regiments.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\n===State duty===\nThe 71st also served to control the Orange riots of 1871, the railroad riots of July 1877, the switchmen's strike in Buffalo of August 1892, and the motorman's strike of 1895 in [[Brooklyn]].<ref name=\"DNMA\" />\n\nIn 1884, under accusations of financial mismanagement by Colonel Vose, 15 company-grade officers resigned.

A week of confusion and quartermaster incompetence delayed their shipment to Cuba. The 71st was bivouacked along with the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, the \"Rough Riders\", in Tampa, who then stole a march on the 71st to steal their transport on the ''Tampa.'' The 71st's sea trip took two weeks<ref name=\"DNMA\"/> The confusion of this organization was cited as one of the reasons for the 1903 reforms of the Army and National Guard.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThere were ten companies of the regiment, with 1,000 soldiers, organized into three battalions.\n\nArriving at Siboney, Cuba, on June 23, the 71st was brigaded with two regular regiments, the 6th and 16th Infantry Regiments in the First Brigade under Regular Army Brigadier General [[Hamilton S. Hawkins]], as part of General [[Jacob Ford Kent]]'s division, as part of the Fifth Corps under General Shafter. Although the 71st was regarded as one of the best National Guard regiments, it was equipped with obsolescent black powder rifles, and its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Wallace A. Downs, reported that one-third of his men had never fired a rifle before.<ref name=millis>Millis, Walter. ''The Martial Spirit''. 1931, Ayer Publishing. p. 285.

Colonel Downs, testified at a court of inquiry in 1899 that he had received no orders to advance since 10 a.m. and therefore held his men in reserve. He said the attack by Lawton's brigade on the right had been delayed, and Downs' last orders had been to wait until Lawton's attack was successful before moving forward. Colonel Reade<ref name=\"times1900\"/>  testified that he had to \"shove\" the 71st into the fight, though Company F commander Captain Malcolm Rafferty and 3rd Battalion commander Major Frank Keck responded immediately.

Smith, noting he was present on the battlefield.<ref name=\"times1899\"/> However, Colonel Downs and Major John Whittle resigned their commissions. Two more officers were reprimanded. The board was reviewed by then Governor [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who noted \"the greater part of the Seventy-First of their own free will took part in the storming of San Juan hill, and showed that no matter how cowardly their officers might be, they were willing to obey their country's call.\"<ref>Harrison, W.B.

Formerly, the 71st Infantry was a regiment of the New York State Militia and then the Army National Guard from 1850 to 1993. The regiment was not renumbered during the 1918 national reorganization due to being broken up to staff other units from 1917\u20131919,<ref name=Sut1>Sutliffe, pp. 1-4, 34-39</ref> and never received a National Guard number.\n\n==History==\nIn the fall of 1849, the Order of United Americans, related to the [[Know Nothing Party]], held a meeting to organize a \"distinctively American regiment.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1894/04/01/archives/seventyfirsts-new-home-the-regiment-takes-possession-of-its-armory.html \"Seventy-First's New Home\"].

Parker, [[Hamilton Fish|Hamilton W. Fish, Sr]], Hamilton W. Fish, Jr. and William Kellock, had political links to the [[Know-Nothing Party]]. Initially there were six companies recruited. One officer in A Company, Captain Parker, resigned after hearing a \"foreigner\" paraded with the \"American Rifles.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nIn Spring 1852, the American Rifles had eight companies, enough to be enrolled as a regiment of the state militia, and were assigned the regimental number of 71st. Its first commander was Colonel Abraham S. Vosburgh, previously its quartermaster. Vosburgh would remain commanding officer until his death on May 20, 1861. Henry P. Martin, previously adjutant, became lieutenant colonel in 1854. He would remain with the 71st through the first years of the Civil War. Its arsenal was located at Seventh Avenue and 35th Street.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nThe regiment became the \"American Guard\" in 1853 when their Ogden long rifles were replaced with muskets, which could carry bayonets. These, in turn, were replaced with Minie rifles in 1857.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nOn July 4, 1857, the regiment, along with the seventh New York, served as riot control personnel during the riots in the Sixth Ward between the [[Dead Rabbits]] and the Bowery Boys. During this action, Dead Rabbit leader Mickey Free was killed and the regiment captured an 8-lb howitzer from the rioters.

The regiment was mustered out of service in 1864. Many members of the 71st joined the 124th New York, which carried on the name \"The American Guard.\" and took part in the Petersburg campaign.

Hawkins]], as part of General [[Jacob Ford Kent]]'s division, as part of the Fifth Corps under General Shafter. Although the 71st was regarded as one of the best National Guard regiments, it was equipped with obsolescent black powder rifles, and its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Wallace A.

MacGillivary]] of the 71st received the [[Medal of Honor]] for actions during the German Ardennes offensive of December 1944 near Woelfling, France, near the German border. On January 1, 1944, Sergeant MacGillivary was serving as company commander because of casualties among the officers. Ammunition was low and the company was pinned down. MacGillivary set out on his own to destroy the German machine guns menacing his company. He carried a sub-machine gun and grenades; when his submachine gun ran out of ammunition, he picked up a discarded weapon and continued the attack. MacGillivary wiped out the German positions and killed or wounded all of the defenders, at the cost of his left arm.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/30/us/c-a-macgillivary-83-dies-won-medal-of-honor.html |work=The New York Times |first=Richard |last=Goldstein |title=C.

It later moved to 125 West 14th Street.\n\nIn 1984, the Governor of New York, [[Mario Cuomo]], proposed disbanding the 71st and 106th Infantry to use their armory spaces for civilian purposes. The 71st Infantry Veterans' Association sued the state in court, stating that such realignment would violate state affirmative action guidelines since the 71st Infantry was predominantly black. The 71st received a favorable ruling.<ref>\"Court Order Rescues Historic Guard Unit,\" ''New York Times'', February 2, 1984</ref>\n\nOn August 31, 1993, the 71st disbanded as a National Guard unit.<ref name=\"veteran\"/> A detachment of the battalion in Batavia, New York, was kept on active duty.<ref>\"136 Guardsmen to stay active despite units' status\", ''Buffalo News'', February 12, 1993</ref> The First Battalion became a [[State Guard]] unit, serving with the 14th Infantry Brigade.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/09/AR2006080900262_pf.html |accessdate=January 14, 2008|title=U.S. Forces Repel Raid on Afghan Base |last=Garwood|first=Paul |publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n==Symbols and traditions==\nThe regimental nickname is \"The American Guard.\" The regimental motto is \"Pro aris et pro focis,\" which can be translated \"For our homes and our families\" but see '[[Pro aris et focis]]'.
