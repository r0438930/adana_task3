From the 11th century onward the Genoese navy protected the interests of the republic and projected its power throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The navy declined in power after the 16th century, periodically coming under the control of foreign powers, and was finally disbanded following the annexation of Genoa by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont]] in 1815.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Genova 1481 (copy 1597).jpg|thumb|The Genoese fleet returning to port after a successful expedition against the Ottoman Turks. Depicted in the 1597 painting ''[[View of Genoa]]''.]]\n=== Establishment ===\nA center of trade since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], the city of [[Genoa]] relied heavily on income from [[merchant shipping]] and [[trade]]. As such, piracy posed a substantial threat to the city's merchants, who were forced to pay for the defense of their ships. The city was likewise vulnerable to attack, a fact made apparent when in 935 a fleet led by [[Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi]] of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] [[Fatimid sack of Genoa|sacked the city]].<ref>Lev, Yaacov (1984). \"The Fatimid Navy, Byzantium and the Mediterranean Sea, 909\u20131036 CE/297\u2013427 AH\".

[[OCLC]] [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1188035 1188035]. pg. 232</ref> The Muslim incursion spurred the city to build strong harbor defenses, and renewed interest in an armed merchant marine to patrol the [[Ligurian Sea]]. In 1005 the Republic of Genoa was established; The new government was headed by a [[consul]] who would be elected every few years by the wealthiest merchants and landowners in the city. The young republic was as such dominated by the needs and desires of the merchant houses, and the navy was given a place of high importance in the new [[Thalassocracy]]. A High Admiral was appointed, and with the government coordinating the navy, Genoese traders and merchants came to dominate the Ligurian Sea in the 11th century. The city-state was considered one of the four ''[[Repubbliche Marinare]]'' in [[Italy]] alongside [[Venice]], [[Pisa]], and [[Amalfi]]. However, the early fleet was composed of ships levied from private merchants, fishermen, and lacked dedicated warships. As such, the 11th century fleet was relegated to protecting the trade of the great merchant houses of Genoa, which continued to dominate the politics and economy of the republic. In an effort to suppress piracy, the fleet was occasionally deployed to fight against [[Muslim]] corsairs from [[Aghlabid]] in [[North Africa]].<ref>[[H. E. J.

As new crusaders were constantly needed to secure the [[Holy Land]] (and later to reinforce the [[Crusader states]]), Genoa was able to profit by assisting in the transport of military forces from Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Crusades#CITEREFHousley2006|Housley 2006]], pp. 152\u2013154</ref><ref name=\":14\" /> To better support the crusaders, a squadron of 12 Genoese galleys were deployed to the Holy Land during the [[First Crusade]]. The ships served to counter the threat posed by the [[Fatimid navy]] and saw some successes, with the fleet succeeding in trapping a Fatimid fleet in [[Beirut|Beirut Harbor]] during the First Crusade. The Genoese [[Embriaco family]] became famous for their exploits in the Holy Land during this time, most notably for their leading of a Genoese [[Marines|seaborne]] attack during the [[Siege of Tripoli]].

In the 1230s a second, undeclared war erupted between Genoa and Pisa as part of the wider [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs-Ghibellines Conflict]]. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] sided with Pisa when the war broke out, forcing Genoa to find allies abroad. The republic sided with the Pope (who was at the time in a dispute with the Holy Roman Emperor), and sent a fleet to transport a Guelph army to Rome in a show of support for the papal cause. The Ghibellines discovered the plan and, along with a Pisan fleet, intercepted the Genoese navy at the [[Battle of Giglio (1241)|Battle of Giglio]] in 1241.

In 1266 Genoese merchants purchased the city of Kaffa from the [[Golden Horde]] and went on to establish further trading colonies in the Black Sea and [[Byzantine Empire]]. This expansion brought Genoa into further conflict with the powerful city-state of Venice, which also had trade relations in the area.<ref name=\":1\" /> The bitter rivalry escalated into the first of the [[Venetian\u2013Genoese wars]] in 1296, at which point Genoa's fleet consisted of 125 galleys. Despite outnumbering the [[Venetian navy]], the Genoese fleet was unable to catch them, and Genoa's merchants suffered greatly during the war. A change came in 1298 when a major engagement was fought in the [[Adriatic Sea]] off the coast of [[Kor\u010dula]]. At the [[Battle of Curzola]], a fleet of 75 Genoese galleys decisively defeated a force of 95 Venetian galleys, destroying or capturing 83 of the enemy ships. However, Genoese casualties were heavy and the city's shipyards were unable to quickly replace the ships lost at Curzola. The conflict ended in a relative stalemate in 1299. Following the war, Genoa dominated the Mediterranean [[Slave Trade|slave trade]] and the Genoese navy employed thousands of [[galley slave]]s as oarsmen. This new policy decreased the cost of maintaining the navy, as rowers no longer had to be paid (as opposed to Venice, which only employed paid rowers), but also decreased the number of men available for boarding parties, as Genoese captains did not trust armed slaves.<ref name=\":7\">William Ledyard Rodgers (1967).

While these naval trade routes greatly benefited the city, they also left it vulnerable to disease.

Venice allied itself with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and the Byzantine Empire, and in doing so mustered a large force that outnumbered the Genoese navy. Genoa won a costly victory at a battle in the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus Straits]] in February 1352 that forced Byzantium to withdraw from the war. The tide of the war reversed when in 1353 the Genoese navy suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of Alghero]].

During the war, a large percentage of the navy was relegated to escorting transport ships from Genoa to Crimea. The Venetians took advantage of the absence of Genoese warships and raided coastal settlements under Genoese control. The Genoese navy suffered a defeat in 1378 when a squadron was destroyed by the Venetians off of the [[Cape d'Anzio]]. Genoa won a victory in May 1379, after which the fleet sailed to the port of [[Chioggia]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and captured the city. The Genoese intended to use their new position at Chioggia to blockade the city of Venice, but on June 24, 1380 the navy was defeated and driven from the city by a Venetian relief force. 17 Genoese warships were captured in the ensuing rout, and the Genoese army was left stranded in Chioggia without supplies.<ref name=\":2\">Sanderson, Michael W.

The rise of larger nation states also sapped the ability of the relatively small city-state to compete militarily. Genoa (with French support) launched a [[Barbary Crusade|crusade]] against Tunisia in 1390, with the intent to protect Genoese trade colonies from Muslim pirates. During the war the Genoese navy provided ships while French knights laid siege to the fortress of Mahdi. The war was a success for the christian forces, but also resulted in the French gaining political influence in Genoa, which was pressured to declare itself a French fiefdom in 1396. The Genoese navy was brought under French control, and on 7 October 1403 was decisively defeated by Venice at the [[Battle of Modon (1403)|Battle of Modon]] after the Genoese fleet raided Venetian trade colonies.

Doria was born in Genoa and served as a mercenary for various nations during his early life. He returned from service as a mercenary captain in 1503 to encourage Genoa to resist French encroachment, but failed and was forced to flee the city. From 1503 to 1522 Doria commanded a Genoese squadron in the Mediterranean against the Ottomans and the [[Barbary states]]. He fought against the Holy Roman Empire on behalf of France in 1522 before leading the Genoese fleet into Genoa and expelling the French in 1528. Doria then came into the service of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire and was granted the office of [[Imperial Admiral]]. Doria incorporated the Genoese navy into the Imperial navy and went on to [[Siege of Coron|defend]] the fortress of [[Koroni]] from the Ottomans and capture the city of [[Patras]]. A major victory over the Ottomans in the [[Battle of Girolata]] by the Genoese navy resulted in the capture of 11 galleys and Admiral [[Dragut]]. After retiring from military service, Doria worked to establish the Republic of Genoa as an autonomous state within the Holy Roman Empire, and in doing so gained the protection of the Emperor's army in return for providing the naval expertise of the Genoese. The Genoese economy began to shift from trade to banking and manufacturing as [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] established their overseas empires, and Doria advocated that the Genoese navy should shift its doctrine from competition with other Christian nations to that of cooperation with other europeans against [[Barbary pirates|Muslim piracy]]. He was also a strong proponent of using [[naval artillery]], and as such equipped many of the navy's vessels with cannon.<ref name=\":9\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

The Imperial fleet was decisively defeated by the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Preveza]] in 1538, a Genoese fleet was damaged by a series of storms during the 1541 [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]], a Genoese-Spanish fleet was defeated at [[Battle of Ponza (1552)|Ponza]] in 1552, and the navy failed to stop a French force from capturing Corsica in 1553.

In 1798 the Ligurian fleet dispatched some of its ships to aid [[Military career of Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|campaign in Egypt and Syria]]; this ended in disaster when the French fleet was scattered or destroyed at the [[Battle of the Nile]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nIn 1804, newly-crowned Emperor Napoleon sought to appropriate the remnants of the Genoese navy and Genoa's shipyards for use against Great Britain, and so the city agreed to begin constructing 10 [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] (one of which, the ''[[French ship Brillant (1815)|Brillant]]'', would be captured while under construction and commissioned into the Royal Navy) and 10 frigates for the [[French Navy]].

These ships were used in major battles and to defend the harbor of Genoa itself. The private fleet was much larger than the public fleet, and was made up from ships belonging to the various merchant families that dominated Genoese politics. Both fleets were under the command of the office of the High Admiral, who was appointed by the ruler (either the doge, council, or duke depending on the era) of Genoa.<ref name=\":12\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

These ships possessed an advantage in terms of maneuverability when compared to purely sailing vessels, and their design allowed them to be produced relatively quickly. Genoese galleys were lighter and longer (45 meters long as opposed to the Mediterranean standard of 40-42 meters) than contemporary Venetian and Ottoman galleys, though this speed came at the cost of durability and maneuverability.<ref name=\":5\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \"Genoese galleys\"</ref> Genoese galleys were also noted to have larger holds than the galleys of other naval powers; this extra space allowed Genoese galleys to carry more provisions, cargo, or soldiers. Genoa fielded two types of galleys; smaller and faster ones that were used to protect trade in times of peace, and heavier dromon-style galleys built for battle and garrison duty. The lighter galleys (many of which were classified as [[Galiot|galiots]]) were more numerous, while the heavy galleys were usually only put to sea (or constructed, if the fleet was undersized) during times of war.<ref name=\":6\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

The republic also crewed many of its galleys with criminals, prisoners of war, and slaves.<ref name=\":8\" /> Conditions for sailors (both free and enslaved) were challenging, with disease being a constant issue. The navy encouraged captains to keep their crew alive by issuing heavy fines to those who lost too many men. The republic mandated that every galley in service be crewed with a [[barber]] - who also served as a [[surgeon]] - in order to maintain a standard of hygiene aboard the ship.<ref>Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

From the 11th century onward the Genoese navy protected the interests of the republic and projected its power throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The navy declined in power after the 16th century, periodically coming under the control of foreign powers, and was finally disbanded following the annexation of Genoa by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont]] in 1815.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Genova 1481 (copy 1597).jpg|thumb|The Genoese fleet returning to port after a successful expedition against the Ottoman Turks. Depicted in the 1597 painting ''[[View of Genoa]]''.]]\n=== Establishment ===\nA center of trade since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], the city of [[Genoa]] relied heavily on income from [[merchant shipping]] and [[trade]]. As such, piracy posed a substantial threat to the city's merchants, who were forced to pay for the defense of their ships. The city was likewise vulnerable to attack, a fact made apparent when in 935 a fleet led by [[Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi]] of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] [[Fatimid sack of Genoa|sacked the city]].<ref>Lev, Yaacov (1984). \"The Fatimid Navy, Byzantium and the Mediterranean Sea, 909\u20131036 CE/297\u2013427 AH\".

[[OCLC]] [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1188035 1188035]. pg. 232</ref> The Muslim incursion spurred the city to build strong harbor defenses, and renewed interest in an armed merchant marine to patrol the [[Ligurian Sea]]. In 1005 the Republic of Genoa was established; The new government was headed by a [[consul]] who would be elected every few years by the wealthiest merchants and landowners in the city. The young republic was as such dominated by the needs and desires of the merchant houses, and the navy was given a place of high importance in the new [[Thalassocracy]]. A High Admiral was appointed, and with the government coordinating the navy, Genoese traders and merchants came to dominate the Ligurian Sea in the 11th century. The city-state was considered one of the four ''[[Repubbliche Marinare]]'' in [[Italy]] alongside [[Venice]], [[Pisa]], and [[Amalfi]]. However, the early fleet was composed of ships levied from private merchants, fishermen, and lacked dedicated warships. As such, the 11th century fleet was relegated to protecting the trade of the great merchant houses of Genoa, which continued to dominate the politics and economy of the republic. In an effort to suppress piracy, the fleet was occasionally deployed to fight against [[Muslim]] corsairs from [[Aghlabid]] in [[North Africa]].<ref>[[H. E. J.

As new crusaders were constantly needed to secure the [[Holy Land]] (and later to reinforce the [[Crusader states]]), Genoa was able to profit by assisting in the transport of military forces from Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Crusades#CITEREFHousley2006|Housley 2006]], pp. 152\u2013154</ref><ref name=\":14\" /> To better support the crusaders, a squadron of 12 Genoese galleys were deployed to the Holy Land during the [[First Crusade]]. The ships served to counter the threat posed by the [[Fatimid navy]] and saw some successes, with the fleet succeeding in trapping a Fatimid fleet in [[Beirut|Beirut Harbor]] during the First Crusade. The Genoese [[Embriaco family]] became famous for their exploits in the Holy Land during this time, most notably for their leading of a Genoese [[Marines|seaborne]] attack during the [[Siege of Tripoli]].

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] sided with Pisa when the war broke out, forcing Genoa to find allies abroad. The republic sided with the Pope (who was at the time in a dispute with the Holy Roman Emperor), and sent a fleet to transport a Guelph army to Rome in a show of support for the papal cause.

In 1266 Genoese merchants purchased the city of Kaffa from the [[Golden Horde]] and went on to establish further trading colonies in the Black Sea and [[Byzantine Empire]]. This expansion brought Genoa into further conflict with the powerful city-state of Venice, which also had trade relations in the area.<ref name=\":1\" /> The bitter rivalry escalated into the first of the [[Venetian\u2013Genoese wars]] in 1296, at which point Genoa's fleet consisted of 125 galleys. Despite outnumbering the [[Venetian navy]], the Genoese fleet was unable to catch them, and Genoa's merchants suffered greatly during the war. A change came in 1298 when a major engagement was fought in the [[Adriatic Sea]] off the coast of [[Kor\u010dula]]. At the [[Battle of Curzola]], a fleet of 75 Genoese galleys decisively defeated a force of 95 Venetian galleys, destroying or capturing 83 of the enemy ships. However, Genoese casualties were heavy and the city's shipyards were unable to quickly replace the ships lost at Curzola. The conflict ended in a relative stalemate in 1299. Following the war, Genoa dominated the Mediterranean [[Slave Trade|slave trade]] and the Genoese navy employed thousands of [[galley slave]]s as oarsmen. This new policy decreased the cost of maintaining the navy, as rowers no longer had to be paid (as opposed to Venice, which only employed paid rowers), but also decreased the number of men available for boarding parties, as Genoese captains did not trust armed slaves.<ref name=\":7\">William Ledyard Rodgers (1967).

The loss of a fleet at Alghero sparked civil unrest in Genoa, further hampering the Republic's war effort.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qAZ4I-8tQIsC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=Alghero+Genoese+defeat#v=onepage|title=Great Power Rivalries|last=Thompson|first=William R.|date=1999|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=9781570032790|language=en}}</ref> To combat this discord, the republic was temporarily dissolved and Genoa came under the rule of the [[Duke of Milan]]. In November 1354 a Genoese fleet commanded by Admiral [[Paganino Doria]] surprised a Venetian fleet off the coast of [[Pylos]]. At the ensuing [[Battle of Sapienza]] Genoa sank or captured 35 Venetian galleys. A peace treaty was signed between Venice and Milan in 1355, bringing an end to the conflict. While the status quo in the east was maintained, the Kingdom of Aragon was able to establish itself as a major rival to Genoese domination of the Western Mediterranean.<ref name=\":2\" /> Genoa broke free from Milanese control following the conclusion of the war, and the republic was reestablished.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dXteCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT78&lpg=PT78&dq=war+galley+Genoa+museum#v=onepage|title=Genoa, 'La Superba': The Rise and Fall of a Merchant Pirate Superpower|last=Walton|first=Nicholas|date=2015-01-09|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849046145|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1378 the [[War of Chioggia]] broke out between Genoa and Venice, a conflict Genoa initiated to counter Venetian threats to the Republic's trade routes in the Black Sea. During the war, a large percentage of the navy was relegated to escorting transport ships from Genoa to Crimea. The Venetians took advantage of the absence of Genoese warships and raided coastal settlements under Genoese control. The Genoese navy suffered a defeat in 1378 when a squadron was destroyed by the Venetians off of the [[Cape d'Anzio]]. Genoa won a victory in May 1379, after which the fleet sailed to the port of [[Chioggia]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and captured the city. The Genoese intended to use their new position at Chioggia to blockade the city of Venice, but on June 24, 1380 the navy was defeated and driven from the city by a Venetian relief force. 17 Genoese warships were captured in the ensuing rout, and the Genoese army was left stranded in Chioggia without supplies.<ref name=\":2\">Sanderson, Michael W.

The Genoese navy lost vital sailors, ships, and was supplanted as the leading naval power in the Western Mediterranean by Aragon.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Decline ===\nThe costly wars against Venice and the devastating impact of the Black Death greatly reduced the Genoese navy's strength. The rise of larger nation states also sapped the ability of the relatively small city-state to compete militarily. Genoa (with French support) launched a [[Barbary Crusade|crusade]] against Tunisia in 1390, with the intent to protect Genoese trade colonies from Muslim pirates. During the war the Genoese navy provided ships while French knights laid siege to the fortress of Mahdi. The war was a success for the christian forces, but also resulted in the French gaining political influence in Genoa, which was pressured to declare itself a French fiefdom in 1396. The Genoese navy was brought under French control, and on 7 October 1403 was decisively defeated by Venice at the [[Battle of Modon (1403)|Battle of Modon]] after the Genoese fleet raided Venetian trade colonies. The Republic gained independence from France in 1409, but the prestige of the military had been severely damaged and the city remained a coveted political conquest for both France and Aragon.<ref name=\":3\">von Meerheimb, Richard (1865).

At the time, the Duke of Milan and the King of Aragon were fighting as to who would control the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. The Genoese fleet arrived at Gaeta and defeated the numerically superior Aragonese fleet at the [[Battle of Ponza (1435)|Battle of Ponza]]. The Aragonese flagship was forced to surrender and [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King Alfonso V of Aragon]] was captured. Despite this setback, Aragon prevailed in the conflict and Sicily came under Aragonese control, making passage through the [[Strait of Messina]] difficult and further disrupting Genoese naval activities.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>Simonde de Sismondi, Jean-Charles-L\u00e9onard (1832).

The gradual loss of Imperial territory, coupled with the destruction of smaller Christian states such as [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Amasra]] chipped away at Genoese mercantile interests in the Black Sea.

Doria was born in Genoa and served as a mercenary for various nations during his early life. He returned from service as a mercenary captain in 1503 to encourage Genoa to resist French encroachment, but failed and was forced to flee the city. From 1503 to 1522 Doria commanded a Genoese squadron in the Mediterranean against the Ottomans and the [[Barbary states]]. He fought against the Holy Roman Empire on behalf of France in 1522 before leading the Genoese fleet into Genoa and expelling the French in 1528. Doria then came into the service of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire and was granted the office of [[Imperial Admiral]]. Doria incorporated the Genoese navy into the Imperial navy and went on to [[Siege of Coron|defend]] the fortress of [[Koroni]] from the Ottomans and capture the city of [[Patras]]. A major victory over the Ottomans in the [[Battle of Girolata]] by the Genoese navy resulted in the capture of 11 galleys and Admiral [[Dragut]]. After retiring from military service, Doria worked to establish the Republic of Genoa as an autonomous state within the Holy Roman Empire, and in doing so gained the protection of the Emperor's army in return for providing the naval expertise of the Genoese. The Genoese economy began to shift from trade to banking and manufacturing as [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] established their overseas empires, and Doria advocated that the Genoese navy should shift its doctrine from competition with other Christian nations to that of cooperation with other europeans against [[Barbary pirates|Muslim piracy]]. He was also a strong proponent of using [[naval artillery]], and as such equipped many of the navy's vessels with cannon.<ref name=\":9\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \"Firearms\"</ref>\n\nThe revival period ended in the mid-16th century due to a series of military failures. The Imperial fleet was decisively defeated by the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Preveza]] in 1538, a Genoese fleet was damaged by a series of storms during the 1541 [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]], a Genoese-Spanish fleet was defeated at [[Battle of Ponza (1552)|Ponza]] in 1552, and the navy failed to stop a French force from capturing Corsica in 1553. Genoa sent a contingent of her fleet to a christian alliance that was defeated by the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Djerba]] in 1560.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, in 1571 the Genoese navy contributed 29 galleys (53 ships in total) to the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] fleet at the pivotal [[Battle of Lepanto]], during which the Genoese admiral [[Giovanni Andrea Doria]] smashed the right flank of the Ottoman fleet. The decisive Christian victory ended Ottoman domination of the Mediterranean.<ref>{{ISBN|1861899467}}, p. 70</ref>\n\n1556 saw the republic create the ''Magistrato delle galee'' (magistrate of the galleys) to combat small-scale piracy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/IT-GE0429/type/fa/id/IT-ASGE-F90110376|title=Archivio di Stato di Genova > Magistrato delle galee (IT-GE0429 - IT-ASGE-F90110376) - Archives Portal Europe|website=www.archivesportaleurope.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dati.san.beniculturali.it/SAN/produttore_GGASI_san.cat.sogP.18376|title=Magistrato delle galee|website=dati.san.beniculturali.it|access-date=2017-06-18}}</ref> During the 15th century competition between Genoa, Venice, Spain, and [[Portugal]] resulted in the creation of the [[Carrack]].<ref name=\":14\" /> Genoa built a number of carracks during the 16th century and incorporated them into the navy.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33098?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Ancient and Modern Ships, Part 1: Wooden Sailing Ships|first=George Charles Vincent|last=Holmes|date=July 6, 2010|via=Project Gutenberg}}</ref><ref name=\":10\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

The lands that had formerly been under the control of the city of Genoa were reconstituted into the [[Ligurian Republic]], a French [[Sister republic|client state]]. However, the Genoese navy remained intact. In 1798 the Ligurian fleet dispatched some of its ships to aid [[Military career of Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|campaign in Egypt and Syria]]; this ended in disaster when the French fleet was scattered or destroyed at the [[Battle of the Nile]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nIn 1804, newly-crowned Emperor Napoleon sought to appropriate the remnants of the Genoese navy and Genoa's shipyards for use against Great Britain, and so the city agreed to begin constructing 10 [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] (one of which, the ''[[French ship Brillant (1815)|Brillant]]'', would be captured while under construction and commissioned into the Royal Navy) and 10 frigates for the [[French Navy]].

These ships were used in major battles and to defend the harbor of Genoa itself. The private fleet was much larger than the public fleet, and was made up from ships belonging to the various merchant families that dominated Genoese politics. Both fleets were under the command of the office of the High Admiral, who was appointed by the ruler (either the doge, council, or duke depending on the era) of Genoa.<ref name=\":12\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

These ships possessed an advantage in terms of maneuverability when compared to purely sailing vessels, and their design allowed them to be produced relatively quickly. Genoese galleys were lighter and longer (45 meters long as opposed to the Mediterranean standard of 40-42 meters) than contemporary Venetian and Ottoman galleys, though this speed came at the cost of durability and maneuverability.<ref name=\":5\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \"Genoese galleys\"</ref> Genoese galleys were also noted to have larger holds than the galleys of other naval powers; this extra space allowed Genoese galleys to carry more provisions, cargo, or soldiers. Genoa fielded two types of galleys; smaller and faster ones that were used to protect trade in times of peace, and heavier dromon-style galleys built for battle and garrison duty. The lighter galleys (many of which were classified as [[Galiot|galiots]]) were more numerous, while the heavy galleys were usually only put to sea (or constructed, if the fleet was undersized) during times of war.<ref name=\":6\">Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

Informational panel titled \"Long ships, round ships\"</ref> In addition to galleys and light sailing ships, Genoa refitted merchant ships for combat roles during wartime.
