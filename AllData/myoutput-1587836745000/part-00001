{"title_page": "Smith criterion", "text_new": "The '''Smith criterion''' (sometimes '''generalized Condorcet criterion''', but this can have other meanings) is a [[voting system criteria|voting systems criterion]] defined such that it's satisfied when a [[voting system]] always elects a candidate that is in the [[Smith set]], which is the smallest non-empty subset of the candidates such that every candidate in the subset is majority-preferred over every candidate not in the subset.

Benjamin Ward{{ref|Ward}} was probably the first to write about this set, which he called the \"majority set\".\n\nThe Smith set can be calculated with the [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm]] in time '''[[big O notation|\u0398]]'''(''n''<sup>3</sup>) or [[Kosaraju's algorithm]] in time '''\u0398'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nWhen there is a [[Condorcet criterion|Condorcet winner]]\u2014a candidate that is majority-preferred over all other candidates\u2014the Smith set consists of only that candidate. Here is an example in which there is no Condorcet winner:\nThere are four candidates: A, B, C and D.\n40% of the voters rank D>A>B>C.\n35% of the voters rank B>C>A>D.\n25% of the voters rank C>A>B>D.\nThe Smith set is {A,B,C}. All three candidates in the Smith set are majority-preferred over D (since 60% rank each of them over D). The Smith set is not {A,B,C,D} because the definition calls for the ''smallest'' subset that meets the other conditions. The Smith set is not {B,C} because B is not majority-preferred over A; 65% rank A over B. (Etc.)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! pro\\con !! A !! B !! C !! D\n|-\n!

In the example above, the three candidates in the Smith set are in a \"rock/paper/scissors\" ''majority cycle'': A is ranked over B by a 65% majority, B is ranked over C by a 75% majority, and C is ranked over A by a 60% majority. The term top cycle may be somewhat misleading, however, since the Smith set can contain candidates that do not cycle. For examples, when there is a Condorcet winner it doesn't cycle with any alternatives, and when the Smith set consists only of two alternatives that tie pairwise, the two do not cycle with any alternatives.\n\n==Other criteria==\n\nAny election method that complies with the Smith criterion also complies with the [[Condorcet criterion]], since if there is a Condorcet winner, then it is the only candidate in the Smith set. Obviously, this means that failing the Condorcet criterion automatically implies the non-compliance with the Smith criterion as well.  Additionally, such sets comply with the [[Condorcet loser criterion]]. This is notable, because even some Condorcet methods do not (Minimax).  It also implies the [[mutual majority criterion]], since the Smith set is a subset of the MMC set.\n\nThe Smith set and [[Schwartz set]] are sometimes confused in the literature. Miller (1977, p.&nbsp;775) lists GOCHA as an alternate name for the Smith set, but it actually refers to the Schwartz set.  The Schwartz set is actually a subset of the Smith set (and equal to it if there are no pairwise ties between members of the Smith set).\n\n==Complying methods==\n\nThe Smith criterion is satisfied by [[Ranked Pairs]], [[Schulze method|Schulze's method]], [[Nanson's method]], the Robert's Rules method for voting on motions & amendments, and several other methods.\n\nMethods failing the Condorcet criterion also fail the Smith criterion. Some Condorcet methods, such as [[Minimax Condorcet|Minimax]], also fail the Smith criterion.\n\nVoting methods that fail the Smith criterion can be modified to satisfy it (typically at the expense of other criteria). One approach is to apply the voting method to the Smith set only. (In other words, begin by deleting the candidates not in the Smith set from the votes.) For example, the voting method Smith/Minimax is the application of Minimax to the candidates in the Smith set. Another approach is to elect the member of the Smith set that is highest in the voting method's order of finish.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Minimax ===\n:''[[Mutual majority criterion#Minimax]]''\nThe Smith criterion implies the Mutual majority criterion, therefore Minimax's failure to satisfy the Mutual majority criterion is also a failure to satisfy the Smith criterion.
