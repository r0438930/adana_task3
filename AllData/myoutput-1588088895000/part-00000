Due to the community campaign opposing the museum development, [[John Brumby]], then State opposition leader, with the support of the Melbourne City Council, proposed the nomination of the Royal Exhibition Building for world heritage listing. The world heritage nomination did not progress until the election of the Victorian State Labor Party as the new government in 1999.\n\nOn 1 July 2004, the Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens was granted listing as a [[World Heritage Site]], the first building in Australia to be granted this status.
