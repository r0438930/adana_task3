In the past, the city was also among Russia's principal production sites for chemical weapons. Owing to its strategic significance, this city was, until recently, [[closed city|officially closed]] to foreign visitors.\n\nManufacture of various chemical weapons started in 1941, particularly concentrating on the production of [[lewisite]]\u2014the poisonous effects of which are owed to its arsenic trioxide content\u2014and [[yperite]] ([[mustard gas]]). The factory producing these substances was called the ''Kaprolactam'' (or ''Caprolaktam'') Organic Glass Factory, and in addition to its [[arsenic]]-based weapons, also produced [[prussic acid]] and [[phosgene]].\n\nChemical weapons production at Dzerzhinsk ceased in 1965. Some materials were transferred to storage units, while large amounts of waste material\u2014frequently containing high concentrations of [[arsenic]]\u2014were buried in dumps on the site of the factory. Full dismantling of the yperite facility was commenced in 1994. As of 1998, the lewisite production unit was still not completely disassembled.\n\n{{As of|2008}}, Dzerzhinsk had 38 large industrial enterprises, which export their goods worldwide. About one thousand varieties of chemical products are produced in Dzerzhinsk. The largest factories, which exist {{As of|2012|lc=y}} or existed in the past, include:\n*''[[Yakov Sverdlov|Sverdlov]] Plant, FSE (Federal State Enterprise)'' manufactures munitions, battle and industrial explosives, and chemicals for industrial purposes (phenol-formaldehyde resin, [[epoxy resin]], carbamide-furane resin, plasticizers, hardeners of various modifications, [[nitrobenzene]], sulphanole, [[acetic anhydride]], various cleaners and detergents, as well as other products). The plant is included in the presidential list of the country's strategic enterprises.

In the past, the city was also among Russia's principal production sites for chemical weapons. Owing to its strategic significance, this city was, until recently, [[closed city|officially closed]] to foreign visitors.\n\nManufacture of various chemical weapons started in 1941, particularly concentrating on the production of [[lewisite]]\u2014the poisonous effects of which are owed to its arsenic trioxide content\u2014and [[yperite]] ([[mustard gas]]). The factory producing these substances was called the ''Kaprolactam'' (or ''Caprolaktam'') Organic Glass Factory, and in addition to its [[arsenic]]-based weapons, also produced [[prussic acid]] and [[phosgene]].\n\nChemical weapons production at Dzerzhinsk ceased in 1965. Some materials were transferred to storage units, while large amounts of waste material\u2014frequently containing high concentrations of [[arsenic]]\u2014were buried in dumps on the site of the factory. Full dismantling of the yperite facility was commenced in 1994. As of 1998, the lewisite production unit was still not completely disassembled.\n\n{{As of|2008}}, Dzerzhinsk had 38 large industrial enterprises, which export their goods worldwide. About one thousand varieties of chemical products are produced in Dzerzhinsk. The largest factories, which exist {{As of|2012|lc=y}} or existed in the past, include:\n*''[[Yakov Sverdlov|Sverdlov]] Plant, FSE (Federal State Enterprise)'' manufactures munitions, battle and industrial explosives, and chemicals for industrial purposes (phenol-formaldehyde resin, [[epoxy resin]], carbamide-furane resin, plasticizers, hardeners of various modifications, [[nitrobenzene]], sulphanole, [[acetic anhydride]], various cleaners and detergents, as well as other products). The plant is included in the presidential list of the country's strategic enterprises.
