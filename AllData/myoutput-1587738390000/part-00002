With this season, the show moved from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[4Kids TV]] lineup to the CW. The season began with the episode \"Tempus Fugit\"  which aired on September 13, 2008. It is followed by the TV special [[Turtles Forever]].\n\n==Story==\nCody Jones is able to finally repair the Time Window, but parts with the Turtles and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] can return to 2006. However, Viral, who had survived her defeat in the previous season, hacks into the time window, taking control of it and sending the Turtles, Splinter and Serling (who accidentally fell in) to various eras in attempts to kill them. Just as the group is able to return home, Viral attacks Splinter, shattering him into countless bytes of data scattered across the Internet. Serling and the Turtles resolve to recover Splinter's bytes and return him to his whole self by digitizing themselves and entering cyberspace to find them.\n\nViral is forcibly assimilated into a digital copy of Ch'rell, who had done so prior to his attempted departure from Earth in the 3rd season finale. This forms a new incarnation of [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]] known as the \"Cyber Shredder\", who employs a new [[Foot Clan]] with Khan as his first lieutenant. Shredder makes several attempts to escape from cyber space and enter the real world, often harassing the Turtles during their attempts to locate Splinter's data.\n\nIn the season's finale, Splinter is recompiled and returned to his sons, who decide to celebrate [[April O'Neil|April]] and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey]]'s wedding. Dozens of the Turtles' allies and friends attend the ceremony, which is violently attacked by the Foot Clan, led by the Shredder, who has finally entered the physical world. In the midst of a massive battle between the Turtles' allies and the Foot, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] is able to destroy the Shredder. The wedding finally ends, in front of the Turtles, Splinter, and many other allies (including some who watch from afar; such as Agent Bishop, Cody, etc.).\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]]: Donnie's second-in-command and the former leader of the Turtles who helped his brothers to find Splinter's data bits after Viral blasted him apart into Cyberspace.

The turtles meet an enemy who claims to have killed them, but manage to have Serling open a new portal in time to send them home by using the decompilier on Viral once again. However, Viral manages to muster enough control over Serling to make him fire the decompilier at [[Master Splinter|Splinter]], scattering him into data-bits while in the time stream. Upon returning to the present, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donnie]] blames himself for the loss of Splinter.

With this season, the show moved from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[4Kids TV]] lineup to the CW. The season began with the episode \"Tempus Fugit\"  which aired on September 13, 2008. It is followed by the TV special [[Turtles Forever]].\n\n==Story==\nCody Jones is able to finally repair the Time Window, but parts with the Turtles and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] can return to 2006. However, Viral, who had survived her defeat in the previous season, hacks into the time window, taking control of it and sending the Turtles, Splinter and Serling (who accidentally fell in) to various eras in attempts to kill them. Just as the group is able to return home, Viral attacks Splinter, shattering him into countless bytes of data scattered across the Internet. Serling and the Turtles resolve to recover Splinter's bytes and return him to his whole self by digitizing themselves and entering cyberspace to find them.\n\nViral is forcibly assimilated into a digital copy of Ch'rell, who had done so prior to his attempted departure from Earth in the 3rd season finale. This forms a new incarnation of [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]] known as the \"Cyber Shredder\", who employs a new [[Foot Clan]] with Khan as his first lieutenant. Shredder makes several attempts to escape from cyber space and enter the real world, often harassing the Turtles during their attempts to locate Splinter's data.\n\nIn the season's finale, Splinter is recompiled and returned to his sons, who decide to celebrate [[April O'Neil|April]] and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey]]'s wedding. Dozens of the Turtles' allies and friends attend the ceremony, which is violently attacked by the Foot Clan, led by the Shredder, who has finally entered the physical world. In the midst of a massive battle between the Turtles' allies and the Foot, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] is able to destroy the Shredder. The wedding finally ends, in front of the Turtles, Splinter, and many other allies (including some who watch from afar; such as Agent Bishop, Cody, etc.).\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]]: Donnie's second-in-command and the former leader of the Turtles who helped his brothers to find Splinter's data bits after Viral blasted him apart into Cyberspace.
