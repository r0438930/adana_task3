{"title_page": "Tamil literature in the Chola Empire", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}\n\n{{Chola history}}\n'''Chola literature''', written in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], is the literature created during the period of [[Chola]] reign in [[South India]] between the 9th and the 13th centuries CE. The age of the imperial Cholas was the most creative epoch of the history of South India and was the Golden Age of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] culture.\n\nWith the revival of Chola power in the middle of the 9th century, the avenues for the literature and art broadened. For the first time in history, an imperial state encompassed the entire South India bringing with it the safety and security to the people and provided the opportunity for the people to experience cultures beyond their own. Tamil became a language of the people.\n\nThe literature during this period may be classified into religious, secular and political.\n\n==Religious literature==\nDuring the imperial Chola period the ''Prabhanda'' became the dominant form of poetry. The religious canons of [[Shaivism|Saiva]] and [[Vaishnava]] sects were beginning to be systematically collected and categorised. The Cholas built numerous temples, mainly for their favourite god [[Shiva]], and these were celebrated in numerous hymns.\n\nNambi Andar Nambi, who was a contemporary of [[Rajaraja Chola I]], collected and arranged the books on Saivism into eleven books called ''Tirumurais''. One of these include a short poem by [[Gandaraditya]], who was a Chola king during the early tenth century. The hagiology of Saivism was standardised in ''[[Periyapuranam]]'' (also known as ''Tiruttondar Puranam'') by [[Sekkizhar]], who lived during the reign of [[Kulothunga Chola II]] (1133 \u2013 1150 CE). Sekkilar opus became the twelfth book in the Saiva canon.\n\nReligious books on the Vaishnava sect were mostly composed in [[Sanskrit]] during this period. The great Vaishnava leader [[Ramanuja]] lived during this period. Perhaps due to the animosity of the later Cholas towards the Vaishavites, there was no much literary activity in Tamil from this sect.\n\nOne of the best known Tamil works of this period is the ''Ramavatharam'' by [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] who flourished during the reign of Kulottunga III. ''Ramavatharam'' is the greatest epic in Tamil Literature, and although the author states that he followed Valmiki, his work is not a mere translation or even an adaptation of the Sanskrit epic. Kamban imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time. His description of Kosala is an idealised account of the features of the Chola country.\n\nOf the books on the [[Buddhist]] and the [[Jain]] faiths, the most noteworthy is the [[Jivaka-chintamani]] by the Jain ascetic Thirutakkadevar composed in the tenth century. This is the story of Jivaka, who was equally distinguished in war and peace, and tells the story of his youth during which he indulges in excesses and at his prime realises the hollowness of his existence and renounces everything to become a Jain ascetic.\n\n==Secular literature==\nThere were a number of books written on Tamil grammar. ''Yapperungalam'' and ''Yapperungalakkarigai'' were two works on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] by the Jain ascetic Amirtasagara. Buddamitra wrote ''Virasoliyam'',  another work on Tamil grammar, during the reign of [[Virarajendra Chola]]. ''Virasoliyam'' attempts to find synthesis between Sanskrit and Tamil grammar. Other grammatical works of this period are ''Nannul'' by Pavanandi, ''Vaccanandi Malai'' by Neminatha, and the annotations on ''[[Purananuru]]'', ''Purapporun Venbamalai'' by Aiyanaridanar.\n\n==Political literature==\nOf the works of a political nature, we find the poetic works on various Chola kings. Jayamkondar wrote ''Kalingattupparani'', a semi-historical account on the two invasion of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] by [[Kulothunga Chola I]]. Jayamkondar was a poet-laureate in the Chola court and his work is a fine example of the balance between fact and fiction the poets had to tread.  [[Ottakoothar]], a close contemporary of Kambar, wrote three ''Ulas'' on [[Vikrama Chola]], Kulothunga Chola II and [[Rajaraja Chola II]]\n\n== Lost works==\nChola inscription mention the names of some of the literature which are currently not available to us. They were once considered worthy of public recognition, as the authors of these inscriptions assumed the readers would know them by the mere mention of their names. Of these are two works on Rajaraja Chola I, ''Rajararajesvara natakam'' and ''Rajararaja Vijayam''. The former of this was a play and was enacted at the great [[Brihadisvara Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]]. From the context in the inscriptions we learn that this was not a play on the life of the great king, but on the building of the temple.\n\nThere was a book on Kulothunga Chola I called ''Kulothunga Chola Charitai'' by Thirunarayana Bhatta. A certain Kamalalaya Bhatta wrote ''Kannivana Puranam'' and ''Pum Puliyur Natakam'', works of a popular nature. The poet was awarded some tax free gifts for his works.\n\nIt is indeed a tragedy that we are unable to trace these lost works. This is true of most of the extant literature in India, which have been preserved more by chance and accident than by deliberate act of preservation.\n\n== References ==\n* Nilakanta Sastri, K.A.
