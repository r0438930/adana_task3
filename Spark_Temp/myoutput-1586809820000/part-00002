Over time, government housing was built to accommodate much of the new population, like in many other [[development town]]s.\n\nIn 1959, during [[Wadi Salib riots]], the \"''Union des Nords-africains'' led by David Ben Haroush, organised a large-scale procession walking towards the nice suburbs of [[Haifa]] creating little damage but a great fear within the population. This small incident was taken as an occasion to express the social malaise of the different [[Mizrahi Jews in Israel|Oriental communities in Israel]] and riots spread quickly to other parts of the country; mostly in towns with a high percentage of the population having North African origins like in Tiberias, in [[Beer-Sheva]], in [[Migdal HaEmek|Migdal-Haemek]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Allouche|title=The Oriental Communities in Israel 1948-2003|url=http://doczz.fr/doc/96608/the-oriental-communities-in-israel--1948-2003|page= 35}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the city came to rely on tourism, becoming a major Galileean center for Christian pilgrims and internal Israeli tourism. The ancient cemetery of Tiberias and its old synagogues are also drawing religious Jewish pilgrims during religious holidays. PM [[Yitzhak Rabin]] mentioned the town in his memoirs on the occasion of signing the historic peace agreement with Egypt in 1979; and again at the Casablanca Conference in 1994.<ref>M.Gilbert, p.566, 578</ref>\n\nTiberias consists of a small port on the shores of the Galilee lake for both fishing and tourist activities. Since the 1990s, the importance of the port for fishing was gradually decreasing, with the decline of the Tiberias lake level, due to continuing droughts and increased pumping of fresh water from the lake. It is expected that the lake of Tiberias will regain its original level (almost {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=off}} higher than today), with the full operational capacity of Israeli desalination facilities by 2014.\n\nPlans are underway to expand the city with a new neighborhood, Kiryat Sanz, built on a slope on the western side of the Kinneret and catering exclusively to [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/new-ultra-orthodox-neighborhood-to-be-built-in-israel-s-north-1.422255 New ultra-Orthodox neighborhood to be built in Israel's north], Apr. 3, 2012, Haaretz</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS), as of December 2011, 41,700 inhabitants lived in Tiberias.
