In the battle, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Marine Raiders|Raiders]] from the 1st Marine Raider Regiment\u2014supported by two [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] infantry battalions (the 3rd Battalion, [[145th Infantry Regiment (United States)|145th Infantry Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion, [[148th Infantry Regiment (United States)|148th Infantry Regiment]])\u2014under the command of Colonel [[Harry B. Liversedge]],<ref>Miller pp. 127\u2013129</ref> attacked a Japanese garrison guarding the port of [[Bairoko Harbor|Bairoko]] on the Dragons Peninsula on [[New Georgia]]. The battle took place in the wake of the US landing at Rice Anchorage on the northern coast of New Georgia Island on 5 July, and their subsequent [[Battle of Enogai|capture of  Enogai]] on 10\u201311 July.<ref>Miller pp. 99\u2013103</ref> \n\nThe Marine raiders had begun consolidating their position around Enogai from 12 July and began patrolling the local area while US Army troops had occupied blocking position to the south along the Munda\u2013Bairoko trail, to prevent reinforcements being sent south towards Munda, where US troops had begun an [[Drive on Munda Point|advance on Munda Point]], where the Japanese had established an airfield. The blocking position was abandoned on order and the US soldiers returned to Triri on 17 July.<ref>Shaw & Kane pp. 131\u2013133</ref> Liversedge's force had been reinforced by 700 Marines from the 4th Raider Battalion and he subsequently made plans to capture Bairoko village, which lay on the eastern side of Bairoko Harbor, on 20 July.<ref>Morison p. 202</ref> The plan entailed a [[pincer movement]]: while the US Army detachment attacked the the village from the southeast the Marines were to assault from the northeast.<ref name=ShawKane134-135>Shaw & Kane pp. 134\u2013135</ref> \n\nThe Japanese defensive positions around Bairoko were formidable and the garrison had been reinforced since the initial US landing at the Rice Anchorage;<ref name=ShawKane134-135/> as a result,  the day-long assault by the Americans was unsuccessful.<ref>Miller pp. 129\u2013131</ref> Neither attacking force made any progress, and as US casualties began to mount Liversedge decided to withdraw. Just before dawn on 22 July, air strikes were requested to cover the withdrawal. Air support from land-based aircraft had been quite poor earlier in the campaign, but the support provided at this time amounted to the heaviest aerial bombardment of the campaign to that point.<ref>Horton pp. 105\u2013108</ref>\n\nAfter calling-off the assault, the Americans withdrew to nearby Enogai. The American forces remained in the Enogai area until the end of the New Georgia Campaign. The Japanese used Bairoko to resupply and reinforce their troops who were guarding an airfield at Munda Point, southwest of Bairoko on the western coast of New Georgia.{{Cn|date=April 2020}} In early August, Liversedge began another effort to capture Bairoko; reinforcements from the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] also arrived and began to advance on Bairoko from the south, after the U.S. and its allies successfully [[Battle of Munda Point|captured]] the airfield on 4/5 August. The Japanese subsequently evacuated New Georgia and abandoned Bairoko on 24 August.<ref>Horton p. 109</ref><ref>Miller pp. 167\u2013171</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | last = Alexander | first = Joseph H.  | year = 2000 | title = Edson's Raiders: The 1st Marine Raider Battalion in World War II | publisher = Naval Institute Press | location = | isbn = 1-55750-020-7 }}\n*{{cite book | last = Altobello | first = Brian | authorlink = | year = 2000 | chapter = | title = Into the Shadows Furious | publisher = Presidio Press | location = | isbn = 0-89141-717-6 }}\n*{{cite book | last = Day | first = Ronnie | authorlink = | year = 2016 | chapter = | title = New Georgia: The Second Battle for the Solomons | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = | isbn = 0253018773}}\n*{{cite book | last = Hammel | first = Eric M. | authorlink = Eric M.
