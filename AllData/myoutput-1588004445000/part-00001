They spoke an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language also known as ''Pamlico'' or [[Carolina Algonquian language|''Carolina Algonquian'']].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Pamlico lang.png|thumb|250px|Pamlico]]\n\nThe Pamlico Indians lived on the [[Pamlico River]] in North Carolina. Named after them were [[Pamlico Sound]], the largest sound in North Carolina, and [[Pamlico County, North Carolina|Pamlico County]]. They are one of the most southerly [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] tribes on the Atlantic seaboard and the most southerly ones for which scholars collected a vocabulary.\n\n== History ==\nThe Raleigh colonists referred to the Pamlico in 1585-86 by the name ''Pomoui''.\n\n===17th century history===\n[[Image:Arrival of Englishmen in North Carolina - 1585.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Arrival of the Englishmen in Virginia, 1607.]] \nIn 1696, [[smallpox]], called \"A great Mortality\", devastated the Pamlico and neighboring Algonquian communities and reduced their populations.  In 1701 the explorer [[John Lawson (explorer)|John Lawson]] noted their Algonquian language and vocabulary (Lawson, 1860). By 1710 the Pamlico people were so limited that they lived in a single small village.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/pamlico-indians|title=Pamlico Indians {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Village of Secotan.jpg|thumb|Algonquian village on the Pamlico River estuary]]\nBy 1709 the total North Carolina Algonquian population was down to some 600 from at least several thousand at the time of English encounter. The [[Tuscarora War]], 1711-1713, claimed more fatalities among the Algonquian allies than of the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]. In the late stages, the Tuscarora turned on some of their allies.  They likely incorporated some of the Pamlico as [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|slaves]]. By the end of the century, only a handful of Algonkians remained.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pamlico|title=Pamlico {{!}} people|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nWith the decrease in numbers came the loss of tribal lands. Thus, the [[Weapemeoc Indians]] sold their lands on [[Albemarle Sound]] in 1660 and 1662 and started to move to the interior. By 1697 they complained against the encroachments of white settlers in their new location. The \nEnglish assigned a reservation on Bennetts Creek to the Chawanokes (Chowan) before 1700; they reduced its sized from 12 to {{convert|6|sqmi|km2}} by 1707; the Chowanoke sold off land in 1713. \nAfter the Tuscarora War, the Machapunga also were assigned to a reservation.  Other groups on the  Pamlico Sound joined either the [[Machapunga]] or the Tuscarora.\n\nWith growing white presence in eastern Carolina, more products of European origin were introduced to the Indians. Guns were regularly used instead of bows and arrows during the eighteenth century. Iron hatchets had likewise replaced wooden clubs. English clothes were also widely used by the Indians. The [[Roanoke tribe|Roanoke]] chief had an English-style house built in 1654.\n\nOther practices persisted through the nineteenth century, including the women making baskets of rushes and [[Chrysopsis mariana|silk grass]].  They decorated them with woven-in life motifs.\n\n===18th century history===\n[[Image:An old man in his winter clothes (1590).jpg|thumb|An aged Native man from Pomeiock, c. 1590]]\nDuring the seventeenth century, the Chawanoke were in frequent and partly hostile contact with their Virginia Algonquian neighbors. Their traditional hostilities with the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] Tuscarora continued during that tribe's war with the whites, when they were actively engaged in expeditions against the hostiles. The Machapungas and other tribes of Pamlico Sound, however, changed their alliances: before 1700 they were still at war with the Tuscarora and [[Coree]], but in 1711 they sided with them against the English. The [[Hatteras Indians|Hatteras]], [[Weapemeoc]]  ([[Paspatank]] or [[Pasquotank people|Pasquotank]], [[Poteskeet]], [[Perquimans]] and [[Yeopim]]) Indians were at that time the most acculturated groups; they remained on the side of the English.\n\nExcept for the [[Tuscarora War]], there was little open fighting between the Algonquian and English colonists.  They had suffered more from epidemics of infectious diseases. Due to small numbers, trade was of little importance.\n\nSale of strong liquors to the Indians was probably the greatest problem created by white traders around 1700. Alcohol was banned from Indian towns in 1703, but the prohibition was never strictly enforced. Little was done for Indian education, even though native languages were being replaced by English during the eighteenth century.\n\nA small number of Indians were [[baptized]] as [[Christians]] by [[Anglican]] ministers throughout the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Tribe members starting adopting English names (sometimes as second names to be used occasionally) shortly after 1700. Indian [[medicine men]] earned money by treating white settlers as well as their own people. Some settlers in North Carolina bought Indians as slaves, and others transported them to northern markets. The extent of Indian servitude and slavery is not accurately known.\n\n==Culture==\n[[Image:The town of Pomeiock.jpg|thumb|The town of Pomeiock]]\nThe Pamlico created distinctive [[Dugout (boat)|dugout canoes]], and traveled extensively. Pamlico artifacts have been found as far away as the North Atlantic.<ref>http://www.roadstojustice.org/pamlico-county-here-we-come{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThey ate corn, fish, and other agricultural vegetables and fruits. Besides hunting and agriculture, the coastal groups still relied much on fishing and shellfish gathering, drying the products for preservation on reed hurdles over an open fire or in the sun. Sturgeon was not used as a food by the Indians along the coast. Cattle raising is documented for the Paspatanks around 1700 (Lawson 1709). The Tuscarora War disturbed the economic balance of many of the Algonquian groups: the fields of the Machapunga and their allies were destroyed by the English.  The Hatteras were prevented from planting by their enemies, and in 1714-1715 needed supplies from the colonial authorities to survive.\n\nPolitical organization with [[hereditary]] [[chiefdoms]] was still functioning around 1700. Chiefs' corpses were buried in the temples as before. Commoners could purchase the right of burial in the temple precinct with enough money. Shell beads (wampum) served as money, for example, to compensate victims of crimes.\n\n===Ceremonies===\nMarriage restrictions that prohibited marrying first cousins made it difficult to find mates within rapidly shrinking communities. Resulting marriages into other tribes certainly strengthened intertribal bonds.\n\nThe ''huskenaw'' rite appears to have been used as an initiation for both boys and girls. It was held around Christmas and lasted for five or six weeks, during which the adolescents were separated in a special building outside the village. There were some colonial reports that two of 50 families among the Machapungas practiced male circumcision, but this was not typical of the Native Americans.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:North carolina algonkin(2).png|right|thumb|200px|Distribution of [[Carolina Algonquian]] speaking peoples]]\n*[[Algonquian languages]]\n*[[Algonquian peoples]]\n{{commons category}}\n*[[Pamlico County, North Carolina]]\n*[[Roanoke tribe]]\n<ref>https://www.pamlicocapital.com</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands]]\n[[Category:Algonquian peoples]]\n[[Category:Native American history of North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Native American tribes in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Pamlico County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Algonquian ethnonyms]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Pimlico}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group      = Pamlico\n|image=A noblewoman of Pomeiock (1590).jpg\n|image_caption    = A noblewoman of Pomeiock\n|population = Extinct as a tribe\n|regions    = [[North Carolina]]\n|region1    = \n|region2    = \n|pop1       = \n|ref1       = \n|religions  = [[Tribal religion]] (historical)\n|languages  = [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] (historical) \n|related    = [[Chowanoke]], [[Machapunga]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Pamlico''' (also ''Pampticough'', ''Pomouik'', ''Pomeiok'') were  [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] of [[North Carolina]].
