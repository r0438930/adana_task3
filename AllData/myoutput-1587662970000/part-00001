It is a solution to the [[Triffin dilemma]]-the conflict of economic interests between the short-term domestic and long-term international objectives when a currency used in a country is also serving as world reserve currency.\n\nNash gave various lectures and written discourses on the subject he called Ideal Money.<ref>http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/videos/31344/ideal-money-and-the-motivation-of-savings-and-thrift-2011</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je22xKQekCk|title=Ideal Money Lecture|last=Nash|first=John}}</ref> The first talk was given in 1995 (one year after Nash won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize for economics]] for his work on equilibrium theory nearly 50 years prior).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO7aDojl6f0|title=Ideal Money lecture 1995|last=Nash|first=John}}</ref> Nash spent 20 years giving talks, in many different nations around the world, about how Ideal Money could be brought about internationally.\n\nNash said in an interview the basic idea for Ideal Money came to him in the late 1950s and early 1960s at a time when he fled the US to Europe in order to try to renounce his US citizenship and exchange his USD for the Swiss Franc (which he believed to be superior in quality from a perspective he describes in Ideal Money).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zb6_PZxxA0|title=Food For Thought With John Nash}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nNash defines his concept of Ideal Money as: <blockquote>\n....money intrinsically not subject to inflation...<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fermatslibrary.com/|title=Fermat's Library {{!}} Ideal Money Version 2 annotated/explained version.|website=Fermat's Library|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== ICPI-Industrial Consumption Price Index ==\nIn pursuit of a possible apolitical basis for stable value Nash created a concept he calls an ICPI.  The ICPI is effectively a basket of optimally chosen commodity prices: <blockquote>The ultimately launched concept of \"Ideal Money\" became possible when I conceived of a practical basis for a standardization of the comparison of the value of the currency with an appropriate standard or ideal. And the key to that was the idea of an ICPI or (international) \"Industrial Consumption Price Index\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fermatslibrary.com/p/213f2919|title=Asymptotically Ideal Money|last=Nash|first=John}}</ref></blockquote><blockquote>This statistic could be calculated from the international prices of commodities such as copper, silver, tungsten, and so forth that are used in industrial activities.</blockquote>\n\n== Asymptotically ideal money ==\nIn an interview with Greek ex-finance minister [[Yanis Varoufakis]] Nash explained that the role of money has changed and evolves: <blockquote>...money plays constantly evolving role, despite the continuity from one era to the next.

As the number approaches 21 million, mining rewards will approach zero, and Bitcoin output with cease once and for all. The transactions demand for Bitcoins will, in contrast, tend to go on increasing with economic growth. A Bitcoin standard would thus tend to result in a rate of deflation at least equal to the rate of economic growth, with occasional bouts of more severe deflation occurring with every cyclical increase in the demand for money. Although (as I\u2019ve argued elsewhere) deflation needn\u2019t go hand-in-hand with recession or depression so long as the rate of deflation reflects an economy\u2019s (total factor) productivity growth rate, chances are that deflation in a Bitcoin economy would frequently exceed this safe limit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hillsdale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/FMF-2014-Bitcoin-Problems-and-Prospects.pdf|title=Bitcoin: Problems and Prospects|last=Selgin|first=George|date=Nov 2014}}</ref></blockquote>Because bitcoin's supply was predetermined at inception<ref>[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply]</ref> and considered unchangeable it cannot fluctuate with the demand cycles and thus Selgin suggests it cannot be made very stable in regard to its purchasing power.  However, this still leaves the possibility that bitcoin fits Nash's concept of \"Asymptotically Ideal Money\". Whether Nash was specifically referring to bitcoin or not it still might have the same effect and lead to the intended result of international stability of the existing legacy fiat currencies (and possibly in relation to bitcoin).\n\nAlthough bitcoin might not be Ideal Money Nash would consider it to be \"good money\" because of its comparability to gold based on its supply restraint and predictability:<blockquote>To be quite respectable, in a Gresham-advised sense, money needs only to be AS GOOD as other material commodities that might be hoarded.</blockquote>This makes it an interesting consideration for the basis of Nash's premise suggesting Ideal Money could be an enthymeme [bitcoin has inflation, Ideal Money, unlike Asymptotically Ideal Money, is free from inflation] for bitcoin: <blockquote>\u2026intrinsically free of \u201cinflationary decadence\u201d..a true \u201cgold standard\u201d, but the proposed basis for that was not the proposal of a linkage to gold</blockquote>\n\n== Ideal money as fiat ==\nThe implementation of centrally banked digital currencies, such as many nations and central banks are studying and testing,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sdp2017-16.pdf|title=Central Bank Digital Currency: Motivations and Implications}}</ref> might also give rise to a possibility for the implementation of Ideal Money via a digitally secured peg to a basket of digitally based nationally currencies.\n\n== Nashification vs hyperbitcoinization ==\nIt has been shown{{by whom|date=June 2018}} that Nashification, the process of the asymptotic approach to an \"ideal\" of inter-national stability of major currencies is comparable to the end observation of the result of \"hyperbitcoinization\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/|title=Hyperbitcoinization|last=Krawisz|first=Daniel}}</ref>  That is to say, hyperbitcoinization, which is the implication bitcoin will becomes the single world currency, does satisfy Nash's proposal to have internationally stable money:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@rextar4444/nashification-vs-bitcoinization-d8ec9b8bce3f|title=Nashification Vs.
