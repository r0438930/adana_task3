He also served as one of three [[Rosh yeshiva|co-deans]] of the [[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in Bnei Brak, along with Rabbis [[Shmuel Rozovsky]] and [[Dovid Povarsky]].\n\nDue to his differences with the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] leadership of the [[Agudat Yisrael]] in 1984, he [[Shas#History|allied with Rabbi Ovadia Yosef]], who had founded the [[Shas]] party. Later, in 1988, Shach sharply criticized Ovadia Yosef, and said that, \"[[Sepharadim]] are not yet ready for leadership positions\",<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">'Haaretz' daily newspaper, Shachar Ilan, November 2, 2001</ref> and subsequently [[Degel HaTorah#History|founded the Degel HaTorah]] political party representing [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] (non-Hasidic) [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the Israeli [[Knesset]].\n\n== Life in Europe ==\n[[File:Schach passport photo.jpg|thumb|185px|Passport photo (1920s)]]\n\nElazar Menachem Man Shach was born in [[Vabalninkas]] (Vaboilnik in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]), a rural village in northern [[Lithuania]], to Rabbi Ezriel and Batsheva Shach. The Shach family had been merchants for generations, but Batsheva's family, the Levitans, were religious scholars who served various Lithuanian communities. Batsheva's brother, Rabbi Osher Nisan Levitan, later became an important figure in the [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] in the United States. Elazar was an ''[[illui]]'' (child prodigy).<ref>''Rabbi Eliezer Schach, Torah giant, dies at age 103'' Ilan, Shahar. Canadian Jewish News. Nov 8, 2001. Vol. 31, Iss. 46; pg. 41</ref>\n\nIn 1909, at the age of 11, Shach went to study at the [[Ponevezh Yeshiva]], which at the time was located in the city of [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], Lithuania, and was headed by Rabbi [[Isaac Jacob Rabinowitz]], known as Rav Itzele Ponovezer.\nIn 1913, Shach started studying in [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)]]. \nWhen [[World War I]] began in 1914, many of the Slabodka yeshiva students were dispersed across Europe. Shach initially returned to his family, but then began traveling across Lithuania from town to town, sleeping and eating wherever he could, while continuing to [[Torah study|study Torah]]. In 1915, following the advice of Rabbi [[Yechezkel Bernstein]] (author of ''Divrei Yechezkel''), Shach traveled to [[Slutsk]] to study at the yeshiva there. It was in Slutsk that he met Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]], and this was the beginning of a close life-long relationship between the two. Shach also met Rabbi [[Yosef Yozel Horwitz]] (head of the [[Novardok yeshiva]]), who had come to visit the yeshiva in order to introduce its students to the study of ''mussar'' (see [[Musar movement]]). Around this time, he also met for the first time Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], as Feinstein would often visit Meltzer at his house in Slutsk. In 1921, as a result of regional political changes, the Slutsk yeshiva split up. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] stayed in the city of Slutsk, while Meltzer's son-in-law, Rabbi [[Aharon Kotler]], took his students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Kletsk]]. Shach joined Kotler in Kletsk, and subsequently was appointed by Kotler as a [[maggid shiur]] (\"lecturer [in [[Talmud]]]\") in the yeshiva.\nIn 1923, Shach married Meltzer's niece, Guttel Gilmovski. After the wedding, Shach and his wife moved to [[Mir, Belarus]], the residence of his father-in-law. After spending some time in the city of Mir, Shach moved back to Kletsk to join the yeshiva again. In 1925, his wife's uncle, Rabbi Meltzer, moved to Israel, and it was at this point that Shach became significantly more involved in the daily running of the yeshiva. It was around this time that Rabbi [[Yechezkel Levenstein]] joined the yeshiva to become its [[mashgiach ruchani]] (\"spiritual guide\"), and thus began a life-long relationship of mutual respect between Shach and Levenstein.\nAfter the passing of Rabbi [[Meir Shapiro]], head of the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]], Rabbi [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]] sent the yeshivah's administrators a letter, recommending Shach for the position. After delivering a discourse at the Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva, Shach traveled to [[Vilnius|Vilna]] to consult with Grodzinski about the wisdom of taking on the new position, and upon hearing the various aspects of the question, Grodzinski advised Shach to turn down the offer.<ref name=\"Elazar Menachem Man Shach 1953 pg. 262\"/>\n\nIn 1934, Shach was appointed ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' of the [[Novardok yeshiva]]. This came about as a result of the recommendation of Rabbi [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz]] (known as the [[Chazon Ish]]) to one of the yeshiva's founders, Rabbi Bentzion Brook.<ref>''Path to Greatness \u2013 The Life of Maran Harav Elazar Menachem Man Shach, Vol I: Vaboilnik to Bnei Brak (1899\u20131953)'' \u2013 pg. 454</ref> During this time in Shach's life, the rest of his family stayed in Kletsk, while he stayed in the Novardok yeshiva for extended periods of time. After approximately two years, Shach left the yeshiva, saying that \"this is not the place for me for many reasons\".<ref>Letter to a student.</ref>\n\n== Escaping to the British Mandate of Palestine ==\n\nShortly before the start of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], several yeshivas began considering evacuating their rabbis, students, and families. [[Aharon Kotler#World War II and move to the United States|Aharon Kotler escaped to the United States]], traveling across [[Siberia]] and arriving in the United States during the war. In 1939, Shach first went to [[Vilnius|Vilna]], where he stayed with Rabbi [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]]. Later that year, both Shach's mother and his eldest daughter fell ill, and died. In early 1940, the Shach family decided to leave Lithuania. Shach's maternal uncle, Rabbi Aron Levitan, had helped Kotler get emigration visas to the United States, but Shach, after consulting with Rabbi [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik]] and Rabbi Grodzinski,<ref>''Harav Schach: Shehamafteach B'yado'' by Moshe Horovitz. Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1989. page 56</ref> decided instead to go to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], where Meltzer was serving as Rosh Yeshiva at [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Shach would later serve as the Rosh Yeshiva there as well. His uncle helped him and his family get immigration certificates, and took them in after they arrived at his doorstep in a destitute condition.\n\nSeveral years after the re-establishment of the Ponevezh yeshiva in Bnei Brak, Shach was asked by Rabbi [[Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman]] to be one of its deans. Shach first discussed the proposal with Rabbi Soloveitchik, and was encouraged by the latter to take the position.<ref>''Harav Schach: Shehamafteach B'yado'' by Moshe Horovitz. Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1989. page 60</ref> Shach served in that capacity from 1954 until his death. At this yeshiva, Shach delivered a lecture on the [[Talmud]] every Tuesday, and also occasionally gave other classes to the student body of the yeshiva.\n\n== Rabbinical career ==\n\nShach received [[Semikhah|rabbinical ordination]] from Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]],<ref name=\"Elazar Menachem Man Shach 1953 pg. 262\">''Path to Greatness \u2013 The Life of Maran Harav Elazar Menachem Man Shach, Vol I: Vaboilnik to Bnei Brak (1899\u20131953)'' \u2013 pg. 262</ref> and served as chairman of [[Chinuch Atzmai]] and Va'ad HaYeshivos.<ref>''In Their Shadow: Wisdom and Guidance of the Gedolim Volume One: Chazon Ish, Brisker Rav, Rav Shach'' pg. 282</ref> In the mid-1960s, Shach was offered a position to serve as a senior ''rosh hayeshiva'' at Yeshiva University in New York, to which he politely declined.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Orthodoxy Awakens: The Belkin Era and Yeshiva University|last=Geller|first=Victor|publisher=Urim Publications|year=2003|isbn=965-7108-47-0|location=Jerusalem, Israel|pages=161-162}}</ref> From 1970 until his death, Shach was generally recognized by Lithuanian Haredim and some other Haredi circles as the ''Gadol Ha-Dor''.<ref>Encyclopedia Judaica \u2013 Macmillan Reference USA; Second edition (2006)</ref> During his lifetime, Shach was a revered spiritual mentor of more than 100,000 Orthodox Jews,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/27/world/orthodox-leader-in-israel-appears-to-spurn-peres.html?scp=3&sq=Eliezer%20Schach&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Orthodox Leader in Israel Appears to Spurn Peres | first=Joel | last=Brinkley | date=March 27, 1990 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> and was credited by many with promoting the concept of the \"society of learners\" in the post-war Haredi world. Under his aegis, the phenomenon of Haredi men studying the Talmud in [[yeshiva]]s and [[kollel]]s full-time gained popularity.\n\nAlthough this type of set-up was unprecedented in Jewish history,<ref>Jweekly November 9, 2001 David Landau JTA</ref> it became the norm in some Haredi communities in Israel and the United States, with some financial backing and donations from Haredi communities, as well as subsidies to young families with many children from the Israeli government. Shach is also quoted as saying that although the ''yeshivas'' are the heart of the Jewish people, it is the ''[[Baal teshuva|ba'alei teshuvah]]'' who will be the ones to bring ''Mashiach''.<ref>''Raising Roses Among the Thorns'' by Noach Orlowek, pg. 345</ref>\n\n== View of the Holocaust ==\n\nShach taught that events like [[the Holocaust]] occurred because the [[Jewish views on sin|sins of the Jewish people]] accumulated, and they needed to be punished in order to rectify them. He said that, \"God kept count of each and every sin, in a running count over hundreds of years, until the count amounted to six million Jews, and that is how the Holocaust occurred. So must a Jew believe, and if a Jew does not completely believe this, he is a [[Heresy in Orthodox Judaism|heretic]], and if we do not accept this as a punishment, then it is as if we don't believe in The Holy One, Blessed be He...\"<ref>Yated Neeman 29/12/90.

He wrote that any secular studies were banned by the sages of the Talmud, and that in particular the study of [[psychology]] and [[history]] is pure heresy. He also wrote that learning a [[Craft|trade]] before it became an immediate need is forbidden.<ref>Michtavim vMamarim volumes 1 pg. 109, pg.128,3 pg.31&39,4 pg.35,107</ref>\n\nWhen Shach was asked about opening a yeshiva exclusively for gifted boys, he said that it is impossible to know beforehand who will grow in Torah knowledge, and who will not, and that all boys should therefore be given equal opportunities.<ref>''Relevance: Pirkei Avos for the twenty-first century'' by Dan Roth \u2013 Page 133</ref>\n\n== Political life ==\n\nFor Shach, battling [[secularism]] and [[Zionism]] was not enough. During the years of his leadership, he also waged bitter wars against anybody he suspected of deviation from the classical [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] path.<ref>http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-1268268,00.html</ref> At the behest of Rabbi [[Aharon Kotler]], Shach joined the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]].<ref>''The Legacy Of Maran Rav Aharon Kotler'' by Yitzchok Dershowitz, Feldheim Publishers (2006) \u2013 pg. 137. http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50717&st=&pgnum=180</ref> When Rabbi [[Zalman Sorotzkin]] died in 1966, Shach became president of the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]], before later  resigning  from the Moetzes after the other leading rabbis refused to follow him.<ref name=\"HAYESHIVA RAV ELAZAR MENACHEM MAN SHACH 2001\">''PONOVEZER ROSH HAYESHIVA RAV ELAZAR MENACHEM MAN SHACH, ZT\"L (1894\u20132001)'' The Jewish Press \u2013 Saturday, December 08 2001 \u2013 by Rabbi Gershon Tannenbaum with Rabbi Yaakov Klass</ref> Shach wrote strongly in support of every observant citizen voting. He felt that a vote not cast for the right party or candidate was effectively a vote for the wrong party and candidate. This theme is consistent in his writings from the time that the State of Israel was established.<ref name=\"HAYESHIVA RAV ELAZAR MENACHEM MAN SHACH 2001\"/>\n\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 9440 harav-shach.jpg|thumb|230px|Shach (on right, looking down) during the late 1980s; seated to his right are [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]] and [[Chaim Kanievsky]] (partly obscured).]]\n\nShas ran for the [[Knesset#Composition of the 11th Knesset Assembly (elected 1984)|11th Knesset]] in 1984, and Shach called upon his \"[[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]]\" followers to vote for it in the polls, a move that many saw as key political and religious move in Shach's split with the Hasidic-controlled [[Agudat Yisrael]]. While initially, Shas was largely under the aegis of Shach, [[Ovadia Yosef]] gradually exerted control over the party, culminating in Shas' decision to support the [[Labor (Israel)|Labor]] party in the 13th Knesset in 1992.\n\nOn the eve of the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|November 1988 election]], Shach officially broke away from Agudat Israel in protest at [[Hamodia]] publishing, as paid advertisements, a series of articles based on the teachings of the [[Lubavitch]]er Rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]. Shach criticized Schneerson for his presumed messianic aspirations. Shach wanted the Aguda party to oppose Lubavitch; however, all but one ([[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]) of the Hasidic groups within the party refused to back him. Shach and his followers then formed the [[Degel HaTorah]] (\"Flag of Torah\") party to represent the non-Hasidic [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] Haredim.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\nFollowing a personal visit by Shach to the halachic decisors and leading rabbis, [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]] and [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]], in Jerusalem to seek their support for the new party, they agreed to lend support to the new party.<ref>''Davar'' \u2013 02/10/1988 \u2013 pg. 3 \u2013 Noach Zvuluny - http://www.ranaz.co.il/articles/article2971_19881002.asp</ref> Schneerson's followers mobilized to support the Agudat Yisrael party. In the end, Agudat Yisrael secured nearly three times the number of votes it had in 1984, and increased its Knesset representation from two seats to five, while Degel HaTorah only picked up two seats.<ref>{{cite book|title=Israel, Land of Tradition and Conflict |url=https://archive.org/details/israellandoftrad00reic |url-access=registration |first1=Bernard |last1=Reich |first2= Gershon R. |last2=Kieval |publisher=Westview Press |year=1993}}</ref> \nAfter the bitter contest in the 1988 elections, Degel HaTorah conceded and agreed to work together with Agudat Yisrael. They combined forces in the 1992 elections, under the name of [[United Torah Judaism]] (UTJ) ''Yahadut HaTorah HaMeukhedet'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], an agreement which has continued to the present.\n\nIn a speech delivered prior to the 1992 elections, Shach said that [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]] were still not fit for leadership,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and aroused great anger among Sephardi voters. Following the elections, Shach instructed [[Shas]] not to join the government, while [[Ovadia Yosef]] instructed them to join - this precipitated an open rift between the parties. Shach then declared that [[Shas]] had removed itself from the Jewish community when it joined the wicked...<ref>'Haaretz', Shachar Ilan, November 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAround 1995, Shach's political activity diminished, following deterioration in his health, before later ceasing altogether. After that, the two main leaders of the [[Degel HaTorah]] party were Rabbis [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]] (d. 2012) and continued by [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]].\n\nShach was deeply opposed to [[Zionism]], both secular and religious. He was fiercely dismissive of secular [[Israel]]is and their culture. For example, during a 1990 speech, he lambasted secular [[kibbutz]]niks as \"breeders of rabbits and pigs\" who did not \"know what [[Yom Kippur]] is\". In the same speech, he said that the [[Labour (Israel)|Labor Party]] had cut themselves off from their Jewish past and wished to \"seek a new Torah\". Labor Party politician [[Yossi Beilin]] said Shach's speech had set back relations between religious and secular Israelis by decades.<ref>Los Angeles Times \u2013 November 3, 2001 from the Associated Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1985, four years after the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]] supported a liberalized [[abortion in Israel|abortion law]], Shach refused to meet with [[Shimon Peres]], since he would not even speak with a \"murderer of fetuses\".<ref>Yair Sheleg: [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/chabad-s-lost-son-1.24243 Chabad's Lost Son] ''Ha'aretz'', December 26, 2002.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Haaretz]]'', Shahar Ilan described him as \"an ideologue\" and \"a zealot who repeatedly led his followers into ideological battles\".<ref>'Haaretz' November 2, 2001 \"[http://www.haaretz.com/news/rabbi-schach-a-man-of-wars-and-battles-1.73738 Rabbi Shach \u2013 a man of wars and battles]\"</ref>\n\nShach never seemed concerned over the discord his harsh statements might cause, saying that, \"There is no need to worry about ''machlokes'' [dispute], because if it is done for the sake of Heaven, in the end, it will endure...one is obligated to be a ''baal-machlokes'' [disputant].

In the [[1984 Israeli legislative election|Eleventh Knesset elections of 1984]], Shach had already told his supporters to vote for Shas instead of Agudat Yisrael. Some perceived the schism as the reemergence of the dissent between [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] and [[Misnagdim|Mitnagdim]], as Shach represented the Lithuanian Torah world, while the Gerer Rebbe was among the most important Hasidic Rebbes and represented the most significant Hasidic court in Agudat Yisrael. However, it would not be accurate to base the entire conflict on a renewal of the historic dispute between Hasidim and Mitnagdim which began in the latter half of the eighteenth century.<ref>Friedman, Menachem jcpa.org/jl/vp104.htm</ref>\n\n'''Adin Steinsaltz'''\n\n[[Adin Steinsaltz]] (Even-Yisrael) (b. 1937) was likewise accused of heresy by Shach, who, in a letter written September 10, 1988, wrote that \"... and similarly, all his other works contain heresy.

The Shach family had been merchants for generations, but Batsheva's family, the Levitans, were religious scholars who served various Lithuanian communities. Batsheva's brother, Rabbi Osher Nisan Levitan, later became an important figure in the [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] in the United States. Elazar was an ''[[illui]]'' (child prodigy).<ref>''Rabbi Eliezer Schach, Torah giant, dies at age 103'' Ilan, Shahar. Canadian Jewish News. Nov 8, 2001. Vol. 31, Iss. 46; pg. 41</ref>\n\nIn 1909, at the age of 11, Shach went to study at the [[Ponevezh Yeshiva]], which at the time was located in the city of [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], Lithuania, and was headed by Rabbi [[Isaac Jacob Rabinowitz]], known as Rav Itzele Ponovezer.\nIn 1913, Shach started studying in [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)]]. \nWhen [[World War I]] began in 1914, many of the Slabodka yeshiva students were dispersed across Europe. Shach initially returned to his family, but then began traveling across Lithuania from town to town, sleeping and eating wherever he could, while continuing to [[Torah study|study Torah]]. In 1915, following the advice of Rabbi [[Yechezkel Bernstein]] (author of ''Divrei Yechezkel''), Shach traveled to [[Slutsk]] to study at the yeshiva there. It was in Slutsk that he met Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]], and this was the beginning of a close life-long relationship between the two. Shach also met Rabbi [[Yosef Yozel Horwitz]] (head of the [[Novardok yeshiva]]), who had come to visit the yeshiva in order to introduce its students to the study of ''mussar'' (see [[Musar movement]]). Around this time, he also met for the first time Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], as Feinstein would often visit Meltzer at his house in Slutsk. In 1921, as a result of regional political changes, the Slutsk yeshiva split up. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] stayed in the city of Slutsk, while Meltzer's son-in-law, Rabbi [[Aharon Kotler]], took his students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Kletsk]]. Shach joined Kotler in Kletsk, and subsequently was appointed by Kotler as a [[maggid shiur]] (\"lecturer [in [[Talmud]]]\") in the yeshiva.\nIn 1923, Shach married Meltzer's niece, Guttel Gilmovski. After the wedding, Shach and his wife moved to [[Mir, Belarus]], the residence of his father-in-law. After spending some time in the city of Mir, Shach moved back to Kletsk to join the yeshiva again. In 1925, his wife's uncle, Rabbi Meltzer, moved to Israel, and it was at this point that Shach became significantly more involved in the daily running of the yeshiva. It was around this time that Rabbi [[Yechezkel Levenstein]] joined the yeshiva to become its [[mashgiach ruchani]] (\"spiritual guide\"), and thus began a life-long relationship of mutual respect between Shach and Levenstein.\nAfter the passing of Rabbi [[Meir Shapiro]], head of the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]], Rabbi [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]] sent the yeshivah's administrators a letter, recommending Shach for the position. After delivering a discourse at the Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva, Shach traveled to [[Vilnius|Vilna]] to consult with Grodzinski about the wisdom of taking on the new position, and upon hearing the various aspects of the question, Grodzinski advised Shach to turn down the offer.<ref name=\"Elazar Menachem Man Shach 1953 pg. 262\"/>\n\nIn 1934, Shach was appointed ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' of the [[Novardok yeshiva]]. This came about as a result of the recommendation of Rabbi [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz]] (known as the [[Chazon Ish]]) to one of the yeshiva's founders, Rabbi Bentzion Brook.<ref>''Path to Greatness \u2013 The Life of Maran Harav Elazar Menachem Man Shach, Vol I: Vaboilnik to Bnei Brak (1899\u20131953)'' \u2013 pg. 454</ref> During this time in Shach's life, the rest of his family stayed in Kletsk, while he stayed in the Novardok yeshiva for extended periods of time. After approximately two years, Shach left the yeshiva, saying that \"this is not the place for me for many reasons\".<ref>Letter to a student.</ref>\n\n== Escaping to the British Mandate of Palestine ==\n\nShortly before the start of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], several yeshivas began considering evacuating their rabbis, students, and families. [[Aharon Kotler#World War II and move to the United States|Aharon Kotler escaped to the United States]], traveling across [[Siberia]] and arriving in the United States during the war. In 1939, Shach first went to [[Vilnius|Vilna]], where he stayed with Rabbi [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]]. Later that year, both Shach's mother and his eldest daughter fell ill, and died. In early 1940, the Shach family decided to leave Lithuania. Shach's maternal uncle, Rabbi Aron Levitan, had helped Kotler get emigration visas to the United States, but Shach, after consulting with Rabbi [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik]] and Rabbi Grodzinski,<ref>''Harav Schach: Shehamafteach B'yado'' by Moshe Horovitz. Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1989. page 56</ref> decided instead to go to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], where Meltzer was serving as Rosh Yeshiva at [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Shach would later serve as the Rosh Yeshiva there as well. His uncle helped him and his family get immigration certificates, and took them in after they arrived at his doorstep in a destitute condition.\n\nSeveral years after the re-establishment of the Ponevezh yeshiva in Bnei Brak, Shach was asked by Rabbi [[Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman]] to be one of its deans. Shach first discussed the proposal with Rabbi Soloveitchik, and was encouraged by the latter to take the position.<ref>''Harav Schach: Shehamafteach B'yado'' by Moshe Horovitz. Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1989. page 60</ref> Shach served in that capacity from 1954 until his death. At this yeshiva, Shach delivered a lecture on the [[Talmud]] every Tuesday, and also occasionally gave other classes to the student body of the yeshiva.\n\n== Rabbinical career ==\n\nShach received [[Semikhah|rabbinical ordination]] from Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]],<ref name=\"Elazar Menachem Man Shach 1953 pg. 262\">''Path to Greatness \u2013 The Life of Maran Harav Elazar Menachem Man Shach, Vol I: Vaboilnik to Bnei Brak (1899\u20131953)'' \u2013 pg. 262</ref> and served as chairman of [[Chinuch Atzmai]] and Va'ad HaYeshivos.<ref>''In Their Shadow: Wisdom and Guidance of the Gedolim Volume One: Chazon Ish, Brisker Rav, Rav Shach'' pg. 282</ref> In the mid-1960s, Shach was offered a position to serve as a senior ''rosh hayeshiva'' at Yeshiva University in New York, to which he politely declined.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Orthodoxy Awakens: The Belkin Era and Yeshiva University|last=Geller|first=Victor|publisher=Urim Publications|year=2003|isbn=965-7108-47-0|location=Jerusalem, Israel|pages=161-162}}</ref> From 1970 until his death, Shach was generally recognized by Lithuanian Haredim and some other Haredi circles as the ''Gadol Ha-Dor''.<ref>Encyclopedia Judaica \u2013 Macmillan Reference USA; Second edition (2006)</ref> During his lifetime, Shach was a revered spiritual mentor of more than 100,000 Orthodox Jews,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/27/world/orthodox-leader-in-israel-appears-to-spurn-peres.html?scp=3&sq=Eliezer%20Schach&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Orthodox Leader in Israel Appears to Spurn Peres | first=Joel | last=Brinkley | date=March 27, 1990 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> and was credited by many with promoting the concept of the \"society of learners\" in the post-war Haredi world. Under his aegis, the phenomenon of Haredi men studying the Talmud in [[yeshiva]]s and [[kollel]]s full-time gained popularity.\n\nAlthough this type of set-up was unprecedented in Jewish history,<ref>Jweekly November 9, 2001 David Landau JTA</ref> it became the norm in some Haredi communities in Israel and the United States, with some financial backing and donations from Haredi communities, as well as subsidies to young families with many children from the Israeli government. Shach is also quoted as saying that although the ''yeshivas'' are the heart of the Jewish people, it is the ''[[Baal teshuva|ba'alei teshuvah]]'' who will be the ones to bring ''Mashiach''.<ref>''Raising Roses Among the Thorns'' by Noach Orlowek, pg. 345</ref>\n\n== View of the Holocaust ==\n\nShach taught that events like [[the Holocaust]] occurred because the [[Jewish views on sin|sins of the Jewish people]] accumulated, and they needed to be punished in order to rectify them. He said that, \"God kept count of each and every sin, in a running count over hundreds of years, until the count amounted to six million Jews, and that is how the Holocaust occurred.

He also wrote that learning a [[Craft|trade]] before it became an immediate need is forbidden.<ref>Michtavim vMamarim volumes 1 pg. 109, pg.128,3 pg.31&39,4 pg.35,107</ref>\n\nWhen Shach was asked about opening a yeshiva exclusively for gifted boys, he said that it is impossible to know beforehand who will grow in Torah knowledge, and who will not, and that all boys should therefore be given equal opportunities.<ref>''Relevance: Pirkei Avos for the twenty-first century'' by Dan Roth \u2013 Page 133</ref>\n\n== Political life ==\n\nFor Shach, battling [[secularism]] and [[Zionism]] was not enough.

While initially, Shas was largely under the aegis of Shach, [[Ovadia Yosef]] gradually exerted control over the party, culminating in Shas' decision to support the [[Labor (Israel)|Labor]] party in the 13th Knesset in 1992.\n\nOn the eve of the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|November 1988 election]], Shach officially broke away from Agudat Israel in protest at [[Hamodia]] publishing, as paid advertisements, a series of articles based on the teachings of the [[Lubavitch]]er Rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]. Shach criticized Schneerson for his presumed messianic aspirations. Shach wanted the Aguda party to oppose Lubavitch; however, all but one ([[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]) of the Hasidic groups within the party refused to back him. Shach and his followers then formed the [[Degel HaTorah]] (\"Flag of Torah\") party to represent the non-Hasidic [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] Haredim.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\nFollowing a personal visit by Shach to the halachic decisors and leading rabbis, [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]] and [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]], in Jerusalem to seek their support for the new party, they agreed to lend support to the new party.<ref>''Davar'' \u2013 02/10/1988 \u2013 pg. 3 \u2013 Noach Zvuluny - http://www.ranaz.co.il/articles/article2971_19881002.asp</ref> Schneerson's followers mobilized to support the Agudat Yisrael party.

They combined forces in the 1992 elections, under the name of [[United Torah Judaism]] (UTJ) ''Yahadut HaTorah HaMeukhedet'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], an agreement which has continued to the present.\n\nIn a speech delivered prior to the 1992 elections, Shach said that [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]] were still not fit for leadership,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and aroused great anger among Sephardi voters. Following the elections, Shach instructed [[Shas]] not to join the government, while [[Ovadia Yosef]] instructed them to join - this precipitated an open rift between the parties. Shach then declared that [[Shas]] had removed itself from the Jewish community when it joined the wicked...<ref>'Haaretz', Shachar Ilan, November 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAround 1995, Shach's political activity diminished, following deterioration in his health, before later ceasing altogether. After that, the two main leaders of the [[Degel HaTorah]] party were Rabbis [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]] (d. 2012) and continued by [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]].\n\nShach was deeply opposed to [[Zionism]], both secular and religious. He was fiercely dismissive of secular [[Israel]]is and their culture. For example, during a 1990 speech, he lambasted secular [[kibbutz]]niks as \"breeders of rabbits and pigs\" who did not \"know what [[Yom Kippur]] is\". In the same speech, he said that the [[Labour (Israel)|Labor Party]] had cut themselves off from their Jewish past and wished to \"seek a new Torah\".

When Schneerson became sick, Shach prayed for his recovery by reciting chapters from the Book of [[Psalms]], explaining: \"My battle is against his erroneous approach, against the movement, but not against the people in any personal way.

Schneerson, citing case law in the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', strongly opposed both [[Peace process in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict|peace talks with the Palestinians]] and relinquishing [[Palestinian territories|territory]] to them under any circumstances, while Shach supported the \"[[land for peace]]\" approach.\n\n===Opposition to other Orthodox rabbis and groups===\n\nIn addition to his criticism of Schneerson, Shach attacked the following rabbis:\n\n'''Joseph B. Soloveitchik'''\n\nIn a lengthy attack on [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]] (d. 1993) of [[Yeshiva University]], Shach accused him of writing \"things that are forbidden to hear\",<ref>Letter of Shach \u2013 Michtavim U-Ma\u2019amarim, 4:320:page 36</ref> as well as of \"...endangering the survival of Torah-true Judaism by indoctrinating the masses with actual words of heresy\".<ref>Speech of Shach (transcribed by a listener) \u2013 Michtavim U-Ma\u2019amarim, 4:370:page 107</ref>\n\n'''The Gerer Rebbe'''\n \nShach resigned from the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah#In Israel|Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] (\"Council of Torah Greats\") following tensions between him and the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerer Rebbe]], Rabbi [[Simcha Bunim Alter]] (d. 1992). In the [[1984 Israeli legislative election|Eleventh Knesset elections of 1984]], Shach had already told his supporters to vote for Shas instead of Agudat Yisrael. Some perceived the schism as the reemergence of the dissent between [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] and [[Misnagdim|Mitnagdim]], as Shach represented the Lithuanian Torah world, while the Gerer Rebbe was among the most important Hasidic Rebbes and represented the most significant Hasidic court in Agudat Yisrael. However, it would not be accurate to base the entire conflict on a renewal of the historic dispute between Hasidim and Mitnagdim which began in the latter half of the eighteenth century.<ref>Friedman, Menachem jcpa.org/jl/vp104.htm</ref>\n\n'''Adin Steinsaltz'''\n\n[[Adin Steinsaltz]] (Even-Yisrael) (b. 1937) was likewise accused of heresy by Shach, who, in a letter written September 10, 1988, wrote that \"... and similarly, all his other works contain heresy. It is forbidden to debate with Steinsaltz, because, as a heretic, all the debates will only cause him to degenerate more.
