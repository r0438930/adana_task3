Lee Memorial|Arlington estate]]]]\n\nThe [[First Families of Virginia]] originated with colonists from England who primarily settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and other navigable waters in the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the 17th century. As there was a propensity to marry within their narrow social scope for many generations, many descendants bear surnames which became common in the growing colony.\n\nMany of the original English colonists considered members of the First Families of Virginia emigrated to the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642\u20131660). Royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II is reputed to have called Virginia his \"Old Dominion\", a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \"distressed Cavaliers\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Many Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. Thus, it came to be that the First Families of Virginia often refer to Virginia as \"Cavalier Country\". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but they had settled Virginia and so remained in Virginia.\n\nMost of such early settlers in Virginia were so-called \"Second Sons\".  [[Primogeniture]] favored first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Virginia evolved in a society of second or third sons of English aristocracy who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of the southern elite in America.\n\nMany of the great Virginia dynasties traced their roots to families like the [[Lee family|Lees]] and the Fitzhughs, who traced their lineage to England's county families and baronial legacies. Some, however, came from much more humble origins; such families as the Shackelfords, who gave their name to a Virginia hamlet, rose from modest beginnings in England to a place in the Virginia firmament. Some families, like the Gilliams, arrived in Virginia in the 17th century as [[indentured servants]]; by the late 18th century they had amassed several large plantations, including [[Weston Manor]], and became landed gentry in the colony.  Families such as the [[Mathews family|Mathews]] from later [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish immigration]] also formed political dynasties in Old Virginia. At the same time, other once-great families were decimated not only by the [[English Civil War]], but also by the enormous power of the London merchants to whom they were in debt and who could move markets \"with the stroke of a pen.\"\n\nThe [[Colonial families of Maryland]] were the leading families in the [[Province of Maryland]]. Several also had interests in the [[Colony of Virginia]], and the two are sometimes referred to as the [[Chesapeake Colonies]]. Many of the early settlers came from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in England, although the Maryland families were composed of a variety of European nationalities, e.g. French, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, and Swedish, in addition to English.\n\nThe Carroll family is an example of a prominent political family from Maryland, of Irish descent and origin in the ancient kingdom of \u00c9ile, commonly anglicized Ely, as a branch of the ruling O'Carroll family. Another is the Mason family of Virginia, who descended from the progenitor of the Mason family, [[George Mason I]], a [[Cavalier]] member of the [[Parliament of England]] born in Worcestershire, England.  The Riggin family of Maryland who also had holdings on the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is of Irish descent and origin in the [[Kingdom of Munster]]. Riggin, sometimes spelled Riggen or Regan is an anglicization of the [[Irish language|Irish]] surname Reagh.  The Riggins are descended from [[Cormac na Haoine MacCarthy Reagh]], the 13th prince of [[Carbery (barony)|Carbery]]. Their ancestral home, [[Kilbrittain|Kilbrittain Castle]] near [[Kinsale]] was the principal seat of the [[MacCarthy Reagh]] family, Princes of Carbery, from the early 15th century.<ref>https://www.geni.com/people/Teague-Riggin-Sr/6000000006348527210</ref><ref>https://www.colonial-settlers-md-va.us/getperson.php?personID=I094665&tree=Tree1</ref>\n\n[[Charles I of England]] granted the province [[County palatine|palatinate]] status under [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]].
