{"title_page": "Holotomography", "text_new": "'''Holotomography''' (HT) is a laser technique to measure three-dimensional [[refractive index]] (RI) tomogram of a microscopic sample such as biological cells and tissues. Because the RI can serve as an intrinsic imaging contrast for transparent or phase objects, measurements of RI tomograms can provide label-free quantitative imaging of microscopic phase objects. In order to measure 3-D RI tomogram of samples, HT employs the principle of holographic imaging and inverse scattering. Typically, multiple 2D holographic images of a sample are measured at various illumination angles, employing the principle of interferometric imaging. Then, a 3D RI tomogram of the sample is reconstructed from these multiple 2D holographic images by inversely solving light scattering in the sample.\n\nThe principle of HT is very similar to X-ray computed tomography (CT) or [[CT scan]]. CT scan measures multiple 2-D X-ray images of a human body at various illumination angles, and a 3-D tomogram (X-ray absorptivity) is then retrieved via the inverse scattering theory. Both the X-ray CT and laser HT shares the same governing equation \u2013 [[Helmholtz equation]],  [[Wave equation|the wave equatio]]<nowiki/>n for a monochromatic wavelength.
