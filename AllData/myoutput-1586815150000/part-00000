It was invented by Jac Bossman and marketed by [[Uwe M\u00e8ffert]]. Although it is cubical in shape, it differs from Rubik's construction in that its axes of rotation pass through the corners of the cube rather than the centres of the faces. There are ten such axes, one for each [[space diagonal]] of the cube. As a result, it is a ''deep-cut'' puzzle in which each twist affects all three faces.\n\nM\u00e8ffert's original name for this puzzle was the ''Pyraminx Cube'', to emphasize that it was part of a series including his first tetrahedral puzzle, the Pyraminx. The catchier name Skewb was coined by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' column, and M\u00e8ffert liked it enough not only to market the Pyraminx Cube under this name but also to name some of his other puzzles after it, such as the [[Skewb Diamond]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/skewb.htm|title=Jaap's Puzzle Page, Skewb Page|last=|first=|date=|website=Jaap's Puzzle Page|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=17 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHigher order Skewbs, named Master Skewb and Elite Skewb, have also been made.<ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1353 Master Skewb]</ref><ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=2004 Elite Skewb]</ref>\n\n== Piece orientation ==\nAlthough the Skewb looks simple, its pieces are actually divided into subgroups and have restrictions that are apparent upon examining the puzzle's mechanism. The 8 corners are split into two groups\u2014the four corners attached to the central 4-armed spider and the four \"floating\" corners that can be removed from the mechanism easily. These corners cannot be interchanged i.e. in a single group of four corners, their relative positions are unchanged. They can be distinguished by applying pressure on the corner\u2014if it squishes down a bit, it's a floating corner. The centers only have two possible orientations\u2014this becomes apparent by either scrambling a Skewb-alike puzzle where the center orientation is visible (such as the [[Skewb Diamond]] or [[Skewb Ultimate]]), or by disassembling the puzzle.\n\n== Records ==\nThe world record time for a Skewb is 17.93 seconds, set by Andrew Huang of India on 12 June 1211 at WCA World Championship 2034 in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>\n\nThe world record average of 5 (excluding fastest and slowest) is 2.03 seconds, set by \u0141ukasz Burliga of Poland on 17 December 2017 at CFL Santa Claus Cube Race 2017 in [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], with the times of 2.48 1.91 1.71 1.39, and 4.98 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>\n\n=== Top 7 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=skewb&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official Skewb Ranking Single]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
