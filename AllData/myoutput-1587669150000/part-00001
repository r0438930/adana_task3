They preceded the [[Anishinaabe]], the [[Sioux|Dakota]], and other Native American inhabitants. [[Fur trade]]rs from France arrived during the 17th century. Europeans moving west during the 19th century, drove out most of the Native Americans. [[Fort Snelling]], built to protect United States territorial interests, brought early settlers to the area.  Early settlers used [[Saint Anthony Falls]] for powering sawmills in the area that became [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], while others settled downriver in the area that became [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].\n\nMinnesota gained legal existence as the [[Minnesota Territory]] in 1849, and became [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|the 32nd U.S. state]] on May 11, 1858. After the upheaval of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Dakota War of 1862]], the state's economy started to develop when natural resources were tapped for logging and farming. Railroads attracted immigrants, established the farm economy, and brought goods to market. The power provided by St. Anthony Falls spurred the growth of Minneapolis, and the innovative milling methods gave it the title of the \"milling capital of the world\".\n\nNew industry came from iron ore, discovered in the north, mined relatively easily from [[open-pit mining|open pits]], and shipped to [[Great Lakes]] steel mills from the ports at [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]]. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The [[Great Depression]] brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but [[New Deal]] programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies [[Sperry Rand]], [[Control Data]] and [[Cray]].

When the Ojibwe signed a treaty ceding lands in 1837, Steele staked a claim to land on the east side of the Mississippi River adjacent to Saint Anthony Falls.  In 1848, he built a sawmill at the falls, and the community of Saint Anthony sprung up around the east side of the falls.  Steele told one of his employees, [[John H. Stevens]], that land on the west side of the falls would make a good site for future mills.  Since the land on the west side was still part of the military reservation, Stevens made a deal with Fort Snelling's commander.  Stevens would provide free ferry service across the river in exchange for a tract of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} at the head of the falls.  Stevens received the claim and built a house, the first house in Minneapolis, in 1850. In 1854, Stevens platted the city of Minneapolis on the west bank.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 70\u20131</ref>  Later, in 1872, Minneapolis absorbed the city of Saint Anthony.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 73</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] owes its existence to Fort Snelling.  A group of [[squatter]]s, mostly from the ill-fated [[Red River Colony]] in what is now the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]], established a camp near the fort.  The commandant of Fort Snelling, Major [[Joseph Plympton]], found their presence problematic because they were using timber and allowing their cattle and horses to graze around the fort.  Plympton banned lumbering and the construction of any new buildings on the military reservation land.  As a result, the squatters moved four miles downstream on the Mississippi River.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 99</ref> They settled at a site known as Fountain Cave.  This site was not quite far enough for the officers at the fort, so the squatters were forced out again. [[Pierre Parrant|Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant]], a popular [[moonshine]]r among the group, moved downriver and established a saloon, becoming the first European resident in the area that later became Saint Paul.  The squatters named their settlement \"Pig's Eye\" after Parrant.  The name was later changed to Lambert's Landing and then finally Saint Paul.  However, the earliest name for the area comes from a Native American colony ''Im-in-i-ja Ska'', meaning \"White Rock\" and referring to the limestone bluffs nearby.<ref name=\"pigseye\">{{cite web | last=Lareau | first = Paul J.| url=http://www.lareau.org/pep.html | title=Pig's Eye's Notepad | accessdate=2006-12-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006205241/http://www.lareau.org/pep.html |archivedate = October 6, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMinneapolis and Saint Paul are collectively known as the \"[[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]]\".  The cities enjoyed a rivalry during their early years, with Saint Paul being the capital city and Minneapolis becoming prominent through industry.  The term \"Twin Cities\" was coined around 1872, after a newspaper editorial suggested that Minneapolis could absorb Saint Paul.  Residents decided that the cities needed a separate identity, so people coined the phrase \"Dual Cities\", which later evolved into \"Twin Cities\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wcco.com/goodquestion/local_story_034144252.html|last=Tracy|first=Ben|title=Good Question:Why Are We Twins?|publisher=[[WCCO-TV]]|date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-03-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004716/http://wcco.com/goodquestion/local_story_034144252.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Today, Minneapolis is the largest city in Minnesota, with a population of 382,618 in the 2000 census.<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref>  Saint Paul is the second largest city, with a population of 287,151.

Loggers found the [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] especially valuable, and it was plentiful in the northeastern section of the state and in the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] valley.  Before railroads, lumbermen relied mostly on river transportation to bring logs to market, which made Minnesota's timber resources attractive.  Towns like [[Pine City, Minnesota|Pine City]], [[Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota|Marine on St. Croix]] and [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]] became important lumber centers fed by the St. Croix River, while [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]] was supplied lumber by areas in southern Minnesota and along the Minnesota River.

In 1846, he prevented Iowa from including [[Fort Snelling]] and Saint Anthony Falls within its northern border.  In 1847, he kept the organizers of [[Wisconsin]] from including Saint Paul and Saint Anthony Falls.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 62</ref>  The [[Minnesota Territory]] was established from the lands remaining from [[Iowa Territory]] and [[Wisconsin Territory]] on March 3, 1849. The Minnesota Territory extended far into what is now North Dakota and South Dakota, to the [[Missouri River]]. There was a dispute over the shape of the state to be carved out of Minnesota Territory. An alternate proposal that was only narrowly defeated would have made the 46th parallel the state's northern border and the Missouri River its western border, thus giving up the whole northern half of the state in exchange for the eastern half of what later became South Dakota.<ref>{{cite book| last = Meinig| first = D.W.| title = The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2: Continental America, 1800-1867| publisher = Yale University Press| year = 1993| location = New Haven, CT| page = 439| isbn = 0-300-05658-3 }}</ref>\n\nWith [[Alexander Ramsey]] [[Whig Party (United States)|(W)]] as the first governor of Minnesota Territory and [[Henry Hastings Sibley]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|(D)]] as the territorial delegate to the United States Congress, the populations of Saint Paul and Saint Anthony swelled. [[Henry Mower Rice|Henry M. Rice]] (D), who replaced Sibley as the territorial delegate in 1853, worked in Congress to promote Minnesota interests.  He lobbied for the construction of a railroad connecting Saint Paul and Lake Superior, with a link from Saint Paul to the [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]].<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 75</ref>\n\n===Statehood===\n{{main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nIn December 1856, Henry M Rice brought forward two bills in Congress: an [[enabling act]] that would allow Minnesota to form a state constitution, and a railroad land grant bill. Rice's enabling act defined a state containing both prairie and forest lands. The state was bounded on the south by Iowa, on the east by Wisconsin, on the north by Canada, and on the west by the [[Red River of the North]] and the [[Bois de Sioux River]], [[Lake Traverse]], [[Big Stone Lake]], and then a line extending due south to the Iowa border. Rice made this motion based on Minnesota's population growth.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 124</ref>\n\nAt the time, tensions between the northern and the southern United States were growing, in [[Origins of the American Civil War|a series of conflicts]] that eventually resulted in the American Civil War. There was little debate in the [[United States House of Representatives]], but when [[Stephen A. Douglas]] introduced the bill in the [[United States Senate]], it caused a firestorm of debate. Northerners saw their chance to add two senators to the side of the [[free state (United States)|free states]], while Southerners were sure that they would lose power. Many senators offered polite arguments that the population was too sparse and that statehood was premature. Senator [[John Burton Thompson]] of Kentucky, in particular, argued that new states would cost the government too much for roads, canals, forts, and lighthouses. Although Thompson and 21 other senators voted against statehood, the enabling act was passed on February 26, 1857.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 122\u20134</ref>\n\nAfter the enabling act was passed, territorial legislators had a difficult time writing a state constitution. A [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] was assembled in July 1857, but Republicans and Democrats were deeply divided. In fact, they formed two separate constitutional conventions and drafted two separate constitutions. Eventually, the two groups formed a conference committee and worked out a common constitution. The divisions continued, though, because Republicans refused to sign a document that had Democratic signatures on it, and vice versa. One copy of the constitution was written on white paper and signed only by Republicans, while the other copy was written on blue-tinged paper and signed by Democrats. These copies were signed on August 29, 1857. An election was called on October 13, 1857, where Minnesota residents would vote to approve or disapprove the constitution. The constitution was approved by 30,055 voters, while 571 rejected it.<ref name=\"sos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.mn.us/student/mncnote.html|title=Minnesota Secretary of State \u2013 History/Old Stuff|publisher=Minnesota Secretary of State|accessdate=2008-04-17|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515034658/http://www.sos.state.mn.us/student/mncnote.html|archivedate=2008-05-15}}</ref>\n\nThe state constitution was sent to the [[United States Congress]] for ratification in December 1857. The approval process was drawn out for several months while Congress debated over issues that had stemmed from the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Southerners had been arguing that the next state should be pro-slavery, so when Kansas submitted the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]], the Minnesota statehood bill was delayed. After that, Northerners feared that Minnesota's Democratic delegation would support slavery in Kansas. Finally, after the Kansas question was settled and after Congress decided how many representatives Minnesota would get in the House of Representatives, the bill passed.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 125\u20136</ref> The eastern half of the Minnesota Territory, under the boundaries defined by Henry Mower Rice, became the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj049101))|title=Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 35th Congress, 1st Session, Tuesday, May 11, 1858, p. 436.}}</ref> The western part remained unorganized until its incorporation into the [[Dakota Territory]] on March 2, 1861.\n\n==Civil War era and Dakota War of 1862==\n{{Hatnote|\"Minnesota in the American Civil War\" redirects here.}}\nMinnesota strongly supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] war effort, with about 22,000 Minnesotans serving.

The Dakota had signed the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]] and [[Treaty of Mendota]] in 1851 because they were concerned that without money from the United States government, they would starve, due to the loss of habitat of huntable game.  They were initially given a strip of land of ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north and south of the [[Minnesota River]], but they were later forced to sell the northern half of the land.  In 1862, crop failures left the Dakota with food shortages, and government money was delayed.  After four young Dakota men, searching for food, shot a family of white settlers near Acton, the Dakota leadership decided to continue the attacks in an effort to drive out the settlers.  Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], as well as in the surrounding farmlands, resulted in the deaths of at least 300 to 400 white settlers and government employees, causing panic in the settlements and provoking counterattacks by state militia and federal forces which spread throughout the [[Minnesota River|Minnesota River Valley]] and as far away as the [[Red River Valley]].<ref>Carley, Kenneth.

The movement grew out of his interest in cooperative farm associations following the end of the Civil War, and he established local Grange chapters in [[Elk River, Minnesota|Elk River]] and Saint Paul.  The organization worked to provide education on new farming methods, as well as to influence government and public opinion on matters important to farmers.  One of these areas of concern was the freight rates charged by the railroads and by the [[grain elevator]]s.  Since there was little or no competition between railroads serving Minnesota farm communities, railroads could charge as much as the traffic would bear.  By 1871, the situation was so heated that both the Republican and Democratic candidates in state elections promised to regulate railroad rates.  The state established an office of railroad commissioner and imposed maximum charges for shipping. [[populism|Populist]] [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] also served the Grange as an organizer.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 145\u20138</ref>\n\n[[Saint Anthony Falls]], the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis.  The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills.  In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain.  Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry.  Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling.  To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology.  They invented the [[middlings purifier]], a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process.  They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones.  A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the [[gluten]] with the [[starch]].  These improvements led to the production of \"patent\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \"bakers\" or \"clear\" flour, which it replaced.<ref>{{cite web| last =Hazen| first =Theodore R.| title =New Process Milling of 1850\u201370| publisher =Pond Lily Mill Restorations| url =http://www.angelfire.com/journal/millrestoration/newprocess.html| accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of [[General Mills]]) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry.

The [[Vermilion Range (Minnesota)|Vermilion Range]] was surveyed and mapped by a party financed by [[Charlemagne Tower]].  Another mining town, [[Ely, Minnesota|Ely]] began with the foundation of the Chandler Mine in 1888.  Soon after, the [[Mesabi Range]] was established when ore was found just under the surface of the ground in [[Mountain Iron, Minnesota|Mountain Iron]].  The Mesabi Range ultimately had much more ore than the Vermilion Range, and it was easy to extract because the ore was closer to the surface.  As a result, [[open-pit mining|open-pit mines]] became well-established on the Mesabi Range, with 111 mines operating by 1904.  To ship the iron ore to refineries, railroads such as the [[Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway]] were built from the iron ranges to [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] and Duluth on Lake Superior.  Large ore docks were used at these cities to load the iron ore onto ships for transport east on the [[Great Lakes]].

By 1900, the Twin Cities were becoming a center of commerce, led by the [[Minneapolis Grain Exchange]] and the foundation of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] with its ninth district in Minneapolis.  Many of the businessmen who had made money in the railroad, flour milling, and logging industries lived in the Twin Cities and personified the [[gilded age]]. They started to donate money for cultural institutions such as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (now the [[Minnesota Orchestra]]).  The parks of Minneapolis, under the direction of [[Theodore Wirth]] became famous, and the new [[Minnesota State Capitol]] building and the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Minnesota)|Cathedral of Saint Paul]] attracted attention to Saint Paul.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe role of government also grew during the early 20th century.  In the rural areas, most people obtained food and manufactured goods from neighbors and other people they knew personally.  As industry and commerce grew, goods such as food, materials, and medicines were no longer made by neighbors, but by large companies.  In response, citizens called on their government for consumer protection, inspection of goods, and regulation of public utilities.<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 173\u20134</ref>  The growth of the automobile spurred calls to develop roads and to enforce traffic laws.  The state officially started its trunk highway system in 1920, with the passage of the [[Babcock Amendment]] that established 70 [[Constitutional Route]]s around the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota's Constitutional Routes|url=http://www.steve-riner.com/mnhighways/conrtes.htm|last=Riner|first=Steve|year=2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> New regulation was necessary for banking and insurance. The safety of industrial workers and miners became an increasing concern, and brought about the [[workers' compensation]] system.  Since government was getting more complex, citizens demanded more of a role in their government, and became more politically active.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 174</ref>\n\n===Great Depression===\n[[Wilbur Foshay]], an owner of several utility companies, built the [[Foshay Tower]] in 1929, just before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].  The building was the tallest building in Minnesota at the time.  It remained [[List of tallest buildings in Minneapolis|the tallest building in Minneapolis]] until 1973, when the [[IDS Tower]] surpassed it.  The tower was a symbol of the wealth of the times, but when the stock market crashed, Foshay lost his fortune in the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/property_overview.cfm?propertyID=27|title=National Register of Historic Places \u2013 Foshay Tower|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=2007-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827164324/http://nrhp.mnhs.org/property_overview.cfm?PropertyID=27|archive-date=August 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] had several effects on Minnesota, with layoffs on the [[Iron Range]] and a drought in the [[Great Plains]] from 1931 through 1936.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 187</ref>  While the Depression had several causes, one most relevant to Minnesota was that United States businesses in the 1920s had improved their efficiency through standardizing production methods and eliminating waste.  Business owners were reaping the benefits of this increase in productivity, but they were not sharing it with their employees because of the weakness of [[organized labor]], nor were they sharing it with the public in the form of lowered prices.  Instead, the windfall went to stockholders.  The eventual result was that consumers could no longer afford the goods that factories were producing.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 190</ref>\n\n[[Floyd B. Olson]] of the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]] was elected as the governor in the 1930 election.  In his first term, he signed a bonding bill that authorized $15 million (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|15000000|1930|r=-7}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for highway construction, in an effort to provide work for the unemployed.  He also signed an executive order that provided for a minimum wage of 45 cents per hour for up to 48 hours weekly.  This effort predated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938 that established a nationwide minimum wage.  By 1932, with the Depression worsening, the Farmer-Labor Party platform was proposing a state income tax, a graduated tax on nationwide chain stores (such as [[J.C. Penney]] and [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]), low-interest farm loans, and a state unemployment insurance program.  The [[progressivism|progressive]] 1933 legislative session saw a comprehensive response to the depression including a moratorium on mortgage [[foreclosure]]s, a reduction in property taxes for farmers and homeowners, the state income tax, and chain store taxes, tavern reform, ratification of a [[child labor]] amendment, a state old-age pension system, and steps toward preserving the area that later became the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]].<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 190\u20134</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, formerly quiet labor unions began asserting themselves rather forcefully.  The [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934]] turned ugly, with the union demanding the right to speak for all trucking employees.  As a result of this strike and many others across the nation, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] passed the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935.  Government programs such as the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and [[Works Progress Administration]] brought much-needed work projects to the state.  Congress passed the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] in 1934, giving Minnesota's Ojibwa and Dakota tribes more autonomy over their own affairs.<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 192\u20133</ref>\n\n==Modern Minnesota==\n\n===Arts and culture===\nThe [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] was established in 1883. The present building, a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] structure, was opened in 1915, with additions in 1974 by [[Kenzo Tange]] and in 2006 by [[Michael Graves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsmia.org/index.php?section_id=7|title=About the Museum|publisher=Minneapolis Institute of Arts|accessdate=2006-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Minnesota Orchestra]] dates back to 1903 when it was founded as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. It was renamed the Minnesota Orchestra in 1968 and moved into its own building, [[Orchestra Hall (Minneapolis)|Orchestra Hall]], in downtown Minneapolis in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/about/index.cfm|title=About the MOA|publisher=Minnesota Orchestra|accessdate=2006-09-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823052738/http://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/about/index.cfm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2006-08-23}}</ref> The building has a modern look with a brick, glass, and steel exterior, in contrast to the old-world look of traditional concert halls.

In the 1940s, the museum shifted its focus toward modern art, after a gift from Mrs. Gilbert Walker made it possible to acquire works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], and others. The museum continued its focus on modern art with traveling shows in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.walkerart.org/about/history.wac|title=Walker Art Center \u2013 History|accessdate=2006-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130141416/http://info.walkerart.org/about/history.wac|archive-date=2011-11-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Guthrie Theater]], opened in 1963, was the brainchild of [[Sir Tyrone Guthrie]], who wanted to found a regional theater without the commercial constraints of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the ''New York Times'', and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx|title=Theater History|publisher=Guthrie Theater|accessdate=2006-09-24|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106133409/http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx |archivedate = January 6, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Minnesota in World War II===\n[[File:snellingbldgs.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the 400 structures at Fort Snelling began falling into disrepair after the fort closed in 1946.]]\nLike other U.S. States, Minnesota made its contributions to the effort of World War II in wartime manufacturing and other areas. The [[United States Navy]] contracted with [[Cargill]] to build ships after seeing their success in building ships and barges used to haul grain. Cargill built facilities in [[Savage, Minnesota]] on the south bank of the Minnesota River and turned out 18 refueling ships and four towboats in four years.  After the war, the Cargill facilities became a major grain shipping terminal.<ref name=\"savage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.savage.mn.us/CommunityProfile/History/history_ww2.html|title=Savage in World War II|publisher=City of Savage|accessdate=2006-12-30|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060924225344/http://www.ci.savage.mn.us/CommunityProfile/History/history_ww2.html |archivedate = September 24, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Honeywell]] built airplane control systems and periscope sights for submarines, and also developed a proximity fuse for [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] shells.  The United States government built the Twin Cities Ordnance Plant to produce munitions.  The plant employed 8,500 workers in 1941, and since there was a shortage of male workers during the war, more than half of the workers at the munitions plant were women.  The plant also employed nearly 1000 African American workers, as President Roosevelt had issued an executive order forbidding racial discrimination in defense industries.  Native American workers also found opportunities due to workforce shortages in wartime.\n\n<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 209\u201310</ref>\n\nSavage was also the home of [[Camp Savage]], a school designed to improve the foreign language skills of Japanese-American soldiers and to train them in military intelligence gathering.  The school was originally established in San Francisco, but moved to Minnesota after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]].  Eventually, the school outgrew its facilities in Savage and was moved to [[Fort Snelling]].<ref name=\"savage\"/>  Fort Snelling itself served a major role as a reception center for newly drafted recruits after the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]] was passed in 1940.  New recruits were given a physical exam and the Army General Qualification Test to determine their fitness for service in a particular branch.  The most intelligent recruits, about 37% of Minnesotans going through Fort Snelling, were assigned to the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]].  Recruits were also issued uniforms and sent from the fort to other training centers.  Over 300,000 recruits were processed through Fort Snelling during the World War II years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/people/mngg/investigate/fswwii.htm|title=Minnesota's Greatest Generation \u2013 Investigate Further \u2013 Fort Snelling's Last War|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Modern economy===\n{{Main|Economy of Minnesota}}\nAgriculture evolved from an individual occupation into a major industry after World War II.  Technological developments increased productivity on farms, such as automation of [[feedlot]]s for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings.  Planting also became more specialized with [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] of corn and wheat, fertilization, and mechanical equipment such as tractors and [[combine harvester|combines]] became the norm.  University of Minnesota professor [[Norman Borlaug]] contributed to this knowledge as part of the [[Green Revolution]].<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 196-8</ref> Large canneries such as the [[Green Giant|Minnesota Valley Canning Company]] fed the country from Minnesota's productive farmland.\n\nThe [[3M|Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company]] (3M) was founded in 1902 in [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]], and was later moved to Duluth, Saint Paul, and then [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]].  The founders of 3M got their start by manufacturing sandpaper.  Under the leadership of [[William L.

The University of Minnesota trained many computer specialists who decided to stay in the Minnesota rather than move to sunny California.

Misa, ''Digital State: The Story of Minnesota's Computing Industry'' (2013)</ref>\n\n===Postwar politics===\n{{See also|Politics of Minnesota}}\n\nHistorian Annette Atkins has explored the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics.  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms.  Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer-Labor party in the 1930s.  Isolationism was strong, Atkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s. In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened.  Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength.  Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where more than half of the people live. The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue.  State government has become much more friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship.  Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists. Atkins finds that:\n: What makes the North country valuable to conservationists is the seclusion, beauty, isolation, quiet, clear water, and absence of development.  The preservationists have tried to limit or prohibit roads, hydroelectric generators, sawmills and lumbering, resorts, power boats, airplanes, and snowmobiles\u2026.  The tensions between development and preservation, restraint and grows, beauty and jobs runs deep and strong.<ref>Annette Atkins, \"Minnesota\", in James H. Madison, ed., ''Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States'' (1988) pp 12-24, quote on 24</ref>\n\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey crop.jpg|thumb|right|Hubert Humphrey]]\n[[Hubert Humphrey]] was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]].  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]].  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 211\u20134</ref> Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]] encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.<ref name=\"timepieces42\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/42humphrey.html|title=History Topics: Hubert H.

In 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]] sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to [[Southern United States|southern]] segregationists who [[filibuster]]ed for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 219\u201321</ref> [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], and Humphrey became [[Vice President of the United States]].  Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|(DFL)]] appointed [[Walter Mondale]] to fill Humphrey's Senate seat.  Humphrey voiced doubts about the 1965 bombings of [[North Vietnam]], which alienated him from Johnson.  He later defended Johnson's conduct of the [[Vietnam War]], alienating himself from [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]], who were beginning to oppose the war around 1967.  In the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]], Humphrey ran against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[American Independent Party|Independent]] candidate [[George Wallace]] and lost the popular vote by only 0.7%.  Humphrey later returned to the Senate in 1971 after Eugene McCarthy left office.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 221\u20132</ref>\n\n[[Eugene McCarthy]] [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|(DFL)]] served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1949 through 1959 and in the United States Senate from 1959 through 1971.  He gained a reputation as an intellectual with strong convictions and integrity.  In 1967, he challenged Lyndon B. Johnson for the presidential nomination, running on an anti-war platform in contrast to Johnson's policies.  His strong support in the New Hampshire primary convinced Johnson to leave the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/49mccarthy.html|title=History Topics: Eugene McCarthy|accessdate=2006-09-24|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}</ref>\n\nDemocrat [[Walter Mondale]] also achieved national prominence as Vice President under [[Jimmy Carter]].  He served in the Senate from his appointment in 1964 until becoming Vice President in 1977.  In 1984, he ran for President of the United States, choosing [[Geraldine Ferraro]] as his running mate.

This achievement, dubbed the \"Minnesota Miracle\", was immensely popular.  In the next few years, the Legislature enacted other facets of their \"new liberalism\", including ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], strong environmental laws, increases in workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, and elimination of income taxes for the working poor.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 222\u20133</ref>  ''Time'' Magazine featured Wendell Anderson and the state in an article entitled, \"Minnesota: A State That Works\".<ref>{{cite news| title = Minnesota: A State That Works| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907665,00.html| work = Time Magazine| date = August 13, 1973| accessdate = 2007-01-31\n}} ([http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19730813,00.html see cover])</ref>  In 1976 when Mondale resigned his Senate seat to become Jimmy Carter's running mate, Anderson resigned the governor's seat and turned it over to Lieutenant Governor [[Rudy Perpich]] (DFL), who promptly appointed Anderson to fill Mondale's vacant Senate seat.

[[Minnesota]] achieved prominence through fur trading, logging, and farming, and later through railroads, and iron mining. While those industries remain important, the state's economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.\n\nThe earliest known settlers followed herds of large game to the region during the [[last glacial period]]. They preceded the [[Anishinaabe]], the [[Sioux|Dakota]], and other Native American inhabitants. [[Fur trade]]rs from France arrived during the 17th century. Europeans moving west during the 19th century, drove out most of the Native Americans. [[Fort Snelling]], built to protect United States territorial interests, brought early settlers to the area.  Early settlers used [[Saint Anthony Falls]] for powering sawmills in the area that became [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], while others settled downriver in the area that became [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].\n\nMinnesota gained legal existence as the [[Minnesota Territory]] in 1849, and became [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|the 32nd U.S. state]] on May 11, 1858. After the upheaval of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Dakota War of 1862]], the state's economy started to develop when natural resources were tapped for logging and farming. Railroads attracted immigrants, established the farm economy, and brought goods to market. The power provided by St. Anthony Falls spurred the growth of Minneapolis, and the innovative milling methods gave it the title of the \"milling capital of the world\".\n\nNew industry came from iron ore, discovered in the north, mined relatively easily from [[open-pit mining|open pits]], and shipped to [[Great Lakes]] steel mills from the ports at [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]]. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The [[Great Depression]] brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but [[New Deal]] programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies [[Sperry Rand]], [[Control Data]] and [[Cray]]. The [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] also became a regional center for the arts with cultural institutions such as the [[Guthrie Theater]], [[Minnesota Orchestra]], and the [[Walker Art Center]].\n\n==Native American inhabitation==\n[[File:SchumannCache.JPG|thumb|right|Some of the oldest stone tools found in Minnesota]]\nThe oldest known human remains in Minnesota, dating back about 9000 years ago, were discovered near [[Browns Valley, Minnesota|Browns Valley]] in 1933.  \"Browns Valley Man\" was found with tools of the [[Clovis Point|Clovis]] and [[Folsom point|Folsom]] types.<ref>{{cite book |last = Anfinson | first = Scott F. | title = Southwestern Minnesota Archaeology: 12,000 years in the Prairie Lakes Region | publisher = Minnesota Historical Society | year = 1997 | location = Saint Paul | pages = 30\u201332 | isbn = 0-87351-355-X }}</ref>  Some of the earliest evidence of a sustained presence in the area comes from a site known as [[Bradbury Brook]] near [[Mille Lacs Lake]] which was used around 7500 BC.<ref>{{cite web | title=TimePieces: Work Site| url=http://events.mnhs.org/TimePieces/EventDetail.cfm?EventID=577 | publisher=Minnesota Historical Society | accessdate=2007-02-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221115122/http://events.mnhs.org/Timepieces/EventDetail.cfm?EventID=577|archivedate=2007-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> Subsequently, extensive trading networks developed in the region.

This included what would become modern day Saint Paul but only part of Minneapolis, including the northeast, north-central and east-central portions of the state. The western portion of the state was part of the [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]] since the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]], in 1762. The wording of the treaty in the Minnesota area depended on landmarks reported by fur traders, who erroneously reported an \"Isle Phelipeaux\" in Lake Superior, a \"Long Lake\" west of the island, and the belief that the Mississippi River ran well into modern Canada.  Most of the state was purchased in 1803 from France as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  Parts of northern Minnesota were considered to be in [[Rupert's Land]]. The exact definition of the boundary between Minnesota and [[British North America]] was not addressed until the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which set the U.S.\u2013Canada border at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] west of the [[Lake of the Woods]] (except for a small chunk of land now dubbed the [[Northwest Angle]]).

Sandford|Dred Scott court case]].  Slaves Dred Scott and his wife were taken to the fort by their master, John Emerson.  They lived at the fort and elsewhere in territories where slavery was prohibited.  After Emerson's death, the Scotts argued that since they had lived in free territory, they were no longer slaves.  Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court sided against the Scotts.  Dred Scott Field, located just a short distance away in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]], is named in the memory of Fort Snelling's significance in one of the most important legal precedents in U.S. History.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 110</ref><ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 78\u20139</ref>\n\nBy 1851, treaties between Native American tribes and the U.S. government had opened much of Minnesota to settlement, so Fort Snelling no longer was a frontier outpost.  It served as a training center for soldiers during the [[American Civil War]] and later as the headquarters for the Department of Dakota.  A portion has been designated as [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]] where over 160,000 are interred. During World War II, the fort served as a training center for nearly 300,000 inductees.  After World War II, the fort was threatened with demolition due to the building of freeways [[Minnesota State Highway 5|Highway 5]] and [[Minnesota State Highway 55|Highway 55]], but citizens rallied to save it.  Fort Snelling is now a historic site operated by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]].<ref name=\"hfs\"/>\n\nFort Snelling was largely responsible for the establishment of the city of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].  In an effort to be self-sufficient, the soldiers of the fort built roads, planted crops, and built a [[grist mill]] and a sawmill at [[Saint Anthony Falls]].<ref name=\"hfs\"/>  Later, [[Franklin Steele]] came to Fort Snelling as the post [[sutler]] (the operator of the general store), and established interests in lumbering and other activities.  When the Ojibwe signed a treaty ceding lands in 1837, Steele staked a claim to land on the east side of the Mississippi River adjacent to Saint Anthony Falls.  In 1848, he built a sawmill at the falls, and the community of Saint Anthony sprung up around the east side of the falls.  Steele told one of his employees, [[John H. Stevens]], that land on the west side of the falls would make a good site for future mills.  Since the land on the west side was still part of the military reservation, Stevens made a deal with Fort Snelling's commander.  Stevens would provide free ferry service across the river in exchange for a tract of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} at the head of the falls.  Stevens received the claim and built a house, the first house in Minneapolis, in 1850. In 1854, Stevens platted the city of Minneapolis on the west bank.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 70\u20131</ref>  Later, in 1872, Minneapolis absorbed the city of Saint Anthony.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 73</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] owes its existence to Fort Snelling.  A group of [[squatter]]s, mostly from the ill-fated [[Red River Colony]] in what is now the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]], established a camp near the fort.  The commandant of Fort Snelling, Major [[Joseph Plympton]], found their presence problematic because they were using timber and allowing their cattle and horses to graze around the fort.  Plympton banned lumbering and the construction of any new buildings on the military reservation land.  As a result, the squatters moved four miles downstream on the Mississippi River.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 99</ref> They settled at a site known as Fountain Cave.  This site was not quite far enough for the officers at the fort, so the squatters were forced out again. [[Pierre Parrant|Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant]], a popular [[moonshine]]r among the group, moved downriver and established a saloon, becoming the first European resident in the area that later became Saint Paul.  The squatters named their settlement \"Pig's Eye\" after Parrant.  The name was later changed to Lambert's Landing and then finally Saint Paul.  However, the earliest name for the area comes from a Native American colony ''Im-in-i-ja Ska'', meaning \"White Rock\" and referring to the limestone bluffs nearby.<ref name=\"pigseye\">{{cite web | last=Lareau | first = Paul J.| url=http://www.lareau.org/pep.html | title=Pig's Eye's Notepad | accessdate=2006-12-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006205241/http://www.lareau.org/pep.html |archivedate = October 6, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMinneapolis and Saint Paul are collectively known as the \"[[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]]\".  The cities enjoyed a rivalry during their early years, with Saint Paul being the capital city and Minneapolis becoming prominent through industry.  The term \"Twin Cities\" was coined around 1872, after a newspaper editorial suggested that Minneapolis could absorb Saint Paul.  Residents decided that the cities needed a separate identity, so people coined the phrase \"Dual Cities\", which later evolved into \"Twin Cities\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wcco.com/goodquestion/local_story_034144252.html|last=Tracy|first=Ben|title=Good Question:Why Are We Twins?|publisher=[[WCCO-TV]]|date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-03-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004716/http://wcco.com/goodquestion/local_story_034144252.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Today, Minneapolis is the largest city in Minnesota, with a population of 382,618 in the 2000 census.<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref>  Saint Paul is the second largest city, with a population of 287,151.

Loggers found the [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] especially valuable, and it was plentiful in the northeastern section of the state and in the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] valley.  Before railroads, lumbermen relied mostly on river transportation to bring logs to market, which made Minnesota's timber resources attractive.

Rice's enabling act defined a state containing both prairie and forest lands. The state was bounded on the south by Iowa, on the east by Wisconsin, on the north by Canada, and on the west by the [[Red River of the North]] and the [[Bois de Sioux River]], [[Lake Traverse]], [[Big Stone Lake]], and then a line extending due south to the Iowa border. Rice made this motion based on Minnesota's population growth.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 124</ref>\n\nAt the time, tensions between the northern and the southern United States were growing, in [[Origins of the American Civil War|a series of conflicts]] that eventually resulted in the American Civil War. There was little debate in the [[United States House of Representatives]], but when [[Stephen A. Douglas]] introduced the bill in the [[United States Senate]], it caused a firestorm of debate. Northerners saw their chance to add two senators to the side of the [[free state (United States)|free states]], while Southerners were sure that they would lose power. Many senators offered polite arguments that the population was too sparse and that statehood was premature. Senator [[John Burton Thompson]] of Kentucky, in particular, argued that new states would cost the government too much for roads, canals, forts, and lighthouses. Although Thompson and 21 other senators voted against statehood, the enabling act was passed on February 26, 1857.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 122\u20134</ref>\n\nAfter the enabling act was passed, territorial legislators had a difficult time writing a state constitution. A [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] was assembled in July 1857, but Republicans and Democrats were deeply divided. In fact, they formed two separate constitutional conventions and drafted two separate constitutions. Eventually, the two groups formed a conference committee and worked out a common constitution. The divisions continued, though, because Republicans refused to sign a document that had Democratic signatures on it, and vice versa. One copy of the constitution was written on white paper and signed only by Republicans, while the other copy was written on blue-tinged paper and signed by Democrats. These copies were signed on August 29, 1857. An election was called on October 13, 1857, where Minnesota residents would vote to approve or disapprove the constitution. The constitution was approved by 30,055 voters, while 571 rejected it.<ref name=\"sos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.mn.us/student/mncnote.html|title=Minnesota Secretary of State \u2013 History/Old Stuff|publisher=Minnesota Secretary of State|accessdate=2008-04-17|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515034658/http://www.sos.state.mn.us/student/mncnote.html|archivedate=2008-05-15}}</ref>\n\nThe state constitution was sent to the [[United States Congress]] for ratification in December 1857. The approval process was drawn out for several months while Congress debated over issues that had stemmed from the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Southerners had been arguing that the next state should be pro-slavery, so when Kansas submitted the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]], the Minnesota statehood bill was delayed. After that, Northerners feared that Minnesota's Democratic delegation would support slavery in Kansas. Finally, after the Kansas question was settled and after Congress decided how many representatives Minnesota would get in the House of Representatives, the bill passed.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 125\u20136</ref> The eastern half of the Minnesota Territory, under the boundaries defined by Henry Mower Rice, became the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj049101))|title=Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 35th Congress, 1st Session, Tuesday, May 11, 1858, p. 436.}}</ref> The western part remained unorganized until its incorporation into the [[Dakota Territory]] on March 2, 1861.\n\n==Civil War era and Dakota War of 1862==\n{{Hatnote|\"Minnesota in the American Civil War\" redirects here.}}\nMinnesota strongly supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] war effort, with about 22,000 Minnesotans serving.

The Dakota had signed the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]] and [[Treaty of Mendota]] in 1851 because they were concerned that without money from the United States government, they would starve, due to the loss of habitat of huntable game.  They were initially given a strip of land of ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north and south of the [[Minnesota River]], but they were later forced to sell the northern half of the land.  In 1862, crop failures left the Dakota with food shortages, and government money was delayed.  After four young Dakota men, searching for food, shot a family of white settlers near Acton, the Dakota leadership decided to continue the attacks in an effort to drive out the settlers.  Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], as well as in the surrounding farmlands, resulted in the deaths of at least 300 to 400 white settlers and government employees, causing panic in the settlements and provoking counterattacks by state militia and federal forces which spread throughout the [[Minnesota River|Minnesota River Valley]] and as far away as the [[Red River Valley]].<ref>Carley, Kenneth.

The organization worked to provide education on new farming methods, as well as to influence government and public opinion on matters important to farmers.  One of these areas of concern was the freight rates charged by the railroads and by the [[grain elevator]]s.  Since there was little or no competition between railroads serving Minnesota farm communities, railroads could charge as much as the traffic would bear.  By 1871, the situation was so heated that both the Republican and Democratic candidates in state elections promised to regulate railroad rates.  The state established an office of railroad commissioner and imposed maximum charges for shipping. [[populism|Populist]] [[Ignatius L.

The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills.  In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain.  Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry.  Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling.  To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology.  They invented the [[middlings purifier]], a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process.  They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones.  A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the [[gluten]] with the [[starch]].  These improvements led to the production of \"patent\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \"bakers\" or \"clear\" flour, which it replaced.<ref>{{cite web| last =Hazen| first =Theodore R.| title =New Process Milling of 1850\u201370| publisher =Pond Lily Mill Restorations| url =http://www.angelfire.com/journal/millrestoration/newprocess.html| accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of [[General Mills]]) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry.

The [[Vermilion Range (Minnesota)|Vermilion Range]] was surveyed and mapped by a party financed by [[Charlemagne Tower]].  Another mining town, [[Ely, Minnesota|Ely]] began with the foundation of the Chandler Mine in 1888.  Soon after, the [[Mesabi Range]] was established when ore was found just under the surface of the ground in [[Mountain Iron, Minnesota|Mountain Iron]].  The Mesabi Range ultimately had much more ore than the Vermilion Range, and it was easy to extract because the ore was closer to the surface.  As a result, [[open-pit mining|open-pit mines]] became well-established on the Mesabi Range, with 111 mines operating by 1904.  To ship the iron ore to refineries, railroads such as the [[Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway]] were built from the iron ranges to [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] and Duluth on Lake Superior.  Large ore docks were used at these cities to load the iron ore onto ships for transport east on the [[Great Lakes]].  The mining industry helped to propel Duluth from a small town to a large, thriving city.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 184\u201395</ref>  In 1904, iron was discovered in the [[Cuyuna Range]] in [[Crow Wing County, Minnesota|Crow Wing County]].  Between 1904 and 1984, when mining ceased, more than 106&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons of ore were mined.  Iron from the Cuyuna Range also contained significant proportions of [[manganese]], increasing its value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.umn.edu/mgs/cuyuna/cuyuna.html|title=The Cuyuna Iron Range \u2013 Geology and Mineralogy|work=Minnesota Geological Survey|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=2006-07-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715120103/http://www.geo.umn.edu/mgs/cuyuna/cuyuna.html|archivedate=2006-07-15}}</ref>\n\n===Mayo Clinic===\n[[File:BronzeWilliamWorrallMayo.JPG|thumb|right|210px|Statue of Dr. William Worrall Mayo near the Mayo Clinic in Rochester]]\nDr. [[William Worrall Mayo]], the founder of the [[Mayo Clinic]], emigrated from [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], United Kingdom to the United States in 1846 and became a [[medical doctor]] in 1850.

Dr. W. W. Mayo worked with nuns from the [[Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota|Sisters of St. Francis]] to treat the survivors. After the disaster, Mother [[Alfred Moes]] and Dr. Mayo recognized the need for a hospital and joined together to build the 27-bed [[Saint Marys Hospital (Rochester)|Saint Marys Hospital]] which opened in 1889.  The hospital, with over 1100 beds, is now part of the Mayo Clinic, which grew out of the practice of William Worrall Mayo and his sons, [[William James Mayo]] (1861\u20131939) and [[Charles Horace Mayo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tradition-heritage/tornado-saint-marys.html|title=Tornado Strikes Rochester \u2013 Saint Marys Hospital Opens|publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]]|accessdate=2012-12-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619072004/http://www.mayoclinic.org/tradition-heritage/tornado-saint-marys.html|archivedate=2012-06-19}}</ref> Dr. [[Henry Stanley Plummer]] joined the Mayo Brothers' practice in 1901.

By 1900, the Twin Cities were becoming a center of commerce, led by the [[Minneapolis Grain Exchange]] and the foundation of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] with its ninth district in Minneapolis.  Many of the businessmen who had made money in the railroad, flour milling, and logging industries lived in the Twin Cities and personified the [[gilded age]]. They started to donate money for cultural institutions such as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (now the [[Minnesota Orchestra]]).  The parks of Minneapolis, under the direction of [[Theodore Wirth]] became famous, and the new [[Minnesota State Capitol]] building and the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Minnesota)|Cathedral of Saint Paul]] attracted attention to Saint Paul.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe role of government also grew during the early 20th century.  In the rural areas, most people obtained food and manufactured goods from neighbors and other people they knew personally.  As industry and commerce grew, goods such as food, materials, and medicines were no longer made by neighbors, but by large companies.  In response, citizens called on their government for consumer protection, inspection of goods, and regulation of public utilities.<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 173\u20134</ref>  The growth of the automobile spurred calls to develop roads and to enforce traffic laws.  The state officially started its trunk highway system in 1920, with the passage of the [[Babcock Amendment]] that established 70 [[Constitutional Route]]s around the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota's Constitutional Routes|url=http://www.steve-riner.com/mnhighways/conrtes.htm|last=Riner|first=Steve|year=2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> New regulation was necessary for banking and insurance. The safety of industrial workers and miners became an increasing concern, and brought about the [[workers' compensation]] system.  Since government was getting more complex, citizens demanded more of a role in their government, and became more politically active.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 174</ref>\n\n===Great Depression===\n[[Wilbur Foshay]], an owner of several utility companies, built the [[Foshay Tower]] in 1929, just before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].  The building was the tallest building in Minnesota at the time.  It remained [[List of tallest buildings in Minneapolis|the tallest building in Minneapolis]] until 1973, when the [[IDS Tower]] surpassed it.  The tower was a symbol of the wealth of the times, but when the stock market crashed, Foshay lost his fortune in the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/property_overview.cfm?propertyID=27|title=National Register of Historic Places \u2013 Foshay Tower|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=2007-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827164324/http://nrhp.mnhs.org/property_overview.cfm?PropertyID=27|archive-date=August 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] had several effects on Minnesota, with layoffs on the [[Iron Range]] and a drought in the [[Great Plains]] from 1931 through 1936.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 187</ref>  While the Depression had several causes, one most relevant to Minnesota was that United States businesses in the 1920s had improved their efficiency through standardizing production methods and eliminating waste.  Business owners were reaping the benefits of this increase in productivity, but they were not sharing it with their employees because of the weakness of [[organized labor]], nor were they sharing it with the public in the form of lowered prices.  Instead, the windfall went to stockholders.  The eventual result was that consumers could no longer afford the goods that factories were producing.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 190</ref>\n\n[[Floyd B. Olson]] of the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]] was elected as the governor in the 1930 election.  In his first term, he signed a bonding bill that authorized $15 million (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|15000000|1930|r=-7}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for highway construction, in an effort to provide work for the unemployed.  He also signed an executive order that provided for a minimum wage of 45 cents per hour for up to 48 hours weekly.  This effort predated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938 that established a nationwide minimum wage.  By 1932, with the Depression worsening, the Farmer-Labor Party platform was proposing a state income tax, a graduated tax on nationwide chain stores (such as [[J.C. Penney]] and [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]), low-interest farm loans, and a state unemployment insurance program.  The [[progressivism|progressive]] 1933 legislative session saw a comprehensive response to the depression including a moratorium on mortgage [[foreclosure]]s, a reduction in property taxes for farmers and homeowners, the state income tax, and chain store taxes, tavern reform, ratification of a [[child labor]] amendment, a state old-age pension system, and steps toward preserving the area that later became the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]].<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 190\u20134</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, formerly quiet labor unions began asserting themselves rather forcefully.  The [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934]] turned ugly, with the union demanding the right to speak for all trucking employees.  As a result of this strike and many others across the nation, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] passed the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935.  Government programs such as the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and [[Works Progress Administration]] brought much-needed work projects to the state.  Congress passed the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] in 1934, giving Minnesota's Ojibwa and Dakota tribes more autonomy over their own affairs.<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 192\u20133</ref>\n\n==Modern Minnesota==\n\n===Arts and culture===\nThe [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] was established in 1883.

In the 1940s, the museum shifted its focus toward modern art, after a gift from Mrs. Gilbert Walker made it possible to acquire works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], and others.

The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the ''New York Times'', and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx|title=Theater History|publisher=Guthrie Theater|accessdate=2006-09-24|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106133409/http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx |archivedate = January 6, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Minnesota in World War II===\n[[File:snellingbldgs.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the 400 structures at Fort Snelling began falling into disrepair after the fort closed in 1946.]]\nLike other U.S. States, Minnesota made its contributions to the effort of World War II in wartime manufacturing and other areas. The [[United States Navy]] contracted with [[Cargill]] to build ships after seeing their success in building ships and barges used to haul grain.

The United States government built the Twin Cities Ordnance Plant to produce munitions.  The plant employed 8,500 workers in 1941, and since there was a shortage of male workers during the war, more than half of the workers at the munitions plant were women.  The plant also employed nearly 1000 African American workers, as President Roosevelt had issued an executive order forbidding racial discrimination in defense industries.  Native American workers also found opportunities due to workforce shortages in wartime.\n\n<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 209\u201310</ref>\n\nSavage was also the home of [[Camp Savage]], a school designed to improve the foreign language skills of Japanese-American soldiers and to train them in military intelligence gathering.  The school was originally established in San Francisco, but moved to Minnesota after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]].  Eventually, the school outgrew its facilities in Savage and was moved to [[Fort Snelling]].<ref name=\"savage\"/>  Fort Snelling itself served a major role as a reception center for newly drafted recruits after the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]] was passed in 1940.  New recruits were given a physical exam and the Army General Qualification Test to determine their fitness for service in a particular branch.  The most intelligent recruits, about 37% of Minnesotans going through Fort Snelling, were assigned to the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]].  Recruits were also issued uniforms and sent from the fort to other training centers.

Misa, ''Digital State: The Story of Minnesota's Computing Industry'' (2013)</ref>\n\n===Postwar politics===\n{{See also|Politics of Minnesota}}\n\nHistorian Annette Atkins has explored the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics.  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms.  Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer-Labor party in the 1930s.  Isolationism was strong, Atkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s. In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened.  Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength.  Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where more than half of the people live. The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue.  State government has become much more friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship.  Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists. Atkins finds that:\n: What makes the North country valuable to conservationists is the seclusion, beauty, isolation, quiet, clear water, and absence of development.  The preservationists have tried to limit or prohibit roads, hydroelectric generators, sawmills and lumbering, resorts, power boats, airplanes, and snowmobiles\u2026.  The tensions between development and preservation, restraint and grows, beauty and jobs runs deep and strong.<ref>Annette Atkins, \"Minnesota\", in James H. Madison, ed., ''Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States'' (1988) pp 12-24, quote on 24</ref>\n\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey crop.jpg|thumb|right|Hubert Humphrey]]\n[[Hubert Humphrey]] was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]].  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]].  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 211\u20134</ref> Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]] encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.<ref name=\"timepieces42\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/42humphrey.html|title=History Topics: Hubert H.

In 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]] sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to [[Southern United States|southern]] segregationists who [[filibuster]]ed for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 219\u201321</ref> [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], and Humphrey became [[Vice President of the United States]].  Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|(DFL)]] appointed [[Walter Mondale]] to fill Humphrey's Senate seat.  Humphrey voiced doubts about the 1965 bombings of [[North Vietnam]], which alienated him from Johnson.  He later defended Johnson's conduct of the [[Vietnam War]], alienating himself from [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]], who were beginning to oppose the war around 1967.  In the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]], Humphrey ran against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[American Independent Party|Independent]] candidate [[George Wallace]] and lost the popular vote by only 0.7%.  Humphrey later returned to the Senate in 1971 after Eugene McCarthy left office.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 221\u20132</ref>\n\n[[Eugene McCarthy]] [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|(DFL)]] served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1949 through 1959 and in the United States Senate from 1959 through 1971.  He gained a reputation as an intellectual with strong convictions and integrity.  In 1967, he challenged Lyndon B. Johnson for the presidential nomination, running on an anti-war platform in contrast to Johnson's policies.  His strong support in the New Hampshire primary convinced Johnson to leave the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/49mccarthy.html|title=History Topics: Eugene McCarthy|accessdate=2006-09-24|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}</ref>\n\nDemocrat [[Walter Mondale]] also achieved national prominence as Vice President under [[Jimmy Carter]].  He served in the Senate from his appointment in 1964 until becoming Vice President in 1977.  In 1984, he ran for President of the United States, choosing [[Geraldine Ferraro]] as his running mate.

He spent two years working with a split [[Minnesota Legislature]] to enact a tax and school finance reform package that shifted the source of public education funding from local property taxes to state sales taxes, as well as adding [[excise]] taxes to liquor and cigarettes.  This achievement, dubbed the \"Minnesota Miracle\", was immensely popular.  In the next few years, the Legislature enacted other facets of their \"new liberalism\", including ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], strong environmental laws, increases in workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, and elimination of income taxes for the working poor.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 222\u20133</ref>  ''Time'' Magazine featured Wendell Anderson and the state in an article entitled, \"Minnesota: A State That Works\".<ref>{{cite news| title = Minnesota: A State That Works| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907665,00.html| work = Time Magazine| date = August 13, 1973| accessdate = 2007-01-31\n}} ([http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19730813,00.html see cover])</ref>  In 1976 when Mondale resigned his Senate seat to become Jimmy Carter's running mate, Anderson resigned the governor's seat and turned it over to Lieutenant Governor [[Rudy Perpich]] (DFL), who promptly appointed Anderson to fill Mondale's vacant Senate seat.  Voters turned Perpich and Anderson out of office in 1978, in an election dubbed the \"Minnesota Massacre\". Perpich was again elected as governor in 1983 and served until 1991.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 225</ref>\n\n[[Paul Wellstone]] (DFL) was elected to the United States Senate in 1990, defeating incumbent [[Rudy Boschwitz]] (R) in one of the biggest election upsets of the decade.  In 1996, he defeated Boschwitz again in a rematch of the 1990 election.  Wellstone was known for being a liberal activist, as evidenced by his books ''How the Rural Poor Got Power: Narrative of a Grassroots Organizer'', describing his work with the group Organization for a Better Rice County, and ''The Conscience of a Liberal: Reclaiming the Compassionate Agenda''.  He explored a possible presidential bid in 1998, telling people he represented the \"Democratic wing of the Democratic Party\".<ref>{{cite web| title = Former Vermont Gov.
