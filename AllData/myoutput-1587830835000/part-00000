The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband who also used to be a prankster, known as \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\". He was cured of pranking by school counselor, Mrs. Murphy.\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife. She knows nothing about her husband's past as a prankster.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable. She blames her younger brother Andy for almost everything. She finds his pranks childish and unfunny.\n* '''Spank Larkin''': Andy's fat and lazy dog. Spank frequently yawns, especially after going for a walk.\n\n===Recurring/minor characters===\n* '''Teri''': Jen's best friend.\n* '''Jervis Coltrane''': A French snob who has a crush on Lori Mackney and dreams of being the Prime Minister of Canada.\n* '''Peter Lik and Andrew Leech''': Peter and Andrew are Andy's and Danny's nemeses. They are usually referred to as Lik and Leech.\n* '''Craig Bennett''': Jen's crush and one of the best athletes of East Gackle.\n* '''Martin Bonwick''': He is a stereotypically nervous nerd who very often gets bullied.\n* '''Victor \"Vic\" Muskowitz (Mush)''': The pizza delivery man of East Gackle who is a good friend of Andy and Danny and he sometimes helps them with pranks.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Jr.''': A dumb police officer who is the incompetent son of Steve Rowgee Sr.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Sr.''': A police officer who is an old man, who always commands Steve Rowgee Jr. (his son) and is nicknamed the Iron Fisted Maniac.\n* '''Principal DeRosa''': He is the bad-tempered principal of the school in East Gackle and the main antagonist who is obsessed with punishing Andy.\n* '''Mr. Hutchins''': One of the many teachers at East Gackle school, Andy likes to prank him more than the other teachers.\n* '''Mayor Henry K. Roth''': The mayor of East Gackle.\n* '''Mayor Simms''': Mayor of West Gackle and Mayor Henry K. Roth's rival.\n* '''Clyde''': The janitor of the school.\n* '''Hazel Strinner''': She has a crush on Andy and Lori's protecting friend.\n* '''Louella Berman''': Frieda's best friend.\n* '''Mrs. Wibbles''': Principal DeRosa's secretary.\n* '''Norman Larkin''': Andy's grandfather and Al's father who is also a prankster, implying that the male side of the Larkin family comes from a long line of pranksters, apparently with the exception of Al, though several hints have been given that he is also a prankster, even greater than his son or father.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Voice actors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband and presumably \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable. She blames her younger brother Andy for almost everything. She finds his pranks childish and unfunny.\n* '''Spank Larkin''': Andy's fat and lazy dog. Spank frequently yawns, especially after going for a walk.\n\n===Recurring/minor characters===\n* '''Teri''': Jen's best friend.\n* '''Jervis Coltrane''': A French snob who has a crush on Lori Mackney and dreams of being the Prime Minister of Canada.\n* '''Peter Lik and Andrew Leech''': Peter and Andrew are Andy's and Danny's nemeses. They are usually referred to as Lik and Leech.\n* '''Craig Bennett''': Jen's crush and one of the best athletes of East Gackle.\n* '''Martin Bonwick''': He is a stereotypically nervous nerd who very often gets bullied.\n* '''Victor \"Vic\" Muskowitz (Mush)''': The pizza delivery man of East Gackle who is a good friend of Andy and Danny and he sometimes helps them with pranks.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Jr.''': A dumb police officer who is the incompetent son of Steve Rowgee Sr.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Sr.''': A police officer who is an old man, who always commands Steve Rowgee Jr. (his son) and is nicknamed the Iron Fisted Maniac.\n* '''Principal DeRosa''': He is the bad-tempered principal of the school in East Gackle and the main antagonist who is obsessed with punishing Andy.\n* '''Mr. Hutchins''': One of the many teachers at East Gackle school, Andy likes to prank him more than the other teachers.\n* '''Mayor Henry K. Roth''': The mayor of East Gackle.\n* '''Mayor Simms''': Mayor of West Gackle and Mayor Henry K. Roth's rival.\n* '''Clyde''': The janitor of the school.\n* '''Hazel Strinner''': She has a crush on Andy and Lori's protecting friend.\n* '''Louella Berman''': Frieda's best friend.\n* '''Mrs. Wibbles''': Principal DeRosa's secretary.\n* '''Norman Larkin''': Andy's grandfather and Al's father who is also a prankster, implying that the male side of the Larkin family comes from a long line of pranksters, apparently with the exception of Al, though several hints have been given that he is also a prankster, even greater than his son or father.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Voice actors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!
