The North East coastal towns of England were particularly hard hit by Zeppelins during 1915 and 1916,<ref>Morris, pp 178\u201385.</ref> and by mid-1916, the East Riding and [[North Riding Fortress Royal Engineers|North Riding Fortress Engineers]] had combined to provide the personnel for '''No 3 (Yorkshire) AA Company, RE'''. Later a barrage line of lights was organised up the East Coast with the East Riding Fortress Engineers providing  '''No 39 AA Company''' at [[North Killingholme|Killingholme]], while Hull was protected by No 38 AA Company and East Riding personnel guarding [[Sheffield]] were relieved by No 40 AA Company, both manned by the [[Tyne Electrical Engineers]]. By May 1918 this formed part of Northern Air Defences (NAD). At this stage of the war the NAD was barely troubled by German raids, and most of the men of medical category A1 had been withdrawn from the AA defences and sent to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]<ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 128, 131, 139, 143, 151.</ref> All TF units were demobilised in 1919 after the [[Armistice with Germany]].\n\n==Interwar==\nThe East Riding (Fortress) Engineers, consisting of No 1 (Works) and Nos 2 and 3 (Lights) Companies, was reformed in the renamed [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) in 1920, forming part of North Eastern Coastal Defences in [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Area]], with its HQ still at Colonial St, Hull. However, by 1939 it had been reduced to a single Electric Light and Works company.<ref>''Titles and Designations'', 1927.</ref><ref>''Monthly Army List'', May 1939.</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 105.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Mobilisation===\nThe East Riding Fortress Engineers were mobilised in the Humber Coast defences on 3 September 1939. Some time after December 1941 the unit was converted into '''542nd Electrical and Mechanical Company, RE'''. Whereas the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (formed in 1942) maintained vehicles and complex weapons and equipment, the RE's E&M companies worked with heavy electrical engineering plant, such as generators and pumps. In December 1942 the company landed in North Africa with [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] ([[Operation Torch]]), transferring to [[Allied Forces Headquarters]] in February 1943. Later in the year it moved to Italy.<ref name = W&R169>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 169, 186.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nDuring the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] the re-establishment of electric power supplies was critical. Power stations in the south of the country were quickly captured intact, but north of [[Naples]] and [[Foggia]] the Germans had destroyed everything to do with electricity supply: power stations, sub-stations, hydro-electric dam sluices, transmission lines and pylons were all wrecked. Repair was a collaborative effort of the British Royal Engineers and [[Royal Navy]] with US and Italian engineers, under an Electric Power Committee set up in December 1943. Once the Allies reached Rome in mid-1944 they discovered that less than 10 per cent of the 800,000&nbsp;kW generating capacity of central Italy was in working order. Over the succeeding months 542nd E&M Company was engaged in re-establishing transmission lines, alongside 540th (formerly the [[Renfrewshire Fortress Royal Engineers|Renfrewshire Fortress Engineers]]), 541st (formerly the North Riding Fortress Engineers), 543rd and 544th (Palestinian) E&M Companies.<ref>Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 30, 73\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe company was disbanded after September 1945.<ref name = W&R169/>\n\n==Postwar==\nWhen the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the East Riding Fortress Engineers were reformed as '''542 (East Riding) Construction Squadron''' in [[North Riding Fortress Royal Engineers|118 Construction Regiment]] (itself descended from the North Riding Fortress Engineers).<ref name = W&R294>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 294, 296.</ref><ref name=542on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-engineers/squadrons-337-to-575.html 337\u2013575 RE Sqns at British Army 1945 on.]</ref><ref name=118on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-engineers/regiments-118-432-territorial-army.html 118\u2013432 RE Rgts at British Army 1945 on.]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051118222359/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vengr/yn-tees.htm North Riding Fortress Engineers at Regiments.org.]</ref>\n\nWhen the TA was reorganised in 1961, 542 Sqn was transferred as a field squadron to 129 Corps Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R294/><ref name = 542on/><ref name = 118on/> Then when the TA was converted into the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|TAVR]] in 1967, 129 Regt was reduced to a single [[East Riding Royal Garrison Artillery#422 .28East Riding Coast.29 Squadron|129 (East Riding) Field Squadron]] based at Hull, and included in a new 72 ([[Tyne Electrical Engineers]]) Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R314>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 314\u20135.</ref>\n<ref name = Sappers>[http://www.sappers.co.uk/squadrons/ta-72-engineer-regt-volunteers 72 Engineer Rgt at Sappers site.]</ref><ref name=Regts72>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126065713/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/engr72.htm 72 Engineer Rgt at Regiments.org]</ref> In 1977 the squadron was transferred again, this time to 73 Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R314/><ref name = Sappers/><ref name = Regts72/><ref name=Regts73>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051227044404/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/engr73.htm 73 Engineer Rgt at Regiments.org]</ref> Finally, it was broken up in April 1991, with part going to the Humber Artillery Company of 2nd Battalion [[Yorkshire Volunteers]], and part to [[131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers]].<ref name = W&R314/><ref name = Regts73/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126064353/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/varty/ye-n2.htm Humber Artillery at Regiments.org]</ref>\n\n129 Field Sqn was reformed in April 2006, but disbanded again in 2014 under the 'Army 2020' proposals, when 73 Engineer Rgt was reduced to a single squadron.<ref name = W&R314/>\n\n==Prominent members==\n* The Scottish archaeologist [[Charles S.

The North East coastal towns of England were particularly hard hit by Zeppelins during 1915 and 1916,<ref>Morris, pp 178\u201385.</ref> and by mid-1916, the East Riding and [[North Riding Fortress Royal Engineers|North Riding Fortress Engineers]] had combined to provide the personnel for '''No 3 (Yorkshire) AA Company, RE'''. Later a barrage line of lights was organised up the East Coast with the East Riding Fortress Engineers providing  '''No 39 AA Company''' at [[North Killingholme|Killingholme]], while Hull was protected by No 38 AA Company and East Riding personnel guarding [[Sheffield]] were relieved by No 40 AA Company, both manned by the [[Tyne Electrical Engineers]]. By May 1918 this formed part of Northern Air Defences (NAD). At this stage of the war the NAD was barely troubled by German raids, and most of the men of medical category A1 had been withdrawn from the AA defences and sent to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]<ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 128, 131, 139, 143, 151.</ref> All TF units were demobilised in 1919 after the [[Armistice with Germany]].\n\n==Interwar==\nThe East Riding (Fortress) Engineers, consisting of No 1 (Works) and Nos 2 and 3 (Lights) Companies, was reformed in the renamed [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) in 1920, forming part of North Eastern Coastal Defences in [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Area]], with its HQ still at Colonial St, Hull. However, by 1939 it had been reduced to a single Electric Light and Works company.<ref>''Titles and Designations'', 1927.</ref><ref>''Monthly Army List'', May 1939.</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 105.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Mobilisation===\nThe East Riding Fortress Engineers were mobilised in the Humber Coast defences on 3 September 1939. Some time after December 1941 the unit was converted into '''542nd Electrical and Mechanical Company, RE'''. Whereas the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (formed in 1942) maintained vehicles and complex weapons and equipment, the RE's E&M companies worked with heavy electrical engineering plant, such as generators and pumps. In December 1942 the company landed in North Africa with [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] ([[Operation Torch]]), transferring to [[Allied Forces Headquarters]] in February 1943. Later in the year it moved to Italy.<ref name = W&R169>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 169, 186.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nDuring the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] the re-establishment of electric power supplies was critical. Power stations in the south of the country were quickly captured intact, but north of [[Naples]] and [[Foggia]] the Germans had destroyed everything to do with electricity supply: power stations, sub-stations, hydro-electric dam sluices, transmission lines and pylons were all wrecked. Repair was a collaborative effort of the British Royal Engineers and [[Royal Navy]] with US and Italian engineers, under an Electric Power Committee set up in December 1943. Once the Allies reached Rome in mid-1944 they discovered that less than 10 per cent of the 800,000&nbsp;kW generating capacity of central Italy was in working order. Over the succeeding months 542nd E&M Company was engaged in re-establishing transmission lines, alongside 540th (formerly the [[Renfrewshire Fortress Royal Engineers|Renfrewshire Fortress Engineers]]), 541st (formerly the North Riding Fortress Engineers), 543rd and 544th (Palestinian) E&M Companies.<ref>Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 30, 73\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe company was disbanded after September 1945.<ref name = W&R169/>\n\n==Postwar==\nWhen the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the East Riding Fortress Engineers were reformed as '''542 (East Riding) Construction Squadron''' in [[North Riding Fortress Royal Engineers|118 Construction Regiment]] (itself descended from the North Riding Fortress Engineers).<ref name = W&R294>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 294, 296.</ref><ref name=542on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-engineers/squadrons-337-to-575.html 337\u2013575 RE Sqns at British Army 1945 on.]</ref><ref name=118on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-engineers/regiments-118-432-territorial-army.html 118\u2013432 RE Rgts at British Army 1945 on.]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051118222359/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vengr/yn-tees.htm North Riding Fortress Engineers at Regiments.org.]</ref>\n\nWhen the TA was reorganised in 1961, 542 Sqn was transferred as a field squadron to 129 Corps Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R294/><ref name = 542on/><ref name = 118on/> Then when the TA was converted into the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|TAVR]] in 1967, 129 Regt was reduced to a single [[East Riding Royal Garrison Artillery#422 .28East Riding Coast.29 Squadron|129 (East Riding) Field Squadron]] based at Hull, and included in a new 72 ([[Tyne Electrical Engineers]]) Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R314>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 314\u20135.</ref>\n<ref name = Sappers>[http://www.sappers.co.uk/squadrons/ta-72-engineer-regt-volunteers 72 Engineer Rgt at Sappers site.]</ref><ref name=Regts72>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126065713/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/engr72.htm 72 Engineer Rgt at Regiments.org]</ref> In 1977 the squadron was transferred again, this time to 73 Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R314/><ref name = Sappers/><ref name = Regts72/><ref name=Regts73>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051227044404/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/engr73.htm 73 Engineer Rgt at Regiments.org]</ref> Finally, it was broken up in April 1991, with part going to the Humber Artillery Company of 2nd Battalion [[Yorkshire Volunteers]], and part to [[131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers]].<ref name = W&R314/><ref name = Regts73/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126064353/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/varty/ye-n2.htm Humber Artillery at Regiments.org]</ref>\n\n129 Field Sqn was reformed in April 2006, but disbanded again in 2014 under the 'Army 2020' proposals, when 73 Engineer Rgt was reduced to a single squadron.<ref name = W&R314/>\n\n==Prominent members==\n* The Scottish archaeologist [[Charles S.
