On 16 April 1746, the [[Jacobite Army (1745)|Jacobite army]] of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] was decisively defeated by a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] government force under [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], on Drummossie Moor near [[Inverness]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. It was the last [[pitched battle]] fought on British soil.\n\nCharles was the eldest son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the exiled [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] claimant to the British throne. Believing there was support for a Stuart restoration in both Scotland and England, he landed in Scotland in July 1745:  raising an army of Scots [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters, he took [[Edinburgh]] by September and defeated a British government force at [[Battle of Prestonpans|Prestonpans]]. The government recalled 12,000 troops from the Continent to deal with the rising: a Jacobite invasion of England reached as far as [[Derby]] before turning back, having attracted relatively few English recruits.\n\nThe Jacobites, with limited French military support, attempted to consolidate their control of Scotland, where by early 1746 they were opposed by a substantial government army. A scrambled Jacobite victory at [[Battle of Falkirk Muir|Falkirk]] failed to change the strategic situation: with supplies and pay running short and with the government troops resupplied and reorganised under the Duke of Cumberland, son of British monarch [[George II of England|George&nbsp;II]], the Jacobite leadership had few options left other than to stand and fight. The two armies eventually met at Culloden, on terrain that gave Cumberland's larger, well-rested force the advantage. The battle lasted only an hour, with the Jacobites suffering a bloody defeat; between 1,500 and 2,000 Jacobites were killed or wounded,<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/><ref name=\"PH1991-83\"/> while about 300 government soldiers were killed or wounded.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/> While perhaps 5-6,000 Jacobites remained in arms in Scotland, the leadership took the decision to disperse, effectively ending the rising.<ref>Zimmerman, Doron. (2003) ''The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759'', pp.23-25</ref>\n\nCulloden and its aftermath continue to arouse strong feelings. The [[University of Glasgow]] awarded the Duke of Cumberland an honorary doctorate, but many modern commentators allege that the aftermath of the battle and subsequent crackdown on Jacobite sympathisers were brutal, earning Cumberland the [[sobriquet]] \"Butcher\". Efforts were subsequently made to further integrate the comparatively undeveloped [[Scottish Highlands]] into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]; civil penalties were introduced to undermine the [[Scottish clan]] system, which had provided the Jacobites with the means to rapidly mobilise an army.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Jacobite rising of 1745}}\n[[File:Lost Portrait of Charles Edward Stuart.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Charles Stuart at Holyrood, 1745|The [[lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart]], painted at Edinburgh in late 1745]]\n[[File:William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|alt=William, Duke of Cumberland|upright|Charles' dynastic and military opponent, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], ca 1757]]\n[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]], died in 1714, with no living children. Under the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], she was succeeded by her [[second cousin]] [[George I of Great Britain|George&nbsp;I]] of the [[House of Hanover]], who was a descendant of the Stuarts through his maternal grandmother, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], a daughter of [[James VI and I]]. Many, however, particularly in Scotland and Ireland, continued to support the claim to the throne of Anne's exiled half-brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]], excluded from the succession under the Act of Settlement due to his [[Roman Catholic]] religion.\n\nOn 23 July 1745 James's son [[Charles Edward Stuart]] landed on [[Eriskay]] in the Western Islands in an attempt to reclaim the throne of Great Britain for his father, accompanied only by the \"[[Seven Men of Moidart]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Roderick |title=Bonnie Prince Charlie: Truth or Lies |date=2014 |isbn=978-0861537839 |page=2 |publisher=St Andrew Press}}</ref> Most of his Scottish supporters advised he return to France, but his persuasion of [[Donald Cameron of Lochiel]] to back him encouraged others to commit and the rebellion was launched at [[Glenfinnan]] on 19 August.

Around 500 men from the Irish Brigade fought in the battle, around 100 of whom were thought to have been recruited from [[6th Regiment of Foot|6th (Guise's) Foot]] taken prisoner at Fort Augustus.

''author's note''.</ref>  The bulk of the infantry units had already been defeated by the Jacobites in January at Falkirk, but had been further drilled, rested and resupplied since then.\n\nMany of the infantry were experienced veterans of Continental service, but on the outbreak of the Jacobite rising, extra incentives were given to recruits to fill the ranks of depleted units. On 6 September 1745, every recruit who joined the Guards before 24 September was given \u00a36, and those who joined in the last days of the month were given \u00a34.

Cumberland decided to wait out the winter, and moved his troops northwards to [[Aberdeen]]. 5,000 [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] troops, led by Prince [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick of Hesse]], took up position to the south to cut off any path of retreat for the Jacobites.

Rather than offer resistance Drummond retreated towards [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and then to [[Nairn]], an act for which he was sharply criticised after the rising by several participants.

In support of Perth, Lord John Drummond and Charles would bring up the second line. The Jacobite force, however, started out well after dark, partly due to concerns they would be spotted by ships of the Royal Navy then in the [[Moray Firth]]. Murray led them across country with the intention of avoiding government outposts: Murray's one time ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', James [[Chevalier de Johnstone]] later wrote, \"this march across country in a dark night which did not allow us to follow any track [was] accompanied with confusion and disorder\".<ref name=\"SR2006-5658\"/>\n\nBy the time the leading troop had reached Culraick, still {{convert|2|mi|km}} from where Murray's wing was to cross the River Nairn and encircle the town, there was only one hour left before dawn. After a heated council with other officers, Murray concluded that there was not enough time to mount a surprise attack and that the offensive should be aborted. Sullivan went to inform Charles Edward Stuart of the change of plan, but missed him in the dark. Meanwhile, instead of retracing his path back, Murray led his men left, down the Inverness road. In the darkness, while Murray led one-third of the Jacobite forces back to camp, the other two-thirds continued towards their original objective, unaware of the change in plan. One account of that night even records that Perth's men made contact with government troops before realising the rest of the Jacobite force had turned home. A few historians, such as [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] and [[Christopher Duffy]], have suggested that if Perth had carried on the night attack might have remained viable, though most have disagreed, as perhaps only 1200 of the Jacobite force accompanied him.<ref>Britain as a military power 1688\u20131815 (1999), p. 32</ref><ref>Black,Jeremy, Culloden and the '45 (1990)</ref><ref>Pittock (2016) p.67</ref>\n\nNot long after the exhausted Jacobite forces had made it back to Culloden, an officer of Lochiel's regiment, who had been left behind after falling asleep in a wood, arrived with a report of advancing government troops.<ref name=\"SR2006-5658\">Reid (2002), pp. 56\u201358.</ref> By then, many Jacobite soldiers had dispersed in search of food or returned to Inverness, while others were asleep in ditches and outbuildings; several hundred of their army may have missed the battle.\n\n==Battle on Culloden Moor==\n[[File:Battle of Culloden (map 02).svg|thumb|right|200px|Battle lines at Culloden, including initial redeployments by both Charles and Cumberland]]\n\n[[File:Culloden House (old).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Culloden House, 1746 where the Jacobite leader Charles Edward Stuart had his headquarters and lodgings in the days leading up to the Battle of Culloden]]\n\nFollowing the abortive night attack, the Jacobites formed up in substantially the same battle order as the previous day, with the Highland regiments forming the first line.

By {{nowrap|10 am}} the Jacobites finally saw them approaching at a distance of around {{nowrap|4 km;}} at {{nowrap|3 km}} from the Jacobite position Cumberland gave the order to form line, and the army marched forward in full battle order.<ref name=pittock79>Pittock (2016) p.79</ref> John Daniel, an Englishman serving with Charles's army, recorded that on seeing the government troops the Jacobites began to \"huzza and bravado them\", though without response: \"on the contrary, they continued proceding, like a deep sullen river\".<ref name=blaikie213>{{cite book |last=Blaikie |first=Walter |title=Origins of the Forty-Five |publisher=Scottish History Society|date=1916 |page=213}}</ref> Once within 500 metres, Cumberland moved his artillery up through the ranks.<ref name=pittock79/>\n\nAs Cumberland's forces formed into line of battle, it became clear that their right flank was in an exposed position and Cumberland moved up additional cavalry and other units to reinforce it.<ref name=pittock83>Pittock (2016) p.83</ref> In the Jacobite lines, Sullivan moved two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's regiment to cover the walls at Culwhiniac against a possible flank attack by government dragoons. Murray also moved the Jacobite right slightly forwards: this \"changement\", as Sullivan called it, had the unintended result of skewing the Jacobite line and opening gaps, so Sullivan ordered Perth and [[John Gordon of Glenbucket|Glenbucket]]'s regiments from the second line to the left of the front rank, and the Edinburgh Regiment to the centre. While the Jacobite front rank now substantially outnumbered that of Cumberland, their reserve was further depleted, increasing their reliance on the first line attack.<ref name=pittock85>Pittock (2016) p.85</ref>\n\n===Artillery exchange===\n\nAt approximately 1 p.m. Finlayson's Jacobite batteries opened fire, possibly in response to Cumberland sending forward [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|Lord Bury]] to within 100 metres of the Jacobite lines to \"ascertain the strength of their battery\".<ref name=pittock86>Pittock (2016) p.86</ref> The government artillery responded shortly afterwards: while some later Jacobite memoirs suggest their troops were then subjected to artillery bombardment for 30 minutes or more while Charles delayed an advance, government accounts suggest a much shorter exchange before the Jacobites attacked. Campbell of Airds, in the rear, timed it at 9; Cumberland's aide-de-camp Yorke suggested only 2 or 3 minutes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Tony (ed) |title=Culloden |publisher=Pen and Sword (Kindle ed)|date=2009 |page=loc. 2128}}</ref>\n\nThe duration implies that the government artillery are unlikely to have fired more than thirty rounds at extreme range: statistical analysis concludes that this would have caused only 20-30 Jacobite casualties at this stage, rather than the hundreds suggested by some accounts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Tony (ed) |title=Culloden |publisher=Pen and Sword (Kindle ed)|date=2009 |page=loc. 2128}}</ref>\n\n===Jacobite advance===\n\nShortly after 1 pm, Charles issued an order to advance, which Col. Harry Kerr of Graden first took to Perth's regiment, on the extreme left. He then rode down the Jacobite line giving orders to each regiment in turn; [[Seven Men of Moidart#Sir John MacDonald|Sir John MacDonald]] and Brigadier Stapleton were also sent forward to repeat the order.<ref name=pittock87>Pittock (2016) p.87</ref> As the Jacobites left their lines, the government gunners switched to canister; this was augmented by fire from the coehorn mortars situated behind the government front line. As there was no need for careful aiming when using canister the rate of fire increased dramatically, and the Jacobites found themselves advancing into heavy fire.<ref name=pittock86>Pittock (2016) p.86</ref>\n\nOn the Jacobite right, the Atholl Brigade, Lochiel's and the Appin Regiment left their start positions and charged towards Barrell's and Munro's regiments. Within a few hundred yards, however, the centre regiments, Lady Mackintosh's and Lovat's, had begun to swerve rightwards, either trying to avoid canister fire or in order to follow the firmer ground along the road running diagonally across Drummossie Moor. The five regiments became entangled as a single mass, converging on the government left. The confusion was worsened when the three largest regiments lost their commanding officers, who were all at the front of the advance: MacGillivray and MacBean of Lady Mackintosh's both went down; Inverallochie of Lovat's fell, and Lochiel had his ankles broken by canister within a few yards of the government lines.\n\nThe Jacobite left, by contrast, advanced much more slowly, hampered by boggy ground and by having several hundred yards further to cover. According to the account of [[Andrew Henderson (writer)|Andrew Henderson]], Lord John Drummond walked across the front of the Jacobite lines to try and tempt the government infantry into firing early, but they maintained their discipline. The three MacDonald regiments - Keppoch's, Clanranald's and Glengarry's - stalled before resorting to ineffectual long-range musket fire; they also lost senior officers, as Clanranald was wounded and Keppoch killed. The smaller units on their right - Maclachlan's Regiment and Chisholm's and Monaltrie's battalions - advanced into an area swept by artillery fire, and suffered heavy losses before falling back.\n\n===Engagement of government left wing===\n[[File:The Well of the Dead, Culloden Moor - geograph.org.uk - 494157.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Well of the Dead; modern remains of the park wall on Jacobite right]]\nThe Jacobite right was particularly hard hit by a volley from the government regiments at nearly point blank range, but many of its men still reached the government lines and, for the first time, a battle was decided by a direct clash between [[Highland charge|charging Highlanders]] and formed infantry equipped with muskets and socket bayonets. The brunt of the Jacobite impact, led by Lochiel's regiment, was taken by just two government regiments \u2013 [[4th Regiment of Foot|Barrell's 4th Foot]] and [[37th Regiment of Foot|Dejean's 37th Foot]]. Barrell's lost 17 and suffered 108 wounded, out of a total of 373 officers and men. Dejean's lost 14 and had 68 wounded, with this unit's left wing taking a disproportionately higher number of casualties. Barrell's regiment temporarily lost one of its two [[Regimental colours|colours]].{{refn|An unknown British Army corporal's description of the charge into the government's left wing: \"When we saw them coming towards us in great Haste and Fury, we fired at about 50&nbsp;Yards Distance, which made Hundreds fall, we fired at about 50&nbsp;Yards Distance, which made Hundreds fall<!--does the original really say this twice?-->; notwithstanding which, they were so numerous, that they still advanced, and were almost upon us before we had loaden again.

Also sent forward to plug the gap was [[20th Regiment of Foot|Bligh's 20th Foot]], which took up position between Sempill's 25th and Dejean's 37th.

The boggy ground, however, impeded the cavalry and they turned to engage the Irish Picquets whom Sullivan and Lord John Drummond had brought up in an attempt to stabilise the deteriorating Jacobite left flank. Cumberland later wrote: \"They came running on in their wild manner, and upon the right where I had place myself, imagining the greatest push would be there, they came down there several times within a hundred yards of our men, firing their pistols and brandishing their swords, but the Royal Scots and Pulteneys hardly took their fire-locks from their shoulders, so that after those faint attempts they made off; and the little squadrons on our right were sent to pursue them\".<ref name=\"Roberts 2002, p. 173\">Roberts (2002), p. 173.</ref><ref>Reid (2002), pp. 72\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Jacobite collapse and rout===\nWith the collapse of the left wing, Murray brought up the ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' and Kilmarnock's Footguards who were still at this time unengaged, but by the time they had been brought into position, the Jacobite first line was in [[rout]]. The ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' exchanged musket fire with [[Royal Scots Fusiliers|Campbell's 21st]] and commenced an orderly retreat, moving along the Culwhiniac enclosure in order to shield themselves from artillery fire. Immediately the half battalion of Highland militia, commanded by Captain Colin Campbell of Ballimore, which had stood inside the enclosure ambushed them. In the encounter Campbell of Ballimore was killed along with five of his men. The result was that the ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' and Kilmarnock's Footguards were forced out into the open moor and were engaged by three squadrons of Kerr's 11th Dragoons: the fleeing Jacobites must have put up a fight, for Kerr's 11th recorded at least 16 horses killed during the entirety of the battle.\n\nThe Irish Picquets under Stapleton bravely covered the Highlanders' retreat from the battlefield, preventing a massacre: this action cost half of the 100 casualties they suffered in the battle.<ref>McGarry, ''Irish Brigades Abroad'' p. 122</ref> The ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' appear to have retired from the field in two wings; one part surrendered after suffering 50 killed or wounded, but their colours were not taken and a large number retired from the field with the Jacobite Lowland regiments.<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\"/> A few Highland regiments also withdrew in good order, notably Lovat's first battalion who retired with colours flying; the government dragoons let them withdraw rather than risk a confrontation.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.95</ref>\n[[File:Jacobite standard (no9).svg|thumb|One of at least fourteen [[Historical colours, standards and guidons|standards or colours]] recorded as captured by government forces at the battle.<ref>Reid (2006), p. 16.</ref> This and a similar blue [[saltire]] may have been used by the Atholl Brigade.<ref>Reid (2002), p. 93.</ref>]]\nThe stand by the French regulars gave Charles and other senior officers time to escape. Charles seems to have been rallying Perth's and Glenbucket's regiments when Sullivan rode up to Captain Shea, commander of his bodyguard: \"Yu see all is going to pot. Yu can be of no great succor, so before a general deroute wch will soon be, Seize upon the Prince & take him off&nbsp;...\".<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\"/> Contrary to government depictions of Charles as a coward, he yelled \"they won't take me alive!\" and called for a final charge into the government lines:<ref>Pittock (2016) p.134</ref> Shea however followed Sullivan's advice and led Charles from the field, accompanied by Perth and Glenbucket's regiments.\n\nFrom this point on the fleeing Jacobite forces were split into several groups: the Lowland regiments retired in order southwards, making their way to [[Ruthven Barracks]], while the remains of the Jacobite right wing also retired to the south. The MacDonald and other Highland left wing regiments however were cut off by the government cavalry, and forced to retreat down the road to Inverness. The result was that they were a clear target for government dragoons: Major-general [[Humphrey Bland]] led the pursuit of the fleeing Highlanders, giving \"[[no quarter|Quarter to None]] but about Fifty French Officers and Soldiers\".<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\">Reid (2002), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\n===Conclusion: casualties and prisoners===\nJacobite [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] are estimated at 1,500\u20132,000 killed or wounded, with many of these occurring in the pursuit after the battle.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/><ref name=\"PH1991-83\"/> Cumberland's official list of prisoners taken includes 154 Jacobites and 222 \"French\" prisoners (men from the 'foreign units' in the French service). Added to the official list of those apprehended were 172 of the Earl of Cromartie's men, captured after a [[Battle of Littleferry|brief engagement the day before]] near [[Littleferry]].\n\nIn striking contrast to the Jacobite losses, the government losses were 50 dead and 259 wounded. However, a large proportion of those recorded as wounded are likely to have died of their wounds: only 29 out of 104 wounded from Barrell's 4th Foot survived to claim pensions, while all 6 of the artillerymen recorded as wounded died.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/>\n\nSeveral senior Jacobites were casualties including [[Alexander Macdonald, 17th of Keppoch|Keppoch]], [[William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan|Viscount Strathallan]], commissary-general Lachlan Maclachlan and Walter Stapleton, who died of wounds shortly after the battle. Others, including [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock|Kilmarnock]], were captured. The only government casualty of high rank was [[Lord Robert Kerr]], the son of [[William Kerr, 3rd Marquess of Lothian]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:\"The End of the 'Forty Five' Rebellion\".jpg|thumb|left|''The End of the 'Forty Five' Rebellion'' depicts the retreat of the defeated [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]].]]\n\n===Collapse of the Jacobite campaign===\nAs the first of the fleeing Highlanders approached Inverness they were met by the 2nd battalion of Lovat's regiment, led by the [[Simon Fraser of Lovat|Master of Lovat]]. It has been suggested that Lovat shrewdly switched sides and turned upon the retreating Jacobites, an act that would explain his remarkable rise in fortune in the years that followed.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\">Reid (2002), pp. 88\u201390.</ref>\n\nFollowing the battle, the Jacobites' Lowland regiments headed south, towards Corrybrough and made their way to Ruthven Barracks, while their Highland units made their way north, towards Inverness and on through to Fort Augustus. There they were joined by Barisdale's battalion of Glengarry's regiment and a small battalion of MacGregors.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> At least two of those present at Ruthven, James Johnstone and John Daniel, recorded that the Highland troops remained in good spirits despite the defeat and eager to resume the campaign. At this point, continuing Jacobite resistance remained potentially viable in terms of manpower: at least a third of the army had either missed or slept through Culloden, which along with survivors from the battle gave a potential force of 5-6000 men.<ref>Zimmerman, Doron (2003) ''The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759'', p.25</ref> However the roughly 1,500 men who assembled at Ruthven Barracks received orders from Charles to the effect that the army should disperse until he returned with French support.<ref name=\"JLR2002-182-183\">Roberts (2002), pp. 182\u201383.</ref>\n\nSimilar orders must have been received by the Highland units at Fort Augustus, and by 18 April the majority of the Jacobite army was disbanded. Officers and men of the units in French service made for Inverness, where they surrendered as prisoners of war on 19 April. Most of the rest of the army broke up, with men heading for home or attempting to escape abroad,<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> although the Appin Regiment amongst others was still in arms as late as July.\n\n{{see also|Skirmish of Loch nan Uamh}}\n\nMany senior Jacobites made their way to {{lang|gd|[[Loch nan Uamh]]}}, where Charles Edward Stuart had first landed at the outset of the campaign in 1745. Here on 30 April they were met by two French [[frigate]]s \u2013 the [[French privateer Mars (1746)|''Mars'']] and [[French privateer Bellone (1745)|''Bellone'']]. Two days later the French ships were spotted and attacked by three smaller [[Royal Navy]] [[sloops]] \u2013 the ''[[HMS Greyhound (1741)|Greyhound]]'', [[HMS Baltimore (1742)|''Baltimore'']], and ''[[HMS Terror (1741)|Terror]]''. The result was the last real engagement of the campaign; during the six hours in which the battle continued the Jacobites recovered cargo which had been landed by the French ships, including [[pounds sterling|\u00a3]]35,000 of gold.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/>\n\nWith visible proof that the French had not deserted them, a group of Jacobite leaders attempted to prolong the campaign. On 8 May, nearby at [[Murlaggan]], Lochiel, Lochgarry, Clanranald and Barisdale all agreed to rendezvous at Invermallie on 18 May, as did [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and his son. The plan was that there they would be joined by what remained of Keppoch's men and Macpherson of Cluny's regiment, which had not taken part in the battle at Culloden. However, things did not go as planned; after about a month of relative inactivity, Cumberland moved his army into the Highlands and on 17 May three battalions of regulars and eight Highland companies reoccupied Fort Augustus. The same day, the Macphersons surrendered. On the day of the planned rendezvous, Clanranald never appeared and Lochgarry and Barisdale only showed up with about 300 combined, most of whom immediately dispersed in search of food: Lochiel, who commanded possibly the strongest Jacobite regiment at Culloden, was only able to muster 300 men. The group dispersed, and the following week the Government launched [[raids on Lochaber and Shiramore|punitive expeditions into the Highlands which continued throughout the summer]].<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/><ref name=\"JLR2002-182-183\"/>\n\nFollowing his flight from the battle, Charles Edward Stuart made his way towards the [[Hebrides]], accompanied by a small group of supporters. By 20 April, Charles had reached {{lang|gd|[[Arisaig]]}} on the west coast of Scotland. After spending a few days with his close associates, he sailed for the island of [[Benbecula]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]]. From there he travelled to [[Scalpay, Outer Hebrides|Scalpay]], off the east coast of [[Harris (Scotland)|Harris]], and from there made his way to [[Stornoway]].<ref name=\"PH1991-8586\"/> For five months Charles criss-crossed the Hebrides, constantly pursued by government supporters and under threat from local [[laird]]s who were tempted to betray him for the \u00a330,000 upon his head.<ref name=\"JP1973-301\">Prebble (1973), p. 301.</ref> During this time he met [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora Macdonald]], who famously aided him in a narrow escape to [[Skye]]. Finally, on 19 September, Charles reached Borrodale on {{lang|gd|Loch nan Uamh}} in {{lang|gd|Arisaig}}, where his party boarded two small French ships, which ferried them to France.<ref name=\"PH1991-8586\">Harrington (1991), pp. 85\u201386.</ref> He never returned to Scotland.\n\n===Repercussions and persecution===\n[[File:After Culloden- Rebel Hunting.jpg|thumb|left|''After Culloden: Rebel Hunting'' by [[John Seymour Lucas]] depicts the rigorous search for Jacobites in the days that followed Culloden.]]\nThe morning following the Battle of Culloden, Cumberland issued a written order reminding his men that \"the public orders of the rebels yesterday was to give us no quarter\".{{refn|Cumberland wrote: \"A captain and fifty foot to march directly and visit all the cottages in the neighbourhood of the field of battle, and search for rebels.

In the days and weeks that followed,  versions of the alleged orders were published in the ''Newcastle Journal'' and the ''Gentleman's Journal''. Today only one copy of the alleged order to \"give no quarter\" exists.<ref name=\"JR2002-177180\"/> It is however considered to be nothing but a poor attempt at forgery, for it is neither written nor signed by Murray, and it appears on the bottom half of a copy of a declaration published in 1745. In any event, Cumberland's order was not carried out for two days, after which contemporary accounts report then that for the next two days the moor was searched and all those wounded were put to death. On the other hand, the orders issued by Lord George Murray for the conduct of the aborted night attack in the early hours of 16 April suggest that it would have been every bit as merciless. The instructions were to use only swords, dirks and bayonets, to overturn tents, and subsequently to locate \"a swelling or bulge in the fallen tent, there to strike and push vigorously\".<ref name=\"JR2002-177180\">Roberts (2002), pp. 177\u201380.</ref>{{refn|A Highland Jacobite officer wrote: \"We were likewise forbid in the attack to make use of firearms, but only of sword, dirk and bayonet, to cutt the tent strings, and pull down the poles, and where observed a swelling or bulge in the falen tent, there to strick and push vigorously\".<ref>Lockhart (1817), p. 508.</ref>|group= note}} In total, over 20,000 head of livestock, sheep, and goats were driven off and sold at [[Fort Augustus]], where the soldiers split the profits.<ref>Magnusson (2003), p. 623.</ref>\n\n[[File:Beheading of the rebel lords on great tower hill.jpeg|thumb|A contemporary [[engraving]] depicting the executions of [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock|Kilmarnock]] and [[Arthur Elphinstone, 6th Lord Balmerino|Balmerino]] at [[Tower Hill|Great Tower Hill]], on 18 August 1746<ref>Harrington (1996), p. 88.</ref>]]\nWhile in Inverness, Cumberland emptied the [[jail]]s that were full of people imprisoned by Jacobite supporters, replacing them with Jacobites themselves.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> Prisoners were taken south to England to stand trial for [[high treason]].

Interesting finds have been made in the areas where the fiercest fighting occurred on the government left wing, particularly where Barrell's and Dejean's regiments stood. For example, pistol balls and pieces of shattered muskets have been uncovered here which indicate close quarters fighting, as pistols were only used at close range and the musket pieces appear to have been smashed by pistol/musket balls or heavy broadswords. Finds of musket balls appear to mirror the lines of men who stood and fought. Some balls appear to have been dropped without being fired, some missed their targets, and others are distorted from hitting human bodies. In some cases it may be possible to identify whether the Jacobites or government soldiers fired certain rounds, because the Jacobite forces are known to have used a large quantity of French muskets which fired a slightly smaller [[caliber|calibre]] shot than that of the British Army's ''[[Brown Bess]]''. Analysis of the finds confirms that the Jacobites used muskets in greater numbers than has traditionally been thought. Not far from where the hand-to-hand fighting took place, fragments of mortar shells have been found.<ref name=\"gla.ac.uk-culloden\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/battlefieldarchaeology/centreprojects/culloden/|title=Point of Contact: Archaeology at Culloden|accessdate=6 March 2009|work=University of Glasgow Centre for Battlefield Archaeology}}</ref> Though Forbes's headstones mark the graves of the Jacobites, the location of the graves of about sixty government soldiers is unknown. The recent discovery of a 1752 silver ''[[Thaler]]'', from the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], may however lead archaeologists to these graves. A geophysical survey, directly beneath the spot where the coin was found, seems to indicate the existence of a large rectangular burial pit. It is thought possible that the coin was dropped by a soldier who once served on the continent, while he visited the graves of his fallen comrades.<ref name=\"gla.ac.uk-culloden\"/>\nThe National Trust of Scotland is currently attempting to restore Culloden Moor, as closely as possible, to the state it was in during the Battle of Culloden Moor. They are also attempting to expand the land under its care to ensure the full battlefield is protected under the NTS. Another goal is to restore Leannach Cottage and allow visitors to once again tour the interior.\n\n==Order of battle: Culloden, 16 April 1746==\n\n===Jacobite army===\n[[Charles Edward Stuart]]<br />\nColonel John William Sullivan\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=20% | Division\n! width=30% colspan=2 | Unit\n!

On 16 April 1746, the [[Jacobite Army (1745)|Jacobite army]] of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] was decisively defeated by a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] government force under [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], on Drummossie Moor near [[Inverness]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. It was the last [[pitched battle]] fought on British soil.\n\nCharles was the eldest son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the exiled [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] claimant to the British throne. Believing there was support for a Stuart restoration in both Scotland and England, he landed in Scotland in July 1745:  raising an army of Scots [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters, he took [[Edinburgh]] by September and defeated a British government force at [[Battle of Prestonpans|Prestonpans]]. The government recalled 12,000 troops from the Continent to deal with the rising: a Jacobite invasion of England reached as far as [[Derby]] before turning back, having attracted relatively few English recruits.\n\nThe Jacobites, with limited French military support, attempted to consolidate their control of Scotland, where by early 1746 they were opposed by a substantial government army. A scrambled Jacobite victory at [[Battle of Falkirk Muir|Falkirk]] failed to change the strategic situation: with supplies and pay running short and with the government troops resupplied and reorganised under the Duke of Cumberland, son of British monarch [[George II of England|George&nbsp;II]], the Jacobite leadership had few options left other than to stand and fight. The two armies eventually met at Culloden, on terrain that gave Cumberland's larger, well-rested force the advantage. The battle lasted only an hour, with the Jacobites suffering a bloody defeat; between 1,500 and 2,000 Jacobites were killed or wounded,<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/><ref name=\"PH1991-83\"/> while about 300 government soldiers were killed or wounded.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/> While perhaps 5-6,000 Jacobites remained in arms in Scotland, the leadership took the decision to disperse, effectively ending the rising.<ref>Zimmerman, Doron. (2003) ''The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759'', pp.23-25</ref>\n\nCulloden and its aftermath continue to arouse strong feelings. The [[University of Glasgow]] awarded the Duke of Cumberland an honorary doctorate, but many modern commentators allege that the aftermath of the battle and subsequent crackdown on Jacobite sympathisers were brutal, earning Cumberland the [[sobriquet]] \"Butcher\". Efforts were subsequently made to further integrate the comparatively undeveloped [[Scottish Highlands]] into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]; civil penalties were introduced to undermine the [[Scottish clan]] system, which had provided the Jacobites with the means to rapidly mobilise an army.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Jacobite rising of 1745}}\n[[File:Lost Portrait of Charles Edward Stuart.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Charles Stuart at Holyrood, 1745|The [[lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart]], painted at Edinburgh in late 1745]]\n[[File:William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|alt=William, Duke of Cumberland|upright|Charles' dynastic and military opponent, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], ca 1757]]\n[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]], died in 1714, with no living children. Under the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], she was succeeded by her [[second cousin]] [[George I of Great Britain|George&nbsp;I]] of the [[House of Hanover]], who was a descendant of the Stuarts through his maternal grandmother, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], a daughter of [[James VI and I]]. Many, however, particularly in Scotland and Ireland, continued to support the claim to the throne of Anne's exiled half-brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]], excluded from the succession under the Act of Settlement due to his [[Roman Catholic]] religion.\n\nOn 23 July 1745 James's son [[Charles Edward Stuart]] landed on [[Eriskay]] in the Western Islands in an attempt to reclaim the throne of Great Britain for his father, accompanied only by the \"[[Seven Men of Moidart]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Roderick |title=Bonnie Prince Charlie: Truth or Lies |date=2014 |isbn=978-0861537839 |page=2 |publisher=St Andrew Press}}</ref> Most of his Scottish supporters advised he return to France, but his persuasion of [[Donald Cameron of Lochiel]] to back him encouraged others to commit and the rebellion was launched at [[Glenfinnan]] on 19 August.

This assumed limited, short-term warfare: a long campaign demanded greater professionalism and training, and the colonels of some Highland regiments considered their men to be uncontrollable.<ref name=\"Harrington(2006)-35-40\">Harrington (1991), pp. 35\u201340.</ref>{{refn|Colonel John William Sullivan wrote, \"All was confused&nbsp;... such a chiefe of a tribe had sixty men, another thiry, another twenty, more or lesse; they would not mix nor seperat, & wou'd have double officers, yt is two Captns & two Lts, to each Compagny, strong or weak&nbsp;... but by little, were brought into a certain regulation\".<ref>Reid (2006), pp. 20\u201321.</ref>|group=note}} A typical 'clan' regiment was officered by the heavily-armed [[tacksman|tacksmen]], with their subtenants acting as common soldiers.<ref name=\"Reid(1997)-p58\"/><ref name=\"Barthorp(1982)-p17-18\">Barthorp, Michael (1982).

Around 500 men from the Irish Brigade fought in the battle, around 100 of whom were thought to have been recruited from [[6th Regiment of Foot|6th (Guise's) Foot]] taken prisoner at Fort Augustus.

On 6 September 1745, every recruit who joined the Guards before 24 September was given \u00a36, and those who joined in the last days of the month were given \u00a34.

In support of Perth, Lord John Drummond and Charles would bring up the second line. The Jacobite force, however, started out well after dark, partly due to concerns they would be spotted by ships of the Royal Navy then in the [[Moray Firth]]. Murray led them across country with the intention of avoiding government outposts: Murray's one time ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', James [[Chevalier de Johnstone]] later wrote, \"this march across country in a dark night which did not allow us to follow any track [was] accompanied with confusion and disorder\".<ref name=\"SR2006-5658\"/>\n\nBy the time the leading troop had reached Culraick, still {{convert|2|mi|km}} from where Murray's wing was to cross the River Nairn and encircle the town, there was only one hour left before dawn. After a heated council with other officers, Murray concluded that there was not enough time to mount a surprise attack and that the offensive should be aborted. Sullivan went to inform Charles Edward Stuart of the change of plan, but missed him in the dark. Meanwhile, instead of retracing his path back, Murray led his men left, down the Inverness road. In the darkness, while Murray led one-third of the Jacobite forces back to camp, the other two-thirds continued towards their original objective, unaware of the change in plan. One account of that night even records that Perth's men made contact with government troops before realising the rest of the Jacobite force had turned home. A few historians, such as [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] and [[Christopher Duffy]], have suggested that if Perth had carried on the night attack might have remained viable, though most have disagreed, as perhaps only 1200 of the Jacobite force accompanied him.<ref>Britain as a military power 1688\u20131815 (1999), p. 32</ref><ref>Black,Jeremy, Culloden and the '45 (1990)</ref><ref>Pittock (2016) p.67</ref>\n\nNot long after the exhausted Jacobite forces had made it back to Culloden, an officer of Lochiel's regiment, who had been left behind after falling asleep in a wood, arrived with a report of advancing government troops.<ref name=\"SR2006-5658\">Reid (2002), pp. 56\u201358.</ref> By then, many Jacobite soldiers had dispersed in search of food or returned to Inverness, while others were asleep in ditches and outbuildings; several hundred of their army may have missed the battle.\n\n==Battle on Culloden Moor==\n[[File:Battle of Culloden (map 02).svg|thumb|right|200px|Battle lines at Culloden, including initial redeployments by both Charles and Cumberland]]\n\n[[File:Culloden House (old).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Culloden House, 1746 where the Jacobite leader Charles Edward Stuart had his headquarters and lodgings in the days leading up to the Battle of Culloden]]\n\nFollowing the abortive night attack, the Jacobites formed up in substantially the same battle order as the previous day, with the Highland regiments forming the first line. They faced north-east over common grazing land, with the [[River Nairn|Water of Nairn]] about 1 km to their right.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.69</ref> Their left wing, anchored on the Culloden Park walls, was under the command of the titular Duke of Perth, James Drummond; his brother John Drummond commanded the centre. The right wing, flanked by the Culwhiniac enclosure walls, was led by Murray. Behind them the 'Low Country' regiments were drawn up in column, in accordance with French practice. During the morning snow and hail \"started falling very thick\" onto the already wet ground, later turning to rain, though the weather turned fair as the battle started.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.65</ref>\n\nCumberland's army had pitched camp and were underway by {{nowrap|5 am,}} leaving the main Inverness road and marching across country. By {{nowrap|10 am}} the Jacobites finally saw them approaching at a distance of around {{nowrap|4 km;}} at {{nowrap|3 km}} from the Jacobite position Cumberland gave the order to form line, and the army marched forward in full battle order.<ref name=pittock79>Pittock (2016) p.79</ref> John Daniel, an Englishman serving with Charles's army, recorded that on seeing the government troops the Jacobites began to \"huzza and bravado them\", though without response: \"on the contrary, they continued proceding, like a deep sullen river\".<ref name=blaikie213>{{cite book |last=Blaikie |first=Walter |title=Origins of the Forty-Five |publisher=Scottish History Society|date=1916 |page=213}}</ref> Once within 500 metres, Cumberland moved his artillery up through the ranks.<ref name=pittock79/>\n\nAs Cumberland's forces formed into line of battle, it became clear that their right flank was in an exposed position and Cumberland moved up additional cavalry and other units to reinforce it.<ref name=pittock83>Pittock (2016) p.83</ref> In the Jacobite lines, Sullivan moved two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's regiment to cover the walls at Culwhiniac against a possible flank attack by government dragoons. Murray also moved the Jacobite right slightly forwards: this \"changement\", as Sullivan called it, had the unintended result of skewing the Jacobite line and opening gaps, so Sullivan ordered Perth and [[John Gordon of Glenbucket|Glenbucket]]'s regiments from the second line to the left of the front rank, and the Edinburgh Regiment to the centre. While the Jacobite front rank now substantially outnumbered that of Cumberland, their reserve was further depleted, increasing their reliance on the first line attack.<ref name=pittock85>Pittock (2016) p.85</ref>\n\n===Artillery exchange===\n\nAt approximately 1 p.m. Finlayson's Jacobite batteries opened fire, possibly in response to Cumberland sending forward [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|Lord Bury]] to within 100 metres of the Jacobite lines to \"ascertain the strength of their battery\".<ref name=pittock86>Pittock (2016) p.86</ref> The government artillery responded shortly afterwards: while some later Jacobite memoirs suggest their troops were then subjected to artillery bombardment for 30 minutes or more while Charles delayed an advance, government accounts suggest a much shorter exchange before the Jacobites attacked. Campbell of Airds, in the rear, timed it at 9; Cumberland's aide-de-camp Yorke suggested only 2 or 3 minutes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Tony (ed) |title=Culloden |publisher=Pen and Sword (Kindle ed)|date=2009 |page=loc. 2128}}</ref>\n\nThe duration implies that the government artillery are unlikely to have fired more than thirty rounds at extreme range: statistical analysis concludes that this would have caused only 20-30 Jacobite casualties at this stage, rather than the hundreds suggested by some accounts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Tony (ed) |title=Culloden |publisher=Pen and Sword (Kindle ed)|date=2009 |page=loc. 2128}}</ref>\n\n===Jacobite advance===\n\nShortly after 1 pm, Charles issued an order to advance, which Col. Harry Kerr of Graden first took to Perth's regiment, on the extreme left. He then rode down the Jacobite line giving orders to each regiment in turn; [[Seven Men of Moidart#Sir John MacDonald|Sir John MacDonald]] and Brigadier Stapleton were also sent forward to repeat the order.<ref name=pittock87>Pittock (2016) p.87</ref> As the Jacobites left their lines, the government gunners switched to canister; this was augmented by fire from the coehorn mortars situated behind the government front line. As there was no need for careful aiming when using canister the rate of fire increased dramatically, and the Jacobites found themselves advancing into heavy fire.<ref name=pittock86>Pittock (2016) p.86</ref>\n\nOn the Jacobite right, the Atholl Brigade, Lochiel's and the Appin Regiment left their start positions and charged towards Barrell's and Munro's regiments. Within a few hundred yards, however, the centre regiments, Lady Mackintosh's and Lovat's, had begun to swerve rightwards, either trying to avoid canister fire or in order to follow the firmer ground along the road running diagonally across Drummossie Moor. The five regiments became entangled as a single mass, converging on the government left. The confusion was worsened when the three largest regiments lost their commanding officers, who were all at the front of the advance: MacGillivray and MacBean of Lady Mackintosh's both went down; Inverallochie of Lovat's fell, and Lochiel had his ankles broken by canister within a few yards of the government lines.\n\nThe Jacobite left, by contrast, advanced much more slowly, hampered by boggy ground and by having several hundred yards further to cover. According to the account of [[Andrew Henderson (writer)|Andrew Henderson]], Lord John Drummond walked across the front of the Jacobite lines to try and tempt the government infantry into firing early, but they maintained their discipline. The three MacDonald regiments - Keppoch's, Clanranald's and Glengarry's - stalled before resorting to ineffectual long-range musket fire; they also lost senior officers, as Clanranald was wounded and Keppoch killed. The smaller units on their right - Maclachlan's Regiment and Chisholm's and Monaltrie's battalions - advanced into an area swept by artillery fire, and suffered heavy losses before falling back.\n\n===Engagement of government left wing===\n[[File:The Well of the Dead, Culloden Moor - geograph.org.uk - 494157.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Well of the Dead; modern remains of the park wall on Jacobite right]]\nThe Jacobite right was particularly hard hit by a volley from the government regiments at nearly point blank range, but many of its men still reached the government lines and, for the first time, a battle was decided by a direct clash between [[Highland charge|charging Highlanders]] and formed infantry equipped with muskets and socket bayonets. The brunt of the Jacobite impact, led by Lochiel's regiment, was taken by just two government regiments \u2013 [[4th Regiment of Foot|Barrell's 4th Foot]] and [[37th Regiment of Foot|Dejean's 37th Foot]]. Barrell's lost 17 and suffered 108 wounded, out of a total of 373 officers and men. Dejean's lost 14 and had 68 wounded, with this unit's left wing taking a disproportionately higher number of casualties. Barrell's regiment temporarily lost one of its two [[Regimental colours|colours]].{{refn|An unknown British Army corporal's description of the charge into the government's left wing: \"When we saw them coming towards us in great Haste and Fury, we fired at about 50&nbsp;Yards Distance, which made Hundreds fall, we fired at about 50&nbsp;Yards Distance, which made Hundreds fall<!--does the original really say this twice?-->; notwithstanding which, they were so numerous, that they still advanced, and were almost upon us before we had loaden again.

The boggy ground, however, impeded the cavalry and they turned to engage the Irish Picquets whom Sullivan and Lord John Drummond had brought up in an attempt to stabilise the deteriorating Jacobite left flank. Cumberland later wrote: \"They came running on in their wild manner, and upon the right where I had place myself, imagining the greatest push would be there, they came down there several times within a hundred yards of our men, firing their pistols and brandishing their swords, but the Royal Scots and Pulteneys hardly took their fire-locks from their shoulders, so that after those faint attempts they made off; and the little squadrons on our right were sent to pursue them\".<ref name=\"Roberts 2002, p. 173\">Roberts (2002), p. 173.</ref><ref>Reid (2002), pp. 72\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Jacobite collapse and rout===\nWith the collapse of the left wing, Murray brought up the ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' and Kilmarnock's Footguards who were still at this time unengaged, but by the time they had been brought into position, the Jacobite first line was in [[rout]]. The ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' exchanged musket fire with [[Royal Scots Fusiliers|Campbell's 21st]] and commenced an orderly retreat, moving along the Culwhiniac enclosure in order to shield themselves from artillery fire. Immediately the half battalion of Highland militia, commanded by Captain Colin Campbell of Ballimore, which had stood inside the enclosure ambushed them. In the encounter Campbell of Ballimore was killed along with five of his men. The result was that the ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' and Kilmarnock's Footguards were forced out into the open moor and were engaged by three squadrons of Kerr's 11th Dragoons: the fleeing Jacobites must have put up a fight, for Kerr's 11th recorded at least 16 horses killed during the entirety of the battle.\n\nThe Irish Picquets under Stapleton bravely covered the Highlanders' retreat from the battlefield, preventing a massacre: this action cost half of the 100 casualties they suffered in the battle.<ref>McGarry, ''Irish Brigades Abroad'' p. 122</ref> The ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' appear to have retired from the field in two wings; one part surrendered after suffering 50 killed or wounded, but their colours were not taken and a large number retired from the field with the Jacobite Lowland regiments.<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\"/> A few Highland regiments also withdrew in good order, notably Lovat's first battalion who retired with colours flying; the government dragoons let them withdraw rather than risk a confrontation.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.95</ref>\n[[File:Jacobite standard (no9).svg|thumb|One of at least fourteen [[Historical colours, standards and guidons|standards or colours]] recorded as captured by government forces at the battle.<ref>Reid (2006), p. 16.</ref> This and a similar blue [[saltire]] may have been used by the Atholl Brigade.<ref>Reid (2002), p. 93.</ref>]]\nThe stand by the French regulars gave Charles and other senior officers time to escape. Charles seems to have been rallying Perth's and Glenbucket's regiments when Sullivan rode up to Captain Shea, commander of his bodyguard: \"Yu see all is going to pot. Yu can be of no great succor, so before a general deroute wch will soon be, Seize upon the Prince & take him off&nbsp;...\".<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\"/> Contrary to government depictions of Charles as a coward, he yelled \"they won't take me alive!\" and called for a final charge into the government lines:<ref>Pittock (2016) p.134</ref> Shea however followed Sullivan's advice and led Charles from the field, accompanied by Perth and Glenbucket's regiments.\n\nFrom this point on the fleeing Jacobite forces were split into several groups: the Lowland regiments retired in order southwards, making their way to [[Ruthven Barracks]], while the remains of the Jacobite right wing also retired to the south. The MacDonald and other Highland left wing regiments however were cut off by the government cavalry, and forced to retreat down the road to Inverness. The result was that they were a clear target for government dragoons: Major-general [[Humphrey Bland]] led the pursuit of the fleeing Highlanders, giving \"[[no quarter|Quarter to None]] but about Fifty French Officers and Soldiers\".<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\">Reid (2002), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\n===Conclusion: casualties and prisoners===\nJacobite [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] are estimated at 1,500\u20132,000 killed or wounded, with many of these occurring in the pursuit after the battle.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/><ref name=\"PH1991-83\"/> Cumberland's official list of prisoners taken includes 154 Jacobites and 222 \"French\" prisoners (men from the 'foreign units' in the French service). Added to the official list of those apprehended were 172 of the Earl of Cromartie's men, captured after a [[Battle of Littleferry|brief engagement the day before]] near [[Littleferry]].\n\nIn striking contrast to the Jacobite losses, the government losses were 50 dead and 259 wounded. However, a large proportion of those recorded as wounded are likely to have died of their wounds: only 29 out of 104 wounded from Barrell's 4th Foot survived to claim pensions, while all 6 of the artillerymen recorded as wounded died.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/>\n\nSeveral senior Jacobites were casualties including [[Alexander Macdonald, 17th of Keppoch|Keppoch]], [[William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan|Viscount Strathallan]], commissary-general Lachlan Maclachlan and Walter Stapleton, who died of wounds shortly after the battle. Others, including [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock|Kilmarnock]], were captured. The only government casualty of high rank was [[Lord Robert Kerr]], the son of [[William Kerr, 3rd Marquess of Lothian]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:\"The End of the 'Forty Five' Rebellion\".jpg|thumb|left|''The End of the 'Forty Five' Rebellion'' depicts the retreat of the defeated [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]].]]\n\n===Collapse of the Jacobite campaign===\nAs the first of the fleeing Highlanders approached Inverness they were met by the 2nd battalion of Lovat's regiment, led by the [[Simon Fraser of Lovat|Master of Lovat]]. It has been suggested that Lovat shrewdly switched sides and turned upon the retreating Jacobites, an act that would explain his remarkable rise in fortune in the years that followed.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\">Reid (2002), pp. 88\u201390.</ref>\n\nFollowing the battle, the Jacobites' Lowland regiments headed south, towards Corrybrough and made their way to Ruthven Barracks, while their Highland units made their way north, towards Inverness and on through to Fort Augustus. There they were joined by Barisdale's battalion of Glengarry's regiment and a small battalion of MacGregors.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> At least two of those present at Ruthven, James Johnstone and John Daniel, recorded that the Highland troops remained in good spirits despite the defeat and eager to resume the campaign. At this point, continuing Jacobite resistance remained potentially viable in terms of manpower: at least a third of the army had either missed or slept through Culloden, which along with survivors from the battle gave a potential force of 5-6000 men.<ref>Zimmerman, Doron (2003) ''The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759'', p.25</ref> However the roughly 1,500 men who assembled at Ruthven Barracks received orders from Charles to the effect that the army should disperse until he returned with French support.<ref name=\"JLR2002-182-183\">Roberts (2002), pp. 182\u201383.</ref>\n\nSimilar orders must have been received by the Highland units at Fort Augustus, and by 18 April the majority of the Jacobite army was disbanded. Officers and men of the units in French service made for Inverness, where they surrendered as prisoners of war on 19 April. Most of the rest of the army broke up, with men heading for home or attempting to escape abroad,<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> although the Appin Regiment amongst others was still in arms as late as July.\n\n{{see also|Skirmish of Loch nan Uamh}}\n\nMany senior Jacobites made their way to {{lang|gd|[[Loch nan Uamh]]}}, where Charles Edward Stuart had first landed at the outset of the campaign in 1745. Here on 30 April they were met by two French [[frigate]]s \u2013 the [[French privateer Mars (1746)|''Mars'']] and [[French privateer Bellone (1745)|''Bellone'']]. Two days later the French ships were spotted and attacked by three smaller [[Royal Navy]] [[sloops]] \u2013 the ''[[HMS Greyhound (1741)|Greyhound]]'', [[HMS Baltimore (1742)|''Baltimore'']], and ''[[HMS Terror (1741)|Terror]]''. The result was the last real engagement of the campaign; during the six hours in which the battle continued the Jacobites recovered cargo which had been landed by the French ships, including [[pounds sterling|\u00a3]]35,000 of gold.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/>\n\nWith visible proof that the French had not deserted them, a group of Jacobite leaders attempted to prolong the campaign. On 8 May, nearby at [[Murlaggan]], Lochiel, Lochgarry, Clanranald and Barisdale all agreed to rendezvous at Invermallie on 18 May, as did [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and his son. The plan was that there they would be joined by what remained of Keppoch's men and Macpherson of Cluny's regiment, which had not taken part in the battle at Culloden. However, things did not go as planned; after about a month of relative inactivity, Cumberland moved his army into the Highlands and on 17 May three battalions of regulars and eight Highland companies reoccupied Fort Augustus. The same day, the Macphersons surrendered. On the day of the planned rendezvous, Clanranald never appeared and Lochgarry and Barisdale only showed up with about 300 combined, most of whom immediately dispersed in search of food: Lochiel, who commanded possibly the strongest Jacobite regiment at Culloden, was only able to muster 300 men. The group dispersed, and the following week the Government launched [[raids on Lochaber and Shiramore|punitive expeditions into the Highlands which continued throughout the summer]].<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/><ref name=\"JLR2002-182-183\"/>\n\nFollowing his flight from the battle, Charles Edward Stuart made his way towards the [[Hebrides]], accompanied by a small group of supporters. By 20 April, Charles had reached {{lang|gd|[[Arisaig]]}} on the west coast of Scotland. After spending a few days with his close associates, he sailed for the island of [[Benbecula]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]]. From there he travelled to [[Scalpay, Outer Hebrides|Scalpay]], off the east coast of [[Harris (Scotland)|Harris]], and from there made his way to [[Stornoway]].<ref name=\"PH1991-8586\"/> For five months Charles criss-crossed the Hebrides, constantly pursued by government supporters and under threat from local [[laird]]s who were tempted to betray him for the \u00a330,000 upon his head.<ref name=\"JP1973-301\">Prebble (1973), p. 301.</ref> During this time he met [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora Macdonald]], who famously aided him in a narrow escape to [[Skye]].

In any event, Cumberland's order was not carried out for two days, after which contemporary accounts report then that for the next two days the moor was searched and all those wounded were put to death.

Interesting finds have been made in the areas where the fiercest fighting occurred on the government left wing, particularly where Barrell's and Dejean's regiments stood. For example, pistol balls and pieces of shattered muskets have been uncovered here which indicate close quarters fighting, as pistols were only used at close range and the musket pieces appear to have been smashed by pistol/musket balls or heavy broadswords. Finds of musket balls appear to mirror the lines of men who stood and fought. Some balls appear to have been dropped without being fired, some missed their targets, and others are distorted from hitting human bodies. In some cases it may be possible to identify whether the Jacobites or government soldiers fired certain rounds, because the Jacobite forces are known to have used a large quantity of French muskets which fired a slightly smaller [[caliber|calibre]] shot than that of the British Army's ''[[Brown Bess]]''. Analysis of the finds confirms that the Jacobites used muskets in greater numbers than has traditionally been thought. Not far from where the hand-to-hand fighting took place, fragments of mortar shells have been found.<ref name=\"gla.ac.uk-culloden\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/battlefieldarchaeology/centreprojects/culloden/|title=Point of Contact: Archaeology at Culloden|accessdate=6 March 2009|work=University of Glasgow Centre for Battlefield Archaeology}}</ref> Though Forbes's headstones mark the graves of the Jacobites, the location of the graves of about sixty government soldiers is unknown. The recent discovery of a 1752 silver ''[[Thaler]]'', from the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], may however lead archaeologists to these graves. A geophysical survey, directly beneath the spot where the coin was found, seems to indicate the existence of a large rectangular burial pit. It is thought possible that the coin was dropped by a soldier who once served on the continent, while he visited the graves of his fallen comrades.<ref name=\"gla.ac.uk-culloden\"/>\nThe National Trust of Scotland is currently attempting to restore Culloden Moor, as closely as possible, to the state it was in during the Battle of Culloden Moor.
