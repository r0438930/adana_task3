Christian Zucconi (vocals, guitar), Sean Gadd (bass), Andrew Wessen (guitar, vocals), and Ryan Rabin (drums).\n\nRyan Rabin produced their debut EP, ''[[Grouplove (EP)|Grouplove]]'', which was originally released independently, and was later re-released by Canvasback/Atlantic with a bonus track and their hit song, \"[[Colours (Grouplove song)|Colours]]\". They are also known for their single \"[[Tongue Tied (Grouplove song)|Tongue Tied]]\". Their debut album, ''[[Never Trust a Happy Song]]'', was also produced by Rabin and was released worldwide on September 13, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drummagazine.com/features/post/ryan-rabin-gettin-down-to-business |title=Ryan Rabin Of Grouplove: Down To Business \u2013 DRUM!

Hooper met Zucconi on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] after hearing and enjoying his music from his former band [[ALOKE]]. Despite having just met, Hooper invited Zucconi to an artist residency in [[Crete]] she was leaving for later that week.<ref name=\"Grouplove\u2019s Christian Zucconi\">{{cite news|author=Fortune, Drew | title=Interview With Grouplove\u2019s Christian Zucconi|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/grouploves-christian-zucconi,73655/|newspaper=A.V.

Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, grew up in [[Los Angeles]] with Wessen, a surfer and guitarist. Rabin comes from a musical family \u2013 his father is [[Trevor Rabin]], former guitarist of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from [[London]], was also at the commune. The friendship between the members formed quickly, but the band did not form until a year later after Gadd, Zucconi and Hooper pooled their funds together and made a trip to Rabin's Los Angeles recording studio. They played their first show at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010.  Later that year, the band went on tour with [[Florence and The Machine]] on the west coast, and then [[The Joy Formidable]] on the east coast.
