The song was written by [[Jim Jonsin]], [[Rico Love]], Daniel Morris and [[Lil Wayne]], with Jonsin producing the song and Lil Wayne having featured vocals. The [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] slow-jam serves as the [[lead single]] from ''Here I Am'' and was released from April 8, 2011. Upon release, \"Motivation\" received favorable reviews from critics generally praising the sexiness of the song. Official remixes were produced for the song, including a [[dubstep]]-inspired [[electronic music|electronic]] mix by [[Diplo (producer)|Diplo]] and a rap remix by [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Trey Songz]] and [[Fabolous]].\n\nIn the United States, the song has peaked at number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart where it stayed seven weeks in a row, and number seventeen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rowland's second US top 20 hit (fourth top 30 overall) and her second highest performing single to date as a solo artist, behind \"[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]\". It was certified [[double platinum]] by the [[RIAA]] in May 2013.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Sarah Chatfield, the director behind Rowland's previous video \"[[Forever and a Day (Kelly Rowland song)|Forever and a Day]]\" (2010). It follows a number of sultry scenes where Rowland dances seductively amongst partially dressed dancers in a dimly-lit warehouse, with the entire video tinged in blue light. \"Motivation\" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]]. Rowland sang the song with Trey Songz at the [[BET Awards of 2011|2011 BET Awards]] ceremony.\n\n==Background and release==\n''Here I Am'' was originally scheduled for release in 2010, but was pushed back numerous times. Initially the [[dance music|dance]]-influenced \"[[Commander (song)|Commander]]\" served as the album's [[lead single]] for international territories while two separate singles were serviced in the United States. \"[[Rose Colored Glasses (Kelly Rowland song)|Rose Colored Glasses]]\" for the [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] format and \"[[Grown Woman (Kelly Rowland song)|Grown Woman]]\" for the [[urban contemporary|urban]] format.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/press/ldquocommanderrdquo-featuring-david-guetta,1372294.html |title=Kelly Rowland Scores No. 1 Hit on Billboard\u2019s Dance/Club Play Songs Chart with \"Commander,\" Featuring David Guetta |publisher=The Earth Times |author=Universal Motown Records Group |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5srof0lkH |archivedate=2011-09-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Single Plans\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a225421/kelly-rowland-alters-single-release-plans.html |title=Kelly Rowland Alters Single Release Plans |publisher=[[Digital Spy]].
