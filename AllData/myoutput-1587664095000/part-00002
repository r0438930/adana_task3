The purpose of the K-1 Visa is to allow time for the couple to make arrangements for and actually have the marriage ceremony.  The visa is not to give the couple time \"to decide IF\" they will marry. Each couple has already signed document(s) stating that they have promised to marry each other, and provided the signed document(s) to the US Immigration services to get the K-1 Visa. \n\nThe series debuted on January 12, 2014, and has been renewed through its seventh season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a27214674/90-day-fiance-season-7-news-cast-spoilers/|title=When Is a New Season of \u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019 Coming?|last=Beck|first=Laura|date=2019-04-25|website=Cosmopolitan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe series currently has seven spin-offs: ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After]]'', which documents the ups and downs of past ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' couples after their marriage; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Before the 90 Days]],'' which follows couples that have met each other online, but have not yet started the K-1 visa process; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?]],'' an original digital series that gives updates on past 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 couples; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way]],'' a dedicated series to couples where the American partner permanently moves into their partner's home country instead of the foreign partner doing so; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk]],'' a reaction show featuring a number of previous cast members that take part in reacting to an episode of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After; [[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#The Family Chantel|The Family Chantel]],'' focused on the relationship of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' season four cast members Pedro and Chantel, and their immediate family; and ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Self-Quarantined|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Self-Quarantined]]'', which follows the lives of previous ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' couples during the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|2020 COVID-19 outbreak]].\n\n==''K-1 visa process''==\n{{Main|K-1 visa}}\nThe show is based on the K-1 visa process, which begins with the petitioner meeting the beneficiary inside or outside the United States, then filing a I-129F petition with evidence of meeting and of a relationship. After the petition is approved, the petitioner must pass biometrics and then the process is sent to the foreign embassy of the beneficiary. The beneficiary then files for a visa, before or after passing the medical requirements and is called for an interview, in which the beneficiary must prove that they meet the requirements of the visa, including having strong evidence of meeting and a valid relationship. If approved, the foreign fianc\u00e9 travels to the States to live with his or her prospective American spouse. The couple must marry within 90 days, otherwise the beneficiary must leave the country. The couple may face language barriers, culture shock, the stigma of being thought of as a \"[[mail-order bride]]\" as well as skepticism of friends and family.  Professor Lenni B. Benson of the New York Law School has stated that  although the K-1 visa program is widely associated with [[sham marriage]]s, \"It is not true in the majority of cases.\" <ref>{{cite news |title=\u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019: An Anti-Fantasy for Troubled Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/television/90-day-fiance-immigration.html |accessdate=20 August 2019 |publisher=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Season 1 cast==\n\n===Russ & Paola===\nRuss Mayfield (27, from [[Owasso, Oklahoma]]) met Paola \"Pao\" (26, from [[Bucaramanga]], [[Colombia]]), a fashion designer, while he was in Colombia on a work assignment in the [[petroleum industry]].

However, the two reconciled and Anfisa agreed to travel to the United States. Jorge pleaded guilty to marijuana trafficking, which made it hard for him to rent an apartment. They moved into a hotel and Anfisa was not impressed (though why exactly Jorge does not have his own place to live has not been revealed). They later moved into a small apartment. Jorge did not buy an engagement ring or wedding dress for Anfisa, and Jorge's friends and family became concerned about Anfisa's motives. Anfisa admitted that she was indeed interested in Jorge providing for her and stated that while she may be using Jorge for his money, Jorge is primarily interested in her for her looks and would not want to marry her if she was ugly. Anfisa considered returning to Russia, and Jorge considered not trying to stop her. They later got married alone in a simple courthouse ceremony, after which Jorge promised both to buy a ring for Anfisa and to hold a bigger ceremony her family could attend.\n\nJorge's sister confronted Anfisa at a restaurant about her demands. They remained living in a small apartment, Jorge did not buy Anfisa a ring.  Later they separated for a few months and Anfisa got a new apartment, driver's license and a car.

Nicole is thrilled to be in Morocco with Azan (later calling him her \"Arabian Prince\"), though he has a hard time persuading her that in his culture it is not acceptable for unmarried couples to be physically affectionate. Nicole persists in trying to hug and kiss Azan, which only causes him to become irritated. Nicole feels shunned and unsure of their relationship. Azan takes Nicole to [[Agadir]] to visit his family; she is warmly welcomed by the family. Nicole later reveals that she cheated on Azan, which could end the relationship.

The purpose of the K-1 Visa is to allow time for the couple to make arrangements for and actually have the marriage ceremony.  The visa is not to give the couple time \"to decide IF\" they will marry. Each couple has already signed document(s) stating that they have promised to marry each other, and provided the signed document(s) to the US Immigration services to get the K-1 Visa. \n\nThe series debuted on January 12, 2014, and has been renewed through its seventh season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a27214674/90-day-fiance-season-7-news-cast-spoilers/|title=When Is a New Season of \u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019 Coming?|last=Beck|first=Laura|date=2019-04-25|website=Cosmopolitan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe series currently has seven spin-offs: ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After]]'', which documents the ups and downs of past ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' couples after their marriage; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Before the 90 Days]],'' which follows couples that have met each other online, but have not yet started the K-1 visa process; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?]],'' an original digital series that gives updates on past 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 couples; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way]],'' a dedicated series to couples where the American partner permanently moves into their partner's home country instead of the foreign partner doing so; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk]],'' a reaction show featuring a number of previous cast members that take part in reacting to an episode of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After; [[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#The Family Chantel|The Family Chantel]],'' focused on the relationship of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' season four cast members Pedro and Chantel, and their immediate family; and ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Self-Quarantined|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Self-Quarantined]]'', which follows the lives of previous ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' couples during the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|2020 COVID-19 outbreak]].\n\n==''K-1 visa process''==\n{{Main|K-1 visa}}\nThe show is based on the K-1 visa process, which begins with the petitioner meeting the beneficiary inside or outside the United States, then filing a I-129F petition with evidence of meeting and of a relationship. After the petition is approved, the petitioner must pass biometrics and then the process is sent to the foreign embassy of the beneficiary. The beneficiary then files for a visa, before or after passing the medical requirements and is called for an interview, in which the beneficiary must prove that they meet the requirements of the visa, including having strong evidence of meeting and a valid relationship. If approved, the foreign fianc\u00e9 travels to the States to live with his or her prospective American spouse. The couple must marry within 90 days, otherwise the beneficiary must leave the country. The couple may face language barriers, culture shock, the stigma of being thought of as a \"[[mail-order bride]]\" as well as skepticism of friends and family.  Professor Lenni B. Benson of the New York Law School has stated that  although the K-1 visa program is widely associated with [[sham marriage]]s, \"It is not true in the majority of cases.\"  <ref>{{cite news |title=\u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019: An Anti-Fantasy for Troubled Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/television/90-day-fiance-immigration.html |accessdate=20 August 2019 |publisher=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Season 1 cast==\n\n===Russ & Paola===\nRuss Mayfield (27, from [[Owasso, Oklahoma]]) met Paola \"Pao\" (26, from [[Bucaramanga]], [[Colombia]]), a fashion designer, while he was in Colombia on a work assignment in the [[petroleum industry]].
