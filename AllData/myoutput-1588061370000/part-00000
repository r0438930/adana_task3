The club's origins can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was subsequently renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] including the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] surrounding the site where various sports facilities were built. An amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861. They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. The Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace exhibition building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] in 1895 at the sports stadium inside the Palace grounds and ten years later decided to form a new professional club to play at the venue. They stayed here until 1915, but were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and eventually moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924.\n\nPalace applied to gain election to the [[Football League]] in 1905, but missed out by one vote. They instead joined the [[Southern Football League]] Second Division and were champions in their first season. The club played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years. The Football League was restructured in 1920 which saw the majority of the Southern League First Division forming a new [[Football League Third Division]] which Palace became founder members of. At the end of the season Palace were crowned champions and gained promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After four seasons they suffered relegation to what was then the [[Third Division South]] and remained here until the Football League was restructured which saw Palace become founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1958. Over the next eleven years, under the chairmanship of [[Arthur Wait]], the club progressed up to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], then the top flight of English football. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era played for the first time in London in a friendly match at Selhurst Park. In 1973, the manager at that time [[Bert Head]] was moved upstairs to take the position of general manager. [[Malcolm Allison]] was brought in as team manager, but Palace were relegated back to the Second Division, and then to the Third in consecutive seasons. Allison instigated a number of changes at the club, their original nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and they ended the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. \n\nAt the end of the [[1975\u201376 Football League|1975\u201376]] season, Allison left the club, and [[Terry Venables]] became manager taking Palace back to the top flight with promotions in 1977 and 1979. The period between 1989\u201391, under chairman [[Ron Noades]] and manager [[Steve Coppell]], saw the club reach the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], and finish in third place in the top division in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season, only missing out on European qualification due to the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Palace became founder members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club bounced between the top two divisions during the rest of the 1990s, and enjoyed runs to the semi-finals of both the [[Football League Cup|League]] and [[FA Cup|FA]] Cups in 1995, before suffering [[Administration (law)|administration]] under the chairmanship of [[Mark Goldberg]]. Under new owner [[Simon Jordan]] the club spent much of its time in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] over the next ten years with a brief spell in the Premier League during [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]]. Another administration in 2010 saw the club emerge owned by a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]]. Palace then achieved promotion back to the Premier League via the [[Football League play-offs]] in 2013, and have since maintained their place among the elite and also reached the [[2016 FA Cup Final]].\n\n==Origins and formation (1854\u20131905)==\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|right|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\nBetween 1852 and 1854, the glass exhibition building known as [[The Crystal Palace]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] \u2013 including the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] surrounding the site where various sports facilities were built. The earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861 as an amateur outfit.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]] reaching the [[FA Cup Semi-finals|semi-finals]] where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] in a replay after the first game ended goalless. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the Football Association adopted a new permanent home for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] which was to be played at the sports stadium situated inside the historic grounds of the Palace. With the owners also reliant on tourist activity for their income, they sought fresh attractions for the venue, and founded the [[London County Cricket Club]] of [[W. G. Grace]] before turning their attention to football.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;11\u201313</ref>\n\nThe idea of a new club playing at the Crystal Palace stadium was proposed in 1904 by the Crystal Palace Company. The proposal was rejected by the Football Association, who disliked the idea that the owners of the Cup Final venue would also possess their own football club. However a separate company was established the following year to form the club under the chairmanship of [[Sydney Bourne]], who was chosen due to his propensity in buying tickets to the Cup Final.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\n==Southern League (1905\u201320)==\n{{see also|1905 in association football}}\n\n[[File:Crystal palace fc 1905-06.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Crystal Palace squad of 1905\u201306.]]\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club was founded on 10 September 1905,<ref name=CPOS>{{cite web|last=Byfield |first=Terry |title=History |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |accessdate=27 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6e96TrN?url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> playing in the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] colours of claret and blue.<ref name=RG1>{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781848365421|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}</ref> The choice of colours was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by [[Edmund Goodman]], an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].

Unfortunately, it was Chelsea that were accepted, and the club were forced to settle for a place in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division.<ref name=ADDI /> To increase the number of club fixtures, Palace also joined the mid-week United Counties League.<ref name=ADDI /> Robson established a team of sixteen professionals, mainly drawn from Middlesbrough. The club's inaugural campaign, which consisted mainly of matches against other clubs' reserve sides, alongside [[Southall F.C.|Southall]], [[Southern United F.C.|Southern United]], [[Hastings & St Leonards United F.C.|St. Leonards United]] and [[Grays United F.C.|Grays United]],<ref name=ADDI /> was a successful one. Their opening match was against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] Reserves, and approximately 3,000 people paid 6d to stand or a shilling to be seated. Palace led 3\u20130 after 30 minutes, before fading and losing 3\u20134. However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and were promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9\u20131 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4\u20130 defeat of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] Reserves in March.<ref>Matthews, p.14</ref>\n\nFollowing their championship win, Palace started their second season as a club in the Southern League First Division, placing nineteenth at the end of the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating [[Rotherham County F.C.|Rotherham County]] in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another title. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Palace scored through [[Horace Astley]] against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock [[Newcastle United F.C. 0\u20131 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1\u20130]] win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who were flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4\u20130 winners.<ref>Matthews, pp.15\u201316</ref>\n\n[[File:Ted Smith goal for Crystal Palace circa 1914.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A headed goal scored by [[Edwin Smith (footballer)|Edwin Smith]] from a [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Billy Davies]] cross against [[Reading F.C.]], c.&nbsp;1914]]\nJohn Robson left Palace to manage neighbours [[Croydon Common F.C.]] for the 1907\u201308 season, and Edmund Goodman took over as manager and club secretary. The club had a good season, finishing fourth. [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Bill Davies]] became the first player from the club to be capped at international level when he was called up for [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup Palace lost 0\u20139 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a second round replay, which was a record defeat for the club. Palace managed to finish fourth again in the league the following season, losing just one game in the first twelve, and repeated their fourth-place finish the season after, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club won the [[London Challenge Cup]] in 1913, overcoming [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 1\u20130. After seventh and fifth-place finishes, Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913\u201314 season, with the club putting together some long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 2\u20131 at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]], and provided their first [[England national football team|England]] representative in [[Horace Colclough]], who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March.<ref>Matthews, pp.16\u201319</ref>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] on 4 August 1914, Palace had three players called up as [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Reservists]] before the season started. Former Palace players [[Ginger Williams (footballer)|Ginger Williams]] and [[Joe Bulcock]] were amongst those killed in the conflict. In March 1915, [[The Admiralty]], who had taken over the Palace and its grounds at the start of the war, ordered the club to leave and Palace chose to move to [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. When Croydon Common F.C. failed to return to business after the war, Palace moved to their ground known as [[The Nest (stadium)|The Nest]] which was opposite [[Selhurst railway station]]. In the first full season after the war, Palace finished in third place in 1919\u201320.<ref>Matthews, pp.19, 23\u201326</ref>\n\n==The Football League (1920\u201358)==\nCrystal Palace became a Football League club in 1920 when the Southern League First Division clubs were admitted ''en bloc'' as founder members of a newly formed Football League [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In their first season as a Football League club, Palace lost their opening game at [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] 1\u20132 with A.G. Milligan scoring the club's first ever Football League goal. Milligan's Palace career was short-lived however, and he made just one more appearance for the club. Palace's first ever home Football League match was a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], but the club then went on a run of six consecutive wins. Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], who had been signed in 1919, kept a clean sheet in all of those wins and Palace lost just six more games all season. They were unbeaten in the final sixteen games of the season which included an eight-game winning streak and went on to win the championship by five points from Southampton. The feat earned them promotion to the Second Division. The club conceded just thirty four goals over the season, a record that stood until 1978\u201379,<ref>Matthews, p.26, 28</ref> and they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace also won their third London Challenge Cup, beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] 1\u20130 at [[White Hart Lane]] with a goal from forward [[John Conner (footballer)|John Conner]].<ref>Matthews, p.29</ref>\n\n[[File:Jack Alderson Caricature 1922.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], caricatured in the ''Football Special'' in 1922.

This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]<nowiki/> were formed, but for now Palace were above all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the match against Fulham. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table during the following season, 1922\u201323, eventually finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.<ref>Matthews, pp.29\u201330</ref>\n\nBack in 1919, the Palace minute book contained an entry instructing the Secretary to investigate the possibility of obtaining a lease on the 'ground at Selhurst', although calling it a 'ground' was a little misleading since at the time it was a piece of wasteland valuable only to the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company]]. At one time it had been a brickfield, and two chimney stacks still remained. On 3 January 1922 the club purchased the ground at a cost of \u00a32,750, and renowned football ground architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was commissioned to design [[Selhurst Park]]. Leitch had designed stands at [[Craven Cottage]], [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], White Hart Lane and [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]], but the design for Selhurst Park was unusual in that it had no roof gable. The other three sides of the ground remained open banking with just the lower parts being terraced. Construction work was delayed by industrial disputes, and when the ground was opened by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] on the 30 August 1924, the stand had not been completed. It did however boast many luxuries, including \"offices, tea rooms, training quarters, plunge, slipper shower and needle baths\". The opening fixture was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]], and in front of a crowd of 25,000, Palace lost 0\u20131, with the first goal at Selhurst Park being scored by Billy Marsden. That defeat set the tone for the season, with the club eventually finishing in twenty-first place \u2013 and were relegated along with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. A win in the last game at home to [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] would have secured survival, but Palace went down 0\u20131 and it would be almost 40 years before Palace would again grace the second level of English football. One small consolation was the decision by the FA to stage the England versus Wales international at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1926. It remains the only full international match to be staged at the ground.<ref>Matthews, pp.30, 33\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter one season in the Third Division South and eighteen in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, their stay in the division was to last as long as the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to get out of, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Third Division South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth and also finished runners-up no less than three times. At the start of the 1939\u201340 season, Palace were sitting second in the table, but the season was cancelled after just three matches with the onset of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Matthews, pp.35\u201336, 39\u201346</ref>\n\nThe war years of 1939\u201345 saw football enter a period of disarray with the creation of [[Wartime League]]s. Palace joined the South \"A\" Division in 1939, but also joined the South League \"D\" in 1940, winning the latter competition, and then promptly winning an improvised South Regional League the following season on goal average. Palace joined the London League for the 1941\u201342 season, with the clubs in London refusing to accept the ad-hoc competitions the Football League were organising. This division only lasted that season before the London clubs were back in the Football League fold, with Palace joining the Football League South for the next four seasons.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;57\u201361</ref> The club fielded 186 different players during the seven wartime seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~754182,00.html |title=Palace During WWII |accessdate=27 March 2009 |publisher=Crystal Palace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214005340/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~754182%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKit changes had been introduced in the late 1930s. The 1937\u201338 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948\u201349, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and applying for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1950\u201351, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in the bottom half of the table until the league was restructured in 1958\u201359, requiring re-election for a third and final time in 1955\u201356, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\"/>\n\n==Rising through the divisions (1958\u201373)==\nThe 1958\u201359 season began a period of change, with [[Arthur Wait]] taking control of the club as chairman and the league was restructured with Palace playing in the new Fourth Division. This new division had been formed with the merging of the clubs in the bottom half of Third Division South with those in the bottom half of Third Division North. Palace had failed to qualify for the new Third Division, falling outside the top twelve finish required by two places. Their first season in the Fourth Division saw Palace finish seventh, with the club faring slightly worse the following season with an eighth place finish. Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960 and the club then enjoyed a successful 1960\u201361 season, finishing second behind league newcomers [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], who thus matched Palace's 1920\u201321 achievement of winning a championship in their inaugural league season. Palace also set Fourth Division records for the highest average attendance of 19,092, and the highest attendance at an individual match; 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |title=Division Four 1960/61 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6eJurvH?url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Surrey-born [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] scored 31 of Palace's 110 goals, and his strike partner [[Roy Summersby]] netted 25 as Palace moved up to Division Three.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;79\u201380, 87\u201390</ref>\n\nPalace finished fifteenth in Division Three at the end of the 1961\u201362 season.

After international recognition, the West Ham manager [[Ron Greenwood]] paid a British record transfer fee of \u00a365,000 and ex-Palace striker [[Ron Brett]] in exchange to take \"Budgie\" to the Hammers in March 1962. This was a record fee between two British clubs at the time.

Johnny Byrne returned to the Palace line-up as a guest player. Madrid ended up 4\u20133 winners. Arthur Rowe resigned due to health reasons in December 1962 and the club appointed former player [[Dick Graham]] as manager. The 1962\u201363 season saw Palace finish eleventh, before gaining promotion to the Second Division the following season after finishing second behind Coventry City on goal average.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;93\u201395</ref> \n\nFor the following four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes in the Second Division, during which they appointed [[Bert Head]] as their new manager in April 1966. Head promoted from the youth team and transferred in players both new and old, delighting the fans by re-signing old favourite Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968\u201369 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates at the beginning of the season, finished second behind [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] who were managed by [[Brian Clough]]. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.<ref>Matthews, pp.95\u201396, 103\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[The Dave Clark Five|The Dave Clark Five's]] chart-hit \"[[Glad All Over]]\" became a huge crowd favourite at this time with the Palace fans banging on advertising hoardings in time with the drum beat in the chorus of the song.<ref>Sedgwick, Fred. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/26/familyandrelationships.family9 Family: Playlist: The Football Anthems of My Youth].\" The Guardian: 7. 26 May 2007.

Scoring the first Division One goal for the club was [[Mel Blyth]] after six minutes, and a second goal from new signing [[Gerry Queen]] saw Palace hold United to a 2\u20132 draw with goalkeeper [[John Jackson (footballer born 1942)|John Jackson]] denying [[George Best]] and [[Brian Kidd]]. The next match was another home game versus [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] which Palace won 2\u20130. After a season long struggle against relegation, Palace were eventually able to secure safety, finishing in twentieth place above demoted Sheffield Wednesday and Sunderland. The club managed to gain three new records for the First Division at the end of this season: the fewest goals scored; the fewest wins recorded by a non-relegated team; and the tally of twenty-seven points was the smallest number with which a team has avoided relegation from the top flight.<ref>Matthews, 113\u2013115</ref> Palace avoided the drop for two more seasons,<ref>Matthews, 115\u2013121</ref> and followed the trend of many other top flight clubs by introducing a new \"''Player of the Year''\" award which has been presented at the end of every season since the 1971\u201372 campaign. The first recipient was [[John McCormick (footballer, born 1936)|John McCormick]].<ref name=\"POTY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~559565,00.html |title=Player Of The Year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907141243/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~559565%2C00.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |publisher=cpfc.co.uk (Crystal Palace F.C.) |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite some good performances in the 1972\u201373 season, notably a 5\u20130 home win against Manchester United in December, Palace eventually succumbed to the drop in their fourth season in the top flight. Arthur Wait, having overseen the rise of the club from the Fourth to the First Division, was replaced as chairman by Raymond Bloye in November 1972, and the club also appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as the new manager in March the following year, replacing Bert Head. Although the club saw a record average attendance over the season, neither the crowd nor the managerial change were able to keep them at the top level. Allison's first game in charge at home against Chelsea did see some changes, however, including the debut of young Scottish defender [[Jim Cannon]]. Palace had never won a London derby in the top flight up to this point, but Cannon, who had come through the youth ranks, marked the Chelsea striker [[Peter Osgood]] out of the game and then scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win to begin a long career with the club.<ref>Matthews, pp.121\u2013122, 139\u2013140</ref>\n\n==The coming of The Eagles (1973\u201384)==\nDespite relegation, the 1973\u201374 season started with much optimism among the Palace supporters. Malcolm Allison had a strong recent record as a coach, having won trophies with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] as an assistant to [[Joe Mercer]]. Allison or 'Big Mal' as he was nicknamed in the press, had a flamboyant personality which was something of a change for the club, who previously had a rather conservative image. Palace's nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and the club also changed its colours from the original claret and sky blue to a red and dark blue scheme inspired by [[Barcelona FC|Barcelona]]. The Eagle was introduced as the club mascot at this time, an idea borrowed from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the club badge was redesigned. The new season saw the introduction of a three-up, three-down [[promotion and relegation]] system, and Palace struggled to find their feet in the Second Division, failing to win any of their first 15 league games. In bottom place for most of the season, the club, aided by the signing from [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] of pacey winger [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] climbed to seventeenth place with a 3\u20131 win at Fulham on [[Good Friday]]. The club then turned in three consecutive losses which saw them needing to win the last game of the season at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] to remain in the second tier of English football. They could only draw 1\u20131, and suffered relegation for a second successive season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\">Matthews, pp.141\u2013166</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace1970sbadge.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Malcolm Allison|Allison's]] rebranded Palace crest]]\n\nIn 1974\u201375, Palace's first season back in Division Three since 1963\u201364, saw the club miss out on promotion, finishing in fifth place. Allison acquired [[Terry Venables]] and [[Ian Evans (footballer)|Ian Evans]] from [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in exchange for [[Don Rogers (footballer)|Don Rogers]], a trade that was to be significant to Palace's, and indeed England's football future. It was also around this time that Allison persuaded the club to put more resources into developing a strong youth team, a decision that would lead to both success at youth level, and the emergence of a number of promising young players in the first team. Palace again failed to gain promotion the following season, distracted in part by their best run in the FA Cup up to that point. The club reached the semi-finals, beating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and Chelsea along the way, before losing 0\u20132 to Southampton at Stamford Bridge on 3 April 1976. Allison resigned at the end of the season, partly because of the failure to get Palace promoted, but also he had felt pressure due to some of his off the field antics, infamously getting himself photographed in the team bath with porn star [[Fiona Richmond]].<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\"/><ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/8067232/Malcolm-Allison.html Malcolm Allison].\" The Daily Telegraph: 31. 16 October 2010.

The Palace youngsters also won the [[FA Youth Cup]] with a side including [[Kenny Sansom]], [[Vince Hilaire]] and [[Billy Gilbert (footballer born 1959)|Billy Gilbert]]. The following season, 1977\u201378, saw the youth team become the first to win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea did in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the first team by the 1978\u201379 season, which saw Palace vying not only for promotion, but also the Second Division title. The final game of the season was a Friday night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,482, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the title to fierce rivals [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]]; a loss and Palace would stay down, with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed [[Ian Walsh (footballer)|Ian Walsh]] to head the opener, before a great run by [[David Swindlehurst]] was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2\u20130 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.\n\nAs an increasing number of players from the FA Youth Cup winning team had established themselves in the first team, the press gave Palace the title of the \"''Team of the Eighties''\". They began the 1979\u201380 season well and stayed unbeaten longer than any other club in the top flight and also went top of the table for the first and to date only time in the club's history when they beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] 4\u20131 at Selhurst Park in late September. Unfortunately the young starlets could not keep this form up, and a slide down the table resulted in the Eagles finishing thirteenth, which at that point was the club's highest ever league finish.<ref>Matthews, pp.223\u2013226</ref>\n\nThe slide continued into the 1980\u201381 season, with nine defeats in the first ten games, and Venables quit Palace to join QPR. The club were suffering financial problems as well, and were virtually relegated by the start of February when another, even bigger change occurred. [[Ron Noades]], previously the chairman of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], took financial control of the club, purchasing it from Raymond Bloye's consortium. Palace spent the next couple of seasons flirting with relegation from the second tier and there were numerous managerial changes including the unpopular appointment of ex-Brighton manager [[Alan Mullery]].\n\n==Steve Coppell era  (1984\u201393)==\n[[File:Steve coppell 2006 promotion celebration cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Steve Coppell, who led Palace to the FA Cup Final and a third place finish in the top flight. Coppell has managed the club over four separate spells.]]\nThe former Manchester United and England winger [[Steve Coppell]] was appointed as Palace's new manager for the 1984\u201385 season. Coppell's playing career had been cut short by a knee injury, and, assisted by former Palace player Ian Evans, he worked on rebuilding the club, signing the then unknown [[Ian Wright]] from non-league [[Greenwich Borough F.C.|Greenwich Borough]] and [[Mark Bright]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and the pair formed the \"''Wrighty & Brighty''\" strike partnership. Coppell stabilised the club in his first season, and after two seasons of narrowly missing out on the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]], they followed this up by only just missing out on automatic promotion by a single point. The club instead entered the [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1989 Second Division play-offs]], beating Swindon in the semi-finals to set up a two legged final against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the first leg at [[Ewood Park]] the [[Lancashire]] club won 3\u20131, but a 30,000 full house at Selhurst Park saw the Eagles triumph 3\u20130 after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the second leg to end their eight-year exile from the top flight. Ian Wright, who scored 24 league goals, and 33 in all competitions in the promotion campaign, was voted player of the year by the club's supporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=1988/89 revisited|date=26 July 2009|url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|work=holmesdale.net|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f2D9LR?url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|access-date=11 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Matthews, p.289-292, 311\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;289\u2013292, 311</ref><ref>Matthews, pp.226\u2013236, 267\u2013285</ref>\n\nPalace began their first top flight campaign in almost a decade by re-signing [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1964)|Andy Gray]] from QPR for \u00a3500,000. In November, the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] goalkeeper [[Nigel Martyn]] for \u00a31 million \u2013 a record fee for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most of the first half in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams ([[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool team that had beaten them 9\u20130 in the league earlier in the season. The tie was played at [[Villa Park]], and saw Liverpool score first to lead 1\u20130 at half-time. Palace emerged from the interval with a sense of purpose, and within a minute of the restart equalised through Mark Bright. After going 2\u20131 up, Palace then found themselves 2\u20133 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. However an equaliser by Andy Gray with just two minutes remaining took the tie into extra-time, with the winner scored by [[Alan Pardew]] in a thrilling 4\u20133 victory and for the first time in their history, Palace were in the [[1990 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]].<ref>Matthews, pp.289\u2013292, 311</ref>\n\nTheir first ever appearance at Wembley Stadium saw Palace facing [[Alex Ferguson|Alex Ferguson's]] Manchester United. [[Gary O'Reilly]] opened the scoring for Palace, but [[Bryan Robson]] and [[Mark Hughes]] put United 2\u20131 up. Ian Wright then equalised immediately after coming onto the pitch as a substitute to take the final into extra-time, before scoring again early in the added period to put Palace back in the lead. Hughes scored his second late on for United to leave the game drawn 3\u20133 and requiring a replay. In the replay Palace chose to wear a new one-off change strip of yellow and black striped shirts<ref>{{cite web|title=English FA Cup Finalists 1990\u20131999 |url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html |work=Historical Football Kits |first=Dave |last=Moor |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f4wd3o?url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Palace In Colour Crisis|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Uq5UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cZADAAAAIBAJ&dq=crystal%20palace&pg=6631%2C381211|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=17 May 1990|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> The replay saw United left-back [[Lee Martin (footballer born February 1968)|Lee Martin]] cap a 40-yard run by slotting past Nigel Martyn to win the Cup for the Red Devils.<ref>Matthews, p.311</ref>\n\nThe club built on the success of the previous season and even challenged for the [[List of English football champions|English league title]] for most of the next season, but fell just short of eventual champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and runners-up Liverpool, finishing a club-best third in the top flight. Palace were unfortunate to miss out on a place in Europe because although the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985 had now been lifted, there would only be one place available in the [[UEFA Cup 1991-92|1991\u201392]] edition of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and this went to Liverpool rather than Palace. Success was achieved that season however when Palace made their third trip to Wembley in twelve months, beating Everton 4\u20131 in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]] of the [[Full Members Cup]].\n\nThe following season was to become one marked by controversy. In September, [[Channel 4]] showed a documentary called ''Critical Eye \u2013 Great Britain United'', which featured interviews with a number of club personnel. Among them was chairman Ron Noades, who commented \"when you're getting into mid-winter in England, you need a few hard white men to carry the artistic black players through\". Noades claimed he was reported out of context, an allegation rejected by the programme makers,<ref>Duncan, John. \"Noades Still Under Fire.\" The Guardian: 16. 17 September 1991. ProQuest. Web. 30 May 2013.</ref> and his comments stunned Palace's many black players. Ian Wright left the club soon after, transferring to Arsenal for \u00a32.5 million and Palace finished tenth in the First Division at the end of the [[1991-92 in English football|1991\u201392 season]]. A breakaway by the top 22 clubs saw Palace become founder members of the new [[FA Premier League]] for the [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Mark Bright was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in September and the Eagles struggled to score goals without him. They were relegated on goal difference, after Oldham Athletic's 4\u20133 victory over Southampton on the last day of the season. Palace's 49 points from 42 games that season became the joint-highest total of any club ever to have been relegated from the top flight of English football, and remains a Premier League record. The club's relegation prompted the resignation of Coppell after nine years at the helm, and he was succeeded by his assistant [[Alan Smith (football manager)|Alan Smith]].<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;314\u2013320</ref>\n\n==Ups and downs (1993\u201398)==\n<!-- [[File:Eric Cantona kung-fu kick.jpg|thumb|Ex-[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] player [[Eric Cantona]] kicks spectator Matthew Simmons]] -->\n\nAlan Smith immediately guided Palace back to the Premier League as runaway champions of the second tier,<ref>Alexander, Jeremy. \"Soccer: FIRST DIVISION: Palace Promoted a Day Late Luton Town 0, Crystal Palace 1.\" The Guardian (pre-1997 Fulltext): 0. 18 April 1994.

The club's origins can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was subsequently renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] including the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] surrounding the site where various sports facilities were built. An amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861. They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. The Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace exhibition building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] in 1895 at the sports stadium inside the Palace grounds and ten years later decided to form a new professional club to play at the venue. They stayed here until 1915, but were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and eventually moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924.\n\nPalace applied to gain election to the [[Football League]] in 1905, but missed out by one vote. They instead joined the [[Southern Football League]] Second Division and were champions in their first season. The club played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years. The Football League was restructured in 1920 which saw the majority of the Southern League First Division forming a new [[Football League Third Division]] which Palace became founder members of. At the end of the season Palace were crowned champions and gained promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After four seasons they suffered relegation to what was then the [[Third Division South]] and remained here until the Football League was restructured which saw Palace become founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1958. Over the next eleven years, under the chairmanship of [[Arthur Wait]], the club progressed up to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], then the top flight of English football. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era played for the first time in London in a friendly match at Selhurst Park. In 1973, the manager at that time [[Bert Head]] was moved upstairs to take the position of general manager. [[Malcolm Allison]] was brought in as team manager, but Palace were relegated back to the Second Division, and then to the Third in consecutive seasons. Allison instigated a number of changes at the club, their original nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and they ended the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. \n\nAt the end of the [[1975\u201376 Football League|1975\u201376]] season, Allison left the club, and [[Terry Venables]] became manager taking Palace back to the top flight with promotions in 1977 and 1979. The period between 1989\u201391, under chairman [[Ron Noades]] and manager [[Steve Coppell]], saw the club reach the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], and finish in third place in the top division in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season, only missing out on European qualification due to the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Palace became founder members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club bounced between the top two divisions during the rest of the 1990s, and enjoyed runs to the semi-finals of both the [[Football League Cup|League]] and [[FA Cup|FA]] Cups in 1995, before suffering [[Administration (law)|administration]] under the chairmanship of [[Mark Goldberg]]. Under new owner [[Simon Jordan]] the club spent much of its time in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] over the next ten years with a brief spell in the Premier League during [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]]. Another administration in 2010 saw the club emerge owned by a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]]. Palace then achieved promotion back to the Premier League via the [[Football League play-offs]] in 2013, and have since maintained their place among the elite and also reached the [[2016 FA Cup Final]].\n\n==Origins and formation (1854\u20131905)==\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|right|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\nBetween 1852 and 1854, the glass exhibition building known as [[The Crystal Palace]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] \u2013 including the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] surrounding the site, where various sports facilities were built. The earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861 as an amateur outfit.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]] reaching the [[FA Cup Semi-finals|semi-finals]] where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] in a replay after the first game ended goalless. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the Football Association adopted a new permanent home for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] which was to be played at the sports stadium situated inside the historic grounds of the Palace. With the owners also reliant on tourist activity for their income, they sought fresh attractions for the venue, and founded the [[London County Cricket Club]] of [[W. G. Grace]] before turning their attention to football.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;11\u201313</ref>\n\nThe idea of a new club playing at the Crystal Palace stadium was proposed in 1904 by the Crystal Palace Company. The proposal was rejected by the Football Association, who disliked the idea that the owners of the Cup Final venue would also possess their own football club. However a separate company was established the following year to form the club under the chairmanship of [[Sydney Bourne]], who was chosen due to his propensity in buying tickets to the Cup Final.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\n==Southern League (1905\u201320)==\n{{see also|1905 in association football}}\n\n[[File:Crystal palace fc 1905-06.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Crystal Palace squad of 1905\u201306.]]\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club was founded on 10 September 1905,<ref name=CPOS>{{cite web|last=Byfield |first=Terry |title=History |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |accessdate=27 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6e96TrN?url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> playing in the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] colours of claret and blue.<ref name=RG1>{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781848365421|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}</ref> The choice of colours was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by [[Edmund Goodman]], an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].

Unfortunately, it was Chelsea that were accepted, and the club were forced to settle for a place in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division.<ref name=ADDI /> To increase the number of club fixtures, Palace also joined the mid-week United Counties League.<ref name=ADDI /> Robson established a team of sixteen professionals, mainly drawn from Middlesbrough. The club's inaugural campaign, which consisted mainly of matches against other clubs' reserve sides, alongside [[Southall F.C.|Southall]], [[Southern United F.C.|Southern United]], [[Hastings & St Leonards United F.C.|St. Leonards United]] and [[Grays United F.C.|Grays United]],<ref name=ADDI /> was a successful one. Their opening match was against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] Reserves, and approximately 3,000 people paid 6d to stand or a shilling to be seated. Palace led 3\u20130 after 30 minutes, before fading and losing 3\u20134. However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and were promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9\u20131 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4\u20130 defeat of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] Reserves in March.<ref>Matthews, p.14</ref>\n\nFollowing their championship win, Palace started their second season as a club in the Southern League First Division, placing nineteenth at the end of the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating [[Rotherham County F.C.|Rotherham County]] in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another title. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Palace scored through [[Horace Astley]] against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock [[Newcastle United F.C. 0\u20131 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1\u20130]] win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who were flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4\u20130 winners.<ref>Matthews, pp.15\u201316</ref>\n\n[[File:Ted Smith goal for Crystal Palace circa 1914.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A headed goal scored by [[Edwin Smith (footballer)|Edwin Smith]] from a [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Billy Davies]] cross against [[Reading F.C.]], c.&nbsp;1914]]\nJohn Robson left Palace to manage neighbours [[Croydon Common F.C.]] for the 1907\u201308 season, and Edmund Goodman took over as manager and club secretary. The club had a good season, finishing fourth. [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Bill Davies]] became the first player from the club to be capped at international level when he was called up for [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup Palace lost 0\u20139 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a second round replay, which was a record defeat for the club. Palace managed to finish fourth again in the league the following season, losing just one game in the first twelve, and repeated their fourth-place finish the season after, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club won the [[London Challenge Cup]] in 1913, overcoming [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 1\u20130. After seventh and fifth-place finishes, Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913\u201314 season, with the club putting together some long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 2\u20131 at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]], and provided their first [[England national football team|England]] representative in [[Horace Colclough]], who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March.<ref>Matthews, pp.16\u201319</ref>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] on 4 August 1914, Palace had three players called up as [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Reservists]] before the season started. Former Palace players [[Ginger Williams (footballer)|Ginger Williams]] and [[Joe Bulcock]] were amongst those killed in the conflict. In March 1915, [[The Admiralty]], who had taken over the Palace and its grounds at the start of the war, ordered the club to leave and Palace chose to move to [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. When Croydon Common F.C. failed to return to business after the war, Palace moved to their ground known as [[The Nest (stadium)|The Nest]] which was opposite [[Selhurst railway station]]. In the first full season after the war, Palace finished in third place in 1919\u201320.<ref>Matthews, pp.19, 23\u201326</ref>\n\n==The Football League (1920\u201358)==\nCrystal Palace became a Football League club in 1920 when the Southern League First Division clubs were admitted ''en bloc'' as founder members of a newly formed Football League [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In their first season as a Football League club, Palace lost their opening game at [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] 1\u20132 with A.G. Milligan scoring the club's first ever Football League goal. Milligan's Palace career was short-lived however, and he made just one more appearance for the club. Palace's first ever home Football League match was a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], but the club then went on a run of six consecutive wins. Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], who had been signed in 1919, kept a clean sheet in all of those wins and Palace lost just six more games all season. They were unbeaten in the final sixteen games of the season which included an eight-game winning streak and went on to win the championship by five points from Southampton. The feat earned them promotion to the Second Division. The club conceded just thirty four goals over the season, a record that stood until 1978\u201379,<ref>Matthews, p.26, 28</ref> and they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace also won their third London Challenge Cup, beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] 1\u20130 at [[White Hart Lane]] with a goal from forward [[John Conner (footballer)|John Conner]].<ref>Matthews, p.29</ref>\n\n[[File:Jack Alderson Caricature 1922.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], caricatured in the ''Football Special'' in 1922.

This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]<nowiki/> were formed, but for now Palace were above all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the match against Fulham. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table during the following season, 1922\u201323, eventually finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.<ref>Matthews, pp.29\u201330</ref>\n\nBack in 1919, the Palace minute book contained an entry instructing the Secretary to investigate the possibility of obtaining a lease on the 'ground at Selhurst', although calling it a 'ground' was a little misleading since at the time it was a piece of wasteland valuable only to the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company]]. At one time it had been a brickfield, and two chimney stacks still remained. On 3 January 1922 the club purchased the ground at a cost of \u00a32,750, and renowned football ground architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was commissioned to design [[Selhurst Park]]. Leitch had designed stands at [[Craven Cottage]], [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], White Hart Lane and [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]], but the design for Selhurst Park was unusual in that it had no roof gable. The other three sides of the ground remained open banking with just the lower parts being terraced. Construction work was delayed by industrial disputes, and when the ground was opened by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] on the 30 August 1924, the stand had not been completed. It did however boast many luxuries, including \"offices, tea rooms, training quarters, plunge, slipper shower and needle baths\". The opening fixture was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]], and in front of a crowd of 25,000, Palace lost 0\u20131, with the first goal at Selhurst Park being scored by Billy Marsden. That defeat set the tone for the season, with the club eventually finishing in twenty-first place \u2013 and were relegated along with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. A win in the last game at home to [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] would have secured survival, but Palace went down 0\u20131 and it would be almost 40 years before Palace would again grace the second level of English football. One small consolation was the decision by the FA to stage the England versus Wales international at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1926. It remains the only full international match to be staged at the ground.<ref>Matthews, pp.30, 33\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter one season in the Third Division South and eighteen in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, their stay in the division was to last as long as the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to get out of, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Third Division South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth and also finished runners-up no less than three times. At the start of the 1939\u201340 season, Palace were sitting second in the table, but the season was cancelled after just three matches with the onset of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Matthews, pp.35\u201336, 39\u201346</ref>\n\nThe war years of 1939\u201345 saw football enter a period of disarray with the creation of [[Wartime League]]s. Palace joined the South \"A\" Division in 1939, but also joined the South League \"D\" in 1940, winning the latter competition, and then promptly winning an improvised South Regional League the following season on goal average. Palace joined the London League for the 1941\u201342 season, with the clubs in London refusing to accept the ad-hoc competitions the Football League were organising. This division only lasted that season before the London clubs were back in the Football League fold, with Palace joining the Football League South for the next four seasons.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;57\u201361</ref> The club fielded 186 different players during the seven wartime seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~754182,00.html |title=Palace During WWII |accessdate=27 March 2009 |publisher=Crystal Palace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214005340/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~754182%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKit changes had been introduced in the late 1930s. The 1937\u201338 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948\u201349, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and applying for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1950\u201351, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in the bottom half of the table until the league was restructured in 1958\u201359, requiring re-election for a third and final time in 1955\u201356, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\"/>\n\n==Rising through the divisions (1958\u201373)==\nThe 1958\u201359 season began a period of change, with [[Arthur Wait]] taking control of the club as chairman and the league was restructured with Palace playing in the new Fourth Division. This new division had been formed with the merging of the clubs in the bottom half of Third Division South with those in the bottom half of Third Division North. Palace had failed to qualify for the new Third Division, falling outside the top twelve finish required by two places. Their first season in the Fourth Division saw Palace finish seventh, with the club faring slightly worse the following season with an eighth place finish. Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960 and the club then enjoyed a successful 1960\u201361 season, finishing second behind league newcomers [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], who thus matched Palace's 1920\u201321 achievement of winning a championship in their inaugural league season. Palace also set Fourth Division records for the highest average attendance of 19,092, and the highest attendance at an individual match; 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |title=Division Four 1960/61 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6eJurvH?url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Surrey-born [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] scored 31 of Palace's 110 goals, and his strike partner [[Roy Summersby]] netted 25 as Palace moved up to Division Three.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;79\u201380, 87\u201390</ref>\n\nPalace finished fifteenth in Division Three at the end of the 1961\u201362 season.

This was a record fee between two British clubs at the time. Byrne left having scored ninety-six goals for Palace, then a post-war record.<ref>Matthews, pp.90\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.

Johnny Byrne returned to the Palace line-up as a guest player. Madrid ended up 4\u20133 winners. Arthur Rowe resigned due to health reasons in December 1962 and the club appointed former player [[Dick Graham]] as manager. The 1962\u201363 season saw Palace finish eleventh, before gaining promotion to the Second Division the following season after finishing second behind Coventry City on goal average.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;93\u201395</ref> \n\nFor the following four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes in the Second Division, during which they appointed [[Bert Head]] as their new manager in April 1966. Head promoted from the youth team and transferred in players both new and old, delighting the fans by re-signing old favourite Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968\u201369 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates at the beginning of the season, finished second behind [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] who were managed by [[Brian Clough]]. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.<ref>Matthews, pp.95\u201396, 103\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[The Dave Clark Five|The Dave Clark Five's]] chart-hit \"[[Glad All Over]]\" became a huge crowd favourite at this time with the Palace fans banging on advertising hoardings in time with the drum beat in the chorus of the song.<ref>Sedgwick, Fred. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/26/familyandrelationships.family9 Family: Playlist: The Football Anthems of My Youth].\" The Guardian: 7. 26 May 2007.

Scoring the first Division One goal for the club was [[Mel Blyth]] after six minutes, and a second goal from new signing [[Gerry Queen]] saw Palace hold United to a 2\u20132 draw with goalkeeper [[John Jackson (footballer born 1942)|John Jackson]] denying [[George Best]] and [[Brian Kidd]]. The next match was another home game versus [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] which Palace won 2\u20130. After a season long struggle against relegation, Palace were eventually able to secure safety, finishing in twentieth place above demoted Sheffield Wednesday and Sunderland. The club managed to gain three new records for the First Division at the end of this season: the fewest goals scored; the fewest wins recorded by a non-relegated team; and the tally of twenty-seven points was the smallest number with which a team has avoided relegation from the top flight.<ref>Matthews, 113\u2013115</ref> Palace avoided the drop for two more seasons,<ref>Matthews, 115\u2013121</ref> and followed the trend of many other top flight clubs by introducing a new \"''Player of the Year''\" award which has been presented at the end of every season since the 1971\u201372 campaign. The first recipient was [[John McCormick (footballer, born 1936)|John McCormick]].<ref name=\"POTY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~559565,00.html |title=Player Of The Year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907141243/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~559565%2C00.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |publisher=cpfc.co.uk (Crystal Palace F.C.) |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite some good performances in the 1972\u201373 season, notably a 5\u20130 home win against Manchester United in December, Palace eventually succumbed to the drop in their fourth season in the top flight. Arthur Wait, having overseen the rise of the club from the Fourth to the First Division, was replaced as chairman by Raymond Bloye in November 1972, and the club also appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as the new manager in March the following year, replacing Bert Head. Although the club saw a record average attendance over the season, neither the crowd nor the managerial change were able to keep them at the top level. Allison's first game in charge at home against Chelsea did see some changes, however, including the debut of young Scottish defender [[Jim Cannon]]. Palace had never won a London derby in the top flight up to this point, but Cannon, who had come through the youth ranks, marked the Chelsea striker [[Peter Osgood]] out of the game and then scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win to begin a long career with the club.<ref>Matthews, pp.121\u2013122, 139\u2013140</ref>\n\n==The coming of The Eagles (1973\u201384)==\nDespite relegation, the 1973\u201374 season started with much optimism among the Palace supporters. Malcolm Allison had a strong recent record as a coach, having won trophies with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] as an assistant to [[Joe Mercer]]. Allison or 'Big Mal' as he was nicknamed in the press, had a flamboyant personality which was something of a change for the club, who previously had a rather conservative image. Palace's nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and the club also changed its colours from the original claret and sky blue to a red and dark blue scheme inspired by [[Barcelona FC|Barcelona]]. The Eagle was introduced as the club mascot at this time, an idea borrowed from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the club badge was redesigned. The new season saw the introduction of a three-up, three-down [[promotion and relegation]] system, and Palace struggled to find their feet in the Second Division, failing to win any of their first 15 league games. In bottom place for most of the season, the club, aided by the signing from [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] of pacey winger [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] climbed to seventeenth place with a 3\u20131 win at Fulham on [[Good Friday]]. The club then turned in three consecutive losses which saw them needing to win the last game of the season at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] to remain in the second tier of English football. They could only draw 1\u20131, and suffered relegation for a second successive season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\">Matthews, pp.141\u2013166</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace1970sbadge.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Malcolm Allison|Allison's]] rebranded Palace crest]]\n\nIn 1974\u201375, Palace's first season back in Division Three since 1963\u201364, saw the club miss out on promotion, finishing in fifth place. Allison acquired [[Terry Venables]] and [[Ian Evans (footballer)|Ian Evans]] from [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in exchange for [[Don Rogers (footballer)|Don Rogers]], a trade that was to be significant to Palace's, and indeed England's football future. It was also around this time that Allison persuaded the club to put more resources into developing a strong youth team, a decision that would lead to both success at youth level, and the emergence of a number of promising young players in the first team. Palace again failed to gain promotion the following season, distracted in part by their best run in the FA Cup up to that point. The club reached the semi-finals, beating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and Chelsea along the way, before losing 0\u20132 to Southampton at Stamford Bridge on 3 April 1976. Allison resigned at the end of the season, partly because of the failure to get Palace promoted, but also he had felt pressure due to some of his off the field antics, infamously getting himself photographed in the team bath with porn star [[Fiona Richmond]].<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\"/><ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/8067232/Malcolm-Allison.html Malcolm Allison].\" The Daily Telegraph: 31. 16 October 2010.

The Palace youngsters also won the [[FA Youth Cup]] with a side including [[Kenny Sansom]], [[Vince Hilaire]] and [[Billy Gilbert (footballer born 1959)|Billy Gilbert]]. The following season, 1977\u201378, saw the youth team become the first to win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea did in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the first team by the 1978\u201379 season, which saw Palace vying not only for promotion, but also the Second Division title. The final game of the season was a Friday night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,482, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the title to fierce rivals [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]]; a loss and Palace would stay down, with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed [[Ian Walsh (footballer)|Ian Walsh]] to head the opener, before a great run by [[David Swindlehurst]] was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2\u20130 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.\n\nAs an increasing number of players from the FA Youth Cup winning team had established themselves in the first team, the press gave Palace the title of the \"''Team of the Eighties''\". They began the 1979\u201380 season well and stayed unbeaten longer than any other club in the top flight and also went top of the table for the first and to date only time in the club's history when they beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] 4\u20131 at Selhurst Park in late September. Unfortunately the young starlets could not keep this form up, and a slide down the table resulted in the Eagles finishing thirteenth, which at that point was the club's highest ever league finish.<ref>Matthews, pp.223\u2013226</ref>\n\nThe slide continued into the 1980\u201381 season, with nine defeats in the first ten games, and Venables quit Palace to join QPR. The club were suffering financial problems as well, and were virtually relegated by the start of February when another, even bigger change occurred. [[Ron Noades]], previously the chairman of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], took financial control of the club, purchasing it from Raymond Bloye's consortium. Palace spent the next couple of seasons flirting with relegation from the second tier and there were numerous managerial changes including the unpopular appointment of ex-Brighton manager [[Alan Mullery]].\n\n==Steve Coppell era  (1984\u201393)==\n[[File:Steve coppell 2006 promotion celebration cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Steve Coppell, who led Palace to the FA Cup Final and a third place finish in the top flight. Coppell has managed the club over four separate spells.]]\nThe former Manchester United and England winger [[Steve Coppell]] was appointed as Palace's new manager for the 1984\u201385 season. Coppell's playing career had been cut short by a knee injury, and, assisted by former Palace player Ian Evans, he worked on rebuilding the club, signing the then unknown [[Ian Wright]] from non-league [[Greenwich Borough F.C.|Greenwich Borough]] and [[Mark Bright]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and the pair formed the \"''Wrighty & Brighty''\" strike partnership. Coppell stabilised the club in his first season, and after two seasons of narrowly missing out on the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]], they followed this up by only just missing out on automatic promotion by a single point. The club instead entered the [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1989 Second Division play-offs]], beating Swindon in the semi-finals to set up a two legged final against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the first leg at [[Ewood Park]] the [[Lancashire]] club won 3\u20131, but a 30,000 full house at Selhurst Park saw the Eagles triumph 3\u20130 after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the second leg to end their eight-year exile from the top flight. Ian Wright, who scored 24 league goals, and 33 in all competitions in the promotion campaign, was voted player of the year by the club's supporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=1988/89 revisited|date=26 July 2009|url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|work=holmesdale.net|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f2D9LR?url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|access-date=11 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Matthews, p.289-292, 311\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;289\u2013292, 311</ref><ref>Matthews, pp.226\u2013236, 267\u2013285</ref>\n\nPalace began their first top flight campaign in almost a decade by re-signing [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1964)|Andy Gray]] from QPR for \u00a3500,000. In November, the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] goalkeeper [[Nigel Martyn]] for \u00a31 million \u2013 a record fee for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most of the first half in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams ([[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool team that had beaten them 9\u20130 in the league earlier in the season. The tie was played at [[Villa Park]], and saw Liverpool score first to lead 1\u20130 at half-time. Palace emerged from the interval with a sense of purpose, and within a minute of the restart equalised through Mark Bright. After going 2\u20131 up, Palace then found themselves 2\u20133 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. However an equaliser by Andy Gray with just two minutes remaining took the tie into extra-time, with the winner scored by [[Alan Pardew]] in a thrilling 4\u20133 victory and for the first time in their history, Palace were in the [[1990 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]].<ref>Matthews, pp.289\u2013292, 311</ref>\n\nTheir first ever appearance at Wembley Stadium saw Palace facing [[Alex Ferguson|Alex Ferguson's]] Manchester United. [[Gary O'Reilly]] opened the scoring for Palace, but [[Bryan Robson]] and [[Mark Hughes]] put United 2\u20131 up. Ian Wright then equalised immediately after coming onto the pitch as a substitute to take the final into extra-time, before scoring again early in the added period to put Palace back in the lead. Hughes scored his second late on for United to leave the game drawn 3\u20133 and requiring a replay. In the replay Palace chose to wear a new one-off change strip of yellow and black striped shirts<ref>{{cite web|title=English FA Cup Finalists 1990\u20131999 |url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html |work=Historical Football Kits |first=Dave |last=Moor |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f4wd3o?url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Palace In Colour Crisis|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Uq5UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cZADAAAAIBAJ&dq=crystal%20palace&pg=6631%2C381211|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=17 May 1990|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> The replay saw United left-back [[Lee Martin (footballer born February 1968)|Lee Martin]] cap a 40-yard run by slotting past Nigel Martyn to win the Cup for the Red Devils.<ref>Matthews, p.311</ref>\n\nThe club built on the success of the previous season and even challenged for the [[List of English football champions|English league title]] for most of the next season, but fell just short of eventual champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and runners-up Liverpool, finishing a club-best third in the top flight. Palace were unfortunate to miss out on a place in Europe because although the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985 had now been lifted, there would only be one place available in the [[UEFA Cup 1991-92|1991\u201392]] edition of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and this went to Liverpool rather than Palace. Success was achieved that season however when Palace made their third trip to Wembley in twelve months, beating Everton 4\u20131 in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]] of the [[Full Members Cup]].\n\nThe following season was to become one marked by controversy. In September, [[Channel 4]] showed a documentary called ''Critical Eye \u2013 Great Britain United'', which featured interviews with a number of club personnel. Among them was chairman Ron Noades, who commented \"when you're getting into mid-winter in England, you need a few hard white men to carry the artistic black players through\". Noades claimed he was reported out of context, an allegation rejected by the programme makers,<ref>Duncan, John. \"Noades Still Under Fire.\" The Guardian: 16. 17 September 1991. ProQuest. Web. 30 May 2013.</ref> and his comments stunned Palace's many black players. Ian Wright left the club soon after, transferring to Arsenal for \u00a32.5 million and Palace finished tenth in the First Division at the end of the [[1991-92 in English football|1991\u201392 season]]. A breakaway by the top 22 clubs saw Palace become founder members of the new [[FA Premier League]] for the [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Mark Bright was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in September and the Eagles struggled to score goals without him. They were relegated on goal difference, after Oldham Athletic's 4\u20133 victory over Southampton on the last day of the season. Palace's 49 points from 42 games that season became the joint-highest total of any club ever to have been relegated from the top flight of English football, and remains a Premier League record. The club's relegation prompted the resignation of Coppell after nine years at the helm, and he was succeeded by his assistant [[Alan Smith (football manager)|Alan Smith]].<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;314\u2013320</ref>\n\n==Ups and downs (1993\u201398)==\n<!-- [[File:Eric Cantona kung-fu kick.jpg|thumb|Ex-[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] player [[Eric Cantona]] kicks spectator Matthew Simmons]] -->\n\nAlan Smith immediately guided Palace back to the Premier League as runaway champions of the second tier,<ref>Alexander, Jeremy. \"Soccer: FIRST DIVISION: Palace Promoted a Day Late Luton Town 0, Crystal Palace 1.\" The Guardian (pre-1997 Fulltext): 0. 18 April 1994.
