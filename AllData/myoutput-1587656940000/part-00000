He is also the most [[cap (football)|capped]] player for the Denmark national team, with 129 games between 1987 and 2001. In addition to Euro 92, he played for his country at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and three additional [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] tournaments. He captained the national team in 30 matches. He also represented Gladsaxe Hero, [[Hvidovre IF|Hvidovre]], [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]], [[Sporting CP]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a career that lasted from 1981 until 2003 and yielded 24 trophies.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all-time, the [[IFFHS]] ranked Schmeichel among the top ten [[IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper#Goalkeeper of the Century|keepers of the 20th century]] in 2000,<ref name=\"IFFHS' Century Elections\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html#worldkoc |title=IFFHS' Century Elections |accessdate=21 June 2007 |first=Karel |last=Stokkermans |date=30 January 2000 |work=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] }}</ref> and in 2001, Schmeichel won a public poll held by [[Reuters]], when the majority of the 200,000 participants voted him as the best goalkeeper ever, ahead of [[Lev Yashin]] and [[Gordon Banks]].<ref name=\"showstars\">{{cite web |url=http://www.showstars.dk/query:invoke/method:display/folderid:3216/lang:da/ |title=PETER SCHMEICHEL |accessdate=21 June 2007 |work=ShowStars.dk |language=Danish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704194758/http://www.showstars.dk/query:invoke/method:display/folderid:3216/lang:da/ |archivedate=4 July 2007}}</ref> In 2003, Schmeichel was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his impact on the English game. In March 2004, he was named as one of the \"125 greatest living footballers\", at the [[FIFA 100]] celebrations. His son, [[Kasper Schmeichel|Kasper]], is also a professional goalkeeper, currently playing for Premier League side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nPeter Schmeichel was born in the [[S\u00f8borgg\u00e5rd]] parish of [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], Denmark, to Inger, a Danish nurse, and Antoni Schmeichel, a [[Polish people|Polish]] jazz musician. He held Polish [[citizen]]ship until 1970 when he, his father, and his three sisters became Danish citizens.\n\nSchmeichel inherited his middle name \u2013 Boles\u0142aw \u2013 from his great-grandfather.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 25</ref> He spent his early years in the town of [[Buddinge]], [[Copenhagen]], and began his football career playing for a team in the adjacent suburb of [[H\u00f8je-Gladsaxe]]. His first match came on 7 August 1972 at the age of 8.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 29</ref> After a two-and-a-half-year unbeaten run, Schmeichel was approached by BK Hero, a team from a few divisions above H\u00f8je-Gladsaxe and with one of the largest youth football schemes in Denmark. BK Hero merged with Gladsaxe BK in 1979 to form [[Gladsaxe-Hero BK]], and Schmeichel was presented with the opportunity to play for the [[Zealand Football Association|Zealand FA's]] junior representative team.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nEventually graduating to the Gladsaxe-Hero senior squad, Schmeichel met his first mentor in [[Svend Aage Hansen]], the first team coach at the club, and later to become his father-in-law. With Gladsaxe-Hero already relegated from the Danish Third Division with three games to go, Hansen promoted Schmeichel and six others from the youth team for a match against [[IF Skjold Birker\u00f8d]]. The team lost 1\u20130, but Schmeichel received mentions in local newspapers for his personal performance.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 31</ref> At the end of the season, Hansen explained to Schmeichel his plan for the future, which involved Schmeichel spending two more seasons with Gladsaxe-Hero BK before moving on to [[Hvidovre IF|Hvidovre]], playing for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], and eventually having a successful career abroad. Schmeichel admits that he had received an offer to play for [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]]'s youth team, but he turned it down as the club \"seemed a bit boring\".<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nThe following season Gladsaxe-Hero needed only to avoid defeat to Stubbek\u00f8bing to prevent relegation from the Danish National League. In the end, Schmeichel played one of the best games of his career and Gladsaxe-Hero won the match. At the end of the game, Hansen's daughter, Bente, ran onto the pitch and hugged Schmeichel. The two ended up going out as a couple, and they eventually got married.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nBefore becoming a professional footballer, Schmeichel had to work a number of jobs to make ends meet. His first job came in the dyeing department of a textile factory, but safety concerns led to his resignation. He then spent 12 months as a cleaner at an old people's home, before taking up an office job with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]]. He originally worked in the organisation's shops, but three weeks after he joined, the store manager left and Schmeichel was promoted to the position of sales manager. Soon after, Schmeichel was called upon to do his four weeks of compulsory military service. However, this coincided with Hvidovre's summer training camp in Portugal, which he was permitted to go on with the proviso that he completed his military service the following month. Nevertheless, the delicate organisational situation that arose between the WWF, the Danish defence department and Hvidovre prompted Schmeichel to give up working for the WWF. A job with his father-in-law's flooring firm came next, until he realised that his knees could not support his {{convert|15|stone|kg}} frame for eight hours a day, and he was offered a job with the advertising firm owned by Hvidovre's chairman, Niels Erik Madsen. This was to be his last job outside football, as he was offered a contract with [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] the following spring.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\n===Professional career===\n\n====Br\u00f8ndby (1987\u20131991)====\nDespite the fifth best defence in the league, conceding 40 goals in 30 games,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/Danmarksturneringen/1985.htm |title=Danmarksturneringen 1985 |accessdate=21 June 2007 |first=Peder I. |last=Nielsen |year=1999 |publisher=Peders Fodboldstatistik |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316190707/http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/Danmarksturneringen/1985.htm |archivedate=16 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Schmeichel and Hvidovre finished in 14th place and were [[relegated]] in 1985. After only a single season, the club bounced right back to the 1st Division, but Schmeichel was lost by Hvidovre to Danish runners-up [[Br\u00f8ndby IF]] before the 1987 season. Winning the Danish league in his first year, he joined a club which he helped turn into a success. He made his debut for the Danish national team in May 1987, under national manager [[Sepp Piontek]], and was selected for the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 88]] tournament, where he eventually became Denmark's starting goalkeeper, after initially serving as a back-up to [[Troels Rasmussen]] in Denmark's opening 3\u20132 defeat to [[Spain national football team|Spain]]; Denmark lost both of their remaining two matches 2\u20130 to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]], however, and were eliminated in the first round of the competition.<ref name=\"Honours\"/>\n\nIn all, Schmeichel and Br\u00f8ndby won four championships in five seasons.

Indeed, in a 2001 Reuters poll, he beat Lev Yashin and Gordon Banks to be named the finest keeper in football history. Despite being a goalkeeper, he would run into the attack on corner kicks if his team was behind. The sight of him going up for the corner was a great distraction to opposing defenders. He scored a goal in this fashion, for Man United, in a [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] match against [[Rotor Volgograd]] at Old Trafford in September 1995.

In March 2004, he was named as one of the \"125 greatest living footballers\", at the [[FIFA 100]] celebrations. His son, [[Kasper Schmeichel|Kasper]], is also a professional goalkeeper, currently playing for Premier League side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nPeter Schmeichel was born in the [[S\u00f8borgg\u00e5rd]] parish of [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], Denmark, to Inger, a Danish nurse, and Antoni Schmeichel, a [[Polish people|Polish]] jazz musician. He held Polish [[citizen]]ship until 1970 when he, his father, and his three sisters became Danish citizens.\n\nSchmeichel inherited his middle name \u2013 Boles\u0142aw \u2013 from his great-grandfather.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 25</ref> He spent his early years in the town of [[Buddinge]], [[Copenhagen]], and began his football career playing for a team in the adjacent suburb of [[H\u00f8je-Gladsaxe]]. His first match came on 7 August 1972 at the age of 8.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 29</ref> After a two-and-a-half-year unbeaten run, Schmeichel was approached by BK Hero, a team from a few divisions above H\u00f8je-Gladsaxe and with one of the largest youth football schemes in Denmark. BK Hero merged with Gladsaxe BK in 1979 to form [[Gladsaxe-Hero BK]], and Schmeichel was presented with the opportunity to play for the [[Zealand Football Association|Zealand FA's]] junior representative team.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nEventually graduating to the Gladsaxe-Hero senior squad, Schmeichel met his first mentor in [[Svend Aage Hansen]], the first team coach at the club, and later to become his father-in-law. With Gladsaxe-Hero already relegated from the Danish Third Division with three games to go, Hansen promoted Schmeichel and six others from the youth team for a match against [[IF Skjold Birker\u00f8d]]. The team lost 1\u20130, but Schmeichel received mentions in local newspapers for his personal performance.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 31</ref> At the end of the season, Hansen explained to Schmeichel his plan for the future, which involved Schmeichel spending two more seasons with Gladsaxe-Hero BK before moving on to [[Hvidovre IF|Hvidovre]], playing for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], and eventually having a successful career abroad. Schmeichel admits that he had received an offer to play for [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]]'s youth team, but he turned it down as the club \"seemed a bit boring\".<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nThe following season Gladsaxe-Hero needed only to avoid defeat to Stubbek\u00f8bing to prevent relegation from the Danish National League. In the end, Schmeichel played one of the best games of his career and Gladsaxe-Hero won the match. At the end of the game, Hansen's daughter, Bente, ran onto the pitch and hugged Schmeichel. The two ended up going out as a couple, and they eventually got married.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nBefore becoming a professional footballer, Schmeichel had to work a number of jobs to make ends meet. His first job came in the dyeing department of a textile factory, but safety concerns led to his resignation. He then spent 12 months as a cleaner at an old people's home, before taking up an office job with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]]. He originally worked in the organisation's shops, but three weeks after he joined, the store manager left and Schmeichel was promoted to the position of sales manager. Soon after, Schmeichel was called upon to do his four weeks of compulsory military service. However, this coincided with Hvidovre's summer training camp in Portugal, which he was permitted to go on with the proviso that he completed his military service the following month. Nevertheless, the delicate organisational situation that arose between the WWF, the Danish defence department and Hvidovre prompted Schmeichel to give up working for the WWF. A job with his father-in-law's flooring firm came next, until he realised that his knees could not support his {{convert|15|stone|kg}} frame for eight hours a day, and he was offered a job with the advertising firm owned by Hvidovre's chairman, Niels Erik Madsen. This was to be his last job outside football, as he was offered a contract with [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] the following spring.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\n===Professional career===\n\n====Br\u00f8ndby (1987\u20131991)====\nDespite the fifth best defence in the league, conceding 40 goals in 30 games,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/Danmarksturneringen/1985.htm |title=Danmarksturneringen 1985 |accessdate=21 June 2007 |first=Peder I. |last=Nielsen |year=1999 |publisher=Peders Fodboldstatistik |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316190707/http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/Danmarksturneringen/1985.htm |archivedate=16 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Schmeichel and Hvidovre finished in 14th place and were [[relegated]] in 1985.

Winning the Danish league in his first year, he joined a club which he helped turn into a success. He made his debut for the Danish national team in May 1987, under national manager [[Sepp Piontek]], and was selected for the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 88]] tournament, where he eventually became Denmark's starting goalkeeper, after initially serving as a back-up to [[Troels Rasmussen]] in Denmark's opening 3\u20132 defeat to [[Spain national football team|Spain]]; Denmark lost both of their remaining two matches 2\u20130 to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]], however, and were eliminated in the first round of the competition.<ref name=\"Honours\"/>\n\nIn all, Schmeichel and Br\u00f8ndby won four championships in five seasons.

However, he still works occasionally as a pundit for the [[BBC]].\n\nHis popularity in Britain is perhaps best measured by [[Chesney Brown]] on the [[Manchester]]-based soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', naming his former dog (a [[Great Dane]]) \"Schmeichel\".\n\nHe also took part in [[Soccer Aid]], and played for the Rest of the World team, who lost 2\u20131 after he was substituted at half-time. Schmeichel was a contestant on the 2006 series of the [[BBC]]'s popular Saturday night TV programme ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', but was voted out by the public on his 43rd birthday. He also appeared on ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' in the UK, but he was voted off as the weakest link in the first round.\n\nOn 31 August 2007, an investor group including Schmeichel announced their intention to invest 250 million DKK ([[Euro|\u20ac]]33.5 million) in the football club [[Br\u00f8ndby IF]] and make him sports director.
