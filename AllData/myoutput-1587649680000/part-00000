specifically categorize the brick kiln industry as a form of debt bondage since workers in this institution receive money in advance which they must later pay off.<ref name=\":13\" /> According to a 2003 study, although most Indian laborers in the brick kiln industry did not enter debt bondage, the number of workers entering debt bondage was increasing due to a lack of trust between brokers, or

work and receiving a loan in the first place.<ref name=\":13\" /> According to a 2007 study in [[Chennai]] and [[Madurai]] in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu about the brick kiln industry, many Indians hold different views on the relationship between brokers and workers.<ref name=\":3\" /> Whereas some argue that this relationship is built upon mutualism, others cite the harms of this connection since workers in this industry are seasonal, receive conditional advances, and receive low wages, often only covering the costs of food.<ref name=\":3\" /> As of 2019, there are over 23 million

from lenders at a high interest rate.<ref name=\":8\" /> Due to a lack of education, these individuals often don't learn about human rights or have a proper platform for activism.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, there is a correlation between economic opportunity and one's caste.<ref name=\":17\" /> Although the government has attempted to create quota based initiatives to increase the opportunity of

Government Regulations ===\n[[File:Indira Gandhi in 1967.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Indira Gandhi in 1967, 9 years before passing the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act]]\nThe passage of the Bonded Labor System Act of 1976 by Indira Gandhi and the Indian government set a precedent for future government initiatives to tackle labor issues.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1978, the Indian government instituted a national plan to disperse over 20,000 rupees (about 300 US dollars) to freed debt laborers.<ref name=\":4\" /> On a similar note, the [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005|National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]] recently guaranteed employment to one adult in a rural house that has a considerable financial burden.<ref name=\":14\" /> State governments take on this issue in a variety of ways.<ref name=\":14\" /> For example, many Indian states target landless workers in local debt relief efforts.<ref name=\":14\" /> \n\nAdditionally, to tackle the issue of child labor, the government passed the Child Labor Act and National Policy on Child Labor in 1986 and 1987 respectively.<ref name=\":6\" /> These initiatives created projects such as the National Child Labor Project which created rehabilitation programs for children and provided education and food to former child laborers.<ref name=\":6\" /> They also regulated the hours and conditions of child laborers and utilized a team of inspectors to prohibit these individuals from working in dangerous industries.<ref name=\":8\" /> Later on, in 1994, the Elimination of Child Labor Act incorporated more vocational training into schools to help students find opportunities for social mobility post-graduation.<ref name=\":8\" /> Researchers suggest that countries with a high incidence of child debt bondage like India must first address the low wages of farmers and the lack of alternatives to entering debt bondage for individuals in poverty.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Organizations ===\nIn 1993, the [[Human Rights Act 1993|Human Rights Act]] created the [[National Human Rights Commission]] which investigates issues of human rights violations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another organization that works on similar initiatives is the Center for Education and Communication which collaborates with NGOs and is responsible for educating the world about this issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the Academy of Development Science created a grain bank to tackle the issue of food scarcity and help Indians stay out of debt.<ref name=\":0\" /> Finally, the Indian National Commission on Labor has met numerous times to create more protection for Indian workers, especially those who cannot organize.<ref name=\":16\" /> \n\nOn an international level, in 1948, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] outlawed the practice of debt bondage.<ref name=\":14\" /> Similarly, in 1956, the United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery officially prohibited this institution.<ref name=\":12\" /> Additionally, more recently, the Dalit Freedom Network, a British NGO, has brought many children out of debt bondage and has worked to end Dalit slavery.<ref name=\":4\" />

implemented [[Microfinance|micro-finance]] initiatives to help Indians in debt.<ref name=\":1\" /> This organization has been careful to use micro-finance, or the distribution of small loans at low interest costs, to help Indians who have a high risk of entering debt bondage or falling back into this form of forced labor.<ref name=\":10\" /> The intervention of the ILO in India has led to the creation of the Integrated Rural Development Society and Madras Social Service Society which focus on preventative measures to the issue of debt bondage.<ref name=\":10\" /> This has forced state governments to commit more time and attention towards tackling bonded labor issues.<ref name=\":10\" /> Additionally, this has led to more initiatives which involve teaching employers about alternatives to debt bondage, increasing educational opportunities for students, and providing aid for the costs of health care.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|India}}\n* [[Bonded

[[France]] and [[England]], and many Indians were sent to [[Australia]] to reduce the costs and effects of slavery.<ref name=\":2\" /> France, who had an economic and political presence in India, created a system of indentured servitude in the [[Indian Ocean]] which about 3,000 Indians were a part of in the 1830s.<ref name=\":2\" /> By 1847, there were over 6500 indentured servants in the Indian Ocean, including those in India.<ref name=\":2\" /> These French settlers traditionally held onto wages which initiated a system of debt bondage.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the second half of the nineteenth century, many Indians successfully formed unions and utilized trials to free these workers.<ref name=\":2\" /> Nevertheless, India felt the impacts of these historical systems of labor in the twentieth century.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nIn 1935, the British, who ruled India at that time, passed the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act]] whose purpose was to develop the Indian economy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nevertheless, this further stratified the social hierarchy in India, contributing to the debt bondage system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Before India gained [[Indian

find themselves paying interest on the loans that exceeds 100% of the loan per year.<ref name=\"A $110 loan, then 20 years of debt bondage\" /> Additionally, many lenders only let the value of labor

specifically categorize the brick kiln industry as a form of debt bondage since workers in this institution receive money in advance which they must later pay off.<ref name=\":13\" /> According to a 2003 study, although most Indian laborers in the brick kiln industry did not enter debt bondage, the number of workers entering debt bondage was increasing due to a lack of trust between brokers, or lenders, and borrowers.<ref name=\":3\" /> Although employers in charge of this industry do not employ children, workers inevitably turn to their children to improve their chances of completing their work and receiving a loan in the first place.<ref name=\":13\" /> According to a 2007 study in [[Chennai]] and [[Madurai]] in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu about the brick kiln industry, many Indians hold different views on the relationship between brokers and workers.<ref name=\":3\" /> Whereas some argue that this relationship is built upon mutualism, others cite the harms of this connection since workers in this industry are seasonal, receive conditional advances, and receive low wages, often only covering the costs of food.<ref name=\":3\" /> As of 2019, there are over 23 million

health care, and housing which forces them to take out loans and enter forced labor.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, they often do not qualify for loans from banks which forces them to borrow money from lenders at a high interest rate.<ref name=\":8\" /> Due to a lack of education, these individuals often don't learn about human rights or have a proper platform for activism.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, there is a correlation between economic opportunity and one's caste.<ref name=\":17\" /> Although the government has attempted to create quota based initiatives to increase the opportunity of

profits.<ref name=\":15\" /> Thus, farmers are more susceptible to committing suicide if they do not have a large amount of land and are in debt.<ref name=\":15\" /> These individuals typically commit suicide using pesticides.<ref name=\":15\" /> In fact, some farmers in some rural parts of India are twice as likely to commit suicide than urban Indians.<ref name=\":15\" /> From 1997 to 2012, over 180,000 farmers committed suicide in India due to the burden of debt.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Further Inequality ===\n[[File:Mahatma-Gandhi, studio, 1931.jpg|thumb|307x307px|Mahatma Gandhi, who criticized the bondage system]]\nThe debt bondage system in India is characterized by a system known as [[Haliya|halipratha]] which relies on a master-servant connection.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite

Gandhi]] criticized this system and its employers and attempted to declare the Bonded Labour Liberation Day in 1939.<ref name=\":16\" /> However, these employers did not accept this initiatives since it involved increasing wages for workers and ending debt bondage for long term workers.<ref name=\":16\" /> Researchers such as Jan Breman claim that the motivations of employers under this system is not primarily economic but is rather marked by a drive to develop political power and dominance over others.<ref name=\":16\" /> For example, the debt bondage system was used as a way to force tribes in nineteenth century [[Gujarat|Gujurat]] into lower castes.<ref name=\":16\" /> \n\nOn a more current note, many Indian workers are a part of a new form of bonded labor.<ref name=\":16\" /> This system is characterized by an environment that fails to allow laborers to organize or find other jobs and work which requires long hours.<ref name=\":16\" /> Thus, workers in this system are trapped by their occupation and hand these economics burdens down across generations, leading to cases of child labor.<ref name=\":16\" /> Child labor specifically stunts the intellectual growth of students in primary education.<ref name=\":6\" /> This system also leads to lower school attendance and fewer opportunities for social mobility.<ref name=\":6\" /> Nevertheless, many employers cite this form of labor as a way for families to receive a steady form of income.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Health Effects ===\nMany laborers in the debt bondage system are vulnerable to hazardous health conditions such as infection from dangerous working conditions.<ref name=\":4\" />  According to a study about the brick kiln industry in India, many workers under the debt bondage system suffer from enduring high levels of heat during the summer.<ref name=\":13\" /> Children specifically are susceptible to skin and breathing diseases.<ref name=\":6\" /> Child laborers in the debt bondage system often receive cuts and burns or contract liver disease due to their participation in the silver, [[beedi]], and silk industries.<ref name=\":8\" /> Additionally, laborers in the agriculture industry are vulnerable to snake bites and pesticide poisoning due to a lack of protective gear and clean drinking and cleansing water.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite

Government Regulations ===\n[[File:Indira Gandhi in 1967.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Indira Gandhi in 1967, 9 years before passing the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act]]\nThe passage of the Bonded Labor System Act of 1976 by Indira Gandhi and the Indian government set a precedent for future government initiatives to tackle labor issues.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1978, the Indian government instituted a national plan to disperse over 20,000 rupees (about 300 US dollars) to freed debt laborers.<ref name=\":4\" /> On a similar note, the [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005|National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]] recently guaranteed employment to one adult in a rural house that has a considerable financial burden.<ref name=\":14\" /> State governments take on this issue in a variety of ways.<ref name=\":14\" /> For example, many Indian states target landless workers in local debt relief efforts.<ref name=\":14\" /> \n\nAdditionally, to tackle the issue of child labor, the government passed the Child Labor Act and National Policy on Child Labor in 1986 and 1987 respectively.<ref name=\":6\" /> These initiatives created projects such as the National Child Labor Project which created rehabilitation programs for children and provided education and food to former child laborers.<ref name=\":6\" /> They also regulated the hours and conditions of child laborers and utilized a team of inspectors to prohibit these individuals from working in dangerous industries.<ref name=\":8\" /> Later on, in 1994, the Elimination of Child Labor Act incorporated more vocational training into schools to help students find opportunities for social mobility post-graduation.<ref name=\":8\" /> Researchers suggest that countries with a high incidence of child debt bondage like India must first address the low wages of farmers and the lack of alternatives to entering debt bondage for individuals in poverty.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Organizations ===\nIn 1993, the [[Human Rights Act 1993|Human Rights Act]] created the [[National Human Rights Commission]] which investigates issues of human rights violations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another organization that works on similar initiatives is the Center for Education and Communication which collaborates with NGOs and is responsible for educating the world about this issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the Academy of Development Science created a grain bank to tackle the issue of food scarcity and help Indians stay out of debt.<ref name=\":0\" /> Finally, the Indian National Commission on Labor has met numerous times to create more protection for Indian workers, especially those who cannot organize.<ref name=\":16\" /> \n\nOn an international level, in 1948, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] outlawed the practice of debt bondage.<ref name=\":14\" /> Similarly, in 1956, the United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery officially prohibited this institution.<ref name=\":12\" /> Additionally, more recently, the Dalit Freedom Network, a British NGO, has brought many children out of debt bondage and has worked to end Dalit slavery.<ref name=\":4\" /> Organizations such as the UNRISD recommend more state involvement and collaboration between the government and businesses to solve issues of poverty.<ref>{{Cite

slavery.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n=== International Labor Organization ===\nThe International Labor Organization, or ILO, is responsible for dissecting labor issues and making sure exports are ethical.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Koti|first=John|last2=Janaki|first2=D.|date=2016|title=ILO, WTO & Indian Industrial Relations|journal=Indian Journal of Industrial Relations|volume=51|issue=3|pages=371\u2013385|issn=0019-5286|jstor=43974551}}</ref> In 1998, India passed 39 out of the 189 conventions of the ILO, including an agreement about forced labor.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was a part of a larger initiative by the ILO to force countries to end forced labor through the [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]].<ref

implemented [[Microfinance|micro-finance]] initiatives to help Indians in debt.<ref name=\":1\" /> This organization has been careful to use micro-finance, or the distribution of small loans at low interest costs, to help Indians who have a high risk of entering debt bondage or falling back into this form of forced labor.<ref name=\":10\" /> The intervention of the ILO in India has led to the creation of the Integrated Rural Development Society and Madras Social Service Society which focus on preventative measures to the issue of debt bondage.<ref name=\":10\" /> This has forced state governments to commit more time and attention towards tackling bonded labor issues.<ref name=\":10\" /> Additionally, this has lead to more initiatives which involve teaching employers about alternatives to debt bondage, increasing educational opportunities for students, and providing aid for the costs of health care.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|India}}\n* [[Bonded
