Founded in 1987 by [[Peter Molyneux]] and [[Les Edgar]], the company gained recognition in 1989 for their third release, ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', and is also well known for titles such as ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'', ''[[Magic Carpet (video game)|Magic Carpet]]'', ''[[Syndicate (video game)|Syndicate]]'' and ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]''. Bullfrog's name was derived from an ornament in the offices of Edgar's and Molyneux's other enterprise, Taurus Impact Systems, Bullfrog's precursor where Molyneux and Edgar were developing business software. Bullfrog Productions was founded as a separate entity after [[Commodore International|Commodore]] mistook Taurus for a similarly named company.\n\n[[Electronic Arts]], Bullfrog's [[video game publisher|publisher]], [[List of acquisitions by Electronic Arts|acquired]] the studio in January 1995. Molyneux had become an Electronic Arts vice-president and consultant in 1994, after EA purchased a significant share of Bullfrog. Molyneux's last project with Bullfrog was ''Dungeon Keeper'', and as a result of his dissatisfaction of the corporate aspects of his position, he left the company in July 1997 to found [[Lionhead Studios]]. Others would follow them to Lionhead, and some founded their own companies, such as [[Mucky Foot Productions]]. After Molyneux's departure, Electronic Arts' control over Bullfrog caused several projects to be cancelled. Bullfrog was merged into [[EA UK]] in 2001 and ceased to exist as a separate entity. Bullfrog titles have been looked upon as a standard for comparison and have spawned numerous [[spiritual sequel]]s.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins, founding and early years (1982\u20131989) ===\n{{See also|Peter Molyneux#Early career}}\n[[File:Peter Molyneux - Game Developers Conference 2010 (2).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|Peter Molyneux, co-founder of Bullfrog Productions, in 2010]]\nIn 1982, entrepreneur Peter Molyneux met Les Edgar at a computer shop called PJ Hi-Fi.<ref name=\"ChairPM\">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=Bournemouth |ISSN=1742-3155 |title=In The Chair With Peter Molyneux |pages=82\u201389 |issue=71}}</ref> When Molyneux left the company where he was working, Edgar suggested that they start a new one,<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/><ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/petermolyneux/index.html |title=GameSpot Presents Legends of Game Design: Peter Molyneux |last=Dulin |first=Ron |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=26 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830100952/http://www.gamespot.com/features/petermolyneux/index.html |archivedate=30 August 2005}}</ref> which would later develop business software for the [[Commodore 64]] as Taurus Impact Systems (also known as Taurus Software).<ref name=\"Progress\"/><ref name=\"Legend\"/> The new company was named after Molyneux and Edgar's shared [[astrological sign]], the [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]].<ref name=\"Progress\"/> At some point, Molyneux accepted a deal to export money systems to Switzerland and baked beans to the Middle East.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/>\n\nOne day, Taurus received a call from the head of [[Commodore International|Commodore]] Europe, wanting to discuss the future of the [[Amiga]],<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> and Taurus' software's suitability for the system.<ref name=\"Legend\"/> Molyneux was invited to Commodore Europe's headquarters, where he was offered several Amiga systems and a space at a show in Germany.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/><ref name=\"Legend\"/> When Molyneux was told that they were anticipating getting his network running on the Amiga, he realised that they had mistaken his company for one called Torus, a producer of networking systems.<ref name=\"Legend\"/><ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Molyneux wanted the Amiga systems, so he did not inform Commodore of their error.<ref name=\"Legend\"/> He received them and began writing a database program called Acquisition.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Commodore kept asking about the database, and Molyneux gave them excuses because they were threatening to shut Taurus down.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> When Acquisition was finished, it was shown at the exhibition in Germany, and won product of the year. 2000 copies were sold to a company in the United States, giving Molyneux and Edgar funds to sustain Taurus.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Another program Taurus wrote was a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) package called X-CAD.<ref name=\"Progress\">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP]] |title=Work In Progress Bullfrog |issue=12 |date=September 1989 |pages=24\u201328 |ISSN=0955-4084 |url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-12 |accessdate=12 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319081815/https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-12 |archive-date=19 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> They knew the Amiga was becoming a gaming machine, and a friend of Molyneux's asked him to convert ''Druid II: Enlightenment'' from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> According to Edgar, it was around this time Bullfrog was founded in preparation for the day when Acquisition was no longer important and they could focus on games.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web |title=Bullfrog Productions: A History Of The Legendary UK Developer |url=https://www.nowgamer.com/bullfrog-productions-a-history-of-the-legendary-uk-developer/ |website=NowGamer |accessdate=11 June 2017 |date=22 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706050106/https://www.nowgamer.com/bullfrog-productions-a-history-of-the-legendary-uk-developer/ |archive-date=6 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bullfrog was originally a brand of Taurus;

based in [[Guildford]], England. Founded in 1987 by [[Peter Molyneux]] and [[Les Edgar]], the company gained recognition in 1989 for their third release, ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', and is also well known for titles such as ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'', ''[[Magic Carpet (video game)|Magic Carpet]]'', ''[[Syndicate (video game)|Syndicate]]'' and ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]''. Bullfrog's name was derived from an ornament in the offices of Edgar's and Molyneux's other enterprise, Taurus Impact Systems, Bullfrog's precursor where Molyneux and Edgar were developing business software. Bullfrog Productions was founded as a separate entity after [[Commodore International|Commodore]] mistook Taurus for a similarly named company.\n\n[[Electronic Arts]], Bullfrog's [[video game publisher|publisher]], [[List of acquisitions by Electronic Arts|acquired]] the studio in January 1995. Molyneux had become an Electronic Arts vice-president and consultant in 1994, after EA purchased a significant share of Bullfrog. Molyneux's last project with Bullfrog was ''Dungeon Keeper'', and as a result of his dissatisfaction of the corporate aspects of his position, he left the company in July 1997 to found [[Lionhead Studios]]. Others would follow them to Lionhead, and some founded their own companies, such as [[Mucky Foot Productions]]. After Molyneux's departure, Electronic Arts' control over Bullfrog caused several projects to be cancelled. Bullfrog was merged into [[EA UK]] in 2001 and ceased to exist as a separate entity. Bullfrog titles have been looked upon as a standard for comparison and have spawned numerous [[spiritual sequel]]s.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins, founding and early years (1982\u20131989) ===\n{{See also|Peter Molyneux#Early career}}\n[[File:Peter Molyneux - Game Developers Conference 2010 (2).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|Peter Molyneux, co-founder of Bullfrog Productions, in 2010]]\nIn 1982, entrepreneur Peter Molyneux met Les Edgar at a computer shop called PJ Hi-Fi.<ref name=\"ChairPM\">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=Bournemouth |ISSN=1742-3155 |title=In The Chair With Peter Molyneux |pages=82\u201389 |issue=71}}</ref> When Molyneux left the company where he was working, Edgar suggested that they start a new one,<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/><ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/petermolyneux/index.html |title=GameSpot Presents Legends of Game Design: Peter Molyneux |last=Dulin |first=Ron |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=26 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830100952/http://www.gamespot.com/features/petermolyneux/index.html |archivedate=30 August 2005}}</ref> which would later develop business software for the [[Commodore 64]] as Taurus Impact Systems (also known as Taurus Software).<ref name=\"Progress\"/><ref name=\"Legend\"/> The new company was named after Molyneux and Edgar's shared [[astrological sign]], the [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]].<ref name=\"Progress\"/> At some point, Molyneux accepted a deal to export money systems to Switzerland and baked beans to the Middle East.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/>\n\nOne day, Taurus received a call from the head of [[Commodore International|Commodore]] Europe, wanting to discuss the future of the [[Amiga]],<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> and Taurus' software's suitability for the system.<ref name=\"Legend\"/> Molyneux was invited to Commodore Europe's headquarters, where he was offered several Amiga systems and a space at a show in Germany.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/><ref name=\"Legend\"/> When Molyneux was told that they were anticipating getting his network running on the Amiga, he realised that they had mistaken his company for one called Torus, a producer of networking systems.<ref name=\"Legend\"/><ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Molyneux wanted the Amiga systems, so he did not inform Commodore of their error.<ref name=\"Legend\"/> He received them and began writing a database program called Acquisition.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Commodore kept asking about the database, and Molyneux gave them excuses because they were threatening to shut Taurus down.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> When Acquisition was finished, it was shown at the exhibition in Germany, and won product of the year. 2000 copies were sold to a company in the United States, giving Molyneux and Edgar funds to sustain Taurus.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Another program Taurus wrote was a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) package called X-CAD.<ref name=\"Progress\">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP]] |title=Work In Progress Bullfrog |issue=12 |date=September 1989 |pages=24\u201328 |ISSN=0955-4084 |url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-12 |accessdate=12 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319081815/https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-12 |archive-date=19 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> They knew the Amiga was becoming a gaming machine, and a friend of Molyneux's asked him to convert ''Druid II: Enlightenment'' from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> According to Edgar, it was around this time Bullfrog was founded in preparation for the day when Acquisition was no longer important and they could focus on games.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web |title=Bullfrog Productions: A History Of The Legendary UK Developer |url=https://www.nowgamer.com/bullfrog-productions-a-history-of-the-legendary-uk-developer/ |website=NowGamer |accessdate=11 June 2017 |date=22 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706050106/https://www.nowgamer.com/bullfrog-productions-a-history-of-the-legendary-uk-developer/ |archive-date=6 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bullfrog was originally a brand of Taurus;
