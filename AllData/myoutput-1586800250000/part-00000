The city of [[Banyuwangi (city)|Banyuwangi]] is the administrative capital. The name Banyuwangi is [[Javanese language|Javanese]] for \"fragrant water\", connected to the Javanese folklore of [[Sri Tanjung]].\n\n==Society and history==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht op Banjoewangi Oost-Java TMnr 60020438.jpg|thumb|View of Banyuwangi during [[Dutch East Indies|colonial period]] ]]\n\nOne Banyuwangi native group is the [[Osing people|Osing community]] which has a [[Hindu culture]] although they can be considered as a Javanese sub-ethnic group. They live mainly in the central part of Banyuwangi and they sometimes consider themselves as [[Majapahit]] descendants. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Other groups are [[Java (island)|Javanese]] (living mostly in the south and west), [[Madurese people|Madurese]] (mainly in the north and coastal area) and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] (scattered but more concentrated in the east). Other smaller groups include [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], [[Bugis|Buginese]], and [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]]s.\n\nOnce known as '''Blambangan''' (or its variation: Balambangan and Balumbungan), it was a [[vassal]] of the Majapahit Kingdom and a regional trade centre. After the Majapahit Kingdom ceased to exist, it became an independent kingdom and, as such, the last Hindu kingdom of Java. In order to defend itself from the troops of the [[Sultanate of Demak]], which tried to occupy it, Blambangan asked for help from Balinese kings, which caused it to lose its independence to Balinese kingdoms. During this time Blambangan was deeply influenced by [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]]. After around 150 years of Balinese occupation, the [[Sultanate of Mataram]] gained control of the territory and renamed it Banyuwangi. Later, it was part of the Mataram territory controlled by the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] (1770). During the expansion of plantations in the 19th century, many parts of Banyuwangi were planted with [[coffee]] and [[sugar cane]], which feature its landscape even now. The Chinese and Arabs came mostly during this period.\n\nBanyuwangi people are known for their combination of Islamic and pre-Islamic tradition.\n\nDuring the [[Fall of Suharto]], [[1998 East Java ninja scare|a witchhunt]] in [[Banyuwangi]] against alleged sorcerers spiraled into widespread riots and violence. In addition to alleged sorcerers, Islamic clerics were also targeted and killed,  [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] members were murdered by rioters.<ref>http://www.insideindonesia.org/weekly-articles/the-banyuwangi-murders</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053925,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=October 19, 1998}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Gandrung Dance===\n{{See also|Gandrung}}\nThis is a Banyuwangi-typical dance which performed by a woman and along with simple music like violin, [[triangle (music)|triangle]] (called {{transl|jv|kluncing}}), [[gong]] (or [[kempul]]), [[kendhang]] and sometimes with [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]] as result of modern influence.

It is a combination of Balinese, Javanese and local cultures. Balinese influences can be seen in its performers' costumes and instruments. Meanwhile, Javanese influences is in its \"lakon\" or stories as well as language in dialogues.

In 2006, the Banywangi regency administration granted a mining licence to one company, PT Indo Multi Niaga, which later transferred the licence to another company.  However, the local community had expressed concern about gold mining activities as early as 1997.  The issues partly related to the protection of the area around a local Hindu temple, partly relate to environmental matters, and partly related to local community views about the economic and social impact of the mining.<ref>Indra Harsaputra, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/01/30/banyuwangi-mining-site-risks-triggering-social-conflict-experts.html Banywangi mining site risks triggering

The city of [[Banyuwangi (city)|Banyuwangi]] is the administrative capital. The name Banyuwangi is [[Javanese language|Javanese]] for \"fragrant water\", connected to the Javanese folklore of [[Sri Tanjung]].\n\n==Society and history==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht op Banjoewangi Oost-Java TMnr 60020438.jpg|thumb|View of Banyuwangi during [[Dutch East Indies|colonial period]] ]]\n\nOne Banyuwangi native group is the [[Osing people|Osing community]] which has a [[Hindu culture]] although they can be considered as a Javanese sub-ethnic group. They live mainly in the central part of Banyuwangi and they sometimes consider themselves as [[Majapahit]] descendants. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Other groups are [[Java (island)|Javanese]] (living mostly in the south and west), [[Madurese people|Madurese]] (mainly in the north and coastal area) and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] (scattered but more concentrated in the east). Other smaller groups include [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], [[Bugis|Buginese]], and [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]]s.\n\nOnce known as '''Blambangan''' (or its variation: Balambangan and Balumbungan), it was a [[vassal]] of the Majapahit Kingdom and a regional trade centre. After the Majapahit Kingdom ceased to exist, it became an independent kingdom and, as such, the last Hindu kingdom of Java. In order to defend itself from the troops of the [[Sultanate of Demak]], which tried to occupy it, Blambangan asked for help from Balinese kings, which caused it to lose its independence to Balinese kingdoms. During this time Blambangan was deeply influenced by [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]]. After around 150 years of Balinese occupation, the [[Sultanate of Mataram]] gained control of the territory and renamed it Banyuwangi. Later, it was part of the Mataram territory controlled by the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] (1770). During the expansion of plantations in the 19th century, many parts of Banyuwangi were planted with [[coffee]] and [[sugar cane]], which feature its landscape even now. The Chinese and Arabs came mostly during this period.\n\nBanyuwangi people are known for their combination of Islamic and pre-Islamic tradition.\n\nDuring the [[Fall of Suharto]], [[1998 East Java ninja scare|a witchhunt]] in [[Banyuwangi]] against alleged sorcerers spiraled into widespread riots and violence. In addition to alleged sorcerers, Islamic clerics were also targeted and killed,  [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] members were murdered by rioters.<ref>http://www.insideindonesia.org/weekly-articles/the-banyuwangi-murders</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053925,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=October 19, 1998}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Gandrung Dance===\n{{See also|Gandrung}}\nThis is a Banyuwangi-typical dance which performed by a woman and along with simple music like violin, [[triangle (music)|triangle]] (called {{transl|jv|kluncing}}), [[gong]] (or [[kempul]]), [[kendhang]] and sometimes with [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]] as result of modern influence.

Meanwhile, Javanese influences is in its \"lakon\" or stories as well as language in dialogues.

However, the local community had expressed concern about gold mining activities as early as 1997.
