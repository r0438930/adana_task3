{"title_page": "List of Pump It Up songs", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Very long|date=August 2019}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=August 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2019}}\n}}\n{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Pump It Up'' songs}}\n\nThis is a master song list for [[Andamiro]]'s ''[[Pump It Up (video game series)|Pump It Up]]'' video game series.\n\n''Pump It Up'' features the in-house musician BanYa (separated artists are Yahpp, msgoon and BanYa Production), who were responsible for original songs in the series under dance pop, rock, heavy metal, jazz, folk, progressive and house genre, including the remixes of classical pieces such as ''Canon-D'', ''Turkey March'' and ''Moonlight''. In ''Pump It Up Fiesta'', MAX, Doin and SHK (originally from ''O2Jam'') joined as new in-house musicians.\n\nAlso, from ''Pump It Up 1st Dance Floor'' and onward are the large number of licensed K-pop songs from popular South Korean artists. Starting with ''Pump It Up Premiere'' and onward, the international songs are included mostly from North America, Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, China, etc. In almost every version, BanYa were also responsible for nonstop remixes that mixes numerous K-pop and world music songs, especially original songs (examples are ''J Knows that Old Bong'', ''World Remix'', ''Turkey Virus'', ''K-pop Dance'', ''Chicago Club Mix'', etc.), but they are available in Remix Station (Special Zone in ''NX'') and/or WorldMax in ''NX2'' and ''NXA'' (Quest World in ''Fiesta''). Starting ''Exceed 2'', full songs are added only in separate stations.\n\nThe background animations, or BGAs, are contributed to almost every song in Pump It Up series to add multimedia along with the song played, but some are generic in-game BGAs for remixes and full songs (especially regular songs when the visualizers have insufficient time to release until the next update or arcade mix). Some of these BGA's differ from each other, meaning they are visualized by numerous artists, but most of them are uncredited for unknown reasons. In ''Pump It Up Fiesta EX'', it marks the first game since ''Pump It Up 3rd Dance Floor ''(BanYa's \"An Interesting View\")'' ''where the visualizers are credited. These artists or animators can have either worked with Andamiro in-house, or been commissioned from animation studios outside. Starting ''Pump It Up Zero'', the live music video for the licensed K-pop song (and world music beginning in ''Pump It Up Fiesta 2, ''not in home version'' Exceed S.E.'') is added (''Footprints'' by T.O, e.g.) when Andamiro purchased a video from the record companies and studios. They are also cut for a regular song.\n\n==Songlist==\n=== ''1st Dance Floor''<ref>\"[http://www.ph-online.net/mixappearancesdb2015.xls 1st Dance floor to Prime Mix Appearances Excel file by Valius1]\".

Title of the anime is \"Canon-D: Part of the Memories #1\".\n\nDuring the field trip to the ancient park, the mysterious blue-haired student, felt in her presence, sneaks off from her classmates to find her old friend, the blue canon eye. She visits the old ruins through the hidden passage and finds the eye-carved ancient rock. She attaches her blue gem on its pupil, and she remembers the past through her flashback:\n\n''She was an intruder on the floating island, and the guardians, the red canon eyes, were searching for her. But her companion, the blue canon eye in exposed cyborg skin helps her destroy the treacherous island kingdom. To pass from the secured storage chamber, he fired a long-ranged laser beam at the ceiling bars to entrap the guards under debris. He led her to the master control room in the hidden door, and disguises himself using black hologram. He tricked the red guards to the wrong direction. When the diversion was discovered, the girl successfully overloaded the control center and ran away. The blue canon eye followed her through the passageways upstairs and downstairs. Outside the porch, she immediately leaped over the bottomless skies from the edge of the castle without fear, but she was saved when the blue canon eye caught her on his top. He led her to the escape chamber though the elevator. He desperately put her to the escape pod while the timer was quickly running out, guarding off the red canon eyes who are cutting out the sealed entrance. As the blue canon eye tried to flee to the same pod, the red laser was triggered to gun down the girl, but the blue canon eye protected her from being shot, sacrificing himself, and he was disabled. The reaction tossed the blue eye gem at her. The time was up and the pod launched away to the skies, leaving the floating island collapsing toward the ground. She embraced the blue pupil gem in grief.''\n\n''While she was brought to the exile, chambers, rooms and passages were shattered into pieces, and the gravity was shifted. The disabled blue canon eye rolled into the broken floors from the ruins and stopped at the ground.''\n\nThe flashback fades away to the present. The girl is still watching over her beloved protector to pay respects. She is amazed as the blue gem which she had placed blinks with light. This shows that the blue canon eye is functional again. The story ends.\n|'''Present'''\n||''Canon-D Full Song Mix'' is the first full PIU Original song in the series.\n''Canon-D Full Song Mix'' is the hidden song in ''Pump It Up Exceed 2.''\n|-\n|}\n\n=== ''Zero'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n|-\n!

The wolf boy tries to infatuate her by offering a bouquet of yellow flowers and a fish, and gets stubbornly ignored. A horse carriage rushes in, and terrifies the cat girl in front. The wolf boy immediately rescues her by throwing himself to push her away before she could be hit-and-run. Happily, he has his sparkling eyes met with love, but he gets slapped by her ungratefully. The cat girl leaves him sitting at the barrels depressively alone. But she returns and shows him a golden flower field and three windmills. Much of his delight, the wolf boy and cat girl falls in love with each other. Both of them kiss before a theatre curtain closes.\n\nVisualized by Coffee Milk\n|'''Present'''\n||Version 1.40+ only\n''Windmill ''is the second fastest song in the series with constant BPM.\n\n''Windmill ''is the first non-PRO song in the series that uses 3/4 time signature.\n|-\n|1340\n||Follow Me\n\ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 \ubbf8\n||SHK\n||PIU Original; Chiptune\n||155\n||Japan cities, temple and Mt.

It is shown that the witch wishes to steal the pendant. \"who have the pendant will get unlimited power\" is the reason. The pendant is worn by a young girl protected by her father the king from four shadow beings summoned in their castle. The wizard casts a portal in order to allow the girl escape. Her separation from her royal family saddens her with tears, while the king sacrifices himself to save his daughter.\nShe lands on the snowfield far away from the kingdom, cold and alone. As she drifts to nowhere in fear, she is ambushed by four shadow demons. She is almost sliced by one of the beings' blade-morphed arm, and she runs away helplessly. The fourth demon suddenly appears in front of her and stabs her brutally.\n\nHowever, this triggers her pendant's powerful wrath due to utter pain. She floats on mid-air, covered in fiery aura until her dress is magically changed to warrior-type outfit and the mystical long sword appears on her hands.\n\nThe shadow beings respond by attacking her, and the girl performs self-defense using the sword, although she has no skill in swordplay. Sometimes she is hit from behind, but she aimlessly swings her sword, fortunately slashing the incoming enemies. As she stands in front of the four shadow demons, she remembers what her father had been protecting her with courage and valor. Inspired by the deceased king, she is filled with strength and determination.

Starting with ''Pump It Up Premiere'' and onward, the international songs are included mostly from North America, Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, China, etc. In almost every version, BanYa were also responsible for nonstop remixes that mixes numerous K-pop and world music songs, especially original songs (examples are ''J Knows that Old Bong'', ''World Remix'', ''Turkey Virus'', ''K-pop Dance'', ''Chicago Club Mix'', etc.), but they are available in Remix Station (Special Zone in ''NX'') and/or WorldMax in ''NX2'' and ''NXA'' (Quest World in ''Fiesta''). Starting ''Exceed 2'', full songs are added only in separate stations.\n\nThe background animations, or BGAs, are contributed to almost every song in Pump It Up series to add multimedia along with the song played, but some are generic in-game BGAs for remixes and full songs (especially regular songs when the visualizers have insufficient time to release until the next update or arcade mix). Some of these BGA's differ from each other, meaning they are visualized by numerous artists, but most of them are uncredited for unknown reasons. In ''Pump It Up Fiesta EX'', it marks the first game since ''Pump It Up 3rd Dance Floor ''(BanYa's \"An Interesting View\")'' ''where the visualizers are credited. These artists or animators can have either worked with Andamiro in-house, or been commissioned from animation studios outside. Starting ''Pump It Up Zero'', the live music video for the licensed K-pop song (and world music beginning in ''Pump It Up Fiesta 2, ''not in home version'' Exceed S.E.'') is added (''Footprints'' by T.O, e.g.) when Andamiro purchased a video from the record companies and studios. They are also cut for a regular song.\n\n==Songlist==\n=== ''1st Dance Floor''<ref>\"[http://www.ph-online.net/mixappearancesdb2015.xls 1st Dance floor to Prime Mix Appearances Excel file by Valius1]\".

While the superhuman stands behind the front entrance, they are ordered to shoot him down (reference to the plot of the film, \"[[The End of Evangelion]]\"). But he has an inevitable force shield (reference to A.T. Field), leaving him unharmed. The superhuman uses his speed-of-light jump, making one of the guards astonished in fear. He finishes the guards, and gives more space to gaze at a woman, and smiles slowly. The scene freezes at the end of the song before they start the combat.\nVisualized by Kim Young Bum\n|'''Present'''\n||''Cannon X.1'' is the remix of ''Canon D'' by BanYa from ''Pump It Up Exceed 2.''\n\n''Cannon X.1'' shares some similarities with [[JerryC]]'s Canon Rock, the cover version of \"[[Canon in D]]\".\n\n''Cannon X.1''<nowiki/>'s video is inspired from [[Hideaki Anno]]'s anime, ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''.\n|-\n|F03\n||Chopsticks Challenge\n\uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubcc0\uc8fc\uace1\n||[[BanYa|Yahpp]]\n||PIU Original\nElectro House\n||128\n||Female dancer performs mambo dance in different shots.\nVisualized by Choi U Tum\n|'''Present'''\n||\n|-\n|F04\n||LaLaLa\n\ub77c \ub77c \ub77c\n||[[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]]\n||K-Pop\nBig Beat\n||102\n||Visualized by Lu In Chui\n|''Pump It Up Fiesta 2''\n||\n|-\n|F05\n||Adios\n\uc544\ub514\uc624\uc2a4\n||[[Eun Ji-won|Eun Ji Won]]\n||K-Pop\nSoul\n||123\n||In the deep space similar to Star Wars, a female space ranger receives a distress call from her brother imprisoned in the enemy battleship.

The girl fires her plasma beam at the reptilian aliens, and the boy slashes them. As the girl finds the lair of alien menace on her computer, both irrupt the colony, and defeat second wave of aliens by surprise. They enter the lair of eggs and confront the 6-armed draconian queen, so they repeat their attack and the colony detonates.

The wolf boy tries to infatuate her by offering a bouquet of yellow flowers and a fish, and gets stubbornly ignored. A horse carriage rushes in, and terrifies the cat girl in front. The wolf boy immediately rescues her by throwing himself to push her away before she could be hit-and-run. Happily, he has his sparkling eyes met with love, but he gets slapped by her ungratefully. The cat girl leaves him sitting at the barrels depressively alone. But she returns and shows him a golden flower field and three windmills. Much of his delight, the wolf boy and cat girl falls in love with each other.

It is shown that the witch wishes to steal the pendant. \"who have the pendant will get unlimited power\" is the reason. The pendant is worn by a young girl protected by her father the king from four shadow beings summoned in their castle. The wizard casts a portal in order to allow the girl escape. Her separation from her royal family saddens her with tears, while the king sacrifices himself to save his daughter.\nShe lands on the snowfield far away from the kingdom, cold and alone. As she drifts to nowhere in fear, she is ambushed by four shadow demons. She is almost sliced by one of the beings' blade-morphed arm, and she runs away helplessly. The fourth demon suddenly appears in front of her and stabs her brutally.\n\nHowever, this triggers her pendant's powerful wrath due to utter pain. She floats on mid-air, covered in fiery aura until her dress is magically changed to warrior-type outfit and the mystical long sword appears on her hands.\n\nThe shadow beings respond by attacking her, and the girl performs self-defense using the sword, although she has no skill in swordplay. Sometimes she is hit from behind, but she aimlessly swings her sword, fortunately slashing the incoming enemies. As she stands in front of the four shadow demons, she remembers what her father had been protecting her with courage and valor. Inspired by the deceased king, she is filled with strength and determination. She finishes the foes off in one powerful slash.\n\nAfter the shadow beings disintegrate from their deaths, the girl returns to normal self, worn-out and tattered, while her sword is standing behind her in the middle of snowy land.\n\nVisualized by ADZUKI & L.Ferdinant\n|'''Present'''\n|Version 1.15.0+ only\n\n''Prime Japanese Edition'' version 1.11.0+ only\n\n''Red Snow's'' title is mistakenly written as \"Red Snom\" on its background.
