Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as '''grana''' (singular: '''granum'''). Grana are connected by intergranal/ stroma thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment.\n\n==Etymology==\nI hatehomework\n\n==Structure==\n[[Image:Granum.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoid structures]]\n[[Image:chloroplast in leaf of Anemone sp TEM 85000x.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] image of grana]]\n\nThylakoids are membrane-bound structures embedded in the chloroplast [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]].

It plays an important role for [[photophosphorylation]] during [[photosynthesis]]. During the light-dependent reaction, protons are pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen making it acidic down to pH 4.\n\n===Granum and stroma lamellae===\n\nIn higher plants thylakoids are organized into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A '''granum''' (plural '''grana''') is a stack of thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or '''lamellae'''. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of [[electron tomography]] imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed [[helix]] is debated.<ref name=\"Mustardy\">{{cite journal |title=The Three-Dimensional Network of the Thylakoid Membranes in Plants: Quasihelical Model of the Granum-Stroma Assembly | journal=Plant Cell |volume=20 |pages=2552\u20132557 |year=2008 |author=Must\u00e1rdy, L. |author2=Buttle, K. |author3=Steinbach, G. |author4=Garab, G. |doi=10.1105/tpc.108.059147 |pmid=18952780 |issue=10 |pmc=2590735}}</ref>\n\n==Formation==\nChloroplasts develop from [[proplastid]]s when [[seedling]]s emerge from the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo and in the absence of light, proplastids develop into [[etioplast]]s that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo [[etiolation]]. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.\n\nThylakoid formation requires the action of ''vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1'' (VIPP1). Plants cannot survive without this protein, and reduced VIPP1 levels lead to slower growth and paler plants with reduced ability to photosynthesize. VIPP1 appears to be required for basic thylakoid membrane formation, but not for the assembly of protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vipp1 is required for basic thylakoid membrane formation but not for the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes |journal=Plant Physiol Biochem |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=119\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17346982 |doi=10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.01.005 |author1=Elena Aseeva |author2=Friederich Ossenb\u00fchl |author3=Claudia Sippel |author4=Won K.

There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane:\n*[[Photosystem]]s [[Photosystem I|I]] and [[Photosystem II|II]]\n*[[Cytochrome b6f complex]]\n*[[ATP synthase]]\n\nPhotosystem II is located mostly in the grana thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of grana. The cytochrome b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron carriers are required to shuttle electrons between them. These carriers are plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.\n\nTogether, these proteins make use of light energy to drive [[electron transport chain]]s that generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] across the thylakoid membrane and [[NADPH]], a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction. The [[ATP synthase]] uses the chemiosmotic potential to make [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] during [[photophosphorylation]].\n\n====Photosystems====\n{{main|Photosystem}}\n\nThese photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each consisting of an [[antenna complex]] that uses [[chlorophyll]]s and accessory [[photosynthetic pigment]]s such as [[carotenoids]] and [[phycobiliprotein]]s to harvest light at a variety of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll ''a'' at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. '''Photosystem I''' contains a pair of chlorophyll ''a'' molecules, designated [[P700]], at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700&nbsp;nm light. '''Photosystem II''' contains [[P680]] chlorophyll that absorbs 680&nbsp;nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red \u2013 see the [[visible spectrum]]). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.\n\n====Cytochrome b6f complex====\n{{main|Cytochrome b6f complex}}\nThe cytochrome b6f complex is part of the thylakoid electron transport chain and couples electron transfer to the pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen. Energetically, it is situated between the two photosystems and transfers electrons from photosystem II-plastoquinone to plastocyanin-photosystem I.\n\n====ATP synthase====\n{{main|ATP synthase}}\nThe thylakoid ATP synthase is a CF1FO-ATP synthase similar to the mitochondrial ATPase. It is integrated into the thylakoid membrane with the CF1-part sticking into stroma. Thus, ATP synthesis occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoids where the ATP is needed for the [[light-independent reaction]]s of photosynthesis.\n\n===Lumen proteins===\nThe electron transport protein [[plastocyanin]] is present in the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I. While plastoquinones are lipid-soluble and therefore move within the thylakoid membrane, plastocyanin moves through the thylakoid lumen.\n\nThe lumen of the thylakoids is also the site of water oxidation by the [[oxygen evolving complex]] associated with the lumenal side of photosystem II.\n\nLumenal proteins can be predicted computationally based on their targeting signals. In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted lumenal proteins possessing the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat]] signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (proteolysis and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.<ref name=\"Peltier2002\"/>\n\n===Protein expression===\nChloroplasts have their own [[genome]], which encodes a number of thylakoid proteins. However, during the course of plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the [[cell nucleus]] took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper [[stoichiometry]] and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by [[light]]. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by [[phosphorylation]] via redox-sensitive [[kinase]]s in the thylakoid membranes.<ref name=\"Vener\">{{cite journal |title=Protein phosphorylation and redox sensing in chloroplast thylakoids |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=217\u201323 |year=1998 |pmid=10066592 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(98)80107-6 |author1=Vener AV |author2=Ohad I |author3=Andersson B |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> The [[translation (biology)|translation]] rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by the presence or absence of assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis).<ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite journal |title=Assembly-controlled regulation of chloroplast gene translation |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=29 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=421\u20136 |year=2001 |pmid=11498001 |doi=10.1042/BST0290421 |author1=Choquet Y |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Rimbault B |author4=Zito F |author5=Girard-Bascou J |author6=Drapier D |author7=Wollman F |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This mechanism involves [[negative feedback]] through binding of excess protein to the 5' untranslated region of the chloroplast [[mRNA]].<ref name=\"Minai\">{{cite journal |title=Chloroplast Biogenesis of Photosystem II Cores Involves a Series of Assembly-Controlled Steps That Regulate Translation |journal=Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=159\u201375 |year=2006 |pmid=16339851 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.037705 |author1=Minai L |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Wollman F |author4=Choquet Y |name-list-format=vanc |pmc=1323491}}</ref> Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain.

Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), followed by a thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane ([[TIC/TOC complex|Toc and Tic]]) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat-dependent pathway]] (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin [[arginine]] motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP ([[signal recognition particle]]) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins as well as those that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.<ref name=\"Gutensohn\">{{cite journal |title=Toc, Tic, Tat et al.: structure and function of protein transport machineries in chloroplasts |journal=J.

These include light-driven water oxidation and [[oxygen evolution]], the pumping of protons across the thylakoid membranes coupled with the electron transport chain of the photosystems and cytochrome complex, and ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase utilizing the generated proton gradient.\n\n===Water photolysis===\n{{main|photolysis}}\nThe first step in photosynthesis is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons for the establishment of a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems. This oxidation of water conveniently produces the waste product O<sub>2</sub> that is vital for [[cellular respiration]]. The molecular oxygen formed by the reaction is released into the atmosphere.\n\n===Electron transport chains===\n{{main|electron transport chain}}\nTwo different variations of electron transport are used during photosynthesis:\n* '''Noncyclic electron transport''' or '''Non-cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> and ATP.\n* '''Cyclic electron transport''' or '''Cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces only ATP.\n\nThe noncyclic variety involves the participation of both photosystems, while the cyclic electron flow is dependent on only photosystem I.\n\n* '''Photosystem I''' uses light energy to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH + H<sup>+</sup>, and is active in both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport. In cyclic mode, the energized electron is passed down a chain that ultimately returns it (in its base state) to the chlorophyll that energized it.\n* '''Photosystem II''' uses light energy to oxidize water molecules, producing electrons (e<sup>\u2212</sup>), protons (H<sup>+</sup>), and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and is only active in noncyclic transport. Electrons in this system are not conserved, but are rather continually entering from oxidized 2H<sub>2</sub>O (O<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 4 e<sup>\u2212</sup>) and exiting with NADP<sup>+</sup> when it is finally reduced to NADPH.\n\n===Chemiosmosis===\n{{main|chemiosmosis}}\nA major function of the thylakoid membrane and its integral photosystems is the establishment of chemiosmotic potential. The carriers in the electron transport chain use some of the electron's energy to actively transport protons from the [[stromal cell|stroma]] to the [[thylakoid lumen|lumen]]. During photosynthesis, the lumen becomes [[acidic]], as low as pH 4, compared to pH 8 in the stroma.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jagendorf A. T. and E.

These are released in the lumen when the reduced plastoquinol is oxidized by the cytochrome b6f protein complex on the lumen side of the thylakoid membrane. From the plastoquinone pool, electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f complex. This integral membrane assembly resembles cytochrome bc1.\n* The reduction of [[plastoquinone]] by [[ferredoxin]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|cyclic electron transport]] also transfers two protons from the stroma to the lumen.\nThe proton gradient is also caused by the consumptions of protons in the stroma to make NADPH from NADP+ at the NADP reductase.\n\n====ATP generation====\nThe molecular mechanism of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts is similar to that in [[mitochondria]] and takes the required energy from the [[proton motive force]] (PMF).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, chloroplasts rely more on the [[chemical potential]] of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane [[electrical potential]] (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher [[membrane potential]] due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting [[chemiosmotic potential]] between the lumen and [[stromal cell|stroma]] is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the [[ATP synthase]]. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in [[ATP synthase]], ADP + P<sub>i</sub> are combined into ATP. In this manner, the [[light-dependent reactions]] are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria==\n[[File:Synechocystis.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoids (green) inside a cyanobacterium (''Synechocystis'')]]\n[[Cyanobacteria]] are photosynthetic prokaryotes with highly differentiated membrane systems.  Cyanobacteria have an internal system of thylakoid membranes where the fully functional electron transfer chains of [[photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reside.  The presence of different membrane systems lends these cells a unique complexity among [[bacteria]].  Cyanobacteria must be able to reorganize the membranes, synthesize new membrane lipids, and properly target proteins to the correct membrane system.  The [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]], [[plasma membrane]], and thylakoid membranes each have specialized roles in the cyanobacterial cell.

A '''granum''' (plural '''grana''') is a stack of thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or '''lamellae'''. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of [[electron tomography]] imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed [[helix]] is debated.<ref name=\"Mustardy\">{{cite journal |title=The Three-Dimensional Network of the Thylakoid Membranes in Plants: Quasihelical Model of the Granum-Stroma Assembly | journal=Plant Cell |volume=20 |pages=2552\u20132557 |year=2008 |author=Must\u00e1rdy, L. |author2=Buttle, K. |author3=Steinbach, G. |author4=Garab, G. |doi=10.1105/tpc.108.059147 |pmid=18952780 |issue=10 |pmc=2590735}}</ref>\n\n==Formation==\nChloroplasts develop from [[proplastid]]s when [[seedling]]s emerge from the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo and in the absence of light, proplastids develop into [[etioplast]]s that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo [[etiolation]]. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.\n\nThylakoid formation requires the action of ''vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1'' (VIPP1). Plants cannot survive without this protein, and reduced VIPP1 levels lead to slower growth and paler plants with reduced ability to photosynthesize. VIPP1 appears to be required for basic thylakoid membrane formation, but not for the assembly of protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vipp1 is required for basic thylakoid membrane formation but not for the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes |journal=Plant Physiol Biochem |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=119\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17346982 |doi=10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.01.005 |author1=Elena Aseeva |author2=Friederich Ossenb\u00fchl |author3=Claudia Sippel |author4=Won K.

There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane:\n*[[Photosystem]]s [[Photosystem I|I]] and [[Photosystem II|II]]\n*[[Cytochrome b6f complex]]\n*[[ATP synthase]]\n\nPhotosystem II is located mostly in the grana thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of grana. The cytochrome b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron carriers are required to shuttle electrons between them. These carriers are plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.\n\nTogether, these proteins make use of light energy to drive [[electron transport chain]]s that generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] across the thylakoid membrane and [[NADPH]], a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction. The [[ATP synthase]] uses the chemiosmotic potential to make [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] during [[photophosphorylation]].\n\n====Photosystems====\n{{main|Photosystem}}\n\nThese photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each consisting of an [[antenna complex]] that uses [[chlorophyll]]s and accessory [[photosynthetic pigment]]s such as [[carotenoids]] and [[phycobiliprotein]]s to harvest light at a variety of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll ''a'' at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. '''Photosystem I''' contains a pair of chlorophyll ''a'' molecules, designated [[P700]], at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700&nbsp;nm light. '''Photosystem II''' contains [[P680]] chlorophyll that absorbs 680&nbsp;nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red \u2013 see the [[visible spectrum]]). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.\n\n====Cytochrome b6f complex====\n{{main|Cytochrome b6f complex}}\nThe cytochrome b6f complex is part of the thylakoid electron transport chain and couples electron transfer to the pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen. Energetically, it is situated between the two photosystems and transfers electrons from photosystem II-plastoquinone to plastocyanin-photosystem I.\n\n====ATP synthase====\n{{main|ATP synthase}}\nThe thylakoid ATP synthase is a CF1FO-ATP synthase similar to the mitochondrial ATPase. It is integrated into the thylakoid membrane with the CF1-part sticking into stroma. Thus, ATP synthesis occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoids where the ATP is needed for the [[light-independent reaction]]s of photosynthesis.\n\n===Lumen proteins===\nThe electron transport protein [[plastocyanin]] is present in the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I. While plastoquinones are lipid-soluble and therefore move within the thylakoid membrane, plastocyanin moves through the thylakoid lumen.\n\nThe lumen of the thylakoids is also the site of water oxidation by the [[oxygen evolving complex]] associated with the lumenal side of photosystem II.\n\nLumenal proteins can be predicted computationally based on their targeting signals. In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted lumenal proteins possessing the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat]] signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (proteolysis and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.<ref name=\"Peltier2002\"/>\n\n===Protein expression===\nChloroplasts have their own [[genome]], which encodes a number of thylakoid proteins. However, during the course of plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the [[cell nucleus]] took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper [[stoichiometry]] and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by [[light]]. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by [[phosphorylation]] via redox-sensitive [[kinase]]s in the thylakoid membranes.<ref name=\"Vener\">{{cite journal |title=Protein phosphorylation and redox sensing in chloroplast thylakoids |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=217\u201323 |year=1998 |pmid=10066592 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(98)80107-6 |author1=Vener AV |author2=Ohad I |author3=Andersson B |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> The [[translation (biology)|translation]] rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by the presence or absence of assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis).<ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite journal |title=Assembly-controlled regulation of chloroplast gene translation |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=29 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=421\u20136 |year=2001 |pmid=11498001 |doi=10.1042/BST0290421 |author1=Choquet Y |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Rimbault B |author4=Zito F |author5=Girard-Bascou J |author6=Drapier D |author7=Wollman F |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This mechanism involves [[negative feedback]] through binding of excess protein to the 5' untranslated region of the chloroplast [[mRNA]].<ref name=\"Minai\">{{cite journal |title=Chloroplast Biogenesis of Photosystem II Cores Involves a Series of Assembly-Controlled Steps That Regulate Translation |journal=Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=159\u201375 |year=2006 |pmid=16339851 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.037705 |author1=Minai L |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Wollman F |author4=Choquet Y |name-list-format=vanc |pmc=1323491}}</ref> Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain.

Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), followed by a thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane ([[TIC/TOC complex|Toc and Tic]]) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat-dependent pathway]] (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin [[arginine]] motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP ([[signal recognition particle]]) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins as well as those that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.<ref name=\"Gutensohn\">{{cite journal |title=Toc, Tic, Tat et al.: structure and function of protein transport machineries in chloroplasts |journal=J.

These include light-driven water oxidation and [[oxygen evolution]], the pumping of protons across the thylakoid membranes coupled with the electron transport chain of the photosystems and cytochrome complex, and ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase utilizing the generated proton gradient.\n\n===Water photolysis===\n{{main|photolysis}}\nThe first step in photosynthesis is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons for the establishment of a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems. This oxidation of water conveniently produces the waste product O<sub>2</sub> that is vital for [[cellular respiration]]. The molecular oxygen formed by the reaction is released into the atmosphere.\n\n===Electron transport chains===\n{{main|electron transport chain}}\nTwo different variations of electron transport are used during photosynthesis:\n* '''Noncyclic electron transport''' or '''Non-cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> and ATP.\n* '''Cyclic electron transport''' or '''Cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces only ATP.\n\nThe noncyclic variety involves the participation of both photosystems, while the cyclic electron flow is dependent on only photosystem I.\n\n* '''Photosystem I''' uses light energy to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH + H<sup>+</sup>, and is active in both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport. In cyclic mode, the energized electron is passed down a chain that ultimately returns it (in its base state) to the chlorophyll that energized it.\n* '''Photosystem II''' uses light energy to oxidize water molecules, producing electrons (e<sup>\u2212</sup>), protons (H<sup>+</sup>), and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and is only active in noncyclic transport. Electrons in this system are not conserved, but are rather continually entering from oxidized 2H<sub>2</sub>O (O<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 4 e<sup>\u2212</sup>) and exiting with NADP<sup>+</sup> when it is finally reduced to NADPH.\n\n===Chemiosmosis===\n{{main|chemiosmosis}}\nA major function of the thylakoid membrane and its integral photosystems is the establishment of chemiosmotic potential. The carriers in the electron transport chain use some of the electron's energy to actively transport protons from the [[stromal cell|stroma]] to the [[thylakoid lumen|lumen]]. During photosynthesis, the lumen becomes [[acidic]], as low as pH 4, compared to pH 8 in the stroma.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jagendorf A. T. and E. Uribe|title=ATP formation caused by acid-base transition of spinach chloroplasts.|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|date=1966|volume=55|issue=1|pages=170\u2013177|doi=10.1073/pnas.55.1.170|pmid=5220864|pmc=285771}}</ref> This represents a 10,000 fold concentration gradient for [[proton]]s across the thylakoid membrane.\n\n====Source of proton gradient====\nThe protons in the lumen come from three primary sources.\n*[[Photolysis]] by [[photosystem II]] oxidises water to [[oxygen]], protons and [[electron]]s in the lumen.\n*The transfer of electrons from photosystem II to [[plastoquinone]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|non-cyclic electron transport]] consumes two protons from the stroma. These are released in the lumen when the reduced plastoquinol is oxidized by the cytochrome b6f protein complex on the lumen side of the thylakoid membrane. From the plastoquinone pool, electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f complex. This integral membrane assembly resembles cytochrome bc1.\n* The reduction of [[plastoquinone]] by [[ferredoxin]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|cyclic electron transport]] also transfers two protons from the stroma to the lumen.\nThe proton gradient is also caused by the consumptions of protons in the stroma to make NADPH from NADP+ at the NADP reductase.\n\n====ATP generation====\nThe molecular mechanism of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts is similar to that in [[mitochondria]] and takes the required energy from the [[proton motive force]] (PMF).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, chloroplasts rely more on the [[chemical potential]] of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane [[electrical potential]] (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher [[membrane potential]] due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting [[chemiosmotic potential]] between the lumen and [[stromal cell|stroma]] is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the [[ATP synthase]]. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in [[ATP synthase]], ADP + P<sub>i</sub> are combined into ATP. In this manner, the [[light-dependent reactions]] are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria==\n[[File:Synechocystis.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoids (green) inside a cyanobacterium (''Synechocystis'')]]\n[[Cyanobacteria]] are photosynthetic prokaryotes with highly differentiated membrane systems.  Cyanobacteria have an internal system of thylakoid membranes where the fully functional electron transfer chains of [[photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reside.  The presence of different membrane systems lends these cells a unique complexity among [[bacteria]].  Cyanobacteria must be able to reorganize the membranes, synthesize new membrane lipids, and properly target proteins to the correct membrane system.  The [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]], [[plasma membrane]], and thylakoid membranes each have specialized roles in the cyanobacterial cell.  Understanding the organization, functionality, protein composition and dynamics of the membrane systems remains a great challenge in cyanobacterial cell biology.<ref name=Herrero>{{cite book | author = Herrero A and Flores E (editor). | title = The Cyanobacteria: Molecular Biology, Genomics and Evolution | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/cyan | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/cyan ] | isbn = 978-1-904455-15-8}}</ref>\n\nThe thylakoid membranes of the cyanobacteria are not differentiated into granum and stroma regions as observed in plants.
