These genes are located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and code for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in either of these two genes will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channels, which are crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy from the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of action potential by temporarily changing the charge of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7597.2005.05105.x |pmid=16059449 |pmc=1176321 |title=A Plethora of SCN1A Mutations: What Can They Tell Us? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201320 |year=2005 |last1=Wallace |first1=Robyn }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala KL, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | year = 2001 | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel alpha II subunit gene Na(v)1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 11| pages = 6384\u20139 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmid=11371648 | pmc=33477}}</ref> Typically, a [[missense mutation]] in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome.

These genes are located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and code for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in either of these two genes will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channels, which are crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy from the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of action potential by temporarily changing the charge of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7597.2005.05105.x |pmid=16059449 |pmc=1176321 |title=A Plethora of SCN1A Mutations: What Can They Tell Us? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201320 |year=2005 |last1=Wallace |first1=Robyn }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala KL, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | year = 2001 | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel alpha II subunit gene Na(v)1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 11| pages = 6384\u20139 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmid=11371648 | pmc=33477}}</ref> Typically, a [[missense mutation]] in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome.
