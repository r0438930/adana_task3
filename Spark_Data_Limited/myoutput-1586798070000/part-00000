The [[United States Coast Guard]] is the only [[United States Armed Forces|branch]] that does not issue its own Parachutist Badge, but its members are authorized to receive the Parachutist Badges of other services in accordance with their prescribed requirements. The DoD military services are all awarded the same Basic Parachutist Badge. The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] issue the same Senior and Master Parachutist Badges while the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] issue the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Badge to advanced parachutists. The majority of the services earn their Basic Parachutist Badge through the [[United States Army Airborne School|U.S. Army Airborne School]].\n\n==Army==\nThe Army's Basic Parachutist Badge is awarded to all military personnel of any service who complete the [[United States Army Airborne School|US Army Basic Airborne Course]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It signifies that the soldier is a trained military [[Paratrooper|parachutist]], and is qualified to participate in airborne operations. The badge and its sew-on equivalent may be worn on the Army Combat Uniform (ACU).<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/TIOH/docs/Changes%20to%20Wear%20of%20Army%20ACU.pdf Army Directive 2011-11, Change to Wear of the Army Combat Uniform (ACU) Items] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510011151/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/TIOH/docs/Changes%20to%20Wear%20of%20Army%20ACU.pdf |date=10 May 2012 }}, Secretary of the Army, 13 June 2011, last accessed 18 February 2013</ref>\n\nThe original Army Parachutist Badge was designed in 1941 by [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] (later [[Lieutenant General]]) [[William P. Yarborough]] and approved by the Department of War in March of that year. The Parachutist Badge replaced the \"Parachutist Patch\" which had previously been worn as a large patch on the side of a paratrooper's garrison cap. LTG Yarborough also designed the Senior and Master Parachutist Badges and the addition of stars to portray the number of combat jumps. The flash that is worn behind the badge is also a contribution of [[William P. Yarborough]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qmfound.com/parachute_badge.htm |title=U.S. Army Parachute Badge|work=US Army Quartermaster Museum |first=K |last=Born |year=1998 |accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Basic Parachutist Badge===\nTo be eligible for award of the basic Parachutist Badge, an individual must have completed the Basic Airborne Course of the Airborne School of the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia.

Enlisted members are authorized the military free-fall parachutist '''(FPJ)''' designator added to their rating.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>\n\nWhen an officer initially qualifies as a static line parachutist, the [[United States military occupation codes#Commissioned Officer Designators|additional qualification designator]] (AQD) of BT1 will be entered into the officer's record by their detailer (NAVPERS). Free-fall qualification will result in an AQD of BT2.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>\n\nFor both Static Line and Military Free Fall Parachutist qualified personnel, a service record entry shall also indicate whether or not the member is HALO-qualified.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>\n\nThe Basic Parachutist Badge is a prerequisite for the [[Special Warfare Badge]] since parachutist training is an integral part of the Navy's [[United States Navy SEALs|Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL]] (BUD/S) program. SEAL personnel generally do not wear the Basic badge once they earn their [[Special Warfare insignia]], but will wear their Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Badge in addition to the Special Warfare Badge, the latter nicknamed the \"Budweiser\" badge. [[United States Navy EOD|Navy EOD]] technicians are generally also jump qualified with a number of them also being qualified in military free-fall ([[HALO jump|HALO/HAHO]]). Currently, due to a recent change, newly pinned Navy EOD technicians are required to attend the U.S. Army's Basic Airborne School upon graduation. As well, a number of [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen|SWCC]] personnel earn Basic Parachutist badges in conjunction with their assignment to a Special Boat Team detachment that uses the [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen#Maritime Craft Aerial Deployment System (MCADS)|Maritime Craft Air Delivery System (MCADS)]]. This enables them to drop small watercraft and their crews from [[C-130]] aircraft.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>\n\n===Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia===\nThe Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia (originally issued as Navy Parachute Rigger wings) is a gold-colored embroidered or metal insignia depicting an open parachute with outstretched wings. It is authorized for officers and enlisted personnel who were awarded the Basic Parachutist Insignia and, under competent orders, have completed a minimum of five additional [[Static line|static-line]] or P3 jumps, to include: ''(1) combat equipment day jump, two (2) combat equipment night jumps, and employ at least two (2) different types of military aircraft.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>''\n\nThe U.S Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist badge was originally known as the U.S. Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge and designed by American Insignia Company in 1942 for graduates of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School. During WWII, despite being against uniform regulations it became common for U.S. Marine Corps paratroopers who were issued the silver U.S. Army Basic Parachutist badge to wear the gold Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge because they believed the gold \"Rigger wings\" looked better on their uniform.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Chris|title=Paramarine!: Uniforms and Equipment of Marine Corps Parachute Units in World War II|date=2004|publisher=Schiffer Pub Ltd|isbn=9780764319242|pages=175\u2013177}}</ref> This out of regulations wearing of the Parachute Rigger badge became so common that in July 1963, the Commander of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]] Bruce F. Meyers sent a request to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[George W. Anderson Jr.]] via Marine Corps [[Commandant]] General [[David M. Shoup]] requesting to officially make the Navy Parachute Rigger badge the parachutist badge for the Navy and Marine Corps. The request was approved by Admiral Anderson on July 12, 1963 per BuPers Notice 1020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evolution of Naval Wings|url=http://uscgaviationhistory.aoptero.org/images/APP20.pdf|website=Coast Guard Aviation History|publisher=THE U.S. COAST GUARD AVIATION ASSOCIATION}}</ref> Since 1963, being a graduate of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School is no longer a requirement to earn the badge.

SEAL personnel generally do not wear the Basic badge once they earn their [[Special Warfare insignia]], but will wear their Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Badge in addition to the Special Warfare Badge, the latter nicknamed the \"Budweiser\" badge. [[United States Navy EOD|Navy EOD]] technicians are generally also jump qualified with a number of them also being qualified in military free-fall ([[HALO jump|HALO/HAHO]]). Currently, due to a recent change, newly pinned Navy EOD technicians are required to attend the U.S. Army's Basic Airborne School upon graduation. As well, a number of [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen|SWCC]] personnel earn Basic Parachutist badges in conjunction with their assignment to a Special Boat Team detachment that uses the [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen#Maritime Craft Aerial Deployment System (MCADS)|Maritime Craft Air Delivery System (MCADS)]]. This enables them to drop small watercraft and their crews from [[C-130]] aircraft.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>\n\n===Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia===\nThe Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia (originally issued as Navy Parachute Rigger wings) is a gold-colored embroidered or metal insignia depicting an open parachute with outstretched wings. It is authorized for officers and enlisted personnel who were awarded the Basic Parachutist Insignia and, under competent orders, have completed a minimum of five additional [[Static line|static-line]] or P3 jumps, to include: ''(1) combat equipment day jump, two (2) combat equipment night jumps, and employ at least two (2) different types of military aircraft.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>''\n\nThe U.S Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist badge was originally known as the U.S. Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge and designed by American Insignia Company in 1942 for graduates of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School. During WWII, despite being against uniform regulations it became common for U.S. Marine Corps paratroopers who were issued the silver U.S. Army Basic Parachutist badge to wear the gold Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge because they believed the gold \"Rigger wings\" looked better on their uniform.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Chris|title=Paramarine!: Uniforms and Equipment of Marine Corps Parachute Units in World War II|date=2004|publisher=Schiffer Pub Ltd|isbn=9780764319242|pages=175\u2013177}}</ref> This out of regulations wearing of the Parachute Rigger badge became so common that in July 1963, the Commander of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]] Bruce F. Meyers sent a request to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[George W. Anderson Jr.]] via Marine Corps [[Commandant]] General [[David M. Shoup]] requesting to officially make the Navy Parachute Rigger badge the parachutist badge for the Navy and Marine Corps. The request was approved by Admiral Anderson on July 12, 1963 per BuPers Notice 1020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evolution of Naval Wings|url=http://uscgaviationhistory.aoptero.org/images/APP20.pdf|website=Coast Guard Aviation History|publisher=THE U.S. COAST GUARD AVIATION ASSOCIATION}}</ref> Since 1963, being a graduate of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School is no longer a requirement to earn the badge. To be awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia did, however, require the parachutist to have completed the minimum five additional jumps in a jump billet.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Parachutist Badge]]\n* [[Air Assault Badge]]\n* [[Glider Badge]]\n* [[Pathfinder Badge]]\n* [[Blood wings]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Parachutist Badges of the US Army}}\n\n{{US Army badges}}\n\n[[Category:United States military parachuting badges]]\n", "name_user": "McChizzle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMilitary Freefall Parachutist Badges:Added main article template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachutist_Badge_(United_States)"}
