With a length (from the top of its head to the tip of its long pointed tail) of about one meter (3.3&nbsp;ft) it is longer than any other species of parrot. It is the largest [[macaw]] and the largest flying parrot species, though the flightless [[kakapo]] of New Zealand can outweigh it at up to 3.5&nbsp;kg. While generally easily recognized, it could be confused with the smaller [[Lear's macaw]]. Habitat loss and the trapping of wild birds for the pet trade have taken a heavy toll on their population in the wild, so the species is classified as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List]],<ref name=IUCN /> and it is protected by its listing on Appendix I of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES).\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nEnglish physician, ornithologist, and artist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] first described the hyacinth macaw in 1790 under the [[binomial name]] ''Psittacus hyacinthinus'' based on a taxidermic specimen sent to England.<ref>{{cite book| last= Latham| first= John | year=1790 | title= Index Ornithologicus, Sive Systema Ornithologiae: Complectens Avium Divisionem in Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, Ipsarumque Varietates (Volume 1) | language=Latin | place=London | publisher = Leigh & Sotheby | page=84 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QV5UAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT107}}</ref> It is one of two extant and one probably extinct species of the South American macaw genus ''[[Anodorhynchus]]''.\nDid you know that aliens exist.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Hyacinth Macaw head.jpg|205px|thumb|left|Close-up of head]]\n[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus ZOO Dvur Kralove.jpg|right|thumb|205px|A skeleton exhibited at [[Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo]] in [[Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 nad Labem]], Czech Republic]]\nThe largest parrot by length in the world, the hyacinth macaw is {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} long from the tip of its tail to the top of its head and weighs {{convert|1.2|\u2013|1.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Forshaw (2006). plate 70.\">Forshaw (2006). plate 70.</ref><ref name=\"animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu\">Hagan, E.

Reported sightings of tool use in wild parrots go as far back as 1863. Examples of tool use that have been observed usually involve a chewed leaf or pieces of wood. Macaws often incorporate these items when feeding on harder nuts. Their use allows the nuts the macaws eat to remain in position (prevent slipping) while they gnaw into it. It is not known whether this is learned social behavior or an innate trait, but observation on captive macaws shows that hand-raised macaws exhibit this behavior, as well. Comparisons show that older macaws were able to open seeds more efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10071-004-0221-3|pmid=15248094|title=Preliminary observations of tool use in captive hyacinth macaws (''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'')|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|year=2004|last1=Borsari|first1=Andressa|last2=Ottoni|first2=Eduardo B.}}</ref>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil -nest-8 (3).jpg|right|thumb|A pair in their nest]]\nNesting takes place between July and December, with nests constructed in tree cavities or cliff faces depending on the habitat.<ref name=\"Birdlife\" /> In the Pantanal region, 90% of nests are constructed in the manduvi tree (''[[Sterculia apetala]]'').

While the birds may be in decline in the wild, notably higher populations of captive macaws are being held in zoos and private collections. If success in managing and replanting the macaw's food trees and erecting nest boxes as an experiment in the Pantanals is seen, the species could survive. Survival rates could also be enhanced if ranch owners would leave all large and potential nest trees standing and eliminate all trapping on their properties. Ultimately, should these factors work in tandem with erection of nest boxes, fencing off of certain saplings, and the planting of others, the long-term prospects of the hyacinth macaw species would be greatly improved.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130px\">\nHyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) 2.jpg\nHyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) in flight.JPG\nFile:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -pet parrot-8a.jpg|Pet hyacinth macaw on arm\nFile:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -pet on bike handlebars-8.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of macaws]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{Cite book |first=Joseph M. |last=Forshaw |authorlink=Joseph Forshaw |title=Parrots of the World; an Identification Guide |others=Illustrated by [[Frank Knight (artist)|Frank Knight]] |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-09251-5 |nopp=yes |year=2006 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/parrotsofworldid0000fors }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus}}\n{{Wikispecies|Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus}}\n* [http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/hyacinth-macaw-anodorhynchus-hyacinthinus Hyacinth macaw] on the Internet Bird Collection\n* {{ARKive}}\n* [http://www.bluemacaws.org/ The Blue Macaws website]\n* [http://www.macaw-facts.com/species/blue-macaw-hyacinth-macaw-hyacinthine-macaw/ In-Depth Blue Macaw Research]\n* [http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=56513 Audio File of the hyacinth macaw]\n\n{{Macaws}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q463154}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:macaw, hyacinth}}\n[[Category:Anodorhynchus|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Macaws|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Talking birds]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Cerrado]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Pantanal]]\n[[Category:Birds of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1790|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Latham (ornithologist)|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Species endangered by habitat loss]]\n[[Category:Species endangered by the pet trade]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the bird|the play by Mac Wellman|The Hyacinth Macaw}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = Hyacinth macaw\n| image = Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -Disney -Florida-8.jpg\n| image_caption = At the [[Disney's Animal Kingdom Park]], Florida\n| status = VU  <!-- Do NOT change this to \"extinct\" here or make any such changes in the text unless you can provide authoritative sources that definitely state so.

With a length (from the top of its head to the tip of its long pointed tail) of about one meter (3.3&nbsp;ft) it is longer than any other species of parrot. It is the largest [[macaw]] and the largest flying parrot species, though the flightless [[kakapo]] of New Zealand can outweigh it at up to 3.5&nbsp;kg. While generally easily recognized, it could be confused with the smaller [[Lear's macaw]].

Reported sightings of tool use in wild parrots go as far back as 1863. Examples of tool use that have been observed usually involve a chewed leaf or pieces of wood. Macaws often incorporate these items when feeding on harder nuts. Their use allows the nuts the macaws eat to remain in position (prevent slipping) while they gnaw into it. It is not known whether this is learned social behavior or an innate trait, but observation on captive macaws shows that hand-raised macaws exhibit this behavior, as well. Comparisons show that older macaws were able to open seeds more efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10071-004-0221-3|pmid=15248094|title=Preliminary observations of tool use in captive hyacinth macaws (''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'')|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|year=2004|last1=Borsari|first1=Andressa|last2=Ottoni|first2=Eduardo B.}}</ref>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil -nest-8 (3).jpg|right|thumb|A pair in their nest]]\nNesting takes place between July and December, with nests constructed in tree cavities or cliff faces depending on the habitat.<ref name=\"Birdlife\" /> In the Pantanal region, 90% of nests are constructed in the manduvi tree (''[[Sterculia apetala]]'').

Due to the poor survival rates of the young, poachers concentrate more heavily on adult birds, which depletes the population at a rapid pace.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nAccording to Article 111 of Bolivian Environmental Law #1333, all persons involved in the trade, capture, and transportation without authorization of wild animals will suffer a two-year prison sentence, along with a fine equivalent to 100% of the value of the animal.<ref name=\"Luecker, H. 2000\">{{cite journal|author=L\u00fccker, H.|author2=Patzwahl, S.|last-author-amp=yes |title= The European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for the Hyacinth macaw ''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'' from 1989 to 1998|journal= International Zoo Yearbook|volume= 37|pages= 178\u2013183|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1090.2000.tb00720.x|year= 2000}}</ref> While many trackers have been arrested, the illegal pet trade still largely continues in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Unfortunately, animal trafficking is not necessarily viewed as a priority in the city, leaving national departmental and municipal governments unwilling to halt the trade in city centers, and local police reluctant to get involved. This ideology has in turn resulted in a lack of enforcement regarding trade in both CITES-restricted species and threatened species, with little to no restrictions regarding humane treatment of the animals, disease control, or proper hygiene. In the trade centers, the hyacinth macaw demanded the highest price of US$1,000, proving it to be a very desirable and valued bird in the pet trade industry.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mauricio, H.|author2=Hennessey, B.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Quantifying the illegal parrot trade in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, with emphasis on threatened species|journal=Bird Conservation International|volume=17|issue=4|pages=295\u2013300|doi=10.1017/S0959270907000858 |year=2007|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n=== Conservation steps taken to preserve the hyacinth macaw ===\n\nIn 1989, the [[European Endangered Species Programme]] for the hyacinth macaw was founded as a result of concerns about the status of the wild population and the lack of successful breeding in captivity.<ref name=\"Luecker, H. 2000\" /> Breeding in captivity still remains difficult, being that hand-reared hyacinth macaw offspring have demonstrated to have higher mortality rates, especially within the first month of life. Additionally, they have a higher incidence of acute crop stasis than other macaw species due, in part, to their specific dietary requirements.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Casares, M.|author2=F.

Many ranch owners in the Pantanal and Gerais, to protect the birds, no longer allow trappers on their properties.<ref name=IUCN />\n\nA number of conservation actions have been proposed, including the study of the current range, population status, and extent of trading in different parts of its range. Additionally, propositions have been made to assess the effectiveness of artificial nest boxes, enforce legal measures preventing trade, and experiment with ecotourism at one or two sites to encourage donors.<ref name=IUCN /> Furthermore, the Hyacinth Macaw Project in Mato Grosso do Sul has carried out important research by ringing individual birds and has created a number of artificial nests to compensate for the small number of sites available in the region.<ref name=\"Hyacinth Macaw 2013\" /> Furthermore, proposals to list the species as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act have been made to further protective measures in the US and to create Bolivian and Paraguayan trade management authorities under presidential control.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Long-term prospects ===\nEach of the three main populations should be managed as a separate biological entity so as to avoid numbers dropping below 500. While the birds may be in decline in the wild, notably higher populations of captive macaws are being held in zoos and private collections. If success in managing and replanting the macaw's food trees and erecting nest boxes as an experiment in the Pantanals is seen, the species could survive. Survival rates could also be enhanced if ranch owners would leave all large and potential nest trees standing and eliminate all trapping on their properties. Ultimately, should these factors work in tandem with erection of nest boxes, fencing off of certain saplings, and the planting of others, the long-term prospects of the hyacinth macaw species would be greatly improved.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130px\">\nHyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) 2.jpg\nHyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) in flight.JPG\nFile:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -pet parrot-8a.jpg|Pet hyacinth macaw on arm\nFile:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -pet on bike handlebars-8.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of macaws]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{Cite book |first=Joseph M. |last=Forshaw |authorlink=Joseph Forshaw |title=Parrots of the World; an Identification Guide |others=Illustrated by [[Frank Knight (artist)|Frank Knight]] |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-09251-5 |nopp=yes |year=2006 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/parrotsofworldid0000fors }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus}}\n{{Wikispecies|Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus}}\n* [http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/hyacinth-macaw-anodorhynchus-hyacinthinus Hyacinth macaw] on the Internet Bird Collection\n* {{ARKive}}\n* [http://www.bluemacaws.org/ The Blue Macaws website]\n* [http://www.macaw-facts.com/species/blue-macaw-hyacinth-macaw-hyacinthine-macaw/ In-Depth Blue Macaw Research]\n* [http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=56513 Audio File of the hyacinth macaw]\n\n{{Macaws}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q463154}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:macaw, hyacinth}}\n[[Category:Anodorhynchus|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Macaws|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Talking birds]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Cerrado]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Pantanal]]\n[[Category:Birds of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1790|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Latham (ornithologist)|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Species endangered by habitat loss]]\n[[Category:Species endangered by the pet trade]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c7:3a80:e700:a1fa:de43:edfb:1215", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTaxonomy)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth_macaw"}
