Her media career began in 1980 with the radio show ''Sexually Speaking'', which continued until 1990. She has hosted several series on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] Channel and other [[cable television]] networks from 1984 to 1993 and is the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWestheimer was born '''Karola Ruth Siegel''' on June 4, 1928, in Wiesenfeld (now part of [[Karlstadt am Main]]), [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], Irma (n\u00e9e Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a [[Notions (sewing)|notions]] wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/westheimer-ruth|title=Ruth Westheimer|publisher=JWA.org|date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> She was given an early grounding in [[Judaism]] by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district of [[Frankfurt]], where they lived. Her father was taken away by the Nazis a week after [[Kristallnacht]], or the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938. Westheimer cried while her father was taken away by men in gloss-finished boots, while her grandmother gave the men money and asked them to care for him. Westheimer's mother and grandmother decided that Germany was too dangerous due to the tension and Nazi violence growing, so in January 1939 they sent Westheimer on a \"[[Kindertransport|Kinder Transport]],\" a transport taking Jewish children going to Switzerland. 11-year-old Westheimer arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in [[Heiden, Switzerland]], and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children there. Westheimer was not allowed to take classes at the local school, but a fellow orphan boy would sneak his textbooks to Westheimer at night so she could learn and continue her education.\n\nWhile at the orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. When the letters ceased in 1941, Westheimer knew she would not hear from them again. The details of her parents' deaths due to the Holocaust are also included in the Hulu documentary about Westheimer titled \"Ask Dr. Ruth\". Her father was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] concentration camp in 1942. Her mother was killed during the Holocaust, but there is no specific information about her death, or about how and when she died. In the data base at the [[Yad Vashem]] World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer's mother is categorized by the word ''verschollen'' or 'disappeared.'\n\nWestheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. There, at 17, she \"first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception.\" She later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">Dullea, Georgia. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D9103FF935A15753C1A961948260 Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth]\".

Her media career began in 1980 with the radio show ''Sexually Speaking'', which continued until 1990. She has hosted several series on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] Channel and other [[cable television]] networks from 1984 to 1993 and is the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWestheimer was born '''Karola Ruth Siegel''' on June 4, 1928, in Wiesenfeld (now part of [[Karlstadt am Main]]), [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], Irma (n\u00e9e Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a [[Notions (sewing)|notions]] wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/westheimer-ruth|title=Ruth Westheimer|publisher=JWA.org|date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> She was given an early grounding in [[Judaism]] by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district of [[Frankfurt]], where they lived. Her father was taken away by the Nazis a week after [[Kristallnacht]], or the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938. Westheimer cried while her father was taken away by men in gloss-finished boots, while her grandmother gave the men money and asked them to care for him. Westheimer's mother and grandmother decided that Germany was too dangerous due to the tension and Nazi violence growing, so in January 1939 they sent Westheimer on a \"[[Kindertransport|Kinder Transport]],\" a transport taking Jewish children going to Switzerland. 11-year-old Westheimer arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in [[Heiden, Switzerland]], and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children there. Westheimer was not allowed to take classes at the local school, but a fellow orphan boy would sneak his textbooks to Westheimer at night so she could learn and continue her education.\n\nWhile at the orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. When the letters ceased in 1941, Westheimer knew she would not hear from them again. The details of her parents' deaths due to the Holocaust are also included in the Hulu documentary about Westheimer titled \"Ask Dr. Ruth\". Her father was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] concentration camp in 1942. Her mother was killed during the Holocaust, but there is no specific information about her death, or about how and when she died. In the data base at the [[Yad Vashem]] World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer's mother is categorized by the word ''verschollen'' or 'disappeared.'\n\nWestheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. There, at 17, she \"first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception.\" She later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">Dullea, Georgia. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D9103FF935A15753C1A961948260 Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth]\".
