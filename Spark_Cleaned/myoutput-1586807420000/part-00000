Each Special Forces Group (SFG) has a specific regional focus. The Special Forces soldiers assigned to these groups receive intensive language and cultural training for countries within their regional area of responsibility (AOR).<ref name=\"USASFC\">{{cite web |URL=http://www.soc.mil/SF/SF_default.htm |title=United States Army Special Forces Command}}</ref> Due to the increased need for Special Forces soldiers in the [[War on Terror]], all groups\u2014including those of the National Guard (19th and 20th SFGs)\u2014have been deployed outside of their areas of operation (AOs), particularly to [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nUntil recently an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group by 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n<gallery>\nFile:1st Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 1st SFG(A)\nFile:3rd Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 3rd SFG(A)\nFile:5h Special Forces Group - 4 battalions.jpg|Current structure of the 5th SFG(A)\nFile:7th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 7th SFG(A)\nFile:10th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 10th SFG(A)\nFile:20th Special Operations Group - New nomenclature.JPG|Current structure of the 20th SFG(A) (ARNG)\n</gallery>\n\nA Special Forces group is historically assigned to a [[Unified Combatant Command]] or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions.

Preparing for a 12 October visit to the Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the president sent word to the center's commander, Colonel [[William P.

The president felt that since they had a special mission, Special Forces should have something to set them apart from the rest.

This example pre-dates \"Delta\" among others.]]\nThe origin of the term ''operator'' in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces (referred to by many civilians as \"Green Berets\"). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marines|Marines]] was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the ''''Code of the Special Forces Operator'''' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\". ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'' (V14/N1), pp. 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nInside the [[USSOCOM|United States Special Operations]] community, an ''operator'' is a [[Delta Force]] member who has completed selection and has graduated OTC (Operators Training Course). ''Operator'' was used by Delta Force to distinguish between operational and non-operational personnel assigned to the unit.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite book |last=Haney |first=Eric L. |authorlink=Eric Haney |title=[[Inside Delta Force]] |publisher=[[Delacorte Press]] |year=2002 |location=New York |page=325 |isbn=978-0-385-33603-1}}</ref>  Other [[United States special operations forces|special operations forces]] use specific names for their jobs, such as Army ''Rangers'' and Air Force ''Pararescuemen''. The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created '''\"Special Warfare Operator\" (SO)''' as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]).

A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of Group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nUntil recently an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group by 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n<gallery>\nFile:1st Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 1st SFG(A)\nFile:3rd Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 3rd SFG(A)\nFile:5h Special Forces Group - 4 battalions.jpg|Current structure of the 5th SFG(A)\nFile:7th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 7th SFG(A)\nFile:10th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 10th SFG(A)\nFile:20th Special Operations Group - New nomenclature.JPG|Current structure of the 20th SFG(A) (ARNG)\n</gallery>\n\nA Special Forces group is historically assigned to a [[Unified Combatant Command]] or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions.

The team also includes the following enlisted soldiers: one 18Z (Operations Sergeant) (known as the \"Team Sergeant\"), usually a Master Sergeant, one 18F (Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant), usually a Sergeant First Class, and two each, 18Bs (Weapons Sergeant), 18Cs (Engineer Sergeant), 18Ds (Medical Sergeant), and 18Es (Communications Sergeant), usually Sergeants First Class, Staff Sergeants or Sergeants. This organization facilitates 6-man \"split team\" operations, redundancy, and mentoring between a senior NCO and their junior assistant.\n\n==Qualifications==\n[[File:A Special Forces candidate and several role players conduct planning during ROBIN SAGE.jpg|thumb|right|A Special Forces candidate conducts a pre-mission rehearsal with Army ROTC cadets role-playing guerrilla fighters during ROBIN SAGE.]]\n[[File:C-130J HALO jump 140422-F-RH756-417.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Special Forces Group conduct [[High-altitude military parachuting|high-altitude low-opening]] (HALO) jump over Yakima training center, c. 2014]]\n[[File:Alabama National Guard controlled ascent (17310136912).jpg|thumb|20th Special Forces Group soldiers conduct dive operations]]\n\nThe basic eligibility requirements to be considered for entry into the Special Forces are:\n\n:*Be age 20\u201336.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goarmysof.com/sf-qualifications/|title=Qualifications|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=goarmysof.com|accessdate=2018-03-02}}</ref>\n:*Be a U.S. citizen.\n:*Be a high school graduate.\n:*Score a General Technical score of 110 or higher or a combat operation score of 110 on the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]].\n:*Airborne qualified or volunteer for Airborne training\n:*Must pass the Physical Fitness Assessment with at least 49 push-ups, 59 sit-ups, six pull-ups, and run two miles in a maximum of 15:12.\n:*Meet medical fitness standards as outlined in SF Physical IAW AR 40-501\n:*Must successfully complete the Pre-Basic Task list.\n:*Eligible for a secret security clearance\n:*Swim 50 m wearing [[Army Combat Boot|boots]] and [[Army Combat Uniform|ACUs]] prior to SFQC\n:*Must have 20/20 or corrected to 20/20 in both near and distant vision in both eyes.\n:*One year of college is preferred, but it is not mandatory for enlistment.\n\n==Selection and training==\n{{Main|United States Army Special Forces selection and training}}\n\nThe Special Forces soldier trains on a regular basis over the course of their entire career.

The length of the Q Course changes depending on the applicant's primary job field within Special Forces and their assigned foreign language capability, but will usually last between 55 and 95 weeks. After successfully completing the Special Forces Qualification Course, Special Forces soldiers are then eligible for many advanced skills courses.

Preparing for a 12 October visit to the Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the president sent word to the center's commander, Colonel [[William P.

This example pre-dates \"Delta\" among others.]]\nThe origin of the term ''operator'' in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces (referred to by many civilians as \"Green Berets\"). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marines|Marines]] was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the ''''Code of the Special Forces Operator'''' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\".

The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created '''\"Special Warfare Operator\" (SO)''' as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]).
