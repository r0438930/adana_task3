ARVs are crewed by [[authorised firearms officer|authorised firearms officers]] to respond to incidents believed to involve firearms or other high-risk situations. ARVs are specially adapted and modified to accommodate specialist equipment.\n\n== Introduction of ARVs ==\n[[File:West Midland Police armed response vehicle (2).JPG|thumb|Equipment in the boot of an ARV from [[West Midlands Police]]]]\nArmed response vehicles were to show how gay [[User:Jusdafax|Jusdafax]]. is just look introduced to the British Police to provide them with a firearms response capability, as police in the [[United Kingdom]] (except Northern Ireland) do not routinely carry firearms on patrol, with the exception of   a minority of armed officers. Outside of London, ARVs are controlled and organised by the [[Firearms unit|Force Firearms Unit]], and within the capital they are controlled by [[Specialist Firearms Command]]. ARVs are identifiable in London by a yellow dot sticker, visible from each angle, and an asterisk on the roof to enable helicopters to identify the vehicle as being an ARV. [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] vehicles, identifiable by their red paintwork, utilise the same markings to denote the carrying of firearms officers.\n\nARVs were deployed officially for the first time in London, during 1991. An \"unpublicised\" ARV was deployed in the Brixton area after the riots and was operational in the 1980s, code name Lima Delta 53. This had the standard [[Smith & Wesson]] revolvers and was on patrol at all times. Following their success, forces outside of the capital later formed similar units during the early to mid-1990s. The concept of an ARV was influenced by [[West Yorkshire Police]]'s instant response cars, as used from 1976.\n\nEarly ARVs contained a secure safe between the seats containing a [[.38 Special|.38]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[Smith & Wesson Model 10|Model 10]] for each member, with two [[9 mm caliber|9mm]] [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] [[carbine]]s secured in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]]. After ARVs became established and the practice was accepted for widespread use, the Model 10 [[revolver]]s were replaced by the [[Semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic]] [[Glock pistol|Glock 17]] handgun chambered in 9\u00d719mm. In 2010, the [[Heckler & Koch G36|Heckler & Koch G36C]] 5.56mm carbine was introduced in case of a [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai style terrorist attack]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gardham|first1=Duncan|title=Military-style guns for police to fight terrorists on the streets|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7594871/Military-style-guns-for-police-to-fight-terrorists-on-the-streets.html|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=15 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Report9th\">{{cite web|title=Report on the Ninth International Law Enforcement Forum - International Law Enforcement Recommendations on Preventing and Countering Armed Attacks|url=https://www.interpol.int/Media/Files/INTERPOL-Expertise/IGLC/Report-on-the-Ninth-International-Law-Enforcement-Forum-International-Law-Enforcement-Recommendations-on-Preventing-and-Countering-Armed-Attacks|website=Interpol|date=2013|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nRevolvers and pistols could be removed from the secure safe by ARV members if, in a member's opinion, an immediate threat to life was posed. Authorisation for this from the control room was required, including contacting an officer of [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO) rank. If a high-ranking officer was not available, a [[Chief Inspector]] could give authorisation in an emergency. Following an increase in the size of the Firearms Unit, Commissioner [[Sir Paul Condon]] issued regulations, effective 23 May 1994, that gave ARV crews standing authority to wear their handguns overtly and to deploy their weapons.
