It formed in 1997 following a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's [[ceasefire]] that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the Real IRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]] and styles itself as simply \"the Irish Republican Army\" in English or ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]'' in Irish. It is an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and designated as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the [[Terrorism Act 2000#Proscribed groups|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]].\n\nSince its formation, the Real IRA has [[Timeline of Real Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]] against the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI)\u2014formerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC)\u2014and the [[British Army]]. It is the largest and most active of the \"[[dissident republican]]\" paramilitary groups [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|operating against]] the British [[security forces]]. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, and with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The organisation has also been responsible for bombings in Northern Ireland and England with the goal of causing economic harm and disruption. The most notable of these was the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]], which killed 29 people. After that bombing the Real IRA went on ceasefire, but resumed operations again in 2000. In March 2009 it claimed responsibility for an [[2009 Massereene Barracks shooting|attack on Massereene Barracks]] which killed two British soldiers, the first to be killed in Northern Ireland since 1997. The Real IRA has also been involved in [[vigilantism in Northern Ireland|vigilantism]], mainly against drug dealers and organised crime gangs. In Dublin in particular it has been accused of extortion and engaging in feuds with these gangs.\n\nIn July 2012 it was reported that [[Republican Action Against Drugs]] (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the Real IRA. This new entity was named the '''New IRA''' ('''NIRA)''' by the media<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/14/police-severe-terror-threat-ira-northern-ireland-bomb-attacks|title=Police \u2018are facing severe terror threat from IRA\u2019|first=Henry|last=McDonald|date=14 May 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> but members continue to identify themselves as simply \"the Irish Republican Army\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/republican-groups-form-new-ira-535041-Jul2012/|title=Dissident republican groups merge to form \u2018new IRA\u2019|first=Gavan|last=Reilly|website=TheJournal.ie}}</ref> Small pockets of the Real IRA that did not merge with the New IRA continue have a presence in [[Republic of Ireland]], particularly in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and to a lesser extent in [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Keeffe|first1=Cormac|title=New IRA \u2018will be unaffected\u2019 by murder on Derry street|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/views/analysis/new-ira-will-be-unaffected-by-murder-on-derry-street-920365.html|newspaper=Irish Examiner|accessdate=18 December 2019|date=27 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nIn July 1997 the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] called a ceasefire.

It formed in 1997 following a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's [[ceasefire]] that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the Real IRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]] and styles itself as simply \"the Irish Republican Army\" in English or ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]'' in Irish. It is an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and designated as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the [[Terrorism Act 2000#Proscribed groups|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]].\n\nSince its formation, the Real IRA has [[Timeline of Real Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]] against the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI)\u2014formerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC)\u2014and the [[British Army]]. It is the largest and most active of the \"[[dissident republican]]\" paramilitary groups [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|operating against]] the British [[security forces]]. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, and with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The organisation has also been responsible for bombings in Northern Ireland and England with the goal of causing economic harm and disruption. The most notable of these was the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]], which killed 29 people. After that bombing the Real IRA went on ceasefire, but resumed operations again in 2000. In March 2009 it claimed responsibility for an [[2009 Massereene Barracks shooting|attack on Massereene Barracks]] which killed two British soldiers, the first to be killed in Northern Ireland since 1997.
