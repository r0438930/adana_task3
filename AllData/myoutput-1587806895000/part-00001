The shire covers an area of {{convert|870|km2|sqmi|1}}.  The shire existed as a local government entity from 1910 until 2008, when it was [[Merger (politics)|amalgamated]] \nwith the [[Shire of Maroochy]] and [[City of Caloundra]] to form the [[Sunshine Coast Region]], and again from 1 January 2014, when it was re-established.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Noosa.jpg|thumb|left|Noosa Beach.]]\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe Noosa area was originally home to several [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] groups. These primarily include the ''[[Undumbi]]'' tribe to the south, the ''[[Dulingbara]]'' to the north, and the ''[[Kabi Kabi]]'' (or ''Gabbi Gabbi'') to the west.\n\n''[[Gabi-Gabi language|Gubbi Gubbi]] (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi)'' is an [[Australian Aboriginal language]] spoken on Gubbi Gubbi country. The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the [[Sunshine Coast Region]] and [[Gympie Region]], particularly the towns of [[Caloundra]], [[Noosa Heads, Queensland|Noosa Heads]], [[Gympie]] and extending north towards [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] and south to [[Caboolture, Queensland|Caboolture]]''.''<ref>{{Cite SLQ-CC-BY|url=https://maps.slq.qld.gov.au/iyil/view/13|title=Gubbi Gubbi|author=|date=|website=Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages map|access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 the Australian Federal Court determined (title claim QC2013/003) that the native title holders for the Noosa area are the Kabi Kabi First Nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Native Title Applications and Determination Areas |url=http://www.nntt.gov.au/Maps/QLD_Southern_and_Western_NTDA_Schedule.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough much of the culture and presence of the traditional owners of the Noosa district has been lost during the short period of white settlement, there still exist many subtle reminders. These include:\n* [[bora ring]]s, used during rituals.\n* [[scarred tree|canoe trees]], marks on trees where bark was removed for canoes.\n* border/navigation trees, marks on trees used to mark paths and/or tribal borders.\n* [[Indigenous Australian art#Rock engravings|stone carvings]]\n* [[burial tree]]s\n* [[midden]]s, shell mound created by thousands of years of discarded shells.\n* stone axes\n* spoken legends, many local legends which were traditionally passed through the generations survive today.\n* [[List of Australian place names of Aboriginal origin|place names]]'', many local names are versions of the original Aboriginal names.\n\nIt is widely accepted that the name Noosa comes from the local [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word (Noothera or Gnuthuru in the Kabi Kabi language) for shadow or shady place.<ref>{{cite web |last=Potter |first=Ron |title=Place Names of South-East Queensland |url=http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~piula/Placenames/page49.html |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816081404/http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~piula/Placenames/page49.html |archivedate=16 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An 1870 map of Noosa shows the Noosa River written as Nusa River.

This early settlement was primarily driven firstly by timber [[logging]] and then secondly a [[gold rush]] in the [[Gympie]] area, north of Noosa. The difficulty of transport in the region, which persisted to the 1920s and beyond, was one major reason for this.\n\nIn 1871, the Government laid out a port at Tewantin, which was duly surveyed and by 1877 contained two hotels, a boarding house, school, police station and telegraph office. In 1872, the Noosa Heads and coastal region south to Peregian Beach was set aside as an Aboriginal Mission, however this was cancelled in 1878 and land was opened for selection on 15 January 1879. With the advent of the railway, Tewantin declined in importance.<ref name=noosahist>{{cite web |url=http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/docs/CommGuide05PartD.pdf |format=PDF |title=Noosa Community Guide - 2005 and Beyond (5th ed.) |author=Noosa Council |year=2005 |pages=44\u201357 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724202653/http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/docs/CommGuide05PartD.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 24 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nNoosa is a region, not a town. It contains beaches and a beach national park, the cleanest river in South-East Queensland and an extensive trail network inland, linking a number of lifestyle villages, including Cooroy and Pomona. In the last 50 years Noosa has been transformed from an isolated fishing village to a [[tourist]] destination. Although this has had its costs the shire is known for its generally ''greener'' approach to development. Most development in Noosa has been restrained. Noosa has no high rise buildings, due both to local community pressure and to council planning action, and much remaining native forest. 34.8% of the Noosa district consists of [[National Park]]s, [[Conservation park (Australia)|Conservation Park]]s, [[State Forest]]s, and other generally protected land.\n\nThe popularity of Noosa Heads comes from the fact that is it one of Australia's few North facing beaches located on the East Coast, hence Noosa Beach is relatively protected from on-shore wind and storms.\n\n===Council history===\nThe area was originally incorporated as part of the [[Shire of Widgee|Widgee Divisional Board]] on 11 November 1879 under the ''Divisional Boards Act 1879''. Noosa was created as a separate shire under the ''Local Authorities Act 1902'' in 1910, with an initial population of 2,000. The first elections were held on 22 April 1910 and resulted in James Duke becoming the first shire chairman. The Noosa Shire Hall was constructed in [[Pomona, Queensland|Pomona]] in 1911.<ref name=noosahist/>\n\nOn Saturday 8 September 1917, an Honour Roll was unveiled at the Noosa Shire Hall in Pomona. It was to honour and commemorate those from the district who had left Australia to serve in the armed forces during [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81861529 |title=The Chronicle.

In December 1980, the Shire headquarters moved to Pelican Street, [[Tewantin, Queensland|Tewantin]].

The core Councillors who were most influential in this change were elected in a group called The Resident's Team{{cn|date=April 2020}}.  They laid the foundation for many of the planning and environmental protection concepts for which Noosa is now famous{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The 1982-1985 Noosa Council was the first to introduce the idea of a development/population cap{{cn|date=April 2020}}, the concept of strategic planning, a focus on community arts, the use of design and landscape controls in development applications and they introduced drafts of many of the first development control plans for each of the Noosa townships. The business lobby supported by several local media personalities were successful in seeing this Council being largely replaced by a pro-development Council in the 1985 election{{cn|date=April 2020}}.  That pro-development Council was, in turn, largely removed by the Noosa community in the subsequent 1988 election.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n  \nFollowing the election of Noosa's first green mayor, Noel Playford who was an original member of the 1982-1985 Residents Team{{cn|date=April 2020}}, in 1988, Noosa's first formal strategic plan was gazetted, and in 1990 development was limited to four storeys. In 1993, a major Council and community complex covering {{convert|9|ha|acre|1}} opened at Wallace Park, [[Noosaville, Queensland|Noosaville]].\n\nIn 1995, the mayor Noel Playford controversially formally announced a \"population cap\" of 56,500 people for Noosa Shire based on the initial concepts developed during the 1982-1985 Council term.<ref>{{cite web |last=Winsbury |first=John |title=If the cap fits - can we wear it? |url=https://www.planning.org.au/documents/item/2187 |accessdate=25 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415113941/http://www.planning.org.au/documents/item/2187 |archivedate=15 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The population cap was the expected population under the planning scheme if all available land was developed in accordance with the planning scheme.

Theatre, dance, music, food, film, supper clubs, workshops and more are featured as part of the free and ticketed event program. The event attracts over 10,000 people each year.\n\nThe recently developed [[The J Centre]] in [[Noosa Heads]] has become another centre for live theatre and musical performances, as well as a secondary campus for the [[University of the Sunshine Coast]].\n\nThe [[Noosa Country Show]] is the yearly event established 1909 to showcase the shire's best cattle, horsemen etc. The show is held on the 2nd weekend of every September at the Pomona Showgrounds.\n\nPomona is also home to the Noosa Shire Museum, where European and indigenous history are displayed side by side, and The Majestic Theatre, a performing arts center for the Noosa Northern Hinterland.

The shire covers an area of {{convert|870|km2|sqmi|1}}.  The shire existed as a local government entity from 1910 until 2008, when it was [[Merger (politics)|amalgamated]] \nwith the [[Shire of Maroochy]] and [[City of Caloundra]] to form the [[Sunshine Coast Region]], and again from 1 January 2014, when it was re-established.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Noosa.jpg|thumb|left|Noosa Beach.]]\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe Noosa area was originally home to several [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] groups. These primarily include the ''[[Undumbi]]'' tribe to the south, the ''[[Dulingbara]]'' to the north, and the ''[[Kabi Kabi]]'' (or ''Gabbi Gabbi'') to the west.\n\n''[[Gabi-Gabi language|Gubbi Gubbi]] (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi)'' is an [[Australian Aboriginal language]] spoken on Gubbi Gubbi country. The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the [[Sunshine Coast Region]] and [[Gympie Region]], particularly the towns of [[Caloundra]], [[Noosa Heads, Queensland|Noosa Heads]], [[Gympie]] and extending north towards [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] and south to [[Caboolture, Queensland|Caboolture]]''.''<ref>{{Cite SLQ-CC-BY|url=https://maps.slq.qld.gov.au/iyil/view/13|title=Gubbi Gubbi|author=|date=|website=Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages map|access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 the Australian Federal Court determined (title claim QC2013/003) that the native title holders for the Noosa area are the Kabi Kabi First Nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Native Title Applications and Determination Areas |url=http://www.nntt.gov.au/Maps/QLD_Southern_and_Western_NTDA_Schedule.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough much of the culture and presence of the traditional owners of the Noosa district has been lost during the short period of white settlement, there still exist many subtle reminders. These include:\n* [[bora ring]]s, used during rituals.\n* [[scarred tree|canoe trees]], marks on trees where bark was removed for canoes.\n* border/navigation trees, marks on trees used to mark paths and/or tribal borders.\n* [[Indigenous Australian art#Rock engravings|stone carvings]]\n* [[burial tree]]s\n* [[midden]]s, shell mound created by thousands of years of discarded shells.\n* stone axes\n* spoken legends, many local legends which were traditionally passed through the generations survive today.\n* [[List of Australian place names of Aboriginal origin|place names]]'', many local names are versions of the original Aboriginal names.\n\nIt is widely accepted that the name Noosa comes from the local [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word (Noothera or Gnuthuru in the Kabi Kabi language) for shadow or shady place.<ref>{{cite web |last=Potter |first=Ron |title=Place Names of South-East Queensland |url=http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~piula/Placenames/page49.html |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816081404/http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~piula/Placenames/page49.html |archivedate=16 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An 1870 map of Noosa shows the Noosa River written as Nusa River.

This early settlement was primarily driven firstly by timber [[logging]] and then secondly a [[gold rush]] in the [[Gympie]] area, north of Noosa. The difficulty of transport in the region, which persisted to the 1920s and beyond, was one major reason for this.\n\nIn 1871, the Government laid out a port at Tewantin, which was duly surveyed and by 1877 contained two hotels, a boarding house, school, police station and telegraph office. In 1872, the Noosa Heads and coastal region south to Peregian Beach was set aside as an Aboriginal Mission, however this was cancelled in 1878 and land was opened for selection on 15 January 1879. With the advent of the railway, Tewantin declined in importance.<ref name=noosahist>{{cite web |url=http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/docs/CommGuide05PartD.pdf |format=PDF |title=Noosa Community Guide - 2005 and Beyond (5th ed.) |author=Noosa Council |year=2005 |pages=44\u201357 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724202653/http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/docs/CommGuide05PartD.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 24 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nNoosa is a region, not a town. It contains beaches and a beach national park, the cleanest river in South-East Queensland and an extensive trail network inland, linking a number of lifestyle villages, including Cooroy and Pomona. In the last 50 years Noosa has been transformed from an isolated fishing village to a [[tourist]] destination. Although this has had its costs the shire is known for its generally ''greener'' approach to development. Most development in Noosa has been restrained. Noosa has no high rise buildings, due both to local community pressure and to council planning action, and much remaining native forest. 34.8% of the Noosa district consists of [[National Park]]s, [[Conservation park (Australia)|Conservation Park]]s, [[State Forest]]s, and other generally protected land.\n\nThe popularity of Noosa Heads comes from the fact that is it one of Australia's few North facing beaches located on the East Coast, hence Noosa Beach is relatively protected from on-shore wind and storms.\n\n===Council history===\nThe area was originally incorporated as part of the [[Shire of Widgee|Widgee Divisional Board]] on 11 November 1879 under the ''Divisional Boards Act 1879''. Noosa was created as a separate shire under the ''Local Authorities Act 1902'' in 1910, with an initial population of 2,000. The first elections were held on 22 April 1910 and resulted in James Duke becoming the first shire chairman. The Noosa Shire Hall was constructed in [[Pomona, Queensland|Pomona]] in 1911.<ref name=noosahist/>\n\nOn Saturday 8 September 1917, an Honour Roll was unveiled at the Noosa Shire Hall in Pomona. It was to honour and commemorate those from the district who had left Australia to serve in the armed forces during [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81861529 |title=The Chronicle.

In December 1980, the Shire headquarters moved to Pelican Street, [[Tewantin, Queensland|Tewantin]].

The core Councillors who were most influential in this change were elected in a group called The Resident's Team{{cn|date=April 2020}}.  They laid the foundation for many of the planning and environmental protection concepts for which Noosa is now famous{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The 1982-1985 Noosa Council was the first to introduce the idea of a development/population cap{{cn|date=April 2020}}, the concept of strategic planning, a focus on community arts, the use of design and landscape controls in development applications and they introduced drafts of many of the first development control plans for each of the Noosa townships. The business lobby supported by several local media personalities were successful in seeing this Council being largely replaced by a pro-development Council in the 1985 election{{cn|date=April 2020}}.  That pro-development Council was, in turn, largely removed by the Noosa community in the subsequent 1988 election.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n  \nFollowing the election of Noosa's first green mayor, Noel Playford who was an original member of the 1982-1985 Residents Team{{cn|date=April 2020}}, in 1988, Noosa's first formal strategic plan was gazetted, and in 1990 development was limited to four storeys. In 1993, a major Council and community complex covering {{convert|9|ha|acre|1}} opened at Wallace Park, [[Noosaville, Queensland|Noosaville]].\n\nIn 1995, the mayor Noel Playford controversially formally announced a \"population cap\" of 56,500 people for Noosa Shire based on the initial concepts developed during the 1982-1985 Council term.<ref>{{cite web |last=Winsbury |first=John |title=If the cap fits - can we wear it? |url=https://www.planning.org.au/documents/item/2187 |accessdate=25 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415113941/http://www.planning.org.au/documents/item/2187 |archivedate=15 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The population cap was the expected population under the planning scheme if all available land was developed in accordance with the planning scheme.
