Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a [[Italian Jews|Jewish Italian]] bookshop owner, who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a [[Nazi concentration camp]]. The film was partially inspired by the book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'' by [[Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec]] and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in a German labour camp during [[World War II]].\n\nThe film grossed over $230 million worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of highest-grossing non-English films|highest-grossing non-English language movies of all time]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.wonderslist.com/10-highest-grossing-non-english-movies/\n|title=Top 10 Highest Grossing Non-English Movies of All Time\n|last=John\n|first=Adriana\n|date=\n|website=Wonderslist\n|publisher=\n|access-date=January 7, 2018\n}}</ref> and received widespread acclaim (despite some criticisms of using the subject matter for comedic purposes). It won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]], nine [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]] (including [[David di Donatello for Best Film|Best Film]]), five [[Nastro d'Argento]] Awards in Italy, two [[European Film Awards]], and three [[71st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Benigni).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1939, in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], Guido Orefice is a young [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish]] man who arrives to work in the city (Arezzo, in Tuscany) where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fianc\u00e9 and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosu\u00e8, and run a bookstore.\n\nWhen [[World War II]] breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosu\u00e8 are seized on Giosu\u00e8's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a [[concentration camp]]. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages\u2014symbolic or literal\u2014to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a [[gas chamber]] shortly after their arrival. Giosu\u00e8 narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.\n\nIn the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosu\u00e8 that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosu\u00e8 is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. At one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosu\u00e8 that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosu\u00e8 is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosu\u00e8 are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian.\n\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosu\u00e8 one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosu\u00e8 emerges from the sweat-box, just as a [[United States Army|US Army]] unit led by a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosu\u00e8 is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosu\u00e8 to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosu\u00e8 soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosu\u00e8 excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosu\u00e8, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Guido Orefice\n* [[Nicoletta Braschi]] as Dora Orefice\n* [[Giorgio Cantarini]] as Giosu\u00e8 Orefice\n* [[Giustino Durano]] as Uncle Eliseo\n* [[Horst Buchholz]] as Doctor Lessing\n* [[Marisa Paredes]] as Dora's mother\n* [[Sergio Bustric]] as Ferruccio\n* [[Amerigo Fontani]] as Rodolfo\n* [[Lydia Alfonsi]] as Guicciardini\n* [[Giuliana Lojodice]] as the Headmistress\n* [[Pietro Desilva]] as Bartolomeo\n* [[Francesco Guzzo]] as Vittorino\n* [[Raffaella Lebboroni]] as Elena\n* [[Claudio Alfonsi]] as Amico Rodolfo\n* [[Gil Baroni]] as the Prefect\n* [[Ennio Consalvi]] as General Graziosi\n* [[Aaron Craig (actor)|Aaron Craig]] as the tank driver\n* [[Alfiero Falomi]] as [[Victor Emmanuel III |King of Italy]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Badia delle sante flora e lucilla, arezzo, 02.JPG|thumb|The film was shot in [[Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]], including by the [[Badia delle Sante Flora e Lucilla]].]]\nDirector [[Roberto Benigni]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Vincenzo Cerami]], was inspired by the story of [[Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec]] and his book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'', which incorporates elements of irony and [[black comedy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |title=Life Is Beautiful Nazi death camp survivor dies aged 91 |last=Squires |first=Nick |date=11 July 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323074652/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |archive-date=23 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Salmoni was an Italian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, survived and was reunited with his parents, but found his brothers were murdered.

directed by and starring [[Roberto Benigni]], who co-wrote the film with [[Vincenzo Cerami]]. Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a [[Italian Jews|Jewish Italian]] bookshop owner, who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a [[Nazi concentration camp]]. The film was partially inspired by the book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'' by [[Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec]] and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in a German labour camp during [[World War II]].\n\nThe film was a critical and financial success.

It won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]], nine [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]] (including [[David di Donatello for Best Film|Best Film]]), five [[Nastro d'Argento]] Awards in Italy, two [[European Film Awards]], and three [[71st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Benigni).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1939, in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], Guido Orefice is a young [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish]] man who arrives to work in the city (Arezzo, in Tuscany) where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fianc\u00e9 and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosu\u00e8, and run a bookstore.\n\nWhen [[World War II]] breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosu\u00e8 are seized on Giosu\u00e8's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a [[concentration camp]]. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages\u2014symbolic or literal\u2014to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a [[gas chamber]] shortly after their arrival. Giosu\u00e8 narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.\n\nIn the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosu\u00e8 that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosu\u00e8 is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. At one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosu\u00e8 that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosu\u00e8 is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosu\u00e8 are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian.\n\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosu\u00e8 one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosu\u00e8 emerges from the sweat-box, just as a [[United States Army|US Army]] unit led by a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosu\u00e8 is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosu\u00e8 to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosu\u00e8 soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosu\u00e8 excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosu\u00e8, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Guido Orefice\n* [[Nicoletta Braschi]] as Dora Orefice\n* [[Giorgio Cantarini]] as Giosu\u00e8 Orefice\n* [[Giustino Durano]] as Uncle Eliseo\n* [[Horst Buchholz]] as Doctor Lessing\n* [[Marisa Paredes]] as Dora's mother\n* [[Sergio Bustric]] as Ferruccio\n* [[Amerigo Fontani]] as Rodolfo\n* [[Lydia Alfonsi]] as Guicciardini\n* [[Giuliana Lojodice]] as the Headmistress\n* [[Pietro Desilva]] as Bartolomeo\n* [[Francesco Guzzo]] as Vittorino\n* [[Raffaella Lebboroni]] as Elena\n* [[Claudio Alfonsi]] as Amico Rodolfo\n* [[Gil Baroni]] as the Prefect\n* [[Ennio Consalvi]] as General Graziosi\n* [[Aaron Craig (actor)|Aaron Craig]] as the tank driver\n* [[Alfiero Falomi]] as [[Victor Emmanuel III |King of Italy]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Badia delle sante flora e lucilla, arezzo, 02.JPG|thumb|The film was shot in [[Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]], including by the [[Badia delle Sante Flora e Lucilla]].]]\nDirector [[Roberto Benigni]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Vincenzo Cerami]], was inspired by the story of [[Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec]] and his book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'', which incorporates elements of irony and [[black comedy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |title=Life Is Beautiful Nazi death camp survivor dies aged 91 |last=Squires |first=Nick |date=11 July 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323074652/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |archive-date=23 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Salmoni was an Italian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, survived and was reunited with his parents, but found his brothers were murdered.
