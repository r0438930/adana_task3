They board a west-bound train to [[Pomona (Amtrak station)|Pomona]], but are both immediately kicked off by the conductor, played by Pete, stating that dogs aren't allowed (side gag reveals Pluto's luggage to contain bones).  Pete then rambles off the train's destinations and forces his watch to tell him when the train is ready to leave.  When the watch does show its time for the train to go, Pete calls \"All aboard!\"\n\nMickey, at this point, decides to smuggle Pluto onboard by squeezing the dog inside his suitcase. At first, the handle breaks, making Mickey almost leave Pluto behind, but he recovers the suitcase and manages to make it aboard the caboose just as the train is leaving the platform. Later, Pluto barks, wanting to be let out.  Mickey reminds him that he will be thrown off if Pete finds out that Pluto's on the train, so he takes Pluto out and unsquashes him.  The freedom is only short lived, however, as Pete is coming through the train to collect tickets, forcing Mickey to squash Pluto back into position in the suitcase. After biting \"OK\" in Mickey's tickets, Pete sees Mickey's suitcase containing Pluto in the seat and forcefully throws it into an overhead baggage net. This causes Pluto to bark, making Pete suspicious.\n\nHe then recognizes Mickey, who tries to hide behind a large newspaper and make it look like the barking was coming from him. Realizing that Pluto has been stowed in the suitcase, Pete menacingly asks Mickey if he is alone, which Mickey states that he is alone, Pete then makes up a story about owning a little cat who'd cry when he was all alone and screams a loud \"MEOW!\" (even making his face closely resemble a real cat) at the suitcase causing Pluto to leap out barking at the \"cat\". Realizing his cover's been blown, Pluto ducks back into the suitcase, but Pete has already figured it out.  Before he can catch the pair, Mickey and Pluto run away and a chase ensues on board the train.\n\nMickey and Pluto first hide in a sleeping car where Pete mistakenly intrudes on a female passenger and gets assaulted. Pete then stumbles into another bed where Mickey and Pluto (disguised as babies) are hiding. Pete apologizes for the intrusion, but quickly finds out after covering up Pluto's tail.  Just as Mickey and Pluto think that they fooled Pete, Pete bursts in and threatens to beat them to a pulp, but sudden darkness from the train running through a tunnel allows the pair to escape, leaving Pete to beat the mattress to a pulp and experience a brief entanglement with the springs.\n\nMickey and Pluto masquerade as the conductor by hiding in Pete's own coat and hat which they'd had taken off in the tunnel. After getting false directions from Mickey with a deep voice, Pete catches on and threatens to catch them, but ends up disturbing the female passenger again.  Pete receives another beating and, unintentionally taking the passenger's hat, gets pricked by one of her needles.  Mickey disguises himself as an [[Stereotypes of Native Americans|Indian chief]] with Pluto in his [[papoose]], but Pete sees through their disguise after Pluto bites his hand.\n\nWhile Mickey and Pluto are next to an open window, Pluto is caught on a passing [[mail hook]] which whisks him outside the train. Mickey runs after him through the train, and is just able to grab Pluto as he exits the caboose. Pete throws their luggage out after them and they fall to the ground from the mail hook. Mickey then looks up at the station sign and is pleasantly surprised that they have arrived at Pomona.\n\n==Voice-over footage==\n[[File:Walt Disney and Billy Bletcher.png|thumb|left|[[Walt Disney]] (left) and [[Billy Bletcher]] recording voice-overs for ''Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip'']]\n''Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip'' is unique among Disney shorts in that film footage exists of the [[voice-over]] session, which included Walt Disney and Billy Bletcher.
