It is a large, submerged [[massif]], about 120&nbsp;km long and 80&nbsp;km wide.  Its peak lies at the depth of 690 m and it rises 2000 m above the surrounding seafloor, which is located at the depth of up to 2,700 m and is a part of the [[Herodotus Abyssal Plain]].  It is one of the largest features on the Eastern Mediterranean seafloor.\n\nIn 2010 and 2012 the [[Ocean Exploration Trust]]'s vessel [[EV Nautilus]] explored the seamount looking for shipwrecks. Three were found; two were [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] vessels from the 19th century and the third was from the 4th century BC. Such seamounts are considered to be ideal for the preservation of shipwrecks because at depths of around 600&nbsp;metres the areas are not disturbed by [[Fishing trawler|trawler]]s or by sediments coming off land.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Learn|first1=Joseph Rapp|title=Wayfarers of the ancient world|journal=New Scientist|date=9 December 2017|volume=236|issue=3155|page=12}}</ref>\n\n== Oceanography ==\nThe Cyprus eddy is a sustained mesoscale oceanic eddy with a diameter about 100 kilometers, regularly appearing above Eratosthenes Seamount.
