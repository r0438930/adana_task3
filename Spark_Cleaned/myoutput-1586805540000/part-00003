Such a [[nuclear reaction]] of type (p,\u03b3) is called ''proton capture reaction''. By adding a proton to a nucleus, the [[chemical element|element]] is changed because the chemical element is defined by the [[proton number]] of a nucleus. At the same time the ratio of protons to [[neutron]]s is changed, resulting in a proton-richer isotope of the next element. This led to the original idea for the production of p-nuclei: free protons (the nuclei of [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s are present in stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]]) should be captured on heavy nuclei (''seed nuclei'') also already present in the stellar plasma (previously produced in the [[s-process|''s''-process]] and/or [[r-process|''r''-process]]).<ref name=\"b2fh\" /><ref name=\"cameron\" />\n\nSuch proton captures on [[stable nuclide]]s (or nearly stable), however, are not very efficient in producing p-nuclei, especially the heavier ones, because the [[electric charge]] increases with each added proton, leading to an increased repulsion of the next proton to be added, according to [[Coulomb's law]]. In the context of nuclear reactions this is called a [[Coulomb barrier]]. The higher the Coulomb barrier, the more [[kinetic energy]] a proton requires to get close to a nucleus and be captured by it. The average energy of the available protons is given by the [[temperature]] of the stellar plasma. Even if this temperature could be increased arbitrarily (which is not the case in stellar environments), protons would be removed faster from a nucleus by [[photodisintegration]] than they could be captured at high temperature. A possible alternative would be to have a very large number of protons available to increase the effective number of proton captures per second without having to raise the temperature too much. Such conditions, however, are not found in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] which were supposed to be the site of the p-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />\n\nProton captures at extremely high proton densities are called [[P-nuclei#Rapid proton capture processes|rapid proton capture processes]]. They are distinct from the p-process not only by the required high proton density but also by the fact that very short-lived [[radionuclides]] are involved and the reaction path is located close to the [[proton drip line]]. Rapid proton capture processes are the [[rp-process]], the [[P-nuclei#The .CE.BDp-process|&nu;p-process]], and the [[P-nuclei#The pn-process|pn-process]].\n\n==History==\nThe term p-process was originally proposed in the famous [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]] in 1957.
