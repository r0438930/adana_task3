The orders have led to several legal challenges and criticism by human rights groups and several national medical organizations, including the [[American Medical Association]]. Legal challenges on behalf of abortion providers, many of which are represented by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[Planned Parenthood]], have successfully stopped some of the orders on a temporary basis, though bans in several states have not been challenged.\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], many non-essential medical procedures were temporarily suspended to preserve medical resources like [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE). In the context of these orders, several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] officials and anti-abortion advocates argued that [[abortion]] should be considered non-essential, leading to orders in multiple states explicitly prohibiting the procedure.\n\nSeveral medical organizations and human rights groups issued statements critical of the restrictions. The [[American Medical Association]] characterizing them as \"exploiting this moment to ban or dramatically limit women's reproductive health care.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/826369859/in-texas-oklahoma-women-turned-away-because-of-coronavirus-abortion-bans|title=In Texas, Oklahoma, Women Turned Away Because Of Coronavirus Abortion Bans|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-government-interference-reproductive-health-care|title=AMA statement on government interference in reproductive health care|website=American Medical Association|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], the [[American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology]], the [[American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists]], the American Gynecological and Obstetrical Society, the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]], the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society of Family Planning, and the [[Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine]] issued a joint statement that \"abortion should not be categorized as [a procedure that can be delayed during the pandemic].
