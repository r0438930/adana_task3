As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their [[genotype|root cause]] despite the widely varying set of medical [[phenotype|symptoms]] that are clinically visible in the [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]]. Anencephaly is one such disease, part of an [[emergence|emerging]] class of diseases called [[ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary [[cilia]] structures of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[organelle]]s present in many cellular types throughout the [[human]] body. The cilia defects adversely affect \"numerous critical developmental signaling pathways\" essential to cellular development and, thus, offer a plausible hypothesis for the often [[pleiotropic|multi-symptom]] nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. Known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney]] and [[polycystic liver disease|liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alstr\u00f6m syndrome]], [[Meckel\u2013Gruber syndrome]], and some forms of [[retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115610 |title=The Ciliopathies: An Emerging Class of Human Genetic Disorders |year=2006 |last1=Badano |first1=Jose L. |last2=Mitsuma |first2=Norimasa |last3=Beales |first3=Phil L. |last4=Katsanis |first4=Nicholas |journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics |volume=7 |pages=125\u201348 |pmid=16722803}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Image:Ultrasound Scan ND 066.jpg|thumb|right|Ultrasound image of fetus with anencephaly.]]\nAnencephaly can often be diagnosed before birth through an [[ultrasound]] examination.

This bill was a result of much debate over the definition of death and is applicable to the debate over anencephaly. A related bill, the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] (UAGA), grants individuals and, after death, their family members the right to decide whether or not to donate organs.

However, this poses both legal and ethical issues. In the United States, all states have laws that forbid the removal of organs from a donor until after the donor has died, except in the case of altruistic living donations of a kidney or liver segment.\n\nThe goal of those in support of organ donation is that it will further contribute to the pool of suitable organs for transplants while the need for lifesaving organ transplants is so great.

A related bill, the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] (UAGA), grants individuals and, after death, their family members the right to decide whether or not to donate organs.
