{"title_page": "Traffic Service Position System", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2017}}\n:''\"TSPS\" redirects here. For the school, see The Sheffield Private School.''\n\nThe '''Traffic Service Position System''' ('''TSPS''') was developed by [[Bell Labs]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] to replace traditional cord [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]]s.  The first TSPS was deployed in 1969 and used the [[Stored Program Control exchange|Stored Program Control]]-1A CPU, \"Piggyback\" [[twistor memory]] (a proprietary technology developed by [[Bell Labs]] similar to core memory) and [[IGFET|Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistor]] solid state memory devices similar to [[DRAM|dynamic random access memory]].\n\n==Features==\nThe TSPS system utilized special [[analog transmission|analog]] trunks that originated at [[Class 5 telephone switch|Class 5]] end office circuit switch systems and [[Class 4 telephone switch|Class 4]] toll access circuit switch systems that were connected to Class 3 primary toll circuit switch systems such as the 4A-ETS/PBC and [[4ESS switch]] systems.  The TSPS system did not perform switching between the originating end office switch and the toll switch for the subscriber voice path.\n\nThe TSPS system included the \"Remote Trunking Arrangement\" (RTA) feature that consolidated the trunk connection at the originating switch and provided a switched connection to a [[Switchboard operator|telephone operator]] only as required for a short duration at the beginning of a call to obtain billing information or at the end of a call in which the caller requested \"time and charges\".\n\nThe TSPS system provided a temporary switched connection to a toll operator who helped facilitate calls requiring human assistance such as person-to-person, collect, third-party-billed, and hotel billing.  The TSPS system supported up to seven \"Chief Operator Groups\" (COGs) with each COG supporting up to 31 operator consoles.  Operator consoles initially used [[nixie tube]] displays that were quickly replaced by [[light-emitting diode]] displays due to reliability issues.\n\nThe TSPS system was replaced by the Operator Service Position System (OSPS) feature package developed for the [[5ESS switch]]ing system. During the era of TSPS systems, calls to mobile and marine radiotelephone customers were initially handled by operators at a Special Operator Service Treatment cord switchboard.  Operator assisted calls to international destinations were handled by \"Code 10\" and \"Code 11\" operators generally co-located at special gateway international switching systems.\n\n==Hotel Billing Information System==\nThe TSPS system included the ''Hotel Billing Information System'' (HoBIS) special feature to provide automated billing of [[long-distance call]]s from hotel front desks so guests could be charged for calls made almost immediately prior to their departure.  Private [[Teleprinter|Teletype]] data links were provisioned to large [[hotel]]s that subscribed to this service.\n\n==Automated Coin Toll System==\nDebuted in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1977 the ''Automated Coin Toll System'' (ACTS) was an addition to TSPS which provided an automated way to perform charge advisory and toll collection of coin paid calls, reducing the need for operator involvement.  The ACTS sub-system handled the automated voice announcements, e.g. \"Please deposit five cents for the next three minutes\" (initially voiced by [[Jane Barbe]] , and later  [[Pat Fleet]]), and worked with TSPS for coin deposit (start of call) coin collection/coin return (at end of call).<ref>{{cite web |title=Automated Coin Toll System (ACTS) |url=http://www.phworld.org/payphone/acts.htm}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2012/1/16/AT&T-Archives-TSPS-Operator AT&T Archives - TSPS Operator Recruiting Film]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRRnA6YF4KU 1977 Bell System commercial ending with TSPS operator] From [[YouTube]].\n* [http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_tsps.html ATIS definition]\n* [http://www.phworld.org/payphone/acts.htm Telephone World - AT&T Automated Coin Toll System] \n* [http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-037/_5534.htm TSPS definition 47CFR part 67  Appendix]\n* {{US patent|3731000|US Patent #3,731,000 for \"Equipment for Switching Calls from Remote Trunk Groups to Distant Centralized Operator Service Center\"}}, [[Amos E.
