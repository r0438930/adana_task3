However, even alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can become contaminated if the alcohol content is not properly controlled or the sanitizer is grossly contaminated with microorganisms during manufacture. In June 2009, alcohol-free Clarcon Antimicrobial Hand Sanitizer was pulled from the US market by the FDA, which found the product contained gross contamination of extremely high levels of various bacteria, including those which can \"cause opportunistic infections of the skin and underlying tissues and could result in medical or surgical attention as well as permanent damage\".  Gross contamination of any hand sanitizer by bacteria during manufacture will result in the failure of the effectiveness of that sanitizer and possible infection of the treatment site with the contaminating organisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm164845.htm |accessdate=2009-06-15 |title=Consumers Warned Not to Use Clarcon Skin Products |date=June 15, 2009 |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614130646/https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm164845.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Automat do dezynfekcji r\u0105k w 60-tysi\u0119cznym Tomaszowie Mazowieckim, w wojew\u00f3dztwie \u0142\u00f3dzkim.jpg|Automatic hand sanitizer\nFile:COVID-19.

Hand-rubs in the hospital environment have two applications: hygienic hand rubbing and surgical hand disinfection. Alcohol based hand rubs provide a better skin tolerance as compared to antiseptic soap.<ref name=\"Boyce 2000 442\"/>\nHand rubs also prove to have more effective microbiological properties as compared to antiseptic soaps.\n\nThe same ingredients used in over-the-counter hand-rubs are also used in hospital hand-rubs: alcohols such [[ethanol]] and [[isopropanol]], sometimes combined with [[quaternary ammonium cations]] (quats) such as [[benzalkonium chloride]].  Quats are added at levels up to 200 parts per million to increase antimicrobial effectiveness. Although allergy to alcohol-only rubs is rare, fragrances, preservatives and quats can cause contact allergies.<ref>{{ cite journal\n| author= de Groot AC\n| title = Contact allergy to cosmetics: causative ingredients\n| journal = Contact Dermatitis\n| volume = 17\n| year = 1987\n| pmid=3652687\n| issue=1\n| pages=26\u201334\n| doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.1987.tb02640.x}}</ref>  These other ingredients do not evaporate like alcohol and accumulate leaving a \"sticky\" residue until they are removed with soap and water.\n\nThe most common brands of alcohol hand rubs include Aniosgel, Avant, Sterillium, Desderman and Allsept S. All hospital hand rubs must conform to certain regulations like EN 12054 for hygienic treatment and surgical disinfection by hand-rubbing. Products with a claim of \"99.99% reduction\" or 4-[[log reduction]] are ineffective in hospital environment, since the reduction must be more than \"99.99%\".<ref name=\"cvvs\"/>\n\nThe hand sanitizer dosing systems for hospitals are designed to deliver a measured amount of the product for staff.  They are dosing pumps screwed onto a bottle or are specially designed dispensers with refill bottles. Dispensers for surgical hand disinfection are usually equipped with elbow controlled mechanism or infrared sensors to avoid any contact with the pump.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:CVS Hand Sanitizer Notice.jpg|thumb|A notice about hand sanitizer coronavirus [[panic buying|shortages]] at a [[CVS Pharmacy]] on March 17, 2020]]\nIn 2010 the [[World Health Organization]] produced a guide for manufacturing hand sanitizer, which received renewed interest because of shortages of hand sanitizer in the wake of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=WHO-LocalProduction />  Dozens of liquor and perfume manufactures switched their manufacturing facilities from their normal product to hand sanitizer.<ref name=\"forbes.com\">[https://www.forbes.com/sites/fredminnick/2020/03/18/white-house-works-with-distillers-to-increase-hand-sanitizer-production/ \"White House Works With Distillers to Increase Hand Sanitizer Production\"], Forbes, March 18, 2020</ref> In order to keep up with the demand, local [[distilleries]] started using their alcohol to make hand sanitizer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kaur |first1=Harmeet |title=Distilleries are making hand sanitizer with their in-house alcohol and giving it out for free to combat coronavirus |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/us/distilleries-hand-sanitizer-coronavirus-trnd/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=21 March 2020}}</ref> Distilleries producing hand sanitizer originally existed in a legal grey area in the United States, until the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] declared that distilleries could produce their sanitizer without authorization.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Levenson |first1=Michael |title=Distilleries Race to Make Hand Sanitizer Amid Coronavirus Pandemic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/distilleries-virus-hand-sanitizer.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau |title=Production of Hand Sanitizer by Distilled Spirits Permittees |url=https://www.ttb.gov/images/newsletters/archives/2020/ttb-newsletter03172020sp.html |website=The TTB Newsletter |publisher=US Department of the Treasury |accessdate=21 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere are cautions against making your own hand sanitizer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mitroff |first1=Sarah |title=No, you shouldn't make your own hand sanitizer |url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/why-you-shouldnt-make-your-own-hand-sanitizer |website=CNET |accessdate=25 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Some widely-circulated home recipes are [[List of unproven methods against COVID-19#Hand cleaning|ineffective or even poisonous]].\n\n===Composition===\nThe [[World Health Organization]] has published a guide to producing large quantities of hand sanitizer from chemicals available in developing countries, where commercial hand sanitizer may not be available:<ref name=WHO-LocalProduction>{{cite web |title=Guide to Local Production: WHO-recommended Handrub Formulations |url=https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=April 2010}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
