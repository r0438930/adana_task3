It ranks Britain's fastest-growing privately-held companies by sales growth (% per annum) over the last three years. The list is produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research company, and has been sponsored by the [[Virgin Group]] since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|Crep Protect\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.

It ranks Britain's fastest-growing privately-held companies by sales growth (% per annum) over the last three years. The list is produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research company, and has been sponsored by the [[Virgin Group]] since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|Crep Protect\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.
