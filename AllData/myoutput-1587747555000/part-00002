The series features new production designs and the characters (aside from the host) are animated digitally, though the visual style remains similar to the style used in the original series.\n\nLike the original show, ''Blue's Clues & You!'' depended upon built-in silences designed to encourage audience participation and what ''The New York Times'' called \"direct address inviting preschoolers to play along with games and solve mini-mysteries\".<ref name=\"onstad\"/> The show's producers recognized that its return was due to 1990s nostalgia, and that although young children had more access to technology and were more visual than preschoolers in the 1990s, they still had the same developmental and emotional needs to \"slow down\".<ref name=\"onstad\"/>\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{See also|List of Blue's Clues characters}}\n=== Main ===\n* Blue (voiced by [[Traci Paige Johnson]]) \u2013 A blue puppy who leaves pawprints on objects as clues to what she wants to say.\n* Josh (played by Joshua Dela Cruz) \u2013 The host of the new series.

The series features new production designs and the characters (aside from the host) are animated digitally, though the visual style remains similar to the style used in the original series.\n\nLike the original show, ''Blue's Clues & You!'' depended upon built-in silences designed to encourage audience participation and what ''The New York Times'' called \"direct address inviting preschoolers to play along with games and solve mini-mysteries\".<ref name=\"onstad\"/> The show's producers recognized that its return was due to 1990s nostalgia, and that although young children had more access to technology and were more visual than preschoolers in the 1990s, they still had the same developmental and emotional needs to \"slow down\".<ref name=\"onstad\"/>\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{See also|List of Blue's Clues characters}}\n=== Main ===\n* Blue (voiced by [[Traci Paige Johnson]]) \u2013 A blue puppy who leaves pawprints on objects as clues to what she wants to say.\n* Josh (played by Joshua Dela Cruz) \u2013 The host of the new series.
