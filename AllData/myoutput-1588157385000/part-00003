Waterways on the west side of the peak flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the [[Kern River]]. The Kern River terminates at [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] in the [[Tulare Lake|Tulare Basin]], the southern part of the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. During very wet years, water overflows from the Tulare Basin into the [[San Joaquin River]] which flows to the Pacific Ocean. From the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, which joins the [[Owens River]], which in turn terminates at [[Owens Lake]], an endorheic lake of the [[Great Basin]].\n\n=== Elevation measurements ===\nThe estimated elevation of the summit of Mount Whitney has changed over the years. The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and, more importantly, the vertical coordinate system has changed. The peak was commonly said to be at {{convert|14494|ft|abbr=on}} and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit.  An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads \"elevation 14,496.811 feet\" but this was estimated using the older [[geodetic system|vertical datum]] ([[Sea Level Datum of 1929|NGVD29]]) from 1929. Since then the shape of the [[Earth]] (the [[geoid]]) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 ([[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]]) the benchmark is now estimated to be at {{convert|14505|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"ngs\"/><ref name=ngs_hcm/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[Image:Sierra nevada schematic.svg|thumb|left|Schematic of Sierra Nevada [[fault block]]]]\nThe eastern slope of Whitney is far steeper than its western slope because the entire Sierra Nevada is the result of a [[fault block]] that is analogous to a cellar door: the door is hinged on the west and is slowly rising on the east.<ref name=usfs_sn/>\n\nThe rise is caused by a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] system that runs along the eastern base of the Sierra, below Mount Whitney.

Waterways on the west side of the peak flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the [[Kern River]]. The Kern River terminates at [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] in the [[Tulare Lake|Tulare Basin]], the southern part of the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. During very wet years, water overflows from the Tulare Basin into the [[San Joaquin River]] which flows to the Pacific Ocean. From the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, which joins the [[Owens River]], which in turn terminates at [[Owens Lake]], an endorheic lake of the [[Great Basin]].\n\n=== Elevation measurements ===\nThe estimated elevation of the summit of Mount Whitney has changed over the years. The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and, more importantly, the vertical coordinate system has changed. The peak was commonly said to be at {{convert|14494|ft|abbr=on}} and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit.  An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads \"elevation 14,496.811 feet\" but this was estimated using the older [[geodetic system|vertical datum]] ([[Sea Level Datum of 1929|NGVD29]]) from 1929. Since then the shape of the [[Earth]] (the [[geoid]]) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 ([[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]]) the benchmark is now estimated to be at {{convert|14505|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"ngs\"/><ref name=ngs_hcm/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[Image:Sierra nevada schematic.svg|thumb|left|Schematic of Sierra Nevada [[fault block]]]]\nThe eastern slope of Whitney is far steeper than its western slope because the entire Sierra Nevada is the result of a [[fault block]] that is analogous to a cellar door: the door is hinged on the west and is slowly rising on the east.<ref name=usfs_sn/>\n\nThe rise is caused by a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] system that runs along the eastern base of the Sierra, below Mount Whitney. Thus, the [[granite]] that forms Mount Whitney is the same as the granite that forms the [[Alabama Hills]], thousands of feet lower down.<ref name=\"Schoenherr\"/> The raising of Whitney (and the downdrop of the Owens Valley) is due to the same geological forces that cause the [[Basin and Range Province]]: the crust of much of the intermontane west is slowly being stretched.<ref name=\"nps\">\n  {{cite web\n  | url = http://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/the-great-basin.htm\n  | title = The Great Basin|work=Great Basin National Park\n  | publisher = [[National Park Service|US National Park Service]]\n  | accessdate = 2008-04-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe granite that forms Mount Whitney is part of the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]].<ref name=\"mcphee\">{{cite book|last1=McPhee|first1=John|title=Annals of a Former World|date=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0374708460|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GS81F0RNxesC&pg=PT503&dq=batholith.+In+Cretaceous+subduction+Whitney++granite.#v=onepage&q=batholith.%20In%20Cretaceous%20subduction%20Whitney%20%20granite.&f=false | accessdate = 2016-05-08 }}</ref> In [[Cretaceous]] time, masses of molten rock that originated from [[subduction]] rose underneath what is now Whitney and solidified underground to form large expanses of granite.<ref name=\"mcphee\"/> In the last 2 to 10 million years, the Sierra was pushed up which enabled glacial and river erosion to strip the upper layers of rock to reveal the resistant granite that makes up Mount Whitney today.<ref name=\"stephen\">{{cite book|last1=Whitney|first1=Stephen|title=A Sierra Club naturalist's guide to the Sierra Nevada|date=1979|publisher=Sierra Club Books|isbn=0871562154|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WuATAQAAIAAJ&q=2+to+10+million+years+Whitney&dq=2+to+10+million+years+Whitney|accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe summit of Mount Whitney has an alpine tundra climate (''ET'') under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].
