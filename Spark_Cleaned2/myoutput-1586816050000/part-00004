The current party originated in 2009 with the merger of the [[Lakas\u2013CMD (1991)|original Lakas\u2013CMD]] party with the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI); it was known as '''Lakas\u2013Kampi\u2013CMD''' until 2012. The party produced one president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who was president when the two parties merged in 2009.\n\nWith Arroyo unable to run for a new term due to term limits, the party lost the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 presidential election]] with [[Gilberto Teodoro]] as its presidential nominee. The party retained its two [[Philippine Senate|senators]], both incumbents, in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|Senate election]] and became a part of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]-led majority coalition; in the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives election]], it won 47% of the seats contested in the district election, but most of its members were split into three groups, with many defecting to the Liberal Party, some formed the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], and the remaining members were split into the majority and minority blocs, with its members heading the minority. On May 11, 2012, the party decided to revert to its original name and drop Arroyo's KAMPI from the coalition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514081052/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |archivedate=2012-05-14 }} The Manila Times: Lakas drops GMA's Kampi from coalition</ref> Lakas\u2013CMD is currently one of the parties in opposition. In 2013, Sen. [[Bong Revilla]] became chairman of Lakas. He was supposed to be the standard bearer of the party in the [[2016 Philippine presidential election|2016 presidential election]] prior to his detention at the [[Philippine National Police|PNP]] custodial center at [[Camp Crame]] due to his alleged involvement in the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam|pork barrel scam]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/350361/bong-revilla-a-strong-contender-in-2016-lakas-cmd|title=Bong Revilla a strong contender in 2016 \u2013 Lakas-CMD|first=Karen|last=Boncocan|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=31 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Bong Revilla off to surrender to anti-graft court|url = http://www.rappler.com/nation/61091-bong-revilla-heads-for-sandiganbayan-to-submit-self-to-court|website = Rappler|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}</ref>\n\n==Ideology==\nLakas\u2013CMD has always focused on economic growth and development, stronger ties with the [[United States]], creation of jobs, and strong cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present [[presidential system]] to a parliamentary form of government through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] separatists and [[communism|communist]] rebels. The party democracy is distinct in its ecumenical inclusion of Muslim leaders in its political alliance.<ref name= \"Centre-right\" >{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCrTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA195&|title=Southeast Asia In The New International Era|newspaper=|date=2016|author1=|author2=|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Lakas\u2013CMD (1991)|Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino}}\n\n===Ramos administration===\n[[Image:Ramos Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|President Fidel V. Ramos, co-founder of Lakas NUCD.]]\nLakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the [[1992 Philippine general election|1992 elections]] as retired General, then-Defense Secretary, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] and former [[Cebu]] Governor [[Emilio Mario Osme\u00f1a|Emilio Mario \"Lito\" R. Osme\u00f1a]] were running for president and vice-president respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidency under that said banner to Speaker [[Ramon Mitra]].\n\nThe party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's Partido Lakas ng Tao (People Power Party) and the National Union of Christian Democrats of [[Raul Manglapus]].  As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-[[Lakas\u2013CMD (1991)|National Union of Christian Democrats]], with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to \"Lakas\" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.\n\nIn 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the [[1995 Philippine general election|1995 legislative elections]].  This coalition, dubbed the \"[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]\", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] of [[Pangasinan]] after a close nominal fight with then Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]] as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  By this time, it was joined by the Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines of former ambassador to Egypt and Oman [[Sanchez Ali|Sanchez A. Ali]] to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines.\n\nSecretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed [[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma]] (Democratic Reform Party) for the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  Lakas also nominated then-Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Pampanga]] as its candidate as [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.\n\n===Arroyo administration===\nIn the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 elections]], the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas\u2013CMD.  However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as \"Lakas ng [[EDSA I|EDSA]]\" which means \"The Strength of EDSA\" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means \"The Strength of the People\" or \"People Power.\"  This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition.  President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President [[Joseph Estrada]], was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] and Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]].<ref name= \"Centre-right\" />\n\nAt the onset of 2006, Lakas\u2013CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].  Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or \"no-el\") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the \"no-el\" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.\n\nThere are no official results available of the 2007 [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] released by the party but according to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], the party holds 79 out of 235 seats.\n\nOn January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas\u2013CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010\u2014spokesman  in 2010. Except for Para\u00f1aque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. But Lambino named incumbent Senators [[Ramon Revilla, Jr.]] and [[Lito Lapid]], former senator [[Ralph Recto]] and former Congressman [[Prospero Pichay]] as among those considered.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman  Inquirer.net, Lakas lists down 30 senatorial bets for 2010--spokesman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910230132/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman |date=2012-09-10 }}</ref>\n\nFormer Speaker of the House [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] (Pangasinan -4th District) resigned his post as president of Lakas\u2013CMD on March 10, 2008; he rejected the proposition of former president [[Fidel Ramos]] to give him the title Chairman-emeritus. The current Speaker of the House [[Prospero Nograles]] (Davao -1st District) was sworn it as the new president of Lakas\u2013CMD party and former Speaker of the house [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] as vice president for Metro Manila affairs on the same day.\n\n[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on June 18, 2008, confirmed the historical [[merger]] of the [[Lakas-CMD (1991)|Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats]] (Lakas\u2013CMD) and the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) parties. Both parties adopted the \"equity of the incumbent\" principle, as the merger would account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Mrs. Arroyo's prediction of  2010 elections victory.

The party produced one president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who was president when the two parties merged in 2009.\n\nWith Arroyo unable to run for a new term due to term limits, the party lost the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 presidential election]] with [[Gilberto Teodoro]] as its presidential nominee. The party retained its two [[Philippine Senate|senators]], both incumbents, in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|Senate election]] and became a part of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]-led majority coalition; in the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives election]], it won 47% of the seats contested in the district election, but most of its members were split into three groups, with many defecting to the Liberal Party, some formed the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], and the remaining members were split into the majority and minority blocs, with its members heading the minority.

Ramos, co-founder of Lakas NUCD.]]\nLakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the [[1992 Philippine general election|1992 elections]] as retired General, then-Defense Secretary, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] and former [[Cebu]] Governor [[Emilio Mario Osme\u00f1a|Emilio Mario \"Lito\" R. Osme\u00f1a]] were running for president and vice-president respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidency under that said banner to Speaker [[Ramon Mitra]].\n\nThe party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's Partido Lakas ng Tao (People Power Party) and the National Union of Christian Democrats of [[Raul Manglapus]].  As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-[[Lakas\u2013CMD (1991)|National Union of Christian Democrats]], with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to \"Lakas\" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.\n\nIn 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the [[1995 Philippine general election|1995 legislative elections]].  This coalition, dubbed the \"[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]\", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] of [[Pangasinan]] after a close nominal fight with then Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]] as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  By this time, it was joined by the Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines of former ambassador to Egypt and Oman [[Sanchez Ali|Sanchez A. Ali]] to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines.\n\nSecretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed [[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma]] (Democratic Reform Party) for the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  Lakas also nominated then-Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Pampanga]] as its candidate as [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.\n\n===Arroyo administration===\nIn the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 elections]], the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas\u2013CMD.  However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as \"Lakas ng [[EDSA I|EDSA]]\" which means \"The Strength of EDSA\" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means \"The Strength of the People\" or \"People Power.\"  This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition.  President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President [[Joseph Estrada]], was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] and Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]].<ref name= \"Centre-right\" />\n\nAt the onset of 2006, Lakas\u2013CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].  Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or \"no-el\") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the \"no-el\" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.\n\nThere are no official results available of the 2007 [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] released by the party but according to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], the party holds 79 out of 235 seats.\n\nOn January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas\u2013CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010\u2014spokesman  in 2010. Except for Para\u00f1aque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified.
