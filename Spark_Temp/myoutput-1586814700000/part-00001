She was introduced as one of the new [[player character]]s in the [[fighting game]] ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' in 1993. Since then, Kitana appeared in a majority of ''Mortal Kombat'' series' video games and its other media, including the films ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', and the series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'', and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'', becoming one of the most popular and recognizable characters of the franchise.\n\nOne of the lead characters of the ''Mortal Kombat'' saga, Kitana is the princess of Outworld and the adopted daughter of the emperor, [[Shao Khan]]. She has a \u201ctwin\u201d sister [[Mileena]] and personal bodyguard and best friend [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]] always at her side. Through the course of events in the series, she learns that she is actually the daughter of Queen [[Sindel]] and King Jerrod, the rulers of Edenia, a realm that was conquered and destroyed by Shao Khan. She discovers that Mileena is not actually her sister, but a clone created by the emperor\u2019s sorcerer [[Shang Tsung]] intended to watch over and spy on her. Kitana rebels and sides with the Earthrealm warriors to fight against Shao Khan and ultimately free her realm from being a part of Outworld.\n\nKitana has received positive critical reception for her role in the franchise, evolving from one of the three female ninja [[palette swap]]s to one of the main protagonists of the series.\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\nKitana first appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993) as a member of the Edenian race in the fictional other dimension called Outworld.

Shinnok's forces are eventually defeated by the joint efforts of Kitana and her allies. With Edenia freed once again, Kitana proposes to Liu Kang, offering him the chance to rule Edenia at her side as King and Queen, but he reluctantly rejects her offer, seeing his true duty as champion of Earth. After Shinnok's defeat, Kitana captures Mileena but learns that Shao Kahn has survived his defeat in Earthrealm and is regaining power. Knowing that Kahn would attempt to reclaim Edenia once he was strong enough, she forges an alliance with [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]], prince of the Outworld race Shokan, against Kahn's forces.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]] (2002)'', Kitana, leading a preemptive strike against Shao Kahn's forces,<ref>''Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance'' GameCube manual, page 22.</ref> learns that he has been slain by unknown assassins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mortalkombatwarehouse.com/mkda/kitana/ |title=Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance: Kitana |publisher=Mortal Kombat Warehouse |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref> Thinking her fight is at an end, she begins the journey back to Edenia, hoping to finally live in peace. However, on the way she encounters Kung Lao, who tells her of the plans of the Deadly Alliance of Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, who are responsible for Liu Kang and Shao Kahn's demise and are attempting to revive the undead army of the legendary Onaga the Dragon King. Despite Kitana's grief, she rejoins the Earthrealm warriors and leads them into battle. During the assault on Shang Tsung's palace, she faces Quan Chi one-on-one but despite her improved fighting skills, gained from training with [[Bo' Rai Cho]], Kitana is outmatched and killed alongside her allies.

Sindel is freed from her own dungeon by Jade, and together they flee to Outworld where they attempt to find a way to defeat Onaga and free Kitana from his influence.

Weary of constant battle, Kitana is disheartened, but Blaze assures her that the wars will soon be over. Following this warning, Kitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' (2006), accompanied by Liu Kang's spirit in order to keep him whole until there was a way to reunite him with his body. They later meet with [[Nightwolf]], who offers to relieve Kitana of her burden to take Liu Kang's soul into himself, allowing her to fight against the coming evil. Kitana ultimately perishes with the rest of her allies during the battle.\n\nIn the uncanonical crossover game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'' (2008), Kitana is transported to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where she encounters her counterpart from the [[DC Universe]], [[Wonder Woman]]. Due to the \"kombat rage\", Kitana hallucinates, believing Wonder Woman to be an assassin sent from Outworld and challenged her.

Kitana battles Liu Kang in an attempt to ensure that he will not reach the final stages of the first tournament, but is defeated; expecting to die, she is surprised by his decision to spare her. Later, during the second tournament, Kitana is approached by Raiden, who informs her that her supposed past as Shao Kahn's daughter is a lie. Plagued bu doubts, she infiltrates Shang Tsung's flesh pits and discovers the newly-created Mileena. Before Kahn, she accuses Shang Tsung of attempting to replace her, and is shocked to learn that the Emperor himself ordered Mileena's creation. He then imprisons Kitana in the palace, prior to execution, and commands his \"true daughter\" to be brought to him. Kitana is soon freed by Liu Kang, and she and Jade escape to Earthrealm to join their new allies against the forces of Outworld. They assist in the battle for Earthrealm, but are killed alongside several others by Kitana's corrupted mother, Sindel. In the end, she is shown to be one of the warriors that are resurrected by Quan Chi in the Netherrealm to battle Raiden.\n\nIn both timelines, Kitana is killed and becomes some form of a revenant - one timeline she serves Onaga and is freed by the spirit of Liu Kang, while in the other timeline she serves Quan Chi until Raiden dethrones Shinnok, and Quan Chi is killed by Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion), leaving the Netherealm to be ruled by both her and the revenant Liu Kang.\n\nKitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cheatcc.com/395954|title=New Mortal Kombat X Trailer Shows Off Kitana - Cheat Code Central|publisher=News.cheatcc.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> In the story mode she is one of Quan Chi's revenants. She fights [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]] and [[Cassie Cage]] in the game's story mode, and after Quan Chi's death and Shinnok's defeat, she and fellow revenant Liu Kang become the new rulers of the Netherrealm.\n\nKitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' (2019), as both her revenant and her still-living past self. Immediately after Kung Lao defeated Quan Chi and Shang Tsung in the second tournament, Kronika's time anomaly brought Kitana and most of her allies and enemies into the future. She and Jade remain in Outworld with Kotal Kahn to find and defeat the time-displaced Shao Kahn, while Raiden, Kung Lao and Liu Kang return to Earthrealm to learn more about their future selves, as well as the events that transpired in this timeline. To aid Kotal, Kitana attempts to forge an alliance with Sheeva and her Shokan army, but Sheeva will not commit unless the Tarkatans also join. After learning a news from Kung Lao and Liu Kang of Jade and Kotal\u2019s capture by Shao Kahn, Kitana and her Shaolin allied rescue Jade, and at the same time make peace with the time-displaced Baraka and his Tarkatans, who join her ranks. Later, Kitana and her new army rescue Kotal from being executed, with the princess defeating and blinded Shao Kahn personally, rendered the tyrant powerless without his sight. Kotal, now crippled from his battle with Shao Kahn, steps down as the Kahn of Outworld, appoints Kitana as a new worthy Kahn, due to her greater charisma for uniting all of Outworld's denizens with respect than Kotal ever was. After Liu Kang is kidnapped by Kronika, Kitana and her Outworld army aid Earthrealm's allied force of Special Forces and Shaolin against Kronika's army, until Raiden merges with both iterations of Liu Kang into Fire God Liu Kang. As the rest of her allies fight off Kronika's remaining army, Kitana and Kung Lao manage to reach Kronika's Time Keep with Liu Kang. However, Kitana and her allies are affected by Kronika's time-reverse, leaving Liu Kang to fight Kronika and Cetrion alone. In one of the game's endings, the true ending, Kitana becomes Liu Kang's partner to forge a new timeline. Before reshaping the universe with Liu Kang, Kitana tells him that whatever they do, evil will rise someday, and that mortals will still make choices they cannot foresee. Liu Kang replies that each realm must choose its own destiny, and that whatever happens, they will face those events together.\n\n====Design history and derived characters====\n[[File:Kitana Tobias.jpg|thumb|left|A comparison of [[John Tobias]]' sketch of the unused character \"Kitsune\" in then original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992) and his concept art for Kitana in ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'']]\n\nIn 2009, Kitana's origins were revealed by her creator, [[John Tobias]], who disclosed that she started out as an unplayable [[herald]]-type character called \"Kitsune\" during the early development of the original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' game in 1991; his inspiration at the time was the character of Princess Mariko from [[Jordan Mechner]]'s 1984 video game ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]''.{{#tag:ref|Jordan Mechner commented: \"Ha thanks, that's awesome!

Sean Catherine Derek's Writer Guide document for the show, as well as the official character guide,<ref>http://wskel.com/MK/mk_dotr_1996/show_guide/kombatants/booklet.pdf</ref> describe Kitana as an \"exotic\", \"gorgeous and outrageously sexy\" woman, who is \"extremely mysterious\" as she \"often speaks in mystical riddles.\" The guides also note \"a strong bond and major heat\" between her and Liu Kang, and that \"though she is incredibly feminine, Kitana is a fierce warrior.\" In the episode \"Skin Deep\", [[Rain (Mortal Kombat)|Rain]] is introduced as her former love interest turned enemy, though neither have ever shared any relationship in the series canon other than their Edenian heritage. In the episode \"Swords of Ilkan\", Kitana defeats her former ally named Zara, an original character. The episode \"Abandoned\" features a ninja girl named Ruby, a friend of Kitana (a reworking of Jade). The final episode \"Overthrown\" involves Kitana leading an unsuccessful rebellion against Shao Kahn's Outworld rule.\n\nKitana is a recurring character in the 1998 live-action television series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]]'', played by [[Audie England]] in two episodes (\"Vengeance\" and \"Shadow of a Doubt\") and once by Dara Tomanovich (\"The Essence\"), with Christine Rodriguez serving as their stunt double.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mortalkombat.com/film-conquestcredits.shtml|title=Full Cast and Crew for \"Mortal Kombat: Conquest\" (1998)|author=Manna Studio|date=2010-12-20|publisher=Web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220232155/http://mortalkombat.com/film-conquestcredits.shtml|archivedate=2010-12-20|accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> In this series, she is fully aware of her Edenian past and the deaths of her parents at Kahn's hands, clandestinely working with [[Kung Lao]] to prevent the Emperor from conquering realms while at the same time feigning her allegiance to him. Her outfit and weapon are resembling these she has in the films, but she uses her native Edenian fighting style which she had mastered already before Shao Kahn's invasion and which was supplemented with various moves that she learnt from prisoners of her stepfather. The ''Konquest'' version of Mileena is neither her clone nor a sister but just someone who impersonates her to seduce and assassinate Kung Lao, and Rain appears as Kitana's former best friend. In the series finale, which ended in a cliffhanger due to the show's abrupt cancellation after two seasons, Kitana appears to die after she is reluctantly ordered by Shao Kahn to be killed for plotting against him. She is promptly attacked by Shadow Priests and one of them uses Kitana's own fan against her.\n\nKitana was featured in a two-part episode in the 2011 prequel live-action webisode series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]''.<ref>[http://kotaku.com/5734272/that-incredible-mortal-kombat-trailer-is-now-a-series \"That Incredible Mortal Kombat Trailer Is Now A Series\"], Kotaku, January 14, 2011.</ref> Kitana was played by martial artist and stuntwoman [[Samantha Jo]] (credited as Sam Tjhia) in her acting debut.<ref>Ian Fisher, [http://www.shogungamer.com/news/find-out-whos-playing-princess-kitana-mortal-kombat-rebirth \"Sam Tjhia Will Play Princess Kitana in Mortal Kombat: Rebirth\"], Shogun Gamer, 03/22/2011.</ref> Jo, a self-professed Kitana fan since her childhood,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svj3RBo7RnQ |title=Samantha Jo Gets Her Game On As Kitana In Mortal Kombat Legacy 2 - Gamerhubtv |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2013-07-20 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref> said that while preparing for the role she had did research \"to get on the same page\" with fans to see how they perceive Kitana.

In a notable difference, her mother Sindel uses a ritual so her soul fuses with Kitana's in hopes to avoid Shao Kahn's corruption before committing suicide. Kitana appears both masked (only in the animated scenes) and unmasked, and bests Mileena in a fierce sparring match. When the young sisters are sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate the man who is really King Jerrod, Kitana's biological father who is killed by Mileena, Kitana eventually learns the truth after her past and decides to turn against Shao Kahn in the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament.

She was introduced as one of the new [[player character]]s in the [[fighting game]] ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' in 1993. Since then, Kitana appeared in a majority of ''Mortal Kombat'' series' video games and its other media, including the films ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', and the series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'', and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'', becoming one of the most popular and recognizable characters of the franchise.\n\nOne of the lead characters of the ''Mortal Kombat'' saga, Kitana is the princess of Outworld and the adopted daughter of the emperor, [[Shao Khan]]. She has a \u201ctwin\u201d sister [[Mileena]] and personal bodyguard and best friend [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]] always at her side. Through the course of events in the series, she learns that she is actually the daughter of Queen [[Sindel]] and King Jerrod, the rulers of Edenia, a realm that was conquered and destroyed by Shao Khan.

Later, during the second tournament, Kitana is approached by Raiden, who informs her that her supposed past as Shao Kahn's daughter is a lie. Plagued bu doubts, she infiltrates Shang Tsung's flesh pits and discovers the newly-created Mileena. Before Kahn, she accuses Shang Tsung of attempting to replace her, and is shocked to learn that the Emperor himself ordered Mileena's creation.

Immediately after Kung Lao defeated Quan Chi and Shang Tsung in the second tournament, Kronika's time anomaly brought Kitana and most of her allies and enemies into the future. She and Jade remain in Outworld with Kotal Kahn to find and defeat the time-displaced Shao Kahn, while Raiden, Kung Lao and Liu Kang return to Earthrealm to learn more about their future selves, as well as the events that transpired in this timeline. To aid Kotal, Kitana attempts to forge an alliance with Sheeva and her Shokan army, but Sheeva will not commit unless the Tarkatans also join. After learning a news from Kung Lao and Liu Kang of Jade and Kotal\u2019s capture by Shao Kahn, Kitana and her Shaolin allied rescue Jade, and at the same time make peace with the time-displaced Baraka and his Tarkatans, who join her ranks. Later, Kitana and her new army rescue Kotal from being executed, with the princess defeating and blinded Shao Kahn personally, rendered the tyrant powerless without his sight. Kotal, now crippled from his battle with Shao Kahn, steps down as the Kahn of Outworld, appoints Kitana as a new worthy Kahn, due to her greater charisma for uniting all of Outworld's denizens with respect than Kotal ever was. After Liu Kang is kidnapped by Kronika, Kitana and her Outworld army aid Earthrealm's allied force of Special Forces and Shaolin against Kronika's army, until Raiden merges with both iterations of Liu Kang into Fire God Liu Kang. As the rest of her allies fight off Kronika's remaining army, Kitana and Kung Lao manage to reach Kronika's Time Keep with Liu Kang. However, Kitana and her allies are affected by Kronika's time-reverse, leaving Liu Kang to fight Kronika and Cetrion alone. In one of the game's endings, the true ending, Kitana becomes Liu Kang's partner to forge a new timeline. Before reshaping the universe with Liu Kang, Kitana tells him that whatever they do, evil will rise someday, and that mortals will still make choices they cannot foresee. Liu Kang replies that each realm must choose its own destiny, and that whatever happens, they will face those events together.\n\n====Design history and derived characters====\n[[File:Kitana Tobias.jpg|thumb|left|A comparison of [[John Tobias]]' sketch of the unused character \"Kitsune\" in then original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992) and his concept art for Kitana in ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'']]\n\nIn 2009, Kitana's origins were revealed by her creator, [[John Tobias]], who disclosed that she started out as an unplayable [[herald]]-type character called \"Kitsune\" during the early development of the original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' game in 1991; his inspiration at the time was the character of Princess Mariko from [[Jordan Mechner]]'s 1984 video game ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]''.{{#tag:ref|Jordan Mechner commented: \"Ha thanks, that's awesome!
