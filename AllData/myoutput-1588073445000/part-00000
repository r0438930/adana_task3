These resources are held in common, not owned privately. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|journal=International Journal of the Commons|date=17 March 2017|volume=11|issue=1|page=144|doi=10.18352/ijc.673|doi-access=free}}</ref>\nCommons can be also defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates .<ref>Classical theory based on Elinor Ostrom's book Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action.

As Frank van Laerhoven and Elinor Ostrom have stated; \"Prior to the publication of Hardin's article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', '[[common pool resource]]s', or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.18352/ijc.76| title=Traditions and Trends in the Study of the Commons| year=2007| last1=Laerhoven| first1=Frank Van| last2=Ostrom| first2=Elinor| journal=International Journal of the Commons| volume=1| pages=3}}</ref>\n\nSome texts make a distinction in [[usage]] between [[common ownership]] of the commons and [[collective ownership]] among a group of colleagues, such as in a producers' cooperative. The precision of this distinction is not always maintained.\n\nThe use of \"commons\" for natural resources has its roots in European intellectual history, where it referred to shared agricultural fields, grazing lands and forests that were, over a period of several hundred years, enclosed, claimed as private property for private use. In European political texts, the common wealth was the totality of the material riches of the world, such as the air, the water, the soil and the seed, all nature's bounty regarded as the inheritance of humanity as a whole, to be shared together. In this context, one may go back further, to the Roman legal category ''res communis'', applied to things common to all to be used and enjoyed by everyone, as opposed to ''res publica'', applied to public property managed by the government.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|journal=International Journal of the Commons|volume=11|pages=144|date=March 17, 2017|doi=10.18352/ijc.673|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Types of commons==\n\n=== Environmental resource ===\n\nThe examples below illustrate types of environmental commons.\n\n==== European land use ====\n\n{{main|Common land}}\n\nOriginally in [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval England]] the common was an integral part of the [[manor]], and was thus legally part of the [[estate in land]] owned by the [[lord of the manor]], but over which certain classes of manorial tenants and others held certain rights. By extension, the term \"commons\" has come to be applied to other resources which a community has rights or access to. The older texts use the word \"common\" to denote any such right, but more modern usage is to refer to particular rights of common, and to reserve the name \"common\" for the land over which the rights are exercised. A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a ''commoner''.<ref name=\"Anon\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commoner |title=Commoner |last=Anon |publisher=Farlex Inc |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn middle Europe, commons (relatively [[small-scale agriculture]] in, especially, southern Germany, Austria, and the alpine countries) were kept, in some parts, till the present.<ref name=\"Rad\" /> Some studies have compared the German and English dealings with the commons between late medieval times and the agrarian reforms of the 18th and 19th centuries.

In twenty years, locals have noticed a visible increase in the number of trees.

The focus here was on the ready availability of digital forms of knowledge and associated possibilities to store, access and share it as a common. The connection between knowledge and commons may be made through identifying typical problems associated with natural resource commons, such as congestion, overharvesting, pollution and inequities, which also apply to knowledge. Then, effective alternatives (community-based, non-private, non-state), in line with those of natural commons (involving social rules, appropriate property rights and management structures), solutions are proposed. Thus, the commons metaphor is applied to social practice around knowledge. It is in this context that the present work proceeds, discussing the creation of depositories of knowledge through the organised, voluntary contributions of scholars (the research community, itself a social common), the problems that such knowledge commons might face (such as free-riding or disappearing assets), and the protection of knowledge commons from enclosure and commodification (in the form of intellectual property legislation, patenting, licensing and overpricing).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At this point, it is important to note the nature of knowledge and its complex and multi-layered qualities of non-rivalry and non-excludability. Unlike natural commons \u2013 which are both rival and excludable (only one person can use any one item or portion at a time and in so doing they use it up, it is consumed) and characterised by scarcity (they can be replenished but there are limits to this, such that consumption/destruction may overtake production/creation) \u2013 knowledge commons are characterised by abundance (they are non-rival and non-excludable and thus, in principle, not scarce, so not impelling competition and compelling governance). This abundance of knowledge commons has been celebrated through alternative models of knowledge production, such as Commons Based Peer Production (CBPP), and embodied in the free software movement. The CBPP model showed the power of networked, open collaboration and non-material incentives to produce better quality products (mainly software).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=The emergence of a hybrid mode of knowledge production in the Generation Challenge Programme Rice Research Network (GCP-RRN) in India: Exploring the concept of Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)|journal=Geoforum|volume=84|pages=107\u2013116|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.06.008|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Commoning as a process ==\nSome scholars have coined the term ''commoning'', which by its nature as a verb serves to emphasize the understanding of the commons as a process and a practice rather than as a static entity. Some authors<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Angelis|first=Massimo|date=2010-08-17|title=The Production of Commons and the \u201cExplosion\u201d of the Middle Class|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00783.x|journal=Antipode|volume=42|issue=4|pages=954\u2013977|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00783.x|issn=0066-4812}}</ref> distinguish between the resources shared (the ''common-pool resource''s), the ''community'' who governs it, and ''commoning'', that is, the process of coming together to manage such resources. Commoning thus adds another dimension to the commons, acknowledging the social practices entailed in the process of establishing and governing a commons<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Commoning|title=Commoning - P2P Foundation|website=wiki.p2pfoundation.net|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>.

Its focus on social relations endues such processes with an emancipatory potential. Importantly, even if some commons are temporary or fail according to a conventional understanding of the term, their contribution to the members of the community and the social practices and psychological shifts that have arisen are still influential, having contributed to creating new subjectivities and sensibilities. Therefore, in this understanding, commoning can be temporary and this does not entail a problem or a failure. Commoning is a learning process, and the so-called failure of some commons might result in the creation of new ones.\n\n==Economic theories==\n\n===Tragedy of the commons===\n{{Main|Tragedy of the commons}}\nA commons failure theory, now called [[tragedy of the commons]], originated in the 18th century.<ref name=\"Rad\">{{harvnb|Radkau|2008|p=90, ff in the German text}}</ref> In 1833 [[William Forster Lloyd]] introduced the concept by a hypothetical example of herders overusing a shared parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, to the detriment of all users of the common land.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |title=Two Lectures on Population |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=473\u2013496 |year=1833 |jstor=1972412}}</ref> The same concept has been called the \"tragedy of the fishers\", when over-fishing could cause stocks to plummet.<ref>Samuel Bowles: Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution, [[Princeton University Press]], pp. 27\u201329 (2004) {{ISBN|0-691-09163-3}}</ref> Forster\u2019s pamphlet was little known, and it wasn\u2019t until 1968, with the publication by the ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] of the article \u201cThe Tragedy of the Commons\u201d<ref>Hardin, G.

These resources are held in common, not owned privately. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|journal=International Journal of the Commons|date=17 March 2017|volume=11|issue=1|page=144|doi=10.18352/ijc.673|doi-access=free}}</ref>\nCommons can be also defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates .<ref>Classical theory based on Elinor Ostrom's book Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Definition and modern use==\nThe Digital Library of the Commons defines \"commons\" as \"a general term for shared resources in which each stakeholder has an equal interest\".<ref>Digital library of the commons \u2013 Indiana University, retrieved 02/01/16 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/contentguidelines]</ref>\n\nThe term \"commons\" derives from the traditional English legal term for [[common land]], which are also known as \"commons\", and was popularised in the modern sense as a shared resource term by the ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] in an influential 1968 article called [[The Tragedy of the Commons]]. As Frank van Laerhoven and Elinor Ostrom have stated; \"Prior to the publication of Hardin's article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', '[[common pool resource]]s', or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.18352/ijc.76| title=Traditions and Trends in the Study of the Commons| year=2007| last1=Laerhoven| first1=Frank Van| last2=Ostrom| first2=Elinor| journal=International Journal of the Commons| volume=1| pages=3}}</ref>\n\nSome texts make a distinction in [[usage]] between [[common ownership]] of the commons and [[collective ownership]] among a group of colleagues, such as in a producers' cooperative. The precision of this distinction is not always maintained.\n\nThe use of \"commons\" for natural resources has its roots in European intellectual history, where it referred to shared agricultural fields, grazing lands and forests that were, over a period of several hundred years, enclosed, claimed as private property for private use. In European political texts, the common wealth was the totality of the material riches of the world, such as the air, the water, the soil and the seed, all nature's bounty regarded as the inheritance of humanity as a whole, to be shared together. In this context, one may go back further, to the Roman legal category ''res communis'', applied to things common to all to be used and enjoyed by everyone, as opposed to ''res publica'', applied to public property managed by the government.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|journal=International Journal of the Commons|volume=11|pages=144|date=March 17, 2017|doi=10.18352/ijc.673|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Types of commons==\n\n=== Environmental resource ===\n\nThe examples below illustrate types of environmental commons.\n\n==== European land use ====\n\n{{main|Common land}}\n\nOriginally in [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval England]] the common was an integral part of the [[manor]], and was thus legally part of the [[estate in land]] owned by the [[lord of the manor]], but over which certain classes of manorial tenants and others held certain rights. By extension, the term \"commons\" has come to be applied to other resources which a community has rights or access to. The older texts use the word \"common\" to denote any such right, but more modern usage is to refer to particular rights of common, and to reserve the name \"common\" for the land over which the rights are exercised. A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a ''commoner''.<ref name=\"Anon\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commoner |title=Commoner |last=Anon |publisher=Farlex Inc |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn middle Europe, commons (relatively [[small-scale agriculture]] in, especially, southern Germany, Austria, and the alpine countries) were kept, in some parts, till the present.<ref name=\"Rad\" /> Some studies have compared the German and English dealings with the commons between late medieval times and the agrarian reforms of the 18th and 19th centuries. The UK was quite radical in doing away with and enclosing former commons, while southwestern Germany (and the alpine countries as e.g. Switzerland) had the most advanced commons structures, and were more inclined to keep them. The [[Lower Rhine region]] took an intermediate position.<ref>Hartmut Z\u00fcckert, \"Allmende und Allmendaufhebung\".

Local institutions regulate harvesting and selling of timber and land, and must use any profit towards community development and preservation of the forests. In twenty years, locals have noticed a visible increase in the number of trees. Community forestry may also contribute to community development in rural areas \u2013 for instance school construction, irrigation and drinking water channel construction, and road construction.

The focus here was on the ready availability of digital forms of knowledge and associated possibilities to store, access and share it as a common. The connection between knowledge and commons may be made through identifying typical problems associated with natural resource commons, such as congestion, overharvesting, pollution and inequities, which also apply to knowledge. Then, effective alternatives (community-based, non-private, non-state), in line with those of natural commons (involving social rules, appropriate property rights and management structures), solutions are proposed. Thus, the commons metaphor is applied to social practice around knowledge. It is in this context that the present work proceeds, discussing the creation of depositories of knowledge through the organised, voluntary contributions of scholars (the research community, itself a social common), the problems that such knowledge commons might face (such as free-riding or disappearing assets), and the protection of knowledge commons from enclosure and commodification (in the form of intellectual property legislation, patenting, licensing and overpricing).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At this point, it is important to note the nature of knowledge and its complex and multi-layered qualities of non-rivalry and non-excludability. Unlike natural commons \u2013 which are both rival and excludable (only one person can use any one item or portion at a time and in so doing they use it up, it is consumed) and characterised by scarcity (they can be replenished but there are limits to this, such that consumption/destruction may overtake production/creation) \u2013 knowledge commons are characterised by abundance (they are non-rival and non-excludable and thus, in principle, not scarce, so not impelling competition and compelling governance). This abundance of knowledge commons has been celebrated through alternative models of knowledge production, such as Commons Based Peer Production (CBPP), and embodied in the free software movement. The CBPP model showed the power of networked, open collaboration and non-material incentives to produce better quality products (mainly software).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=The emergence of a hybrid mode of knowledge production in the Generation Challenge Programme Rice Research Network (GCP-RRN) in India: Exploring the concept of Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)|journal=Geoforum|volume=84|pages=107\u2013116|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.06.008|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Commoning as a process ==\nSome scholars have coined the term ''commoning'', which by its nature as a verb serves to emphasize the understanding of the commons as a process and a practice rather than as a static entity. Some authors<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Angelis|first=Massimo|date=2010-08-17|title=The Production of Commons and the \u201cExplosion\u201d of the Middle Class|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00783.x|journal=Antipode|volume=42|issue=4|pages=954\u2013977|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00783.x|issn=0066-4812}}</ref> distinguish between the resources shared (the ''common-pool resource''s), the ''community'' who governs it, and ''commoning'', that is, the process of coming together to manage such resources. Commoning thus adds another dimension to the commons, acknowledging the social practices entailed in the process of establishing and governing a commons<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Commoning|title=Commoning - P2P Foundation|website=wiki.p2pfoundation.net|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>. These practices entail, for the community of commoners, the creation of a new way of living and acting together<ref>Euler, J. & Gauditz, L. (23 February 2017). ''[https://www.degrowth.info/en/2017/02/commoning-a-different-way-of-living-and-acting-together/ \"Commoning: a different way of living and acting together\"].'' Degrowth.info</ref>, thus involving a collective psychological shift: it also entails a process of subjectivization, where the commoners produce themselves as common subjects<ref>{{Cite book|last=Federici|first=Silvia|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1129596584|title=Revolution at point zero : housework, reproduction, and feminist struggle|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=978-1-77113-494-1|location=|pages=|oclc=1129596584}}</ref>.\n\nThe discussion of commoning as a process rather than as a fixed entity also serves to bring new elements to the discussion of the commons. Its focus on social relations endues such processes with an emancipatory potential. Importantly, even if some commons are temporary or fail according to a conventional understanding of the term, their contribution to the members of the community and the social practices and psychological shifts that have arisen are still influential, having contributed to creating new subjectivities and sensibilities. Therefore, in this understanding, commoning can be temporary and this does not entail a problem or a failure. Commoning is a learning process, and the so-called failure of some commons might result in the creation of new ones.\n\n==Economic theories==\n\n===Tragedy of the commons===\n{{Main|Tragedy of the commons}}\nA commons failure theory, now called [[tragedy of the commons]], originated in the 18th century.<ref name=\"Rad\">{{harvnb|Radkau|2008|p=90, ff in the German text}}</ref> In 1833 [[William Forster Lloyd]] introduced the concept by a hypothetical example of herders overusing a shared parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, to the detriment of all users of the common land.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |title=Two Lectures on Population |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=473\u2013496 |year=1833 |jstor=1972412}}</ref> The same concept has been called the \"tragedy of the fishers\", when over-fishing could cause stocks to plummet.<ref>Samuel Bowles: Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution, [[Princeton University Press]], pp. 27\u201329 (2004) {{ISBN|0-691-09163-3}}</ref> Forster\u2019s pamphlet was little known, and it wasn\u2019t until 1968, with the publication by the ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] of the article \u201cThe Tragedy of the Commons\u201d<ref>Hardin, G. (1968). The tragedy of the commons. S''cience'', ''162''(3859), 1243-1248.</ref>, that the term gained relevance. Hardin introduced this tragedy as a social dilemma, and aimed at exposing the inevitability of failure that he saw in the commons.\n\nHowever, his argument has been widely criticized<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-revisited/|title=The Tragedy of the Commons, Revisited|last=Frischmann|first=Brett|website=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>, since he mistakes the commons, that is, resources held and managed in common by a community, with open access, that is, resources that are open to everyone but where it is difficult to restrict access or to establish rules. In the case of the commons, the community manages and sets the rules of access and use of the resource held in common: the fact of having a commons, then, does not mean that anyone is free to use the resource as they like. Studies by Ostrom and others<ref name=\"governing\" /> have shown that managing a resource as a commons often has positive outcomes and avoids the so-called tragedy of the commons, a fact that Hardin oversaw.\n\nIt has been said the dissolution of the traditional land commons played a watershed role in landscape development and cooperative land use patterns and property rights.<ref name=ws>The end of the commons as a watershed' The Age of Ecology, Joachim Radkau, John Wiley & Sons, 3 April 2014, p. 15 ff</ref> However, as in the British Isles, such changes took place over several centuries as a result of land [[enclosure]].\n\nEconomist [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] has proposed a 'sky trust' to fix this tragedic problem in worldwide generic commons. He claims that the sky belongs to all the people, and companies do not have a right to over pollute. It is a type of cap and dividend program. Ultimately the goal would be to make polluting excessively more expensive than cleaning what is being put into the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Peter |title=Pie in the Sky |year=2000 |publisher=Corporation for Enterprise Development |location=Washington D.C |isbn=978-1-883187-32-3 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n===Successful commons===\nWhile the original work on the tragedy of the commons concept suggested that all commons were doomed to failure, they remain important in the modern world.

Secondly, articulations of the commons, although historically present and multiple have struggled to come together as a unified front. For the latter to happen she argues that a \"commoning\" or \"commons\" movement that is effectively able to resist capitalist forms of organizing labour and our livelihoods must look to women to take the lead in organizing the collectivization of our daily lives and the [[means of production]].<ref>Federici, S.

This proximity and dependence on communal natural resources has made women the most vulnerable by their privatization, and made them their most staunch defendants. Examples include: [[subsistence agriculture]], credit associations such as [[tontine]] (money commons) and collectivizing [[reproductive labor]]. In [https://www.akpress.org/catalog/product/view/id/789/s/calibanandthewitch/ \"Caliban and the Witch\"], Federici interprets the ascent of capitalism as a reactionary move to subvert the rising tide of communalism and to retain the basic social contract.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvia_Federici#Scholarly_contributions </ref>\n\n===\"Feminist Reconstructions\" of the Commons===\n\nThe process of commoning the material means of reproduction of human life is most promising in the struggle to \"disentangle our livelihoods not only from the world market but also from the war machine and prison system.\" One of the main aims of the process of commoning is to create \"common subjects\" that are responsible to their communities. The notion of community is not understood as a \"gated community\", but as \"a quality of relations, a principle of cooperation and responsibility to each other and the earth, the forsts, the seas, the animals.\"<ref> http://wealthofthecommons.org/essay/feminism-and-politics-commons </ref> In communalizing housework, one of the supporting pillars of human activity it is imperative that this sphere is \"not negated but revolutionized.\" Communalizing housework also serves to de-naturalize it as women's labour, which has been a important part of the [[Feminist_movement|feminist struggle]]. <ref> http://wealthofthecommons.org/essay/feminism-and-politics-commons </ref>\n\n==Historical land commons movements==\n* The [[Diggers]]\n* [[Kett's Rebellion]]\n\n==Contemporary commons movements==\n{{div col |colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]]\n* The [[Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee]] in [[India]]\n* [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]\n* The [[EZLN]] in [[Mexico]]\n* [[Fanmi Lavalas]] in Haiti\n* [[Geolibertarianism]] primarily in the [[United States|US]]\n* The [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]]\n* [[The Land is Ours]] in the UK\n* The [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in Brazil\n* [[Movement for Justice en el Barrio]] in the [[United States of America]]\n* [[Narmada Bachao Andolan]] in India\n* [[Take Back the Land]] in the US\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Common good]]\n* [[Common ownership]]\n* [[Creative Commons]]\n* [[Copyleft]]\n* [[Common land]] \u2013 Account of historical and present common land use, mainly British Isles.\n* [[Global commons]]\n* [[Game theory]]\n* [[Homo reciprocans]]\n* [[Network effect]]\n* ''[[The Magic Cauldron (essay)|The Magic Cauldron]]'' \u2013 essay on the open source economic model\n* [[Tragedy of the anticommons]]\n* [[International Association for the Study of the Commons]]\n* [[Patentleft]]\n* [[Tyranny of small decisions]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=cox>{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Susan Jane Buck|title=No Tragedy of the Commons|journal=Environmental Ethics|date=1985|volume=7|issue=1|pages=49\u201361|doi=10.5840/enviroethics1985716|url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3113/buck_NoTragedy.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"comedy\">{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/1828/ |title=The Comedy of the Commons: Commerce, Custom, and Inherently Public Property |last=Rose |first=Carol M. |year=1986 |accessdate=December 28, 2011 |journal=Faculty Scholarship Series |page=Paper 1828}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"rifkin\">{{cite book |last1=Rifkin |first1=Jeremy |title=The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative |chapter-url=http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/ |accessdate=2 February 2016 |chapter=10 \u2013 Comedy of the Commons}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box}}\n* {{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0896920516661856|title=Labour as a Commons: The Example of Worker-Recuperated Companies|year=2018|last1=Azzellini|first1=Dario|journal=Critical Sociology|volume=44|issue=4\u20135|pages=763\u2013776}}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Basu | first1 = S. | last2 = Jongerden | first2 = J. | last3 = Ruivenkamp | first3 = G. | year = 2017 | title = Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building | url = | journal = International Journal of the Commons | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 144\u2013170 | doi = 10.18352/ijc.673 | doi-access = free }}\n* Basu, S (2016).
