The term is often used by [[Christians]] to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used as an analogy to refer to buildings of other [[religion]]s.<ref>Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism \"The Manichaean Church\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref> In traditional [[Christian architecture]], a church interior is often structured in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center [[aisle]] and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the [[Church_architecture#Characteristics_of_the_early_Christian_church_building|bema]] and [[altar]].\n\nTowers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers. Modern church buildings have a variety of [[architectural style]]s and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and, conversely, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.\n\nThe earliest identified Christian church building was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller [[parish church]]es were erected across [[Western Europe]]. A [[cathedral]] is a church building, usually [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]] (including [[Anglican]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Oriental Orthodox]], housing a [[cathedra]], the formal name for the [[episcopal see|seat]] or [[throne]] of a presiding [[bishop]].\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-\u00f3s/-\u0113/-\u00f3n'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd|\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd]]}}) means \"belonging, or pertaining, to a ''[[Kyrios]]''\" (\"Lord\"), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence \"''Kyriak\u00f3s o\u00edkos''\" ({{lang|grc|K\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}) (\"house of the Lord\", church), \"''Kyriak\u0113''\" ({{lang|grc|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae}}) (\"[the day] of the Lord\", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or \"''Kyriak\u0113 proseukh\u0113''\" ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae}}) (the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\").<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\">{{Cite web |title=Church |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=church |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cyrican.jpg|thumb|''Cyrican'' is an Old English word for churches and church property]]\nIn standard Greek usage, the older word \"ecclesia\" ({{lang-el|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''ekkles\u00eda'', literally \"assembly\", \"congregation\", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a \"[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch\"]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the \"'''C'''hurch\"]]). This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''\u00e9glise'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\" />\n\nIn the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-\u00f3s/-\u0113/-\u00f3n'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof.

While the term ''\"Romanesque\"'' refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], the trend in fact appeared throughout Western and Central Europe. The romanesque style is defined by large and bulky edifices that are typically made up of simple, compact, sparsely decorated geometric structures. Frequent features of the Romanesque church include [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] gained popularity. Interiors widened and the motifs of [[sculpture]]s took on more epic traits and themes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&dq=romanesque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Gothic architecture ====\n[[File:Santuario de Las Lajas, Ipiales, Colombia, 2015-07-21, DD 21-23 HDR.jpg|thumb|[[Las Lajas Sanctuary]] in southern Colombia.]]\nISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION\nThe [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[\u00cele-de-France]] and subsequently spread throughout Europe. Gothic churches lost the compact qualities of the romanesque era and decorations often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegorical]] features. The first [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es began to appear, all possessing geometric properties that reduced the need for large, rigid walls to ensure structural stability. This also permitted the size of windows to increase, producing brighter and lighter interiors. [[Nave]] ceilings became higher and pillars and steeples grew taller. Many architects used these developments to push the limits of structural possibility, an inclination which resulted in the collapse of several towers possessing designs that had unwittingly exceeded the boundaries of soundness. In [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, a style in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] would be built to the same height.\n\nGothic cathedrals were lavishly designed, as in the romanesque era, and many share romanesque traits. However, several also exhibit unprecedented degrees of detail and complexity in decoration. The [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, as well as the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d\u2019Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], and the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[England]] demonstrate the elaborate stylings characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.\n\nSome of the most well-known gothic churches remained unfinished for centuries, after the gothic style fell out of popularity. The construction of the  [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was begun in 1248, halted in 1473, and not resumed until 1842 is one such example.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gothic+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}</ref>\nISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The [[basilica]] was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead [[hall church]]es were built.

From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence. The use of forms known from the [[renaissance]] were extremely exaggerated. [[Dome]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] were decorated with moulding and the former [[Stucco|stucco-sculptures]] ISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGIONwere replaced by [[fresco]] paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created.

The term is often used by [[Christians]] to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used as an analogy to refer to buildings of other [[religion]]s.<ref>Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism \"The Manichaean Church\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref> In traditional [[Christian architecture]], a church interior is often structured in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center [[aisle]] and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the [[Church_architecture#Characteristics_of_the_early_Christian_church_building|bema]] and [[altar]].\n\nTowers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers. Modern church buildings have a variety of [[architectural style]]s and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and, conversely, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.\n\nThe earliest identified Christian church building was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller [[parish church]]es were erected across [[Western Europe]]. A [[cathedral]] is a church building, usually [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]] (including [[Anglican]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Oriental Orthodox]], housing a [[cathedra]], the formal name for the [[episcopal see|seat]] or [[throne]] of a presiding [[bishop]].\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-\u00f3s/-\u0113/-\u00f3n'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd|\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd]]}}) means \"belonging, or pertaining, to a ''[[Kyrios]]''\" (\"Lord\"), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence \"''Kyriak\u00f3s o\u00edkos''\" ({{lang|grc|K\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}) (\"house of the Lord\", church), \"''Kyriak\u0113''\" ({{lang|grc|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae}}) (\"[the day] of the Lord\", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or \"''Kyriak\u0113 proseukh\u0113''\" ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae}}) (the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\").<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\">{{Cite web |title=Church |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=church |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cyrican.jpg|thumb|''Cyrican'' is an Old English word for churches and church property]]\nIn standard Greek usage, the older word \"ecclesia\" ({{lang-el|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''ekkles\u00eda'', literally \"assembly\", \"congregation\", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a \"[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch\"]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the \"'''C'''hurch\"]]). This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''\u00e9glise'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\" />\n\nIn the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-\u00f3s/-\u0113/-\u00f3n'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof.

Besides serving as a place of worship, the cathedral or parish church was frequently employed as a general gathering-place by the communities in which they were located, hosting such events as [[guild]] meetings, [[banquet]]s, [[mystery plays]], and [[fair]]s. Church grounds and buildings were also used for the threshing and storage of grain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}</ref>\n\n==== Romanesque architecture ====\nBetween 1000 and 1200 the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] style became popular across [[Europe]]. While the term ''\"Romanesque\"'' refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], the trend in fact appeared throughout Western and Central Europe. The romanesque style is defined by large and bulky edifices that are typically made up of simple, compact, sparsely decorated geometric structures. Frequent features of the Romanesque church include [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] gained popularity. Interiors widened and the motifs of [[sculpture]]s took on more epic traits and themes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&dq=romanesque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Gothic architecture ====\n[[File:Santuario de Las Lajas, Ipiales, Colombia, 2015-07-21, DD 21-23 HDR.jpg|thumb|[[Las Lajas Sanctuary]] in southern Colombia.]]\n\nThe [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[\u00cele-de-France]] and subsequently spread throughout Europe. Gothic churches lost the compact qualities of the romanesque era and decorations often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegorical]] features. The first [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es began to appear, all possessing geometric properties that reduced the need for large, rigid walls to ensure structural stability. This also permitted the size of windows to increase, producing brighter and lighter interiors. [[Nave]] ceilings became higher and pillars and steeples grew taller. Many architects used these developments to push the limits of structural possibility, an inclination which resulted in the collapse of several towers possessing designs that had unwittingly exceeded the boundaries of soundness. In [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, a style in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] would be built to the same height.\n\nGothic cathedrals were lavishly designed, as in the romanesque era, and many share romanesque traits. However, several also exhibit unprecedented degrees of detail and complexity in decoration. The [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, as well as the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d\u2019Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], and the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[England]] demonstrate the elaborate stylings characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.\n\nSome of the most well-known gothic churches remained unfinished for centuries, after the gothic style fell out of popularity. The construction of the  [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was begun in 1248, halted in 1473, and not resumed until 1842 is one such example.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gothic+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The [[basilica]] was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead [[hall church]]es were built. Typical features are columns and classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=70m1KbuD5YoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=renaissance+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWwu-Bo-TVAhUDORQKHfd9B3YQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=renaissance%20architecture&f=false|title=Renaissance Architecture|last=Anderson|first=Christy|date=2013-02-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780192842275|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]], where the proclamation of God's Word is of special importance, the visitor's line of view is directed towards the [[pulpit]].\n\n=== Baroque architecture ===\nThe [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style was first used in [[Italy]] around 1575. From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence. The use of forms known from the [[renaissance]] were extremely exaggerated. [[Dome]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] were decorated with moulding and the former [[Stucco|stucco-sculptures]] were replaced by [[fresco]] paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created. The sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about 1720 to the [[Rococo|rococo era]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=eaC7yKbxj8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=baroque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi14YH0rOTVAhXQERQKHZaZDEoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=baroque%20architecture&f=false|title=Pietro Da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture|last=Merz|first=J\u00f6rg Martin|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300111231|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Protestantism|Protestant parishes]] preferred lateral churches, in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the [[pulpit]] and the [[altar]].\n\n==Architecture==\n{{main article|Church architecture}}\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral from Cloisters, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Norwich Cathedral]] in England is an example of a Cathedral complex built during the [[Middle Ages]].]]\nA common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dqIZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=Remarks on Church Architecture ...|last=Petit|first=John Louis|date=1841|publisher=J.
