This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, \"If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices.\"<ref>Pegis 1945.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Empirical ===\nOccam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see \"Applications\" section below for some examples).\n\nIn the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).\n\n==== Testing the razor ====\nThe razor's statement that \"other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones\" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that \"simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones\". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.\n\n[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It might be coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]\n\nSome increases in complexity are sometimes necessary, so there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.\n\nPut another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. \"... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too\") successfully prevent outright disproval. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called saving hypotheses, cannot be ruled out \u2013 except by using Occam's razor.<ref name=\"Stanovich2007\">Stanovich, Keith E. (2007).

This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in [[Bayesian inference]] (namely [[marginal probability]], [[conditional probability]], and [[posterior probability]]).\n\nThe [[bias\u2013variance tradeoff]] is a framework that incorporates the Occam's razor principal in its balance between overfitting (i.e. variance minimization) and underfitting (i.e. bias minimization).<ref>{{Cite book |title=Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control |last=Spall |first=James C. |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9780471441908 |pages=330\u2013331}}</ref>\n\n=== Other philosophers ===\n\n==== Karl Popper ====\n[[Karl Popper]] argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its [[falsifiability]] criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones \"because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |author-link=Karl Popper |orig-year=1934 |year=1992 |title=Logik der Forschung |trans-title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery |edition=2nd |chapter= |trans-chapter= |url= |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=121\u2013132 |isbn=978-84-309-0711-3 }}</ref> The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.\n\n==== Elliott Sober ====\nThe philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with \"informativeness\": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.<ref name=\"Sober975\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/simplicity0000sobe |title=Simplicity |last=Sober |first=Elliott |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-19-824407-3 |location=Oxford |author-link=Elliott Sober |url-access=registration}}</ref> He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an [[epistemology|epistemic]] justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: \"Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'\"<ref name=\"Sober2002\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-YdbBN-O-JAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=zellner+simplicity |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |last=Sober |first=Elliott |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-80361-8 |editor-last=Zellner |editor-first=Arnold |location=Cambridge, U.K. |pages=13\u201331 |chapter=What is the Problem of Simplicity? |postscript=ISBN 0-511-00748-5 (eBook [Adobe Reader]) |access-date=4 August 2012 |editor-last2=Keuzenkamp |editor-first2=Hugo A. |editor-link2=Hugo A.

Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: \"Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth.\" (Swinburne 1997).\n\n==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====\nFrom the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':\n\n* 3.328 \"If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless.

At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave\u2014nor the particle\u2014explanation alone suffices, as [[wave\u2013particle duality|light behaves like waves and like particles]].\n\nThree axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.<ref name=\"fn_(110)\" />\n\nThere are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data.

For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.<ref name=\"fn_(110)\" />\n\n=== Biology ===\nBiologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson & E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: \"In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.\" (Morgan 1903).\n\nHowever, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.\n\n[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf \u2013 which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection \u2013 a phenomenon called \"the selfish herd\".\n\n[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference |last=Sober |first=Elliot |date=1998 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-69144-4 |edition=2nd |location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |page=7}}</ref>\n\nIt is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.<ref>Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})</ref> For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article \"Let's Razor Ockham's Razor\" (1990).\n\nOther methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.\n\n[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: \"While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research.\"<ref>Crick 1988, p. 146.</ref>\n\nIn [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Main| Existence of God}}\n\nIn the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that \"nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture.\"<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford |accessdate=24 February 2016 |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |contribution=William Ockham}}</ref> Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: \"only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover.\"<ref>Dale T Irvin & Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.</ref>\n\n[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archive-date=28 April 2013 |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.</blockquote>\n\nIn turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:\n\n<blockquote>Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.</blockquote>\n\nRather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.<ref>McDonald 2005.</ref> This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).\n\nVarious [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).\n\nAnother application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685\u20131753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.\n\nOccam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, \"It's because I had no need of that hypothesis.\"<ref>p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''M\u00e9moires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napol\u00e9on''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ain\u00e9</ref> Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.\n\nIn his article \"Sensations and Brain Processes\" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as \"pain\", \"joy\", \"desire\", \"fear\", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.\n\n=== Penal ethics ===\nIn penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s \"parsimony principle\" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual\u2014an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Tonry |first=Michael |year=2005 |title=Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy |url=http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf |journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] |volume=105 |pages=1233\u20131275|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf |archive-date=23 June 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== Probability theory and statistics ===\nMarcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.\n\nThere are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference.

A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].\n\nStatistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]\u2013[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent \"simplicity\" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.\n\n==== Objective razor ====\nThe minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a \"natural\" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm |title=Algorithmic Information Theory |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm |archive-date=24 December 2007}}</ref> Describing the program for the universal program as the \"hypothesis\", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] that \"the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized.\"<ref>Paul M.

We don't assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false. We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong.

One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions.

V. Quine}}</ref>\n\n[[Galileo Galilei]] lampooned the ''misuse'' of Occam's razor in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]''. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.\n\n== Anti-razors ==\nOccam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290\u20131343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor'': \"If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on.\" Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution {{lang|it|Se non \u00e8 vero, \u00e8 ben trovato}} (\"Even if it is not true, it is well conceived\") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.\n\nAnti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724\u20131804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902\u20131985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: \"The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html |title=The Critique of Pure Reason |last=Immanuel Kant |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1929 |editor-last=Norman Kemp-Smith transl |page=92 |quote=Entium varietates non-temere esse minuendas |author-link=Immanuel Kant |access-date=27 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html |archive-date=16 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nKarl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: \"Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy\" and \"It is vain to do with fewer what requires more.\" A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the \"science of imaginary solutions\" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873\u20131907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, \"'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own.\" Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay \"[[Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]\". There is also [[Crabtree's Bludgeon]], which cynically states that \"[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated.\"\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology|Science}}\n{{col div}}\n* {{annotated link|Chekhov's gun}}\n* {{annotated link|Explanatory power}}\n* {{annotated link|Hanlon's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Hickam's dictum}}\n* {{annotated link|Hitchens's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|KISS principle}}\n* {{annotated link|Minimum description length}}\n* {{annotated link|Minimum message length}}\n* {{annotated link|Newton's flaming laser sword}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophical razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of science}}\n* {{annotated link|Simplicity}}\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n* {{Cite book |title=Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony |last=Ariew |first=Roger |publisher=Champaign-Urbana, University of Illinois |year=1976}}\n* {{Cite journal |last=Charlesworth |first=M.

This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, \"If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices.\"<ref>Pegis 1945.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Empirical ===\nOccam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see \"Applications\" section below for some examples).\n\nIn the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).\n\n==== Testing the razor ====\nThe razor's statement that \"other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones\" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that \"simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones\". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.\n\n[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It might be coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]\n\nSome increases in complexity are sometimes necessary, so there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.\n\nPut another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. \"... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too\") successfully prevent outright disproval. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called saving hypotheses, cannot be ruled out \u2013 except by using Occam's razor.<ref name=\"Stanovich2007\">Stanovich, Keith E. (2007).

He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: \"Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'\"<ref name=\"Sober2002\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-YdbBN-O-JAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=zellner+simplicity |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |last=Sober |first=Elliott |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-80361-8 |editor-last=Zellner |editor-first=Arnold |location=Cambridge, U.K. |pages=13\u201331 |chapter=What is the Problem of Simplicity? |postscript=ISBN 0-511-00748-5 (eBook [Adobe Reader]) |access-date=4 August 2012 |editor-last2=Keuzenkamp |editor-first2=Hugo A. |editor-link2=Hugo A.

Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: \"Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth.\" (Swinburne 1997).\n\n==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====\nFrom the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':\n\n* 3.328 \"If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless.

Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.<ref name=\"fn_(110)\" />\n\nThere are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data.

For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.<ref name=\"fn_(110)\" />\n\n=== Biology ===\nBiologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson & E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: \"In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.\" (Morgan 1903).\n\nHowever, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.\n\n[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf \u2013 which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection \u2013 a phenomenon called \"the selfish herd\".\n\n[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference |last=Sober |first=Elliot |date=1998 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-69144-4 |edition=2nd |location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |page=7}}</ref>\n\nIt is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.<ref>Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})</ref> For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article \"Let's Razor Ockham's Razor\" (1990).\n\nOther methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.\n\n[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: \"While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research.\"<ref>Crick 1988, p. 146.</ref>\n\nIn [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Main| Existence of God}}\n\nIn the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that \"nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture.\"<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford |accessdate=24 February 2016 |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |contribution=William Ockham}}</ref> Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: \"only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover.\"<ref>Dale T Irvin & Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.</ref>\n\n[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archive-date=28 April 2013 |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.</blockquote>\n\nIn turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:\n\n<blockquote>Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.</blockquote>\n\nRather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.<ref>McDonald 2005.</ref> This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).\n\nVarious [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).\n\nAnother application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685\u20131753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.\n\nOccam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, \"It's because I had no need of that hypothesis.\"<ref>p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''M\u00e9moires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napol\u00e9on''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ain\u00e9</ref> Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.\n\nIn his article \"Sensations and Brain Processes\" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as \"pain\", \"joy\", \"desire\", \"fear\", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.\n\n=== Penal ethics ===\nIn penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s \"parsimony principle\" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual\u2014an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Tonry |first=Michael |year=2005 |title=Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy |url=http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf |journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] |volume=105 |pages=1233\u20131275|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf |archive-date=23 June 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== Probability theory and statistics ===\nMarcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.\n\nThere are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference.

A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].\n\nStatistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]\u2013[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent \"simplicity\" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.\n\n==== Objective razor ====\nThe minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a \"natural\" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm |title=Algorithmic Information Theory |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm |archive-date=24 December 2007}}</ref> Describing the program for the universal program as the \"hypothesis\", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] that \"the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized.\"<ref>Paul M.

The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.\n\n== Anti-razors ==\nOccam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290\u20131343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor'': \"If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on.\" Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution {{lang|it|Se non \u00e8 vero, \u00e8 ben trovato}} (\"Even if it is not true, it is well conceived\") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.\n\nAnti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724\u20131804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902\u20131985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: \"The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html |title=The Critique of Pure Reason |last=Immanuel Kant |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1929 |editor-last=Norman Kemp-Smith transl |page=92 |quote=Entium varietates non-temere esse minuendas |author-link=Immanuel Kant |access-date=27 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html |archive-date=16 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nKarl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: \"Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy\" and \"It is vain to do with fewer what requires more.\" A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the \"science of imaginary solutions\" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873\u20131907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, \"'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own.\" Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay \"[[Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]\".
