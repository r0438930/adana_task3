Director [[Mark Herman]] said that they came across Butterfield early on in the audition process. He was on the first audition tape he received and he was the third hopeful he met in person. Herman thought Butterfield's performance was outstanding, but only decided to cast him after auditioning hundreds of other boys, \"so no stone was left unturned\".<ref name=\"lastbroadcast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/movies/v/5698-the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-casting-the-characters.html |title=The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas \u2013 Casting the characters |work=Last Broadcast |accessdate=20 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131205043/http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/movies/v/5698-the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-casting-the-characters.html |archivedate=31 January 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProducer [[David Heyman]] and director [[Mark Herman]] were looking for someone who was able to portray the main character's innocence, so they asked each of the children what they knew about the Holocaust. Butterfield's knowledge was slim and it was purposely kept that way throughout filming so it would be easier for him to convey his character's innocence. The final scenes of the film were shot at the end of the production period to prepare both him and [[Jack Scanlon]] for the dramatic ending of the film.<ref name=\"mark-David-indie London-interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-mark-herman-and-david-heyman-interview |title=The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas \u2013 Mark Herman and David Heyman interview |last=Carnevale |first=Rob |work=Indie London |accessdate=23 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108150914/http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-mark-herman-and-david-heyman-interview |archivedate=8 January 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> He beat hundreds of boys to the role and also successfully passed the auditions for a role in ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'' for which he auditioned at the same time.

Director [[Mark Herman]] said that they came across Butterfield early on in the audition process. He was on the first audition tape he received and he was the third hopeful he met in person. Herman thought Butterfield's performance was outstanding, but only decided to cast him after auditioning hundreds of other boys, \"so no stone was left unturned\".<ref name=\"lastbroadcast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/movies/v/5698-the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-casting-the-characters.html |title=The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas \u2013 Casting the characters |work=Last Broadcast |accessdate=20 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131205043/http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/movies/v/5698-the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-casting-the-characters.html |archivedate=31 January 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProducer [[David Heyman]] and director [[Mark Herman]] were looking for someone who was able to portray the main character's innocence, so they asked each of the children what they knew about the Holocaust. Butterfield's knowledge was slim and it was purposely kept that way throughout filming so it would be easier for him to convey his character's innocence. The final scenes of the film were shot at the end of the production period to prepare both him and [[Jack Scanlon]] for the dramatic ending of the film.<ref name=\"mark-David-indie London-interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-mark-herman-and-david-heyman-interview |title=The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas \u2013 Mark Herman and David Heyman interview |last=Carnevale |first=Rob |work=Indie London |accessdate=23 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108150914/http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-mark-herman-and-david-heyman-interview |archivedate=8 January 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> He beat hundreds of boys to the role and also successfully passed the auditions for a role in ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'' for which he auditioned at the same time.
