The work begins with Creation and contains annals up until the year of Paris's death, 1259.\n\nWritten in [[Latin]], the illustrated autograph copy of the ''Chronica'' survives in three volumes. The first two parts, covering Creation up to 1188 as well as the years 1189 to 1253 (MS 26 and MS 16), are archived at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]].<ref>Parker Library on the web: MS 26, MS 16I, MS 16II 362 x 244/248 mm. ff 141 + 281</ref> The remainder of the ''Chronica'', from 1254 until Paris's death in 1259, is in the [[British Library]], bound as Royal MS 14 C VII folios 157\u2013218, following Paris's ''Historia Anglorum'' (an abridgement of the ''Chronica'' covering the period from 1070 to 1253).<ref>Ibid.</ref>\n\nThe ''Chronica'' is also renowned for its author's unprecedented use of archival and documentary material. These sources, amounting to over 200 items, included charters dating back to the eighth century,<ref>CM, vol. 6, 1\u201362</ref> the rights of St Albans,<ref>Ibid.</ref> a dossier relating to the canonisation of St Edmund of Canterbury and even a documented list of precious gems and artefacts in possession of St Albans.<ref>CM, vol. 6, 383\u201392</ref> This exhaustive list of material required its own appendix which later became a separate volume, the ''Liber Additamentorum.''\n\nThe ''Chronica'' is one of the most important surviving documents for the history of Latin Europe.<ref>Bjorn Weiler, \u2018Matthew Paris on the Writing of History\u2019, ''Journal of Medieval History 35:3'' (2006) p. 255.</ref> Despite its focus on England, Paris's work extends to regions as far as [[Norway]], [[Hungary]], and [[Sicily]] as well as the [[Crusades|crusader]] states.<ref>Ibid.</ref> It continues to be mined for its coverage of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions]], its detailed report of the conflict between [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Fredrick II]] and successive popes, as well as its commentary on the outbreak of the [[First Barons' War|Barons\u2019 War]] of 1258\u201367.<ref>Ibid.<br /></ref> In addition to Paris\u2019 literary abilities, he proved himself to be an accomplished draughtsman. The surviving manuscripts are considered to be the foremost examples of English Gothic [[Manuscript]], and they include some of the earliest surviving maps of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and the [[Holy Land]].<ref>Ibid.</ref>\n\n== Methodology ==\nBy the end of the twelfth century, contemporary historians attempted to distance and distinguish themselves from the [[Monasticism|monastic]] chronicler. [[Gervase of Canterbury]], an individual who influenced Paris\u2019 writing, wrote the following in 1188:\n\n\u2018The historian proceeds diffusely and elegantly, whereas the chronicler proceeds simply, gradually and briefly. The Chronicler computes the years ''Anno Domini'' and months kalends, and briefly describes the actions of kings and princes which occurred at those times; he also commemorates events, portents and wonders\u2019.<ref>Gervase of Canterbury, in Suzanne Lewis, ''The Art of Matthew Paris in the Chronica Majora'' (California, 1987), p.11.</ref>\n\nAlthough Paris was unique in both his illustratory and research efforts, his writing reflects thirteenth-century attempts at synthesis and consolidation in historiography.<ref>Lewis, ''The Art of Matthew Paris'', p.10.</ref> The ''Chronica'' mirrors the century's developments in traditional annalistic genres, namely the monastic chronicle, which tended to merge with a broader scope of universal history.<ref>Ibid.</ref> This explains why Paris structured his seminal work in a seemingly journalistic way. He chose to order the ''Chronica'' in chronological sequence, in keeping with what was ''vogue'', but it soon became a multilayered pastiche since Paris continued the monastic practice of both revising and amending entries retrospectively.<ref>Ibid.</ref>\n\nSuzanne Lewis claims that [[Roger of Wendover|Roger Wendover]], Paris\u2019 predecessor, had a resounding influence on Paris\u2019 works.<ref>Ibid, p. 12.</ref> Paris\u2019 ''Chronica'' was largely a continuation of Wendover's annals up to 1235 with the odd addition of phrases and anecdotes in an attempt to heighten drama.<ref>Ibid, p.13.</ref> Where Paris departed from contemporary modes of literature can be seen in his prodigious use of source material and evidence.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Although the insertion of documents was common in the writing of Christian history, the ''Chronica'' surpassed this and was a contemporary \u2018record breaker\u2019.<ref>Ibid.</ref> In addition, the number of changes made to the ''Chronica'' suggests that Paris adapted much of the material, molding it to match his own understanding of the role of the author and the purpose of writing.<ref>Ibid, p.12.</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\nParis\u2019 long-held status as an historian has been contested within the academic community, past and present. Whilst many argue that Paris never intended to be a \u2018humble compiler of dated events\u2019, as Lewis states, his work has come to be viewed as a cumbersome annalistic production regardless.<ref>Ibid, p.11.</ref>\n\nLewis summarised her stance on the ''Chronica'' by writing that \u2018the downfall of a great king must compete for attention with the birth of a two-headed calf\u2019.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Paris placed great importance on the coverage of portents and marvels. This can be seen in both his preface and within the closing pages of the ''Chronica.'' The latter consisted of a list of marvels which Paris claimed to have occurred over a fifty-year period.<ref>Weiler, \u2018Matthew Paris\u2019, p. 259.</ref>\n\nSuch reporting was undoubtedly rooted in the Latin models, such as [[Cicero]], who influenced both Paris and his contemporaries.<ref>Lewis, ''The Art of Matthew Paris'', p.11.</ref> Classical writings often assumed the role of moral censor; their purpose was to provide examples of good and evil for their readers spiritual edification.<ref>Ibid.</ref> This literary tradition was echoed within the ''Chronica'' and was used with great dexterity by Paris. He posed rhetorical questions concerning the deeds and actions of people and why such things warranted being written down.<ref>Weiler, \u2018Matthew Paris\u2019, p. 259.</ref> In the eyes of Paris, a conservative Benedictine monk, signs and portents indicated famine and other miseries that would befall humanity in recompense for their sins. In essence Paris believed that history, and the sinful actions that forged it, would prompt sinners to hasten quickly to seek God's forgiveness.<ref>Ibid.<br /></ref>\n\nTo Paris, history was a matter of moral instruction and a means to provide guidance to the earthly and celestial well-being of God's people.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Paris saw the reporting of history as a platform through which the mistakes of men could be presented as a lesson to be learnt from. From its treatment of the Jews to its coverage of the Mongol invasion, Paris writes from a position of self-interest.<ref>Lewis, ''The Art of Matthew Paris'', p.14.</ref> He tended to distort history and his source material in order to preserve the integrity of his abbey and kingdom.<ref>Weiler, \u2018Matthew Paris\u2019, p. 269.</ref> What has been agreed upon is that the ''Chronica'', at the very least, provides insight into what history meant to contemporaries and how they used it to reconcile their place within their world. It provides an encyclopedic history of the affairs of his community and an unprecedented number of insightful sources and documents which would never otherwise have survived.\n\n== The Wandering Jew ==\n[[File:Zid Jezis.jpg|thumb|The Wandering Jew in the ''Chronica Majora'']]\nMatthew Paris\u2019 Chronica Majora contains one of the first extant descriptions and images of the [[Wandering Jew]], a legendary figure who struck and scolded [[Jesus]] on his way to the crucifixion, thereby becoming doomed to walk the earth until the [[Second Coming]].<ref>Anderson, George K. \"The Beginnings of the Legend.\" ''The Legend of the Wandering Jew'', Brown UP, 1965, pp. 11-37.</ref>\n\nThe drawing of the Wandering Jew, likely done by Matthew Paris himself, embodies the paradoxical theological position of Jews in early and medieval Christianity as espoused by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].\u00a0 Standing hunched over with a [[mattock]] (a symbol associated with [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]) behind Jesus as he progresses to [[Calvary]], the depiction of the Wandering Jew represents the idea of Jewish sinfulness fixed throughout time as a contrast to Christ\u2019s upright moral progression.\u00a0 The drawing also visualizes the notion of Christian [[supersessionism]].<ref>Lampert-Weissig, Lisa. \"The Time of the Wandering Jew in the Chronica Majora and the De Brailes Hours.\" ''Philological Quarterly'', vol. 96, no. 2, pp. 171-202, search.ebscohost.com.revproxy.brown.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edsglr&AN=edsgcl.507966032&site=eds-live&scope=site. </ref>\n<br />\n== Editions ==\n* [[Matthew Parker]] (1571)\n* [[William Wats]] (1641)\n* [[Henry Richards Luard]], for the [[Rolls series]] (1872\u201380): [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien01pari#page/n13/mode/2up vol 1], [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien02pari#page/n13/mode/2up vol 2], [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien03pari#page/n9/mode/2up vol 3], [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien04pari#page/n9/mode/2up vol 4], [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien05pari#page/n11/mode/2up vol 5], [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien06pari#page/n13/mode/2up vol 6] (the ''Additamenta''), [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien07pari#page/n9/mode/2up vol 7] (Index and Glossary)\n*[[Felix Liebermann]], for the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica|MGH]] (1888) (Excerpts) [https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000862.html?pageNo=107&sortIndex=010%3A050%3A0028%3A010%3A00%3A00 Link]\n\n== Translations ==\n\n* English translation by [[John Allen Giles]] (1852\u201354), [https://archive.org/stream/matthewparisseng01pari#page/n7/mode/2up vol 1], [https://archive.org/stream/matthewparisseng02pari#page/n5/mode/2up vol 2], [https://archive.org/stream/matthewparisseng03pari#page/n3/mode/2up vol 3] [1235 to 1259 only, from Wats, with the continuation to 1273]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Richard Vaughan: ''Matthew Paris'', Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought, New ser. 6 (Cambridge, 1958),  [https://archive.org/details/matthewparis012094mbp/page/n9/mode/2up (Internet Archive)]\n* Richard Vaughan (ed. and tr): ''The Chronicles of Matthew Paris: Monastic Life in the Thirteenth Century'' (Gloucester, 1984).\n* Richard Vaughan: ''The Illustrated Chronicles of Matthew Paris''.
