[[Transport for London]] (TfL) is responsible for the charge which has been operated by [[IBM]] since 2009. During the first ten years since the introduction of the scheme, gross revenue reached about \u00a32.6&nbsp;billion up to the end of December 2013. From 2003 to 2013, about \u00a31.2&nbsp;billion has been invested in public transport, road and bridge improvement and walking and cycling schemes. Of these, a total of \u00a3960&nbsp;million was invested on improvements to the bus network.\n\n[[File:Space taken vs numbers in City of London (transport).png|300px|thumb|Numbers of people using different transport types in the City of London in 2017 against the road space used by that type.<ref>http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/documents/s91800/Appendix+1+-+Traffic+in+the+City+2018.pdf</ref>]]\nThe congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.<ref name=2014assessment>{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/cc-changes-march-2014/user_uploads/cc-impact-assessment.pdf |title=Public and stakeholder consultation on a Variation Order to modify the Congestion Charging scheme Impact Assessment |author=Transport for London (TfL) |publisher=TfL |date=January 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2015 |format=PDF}} ''See pp. 12: Traffic volume, speed and congestion.''</ref>\n\nThe Congestion Charge was suspended on 23 March 2020 for an indefinite period of time in order to facilitate travel around the city for critical workers during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus public health crisis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/coronavirus-transport-london-congestion-charge-suspended-ulez-lez-a9418356.html|title=TfL suspends congestion charge, ULEZ and LEZ amid coronavirus outbreak|date=2020-03-23|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n== Present scheme ==\n\n=== Boundary ===\n[[File:London Congestion Charge Zone since 2011.png|thumb|left|The boundary of the current Congestion Charging zone.]]\n{{Multiple image | direction = horizontal | align = right| image1 =London CC 12 2012 5045.JPG| width1 = 145\n| caption1 =Sign indicating the entrance of congestion charge area.| image2 = London CC 12 2012 5018b.jpg| width2 = 145\n| caption2 =Sign indicating the exit of congestion charge area.}}\nThe current congestion charge zone covers the area within the [[London Inner Ring Road]] which includes both the [[City of London]], which is the main financial district, and also the [[West End of London|West End]], which is London's primary commercial and entertainment centre.<ref name=\"What it is\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |title=Congestion Charging: in London \u2013 What it is |work=BBC News |year=2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412122132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |archivedate=12 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Although primarily a commercial area, there are also 136,000 residents, out of a total [[Greater London]] population of almost 9,000,000.

The daily profile of traffic flows had changed, with less traffic after 9:30&nbsp;am and a peak immediately before and after the end of the charging period. The level of traffic entering the zone during the morning peak had not reduced as much as at other times.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" /> The overall level of traffic of all vehicle types entering the central Congestion Charge Zone was consistently 16% lower in 2006 than the pre-charge levels in 2002.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" /> Year on year, counts of inbound traffic approaching the zone had also seen a distinct and significant 5\u20137% decline in the number of chargeable vehicles, which was unexplained.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" /> They had noted a small but pervasive long term trend of less traffic entering the zone, expected to be a result of people changing their location and lifestyle, perhaps influenced by the charge.

This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works in the latter half of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7109727.stm |title=Congestion charge 'not working' |date=23 February 2007 |work=BBC News   |accessdate=23 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429041334/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7109727.stm |archivedate=29 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.<ref name=\"bbc20070711\" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1454446/London-congestion-charge-not-working.html |title=London congestion charge 'not working' |first=Paul |last=Marston |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph News and Media Limited |date=16 February 2004 |accessdate=24 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nTfL reported in January 2014, that despite a reduction of traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.<ref name=2014assessment/>\n\n=== Air quality ===\nThe pre-commencement report from TfL noted that the scheme wasn't expected to significantly affect [[air quality]], but that offering a discount to encourage the use of greener fuels would be a positive measure.<ref name=\"tflprereport\" />\n\nTfL reported that levels of [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO<sub>X</sub>), fell by 13.4% between 2002 and 2003, and carbon dioxide, as well as the levels of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulates]] (PM10) within and alongside the [[Inner Ring Road, London|Inner Ring Road]] boundary of the zone.<ref name=\"tfljune2006\" />\n\nSince 2002, the [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>) produced by [[diesel exhaust]] has become a serious problem, with the [[London Air Quality Network]] of [[King's College London]] reporting that the annual mean NO<sub>2</sub> objective (of 40 \u03bcgm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006.  Although no areas within the Congestion Charge Zone reported NO<sub>2</sub> levels above an upper limit of 200 \u03bcgm-3 (105 ppb), some monitoring areas near the zone boundary experienced very long periods at such levels, notably the [[A23 road|A23]] near Brixton (3741 hours) and the [[Marylebone Road]] (849 hours).<ref name=laqn>{{cite web |format=PDF |url=http://www.londonair.org.uk/london/reports/AirQualityInLondon2005andmid2006.pdf |title=Air Quality in London 2005 and mid 2006 \u2013 Briefing |last=Fuller & Green |date=28 July 2006 |publisher=London Air Quality Network |accessdate=8 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the ''Fifth Annual Monitoring Report'' by TfL stated that between 2003 and 2006, NO<sub>X</sub> emissions fell by 17%, PM10 by 24% and CO<sub>2</sub> by 3%, with some being attributed to the effects of reduced levels of traffic flowing better, with the majority being as a result of improved vehicle technology.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" /><ref name=\"glareport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/reports/cat09/0505171128_London_Congestion_Charge_Detailed_Assessment.doc |first=Lucy |last=Sadler |title=Detailed assessment London congestion charging |format=DOC |accessdate=20 January 2008 |publisher=UK Air Quality Archive|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228180759/http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/reports/cat09/0505171128_London_Congestion_Charge_Detailed_Assessment.doc |archivedate = 28 February 2008}}</ref> In total, the rate of fall in CO<sub>2</sub> has been almost 20% as of 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Milan introduces traffic charge |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7167992.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=20 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429041527/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7167992.stm |archivedate=29 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 2007 TfL report makes it clear that only a one-off reduction of emissions could be expected from the introduction of the charge, whilst further reductions are unlikely to be as a result of the charge.  It notes that lower vehicles emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality as vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along industrial sources and that weather conditions play a significant role, and that pollutant concentrations were being affected by changes in the make up of the vehicle fleet.  It also suggests that the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" />\n\nA 2011 independent study published by the [[Health Effects Institute]] (HEI), and led by a researcher from [[King's College London]], found that there is little evidence the congestion charge scheme has improved air quality.  This research used modelling and also compared actual air pollutant measurements within the congestion charge zone with those of control sites located in Outer London.  The investigators concluded that \"''it is difficult to identify significant air quality improvements from a specific program\u2014especially one targeted at a small area within a large city\u2014against the backdrop of broader regional pollutant and weather changes''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/04/hei-study-finds-london-congestion-charging-scheme-shows-little-evidence-of-improving-air-quality.html#tp |title=HEI study finds London Congestion Charging Scheme shows little evidence of improving air quality|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>  National trends had already shown a rapid decline of some other emissions during the late 1990s, notably [[carbon monoxide]], and levels have been relatively stable since 2002 across London.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\" | Charging zone\n| colspan=\"3\" | Inner Ring Road\n|-\n|\n| NO<sub>X</sub>\n| PM10\n| CO<sub>2</sub>\n| NO<sub>X</sub>\n| PM10\n| CO<sub>2</sub>\n|-\n| Overall traffic emissions change 2003 versus 2002<ref name=\"tfljune2006\" />\n| \u221213.4\n| \u221215.5\n| \u221216.4\n| \u22126.9\n| \u22126.8\n| \u22125.4\n|-\n| Overall traffic emissions change 2004 versus 2003<ref name=\"tfljune2006\" />\n| \u22125.2\n| \u22126.9\n| \u22120.9\n| \u22125.6\n| \u22126.3\n| \u22120.8\n|-\n| Changes due to improved vehicle technology 2003-2006<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" />\n| \u221217.3\n| \u221223.8\n| \u22123.4\n| \u221217.5\n| \u221220.9\n| \u22122.4\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\"|<small>Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/FourthAnnualReportFinal.pdf |title=Impacts Monitoring \u2013 Fourth Annual Report |publisher= [[Transport for London]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429042848/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/FourthAnnualReportFinal.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2015 |url-status=live}} and {{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/fifth-annual-impacts-monitoring-report-2007-07-07.pdf |accessdate=23 November 2007 |date=June 2007 |title=Impacts Monitoring \u2013 Fifth Annual Report |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122090211/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/fifth-annual-impacts-monitoring-report-2007-07-07.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2014 |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |url-status=live}} 2003\u20132004 figures are TfL estimates. </small>\n|}\n\n=== Public transport ===\nOn the launch date of the original zone, an extra 300 buses (out of a total of around 8,000) were introduced.<ref name=more_buses/> Bus route changes have been made to take advantage of the presumed higher traffic speeds and the greater demand for public transport; [[London Buses route 452|route 452]] was introduced and three others (routes [[London Buses route 31|31]], [[London Buses route 46|46]] and [[London Buses route 430|430]]) were extended.

Also that usage of the Underground has increased by 1% above pre-charge levels, having fallen substantially in 2003/2004. They could not attribute any change in [[National Rail]] patronage to the introduction of the central zone charge.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" />\n\n=== Parking in outer London ===\nThe charge has proved controversial in the outer areas of London, where it has encouraged commuters who previously drove into central London to instead park at suburban railway or underground stations. This has been accompanied by the introduction of extra on-street parking restrictions and [[controlled parking zone]]s in these areas, which affects local residents.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/17/transportintheuk.greaterlondonauthority |title=Road and rail promises leave commuters unmoved |first=Andrew |last=Clark |date=17 March 2003 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=6 January 2008 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429043312/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/17/transportintheuk.greaterlondonauthority |archivedate=29 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Road safety===\nTfL estimated that the charge has led to a small reduction in road traffic casualties against a background trend of improvement across London and across [[Reported Road Casualties Great Britain|the rest of Great Britain]] over the period.

[[Transport for London]] (TfL) is responsible for the charge which has been operated by [[IBM]] since 2009. During the first ten years since the introduction of the scheme, gross revenue reached about \u00a32.6&nbsp;billion up to the end of December 2013. From 2003 to 2013, about \u00a31.2&nbsp;billion has been invested in public transport, road and bridge improvement and walking and cycling schemes. Of these, a total of \u00a3960&nbsp;million was invested on improvements to the bus network.\n\n[[File:Space taken vs numbers in City of London (transport).png|300px|thumb|Numbers of people using different transport types in the City of London in 2017 against the road space used by that type.<ref>http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/documents/s91800/Appendix+1+-+Traffic+in+the+City+2018.pdf</ref>]]\nThe congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.<ref name=2014assessment>{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/cc-changes-march-2014/user_uploads/cc-impact-assessment.pdf |title=Public and stakeholder consultation on a Variation Order to modify the Congestion Charging scheme Impact Assessment |author=Transport for London (TfL) |publisher=TfL |date=January 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2015 |format=PDF}} ''See pp. 12: Traffic volume, speed and congestion.''</ref>\n\nThe Congestion Charge was suspended on 23 March 2020 for an indefinite period of time in order to facilitate travel around the city for critical workers during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus public health crisis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/coronavirus-transport-london-congestion-charge-suspended-ulez-lez-a9418356.html|title=TfL suspends congestion charge, ULEZ and LEZ amid coronavirus outbreak|date=2020-03-23|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n== Present scheme ==\n\n=== Boundary ===\n[[File:London Congestion Charge Zone since 2011.png|thumb|left|The boundary of the current Congestion Charging zone.]]\n{{Multiple image | direction = horizontal | align = right| image1 =London CC 12 2012 5045.JPG| width1 = 145\n| caption1 =Sign indicating the entrance of congestion charge area.| image2 = London CC 12 2012 5018b.jpg| width2 = 145\n| caption2 =Sign indicating the exit of congestion charge area.}}\nThe current congestion charge zone covers the area within the [[London Inner Ring Road]] which includes both the [[City of London]], which is the main financial district, and also the [[West End of London|West End]], which is London's primary commercial and entertainment centre.<ref name=\"What it is\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |title=Congestion Charging: in London \u2013 What it is |work=BBC News |year=2003 |accessdate=26 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412122132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/03/congestion_charge/exemptions_guide/html/what.stm |archivedate=12 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Although primarily a commercial area, there are also 136,000 residents, out of a total [[Greater London]] population of almost 9,000,000.

This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works in the latter half of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7109727.stm |title=Congestion charge 'not working' |date=23 February 2007 |work=BBC News   |accessdate=23 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429041334/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7109727.stm |archivedate=29 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.<ref name=\"bbc20070711\" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1454446/London-congestion-charge-not-working.html |title=London congestion charge 'not working' |first=Paul |last=Marston |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph News and Media Limited |date=16 February 2004 |accessdate=24 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nTfL reported in January 2014, that despite a reduction of traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.<ref name=2014assessment/>\n\n=== Air quality ===\nThe pre-commencement report from TfL noted that the scheme wasn't expected to significantly affect [[air quality]], but that offering a discount to encourage the use of greener fuels would be a positive measure.<ref name=\"tflprereport\" />\n\nTfL reported that levels of [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO<sub>X</sub>), fell by 13.4% between 2002 and 2003, and carbon dioxide, as well as the levels of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulates]] (PM10) within and alongside the [[Inner Ring Road, London|Inner Ring Road]] boundary of the zone.<ref name=\"tfljune2006\" />\n\nSince 2002, the [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>) produced by [[diesel exhaust]] has become a serious problem, with the [[London Air Quality Network]] of [[King's College London]] reporting that the annual mean NO<sub>2</sub> objective (of 40 \u03bcgm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006.

It notes that lower vehicles emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality as vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along industrial sources and that weather conditions play a significant role, and that pollutant concentrations were being affected by changes in the make up of the vehicle fleet.  It also suggests that the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.<ref name=\"tfljune2007\" />\n\nA 2011 independent study published by the [[Health Effects Institute]] (HEI), and led by a researcher from [[King's College London]], found that there is little evidence the congestion charge scheme has improved air quality.
