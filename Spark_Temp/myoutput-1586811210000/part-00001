Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

Board|Civilian Aeronautics Authority]] (CAA) established the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) with the intention of creating pilot training programs at U.S. colleges and universities.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> According to West Virginia State's Dr. Charles Ledbetter, only 20 African Americans in the U.S. were licensed as pilots at the time of the CPTP's establishment.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> On 11 September 1939, Davis received approval from the CAA to establish a CPTP at West Virginia State, which became the first African American college in the U.S. to do so.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> One of the college's CPTP instructors, Dr. Charles Byrd, noted that West Virginia State's CPTP \"played a part in the struggle to get African Americans accepted\" into the [[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC).<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/>\n\nWhen the USAAC admitted the first African Americans and organized the [[99th Flying Training Squadron]], two of the first five commissioned African American pilots were graduates from West Virginia State's CPTP: George Spencer Roberts, the first African American appointed to the USAAC, and Mac Ross.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH

through the CAA and the first female solo pilot in the CPTP nation-wide.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> Rolls and Joseph Greider, a West Virginia State music professor, later joined the West Virginia Civil Air Patrol, becoming the first African Americans in the state's air patrol.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> In the summer of 1940, West Virginia State became the first African American college to enroll white trainees into its CPTP, which served as a precedent for the [[Racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces|racial integration]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/> West Virginia State's CPTP was discontinued in 1942.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/>\n\n=== Army Specialized Training Program ===\n[[File:Astp-patch.gif|thumb|Insignia of the

read about the ASTP in newspapers and in ''School and Safety'', the [[American Council on Education]]'s weekly newsletter, and he sent a letter on 16 June 1943 to the ASTP Director, [[United States Army]] Colonel [[Herman Beukema]].<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> Beukema responded by stating that the ASTP was, \"utilizing the facilities of Howard University, [[Prairie View A&M University|Prairie View State College]], and [[North Carolina A&T State University|Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina]]. Inasmuch as the above institutions meet the present demand, based upon the number of Negro trainees available, we have no immediate need of any other institutions. It is planned that West Virginia State College will be given an Army Specialized Training Unit at the earliest possible date.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/>\n\nDavis was only made aware that West Virginia State was receiving an ASTP unit two weeks before ASTP personnel arrived on its campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> On 16 July 1943, Colonel W. G. Johnston of the [[Army Service Forces]]' Fifth Service Command called Davis to inform him, and two days later, Johnston confirmed the tentative number of ASTP trainees, arrival date, and basic engineering courses to be offered, and that a contract \"negotiating party\" would soon visit the campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> Within a week's time, West Virginia State reached agreements with the Fifth Service Command, and Davis commenced modifications to the college's Gore Hall, where most of the ASTP personnel were housed.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> On 22 July 1943, Davis wrote to Johnston, asking for him to increase the number of ASTP trainees from the expected 150 to 300, a figure which included 17-year-old ASTP reservists from West Virginia that were to be sent to other colleges for ASTP training.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> In this letter, Davis assured Johnston, \"the entire force of this college... is now busy preparing for the arrival of AST trainees.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/>\n\n=== Nonpartisan leadership style ===\nThroughout his tenure as president of West Virginia State, Davis was able to govern the college with a surprising degree of independence and political nonpartisanship, despite the college's proximity to the [[West Virginia State Capitol|state capitol]] in nearby [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]].<ref name=\"Bardolph 227-8\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|pp=227-8.}}</ref><ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=62.}}</ref> In a 1944 meeting of the West Virginia State faculty, Davis explained his disinterest in partisan politics: \"I have never felt it my duty to go and dabble in partisan politics. I hold the position that I have a unique place in the life of the state.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

University|Prairie View State College]], and [[North Carolina A&T State University|Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina]]. Inasmuch as the above institutions meet the present demand, based upon the number of Negro trainees available, we have no immediate need of any other institutions. It is planned that West Virginia State College will be given an Army Specialized Training Unit at the earliest possible date.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/>\n\nDavis was only made aware that West Virginia State was receiving an ASTP unit two weeks before ASTP personnel arrived on its campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> On 16 July 1943, Colonel W. G. Johnston of the [[Army Service Forces]]' Fifth Service Command called Davis to inform him, and two days later, Johnston confirmed the tentative number of ASTP trainees, arrival date, and basic engineering courses to be offered, and that a contract \"negotiating party\" would soon visit the campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> Within a week's time, West Virginia State reached agreements with the Fifth Service Command, and Davis commenced modifications to the college's Gore Hall, where most of the ASTP personnel were housed.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> On 22 July 1943, Davis wrote to Johnston, asking for him to increase the number of ASTP trainees from the expected 150 to 300, a figure which included 17-year-old ASTP reservists from West Virginia that were to be sent to other colleges for ASTP training.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> In this letter, Davis assured Johnston, \"the entire force of this college... is now busy preparing for the arrival of AST trainees.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/>\n\n=== Nonpartisan leadership style ===\nThroughout his tenure as president of West Virginia State, Davis was able to govern the college with a surprising degree of independence and political nonpartisanship, despite the college's proximity to the [[West Virginia State Capitol|state capitol]] in nearby [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]].<ref name=\"Bardolph 227-8\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|pp=227-8.}}</ref><ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=62.}}</ref> In a 1944 meeting of the West Virginia State faculty, Davis explained his disinterest in partisan politics: \"I have never felt it my duty to go and dabble in partisan politics. I hold the position that I have a unique place in the life of the state. You and I are to cooperate in guiding this school, that whatever party is in power, the success of the institution can be a credit to that party.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> However, Davis advocated the college's advancement in all matters in his correspondences with West Virginia state legislators and officials.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> He also leveraged his faculty as a resource for providing expertise and assistance to state politicians, regardless of their party.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> When a [[West Virginia Senate|West Virginia state senator]] expressed an interest in having German papers translated, Davis recommended a West Virginia State faculty member to perform this task, and he assured the senator that the professor would remain \"quiet\" about their assistance.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Davis believed that assistance provided by West Virginia State would be returned in the form of appropriations.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Author Gerald L. Smith cited Davis' nonpartisan leadership style as being an influence on Rufus B. Atwood, president of [[Kentucky State University|Kentucky State College]].<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Davis was also able to secure appropriations for the West Virginia State's buildings and equipment because the state's [[West Virginia Democratic Party|Democratic]] and [[West Virginia Republican Party|Republican]] parties both vied for African American votes.<ref name=\"Trent 1960 ChXI\"/>\n\n== Associated Publishers, Inc. ==\nIn June 1921, Davis and African American leaders including Carter G.
