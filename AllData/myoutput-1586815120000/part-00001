By 1934 Webern's [[Conductor (music)|conducting]] career, a major source of income for the composer, was practically over, and he earned his living by teaching composition to a few private pupils. Despite the considerable disadvantages this financial situation had, the lack of a stable job provided Webern with more time to compose.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\"/>\n\nOpus 27 took Webern about a year to complete. The three movements were not composed in the order they appear in the work:<ref>Dates from: Bailey 1991, 452.</ref>\n* Third movement: begun 14 October 1935, completed 8 July 1936\n* First movement: begun 22 July 1936, completed 19 August 1936\n* Second movement: begun 25 August 1936, completed 5 November 1936\nThe piece is the only work for piano solo that was published by the composer and assigned an opus number. It was also the last work by Webern to be published by [[Universal Edition]] during his lifetime.<ref>Bailey 1998, 152.</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n===Structure===\nAll three movements of the work are 12-tone pieces based on the following row (as found at the beginning of the second movement<ref name=\"Nolan\"/>):\n\n[[File:Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.png|thumb|center|550px|Principal forms of Webern's tone row from Variations for piano, op. 27, movement 2.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Nolan 1995, 49\u201350, though her 0 is G{{Music|sharp}}, and so she labels these two row forms P8 and I10.</ref> The first simultaneous pairing of row forms is P1 and R8, and as with the principal forms, each hexachord fills in a chromatic fourth, with B as the pivot (end of P1 and beginning of IR8), and thus linked by the prominent tritone in the center of the row {{audio|Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.mid|Play}}.<ref>Leeuw 2005, 158, for whom 0 = E{{Music|flat}}.</ref>]]\n\nThe work's title, ''Variations'', is ambiguous. In a letter dated 18 July, Webern wrote: \"The completed part is a variations movement; the whole will be a kind of 'Suite'\".<ref>Bailey 1991, 189.</ref> Only the third movement was completed at the time, and it is clearly [[Variation (music)|a set of variations]]. The form of the other two movements conforms to the \"[[Suite (music)|Suite]]\" plan: the first movement is a [[ternary form]], ABA, and the second is a [[binary form]]. However, to refer to an entire work by the form of its last movement is very unusual, and numerous attempts have been made to explain the title.<ref>Bailey 1991, 189&ndash;190.</ref>\n\nWebern scholar Kathryn Bailey outlined three possible views on the structure of the piece. Webern's Variations may be considered any of these:<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\">Bailey 1991, 190.</ref>\n# A three-movement sonata: [[sonata form]] &ndash; binary [[scherzo]] &ndash; variations\n# A three-movement suite: ternary movement &ndash; binary movement &ndash; variations\n# A set of variations, in which the first two movements have little connection to the third\n\nOne of the earliest explanations was offered by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], who in 1948 described the first movement as a theme and two variations, the second movement as a theme with a single variation, and the third movement as five variations of yet another theme.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\"/> Willi Reich, a member of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s circle, described the work as a sonatina which begins with a set of variations (first movement) and ends with a sonata form (third movement). Reich claimed his explanation was identical to Webern's and stemmed from the two men's conversations, however, the authenticity of this claim has been questioned.<ref>Bailey 1991, 191.</ref> \n\nYet another explanation was provided by Friedhelm D\u014dhl (who published Reich's analysis, but did not find it satisfactory), who viewed each of the fourteen phrases in the first movement as a variation of the prime/retrograde idea, and found the same structure in the second movement. Robert U. Nelson published a similar analysis in 1969.<ref>Nelson 1969.</ref> Finally, Kathryn Bailey's analysis suggests that the first movement is a sonata form, her ideas supported by Webern's own remarks in the original manuscript, published in 1979 by Peter Stadlen.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\">Bailey 1991, 192.</ref>\n\n===Symmetry===\nA particularly notable feature of Variations is [[symmetry]], which is featured throughout the work. Horizontal symmetry can be observed, for example, in successive phrases of the first movement: bars 1&ndash;18 comprise four phrases, each built from the normal row and its retrograde stated simultaneously, and the second half of the phrase is always a reverse of the first. Each phrase is therefore a [[palindrome]], though only the first pair of rows in the beginning of the movement is perfectly palindromic.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\"/> Vertical symmetry pervades the second movement, which is a [[Canon (music)|canon]]. The pitches are arranged around the pitch axis of A4. Each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction.<ref>Bailey 1991, 262&ndash;264.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bailey, Kathryn. 1998.
