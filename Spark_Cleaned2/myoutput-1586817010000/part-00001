{"title_page": "Nazas River", "text_new": "{{short description|River in Mexico}}\n[[File:PRESA FRANCISCO ZARCO.jpg|thumb|300px]]\n\nThe '''Nazas River''' is a [[river]] located in northern [[Mexico]], in territory of the states of [[Coahuila]] and [[Durango]]. It is part of the [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Bols\u00f3n de Mapim\u00ed]]. It is only {{convert|560|km|mi}} long, but irrigates an area of {{convert|71906|sqkm|sqmi}} in the middle of the desert. The Nazas is also nurtured by the San Juan, Ramos, Potreritos, del Oro, Nazas, Santiago, [[Tepehuanes River|Tepehuanes]] and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n Blanco rivers. The river starts at the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. The aboriginal title for this stream is ''Tlahualilo'', coming from the [[Nahuatl]] words ''tlalli'' meaning \"fertile land\" and ''ahualila'', meaning \"water for irrigation\".\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Nazas took its name when the [[Spanish Empire|Spaniards]], during the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of Mexico]] in the early 1500s, saw the original inhabitants on the shore of the river fishing with some artifacts similar to baskets, whose Spanish name is 'nasa', for that reason it became known as the 'river of nazas'.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe Nazas watershed contains considerable desertic habitat, outside of the immediate [[riparian zone]]. A large variety of flora and fauna populate the Nazas Basin, with a variety of succulent native plants. One of the widespread flora is the [[ocotillo]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009</ref> A number of freshwater fishes are found in the Nazas River, including ''[[Notropis nazas]]''.<ref>Seth Eugene Meek. 1904</ref>\n\n==Geography and economy==\nThe river acts as a geographic division between the cities of [[G\u00f3mez Palacio, Durango|G\u00f3mez Palacio]] in Durango and [[Torre\u00f3n]] in Coahuila. The city of Torre\u00f3n is named after a tower that was built in the area to monitor the water level of the Nazas from afar.<ref>[http://www.torreon.gob.mx/english/the_city/turism/alrededores/rionazas_english.php ''Torreon'']</ref>\n\nThe Nazas has served as one of the most important natural resources enabling development in the [[Comarca Lagunera|Laguna Region]] since the middle of the 19th century. All of its waters are locked in Francisco Zarco and L\u00e1zaro Cardenas dams, both located in Durango, which have significantly reduced the once mighty flow of the river. However, Coahuila receives an annual share by mutual agreement between the state governments. Indeed, on its course, the Nazas fills smaller water bodies like the Palmito dam (in Torre\u00f3n) and the Santiaguillo lagoons. The river ends in the now-drained Mayr\u00e1n Lagoon and the Caim\u00e1n Lakes in the Tlahualilo region.\n\nThe river was an important shooting location for the film ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). In the celebrated scene where a bridge is dynamited, the Nazas stands in for the [[Rio Grande]].\n\nThere is an amateur annual [[kayak]] competition on the Nazas River between the cities of [[Rodeo, Durango|Rodeo]] and [[Lerdo, Durango|Lerdo]] in Durango.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of longest rivers of Mexico]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Hogan, C.
