Within the game, death is final and frequently risked; an early priority is establishing a family, which permits the player to continue as the [[samurai]]'s heir in the event of death or retirement. In the first two sections of the game, the player rises from a minor [[gokenin|retainer]] to a more powerful [[hatamoto|lieutenant]] and then to [[daimy\u014d]] over his entire [[Japanese clans|clan]]. At each of these levels, he competes to curry favor from his lord with three computer-controlled rivals who also seek to become first in favor and next in succession. Each samurai has several properties, including land holdings, army size, sword-fighting ability, and generalship. In keeping with the [[Bushid\u014d]] theme of the game, army size and  honor have the greatest influence over how the samurai are ranked.\n\nA wide array of dishonorable actions are also possible. The player (and AI controlled characters) may kidnap and rescue family members, dishonor other samurai, or even assassinate their rivals or lord. Naturally, such behavior carries serious risk. The samurai performs these acts personally and risks capture or death. At minimum, exposure entails loss of honor and land and more serious offenses require ritual suicide ([[seppuku]]); a failed attempt on the life of the samurai's lord occasions the [[three exterminations|extermination of his entire family]], losing the game.\n\nAfter becoming a [[daimy\u014d]], the game shifts to a wargame format, with the goal of conquering enough provinces to claim the title of [[sh\u014dgun]]. The player no longer wanders personally through a provincial map but directs his army through the three lower [[Japanese islands]]. He is able to direct his underlings to deal with any sword fight or melee minigames without loss of honor: the focus is on the size of the player's army and mastery of the battlefield tactics.\n\nAfter winning the game, the player is given a final summary of the future of his dynasty. Depending on various factors such as the victor's honor and the presence of an adult heir, the length of the [[Shogun#Heian period .28794.E2.80.931185.29|dynasty]] could range from hundreds of years (like the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]) to a quick dissolution after the sh\u014dgun's death (as occurred with [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]).\n\n==Development==\nMicroProse designers Sid Arnold and Lawrence Schick began development of ''Sword of the Samurai'' in late 1987, after the success of the company's first role-playing adventure game ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates!]]''. They chose to set it during the [[Sengoku period]] because the era's chaos made it possible for samurai to gain great power regardless of background, and gave players the goal of uniting the country and becoming sh\u014dgun.
