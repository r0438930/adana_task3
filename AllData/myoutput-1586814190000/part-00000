The town was put together in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[new town]] on previously industrial and agricultural land and smaller towns. Like other [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] of the era, Telford was created from the merger of other, smaller settlements, most notably the towns of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Dawley]]. Many of the New Town's newer inhabitants were originally from [[Birmingham]] or [[Wolverhampton]].\n\n[[Telford Shopping Centre]], a modern shopping mall, was constructed at the new town's geographical centre, along with an extensive [[Telford Town Park|Town Park]]. The [[M54 motorway]] was completed in 1983, improving the town's road links with the [[West Midlands conurbation]].\n\nOn Telford's southern boundaries is the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a scenic tourist destination and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The town advertises itself as \"The Birthplace of Industry\", due to it having [[Coalbrookdale]] and other places in the Ironbridge Gorge area, within its boundary.  These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield. Its influence was greatly used to further Birmingham\u2019s industry through innovations as well.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]\nEarly settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Wrockwardine]] and [[Lilleshall]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nFrom the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], where [[Wenlock Priory]] founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area's economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area, and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18062|title=History of Telford|work=British History Online|accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe area was also the site of the 1821 [[Cinderloo Uprising]] which saw 3,000 people protest the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disturbances near Wellington |work=Salopian Journal |date=7 February 1821}}</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:TelfordBeatties.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Beatties]] department store at the west end of [[Telford Shopping Centre]], which was renamed [[House of Fraser]] in early 2007.]]\n[[File:Telford Town Centre .jpg|thumb|Northfield Street Telford Centre]]\n[[File:TelfordPlaza.JPG|thumb|right|Telford Plaza in Telford Town Centre.]]\nThe New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 as '''Dawley New Town''', covering {{convert|9100|acre|km2}} of [[Dawley]], [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington Rural District (Shropshire)|Wellington Rural District]] and [[Shifnal Rural District]].<ref>''London Gazette''. 18 January 1963.</ref> Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new [[Sutton Hill]] housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based [[John Madin Design Group]].\n\nThe Minister proposed an extension of {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} in 1968 (taking in the historic area of [[Ironbridge Gorge]]), which saw objections and a public inquiry take place{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.  The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|km2}} of \"land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington\".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> This Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] who, in 1787, became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.\n\nMost of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region.\n\nIn 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries,<ref>{{cite news|title=30 years on - how opening of M54 brought new dawn for Shropshire|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/11/25/30-years-on/|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Shropshire Star|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> the [[M54 motorway]] was completed, connecting the town to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and thence the rest of the UK's motorway network. Other major roads are the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]], [[A518 road|A518]] and [[A442 road|A442]], which is commonly known as the Eastern Primary or ''EP'', and is officially branded ''Queensway''.\n\nMany of the new town's residents were originally from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[conurbation]], which includes [[Wolverhampton]], Birmingham, [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]]. The vast majority of the [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner city Birmingham. Some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] or [[Dawley]]) and often citing the existence of Town Councils as support for the argument \"you can't live in a town in a town,\" e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town's residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname \"overspill\" from people living in the existing towns and villages.\n\nIn 2007, a \u00a3250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which will include the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre, and the creation of new caf\u00e9s, bars and shops which will lead to 1,750 new jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7053156.stm|title=BBC Shropshire \u2013 Redevelopment scheme unveiled|accessdate=19 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> The reason for this expansion is that the original \"centre\" was only ever a shopping place with no real heart.

These are used for electoral purposes and demographic surveys. Telford was created politically \u2013 but its attempts to make a cohesive town from the fusion of other independent, smaller towns: [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]], [[Oakengates]], [[Dawley]], [[Ironbridge]] and [[Donnington, Telford|Donnington]] have largely been successful. Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of [[Ironbridge]] and [[Broseley]], while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by [[Shropshire Council]].\n\nTelford is the only settlement within the [[Telford (UK Parliament constituency)|Telford parliamentary constituency]], which was held by [[Labour Party UK|Labour]] from its creation in 1997 until the 2015 General Election. The current MP is [[Lucy Allan (politician)|Lucy Allan]] (Conservative). Some suburbs, such as Wellington, are located in [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]], which also has varying support between the [[Conservative Party UK|Conservatives]] and Labour.  Conservative [[Mark Pritchard (politician)|Mark Pritchard]] was reelected as MP in 2015.

By 1968 Telford was intended to take an additional 50,000 and grow to a town of 220,000 or more by 1991. By 1983, however, Telford's population was just under 108,000, and it was generally thought that it might not reach 120,000 by the late 1980s.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nTelford has a younger than average population, and a higher rate of teenage pregnancy than the national average, as well as relatively high levels of income deprivation with 15% of residents living in low income households.

Other large estates followed, in 1973 with '''Stafford Park''' just east of the [[Telford Town Centre|town centre]] and in 1979 with '''Hortonwood''', to the north, helping ease the unemployment crisis in a decade which saw an almost unbroken rise in unemployment.\n\nIn total, half a million square metres of factory space were provided between 1968 and 1983, making Telford an attractive investment area.<ref>Private inf.; Thomas, 'Telford', 36-7; Fenter, 'Bldg.

However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster.

These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield. Its influence was greatly used to further Birmingham\u2019s industry through innovations as well.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]\nEarly settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Wrockwardine]] and [[Lilleshall]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nFrom the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], where [[Wenlock Priory]] founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area's economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area, and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18062|title=History of Telford|work=British History Online|accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe area was also the site of the 1821 [[Cinderloo Uprising]] which saw 3,000 people protest the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disturbances near Wellington |work=Salopian Journal |date=7 February 1821}}</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:TelfordBeatties.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Beatties]] department store at the west end of [[Telford Shopping Centre]], which was renamed [[House of Fraser]] in early 2007.]]\n[[File:Telford Town Centre .jpg|thumb|Northfield Street Telford Centre]]\n[[File:TelfordPlaza.JPG|thumb|right|Telford Plaza in Telford Town Centre.]]\nThe New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 as '''Dawley New Town''', covering {{convert|9100|acre|km2}} of [[Dawley]], [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington Rural District (Shropshire)|Wellington Rural District]] and [[Shifnal Rural District]].<ref>''London Gazette''. 18 January 1963.</ref> Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new [[Sutton Hill]] housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based [[John Madin Design Group]].\n\nThe Minister proposed an extension of {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} in 1968 (taking in the historic area of [[Ironbridge Gorge]]), which saw objections and a public inquiry take place{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.  The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|km2}} of \"land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington\".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> This Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] who, in 1787, became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.\n\nMost of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region.\n\nIn 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries,<ref>{{cite news|title=30 years on - how opening of M54 brought new dawn for Shropshire|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/11/25/30-years-on/|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Shropshire Star|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> the [[M54 motorway]] was completed, connecting the town to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and thence the rest of the UK's motorway network.

The vast majority of the [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner city Birmingham. Some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] or [[Dawley]]) and often citing the existence of Town Councils as support for the argument \"you can't live in a town in a town,\" e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town's residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname \"overspill\" from people living in the existing towns and villages.\n\nIn 2007, a \u00a3250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which will include the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre, and the creation of new caf\u00e9s, bars and shops which will lead to 1,750 new jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7053156.stm|title=BBC Shropshire \u2013 Redevelopment scheme unveiled|accessdate=19 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> The reason for this expansion is that the original \"centre\" was only ever a shopping place with no real heart.

Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of [[Ironbridge]] and [[Broseley]], while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by [[Shropshire Council]].\n\nTelford is the only settlement within the [[Telford (UK Parliament constituency)|Telford parliamentary constituency]], which was held by [[Labour Party UK|Labour]] from its creation in 1997 until the 2015 General Election. The current MP is [[Lucy Allan (politician)|Lucy Allan]] (Conservative).
