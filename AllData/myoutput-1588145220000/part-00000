The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the [[Tahara plant]] in [[Tahara, Aichi]], while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in [[Toyota, Aichi|Toyota City]]. The fifth generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the [[BMW Z4 (G29)|G29 BMW Z4]] in [[Graz, Austria]] by [[Magna Steyr]].\n\nThe Supra also traces much of its roots back to the [[Toyota 2000GT|2000GT]] owing to an [[inline-6]] layout. The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the [[Toyota Crown|Crown]]'s and 2000GT's [[Toyota M engine|M engine]]. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code \"A\".\n\nAlong with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. (The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what color it was. It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it too was discontinued.){{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth generation of the Supra in the United States,<ref name=\"OSS\"/> production of the fourth generation of the Supra ended in 2002.\n\nIn January 2019, the fifth generation of the Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 Z4,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.motor1.com/news/236633/supra-z4-magna-steyr-production/ |title=Toyota Supra And BMW Z4 Could Be Built Together By Magna Steyr |work=Motor1 |date=20 March 2018 |access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> was introduced.\n\n== {{anchor|A40|A50}} First generation (A40/A50) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (A40/A50)\n| image = Toyota Supra (2492707827).jpg\n| caption = Toyota Celica Supra (MA47)\n| aka = {{unbulleted list\n  | Toyota Celica XX (Japan)\n  | Toyota Celica Supra\n  }}\n| production = April 1978 \u2013 June 1981<ref name=\"parts catalogue 1977\u20131981\"/>\n| assembly = Japan: [[Tahara, Aichi]] ([[Tahara plant]])<ref name=\"tahara\">{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/production/production/japan/general_status/tahara.html |title=75 Years of Toyota {{!}} General Status of Plants in Japan {{!}} Tahara Plant |year=2012 |access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n| related = {{unbulleted list\n  | [[Toyota Carina#A40|Toyota Carina (A40)]]\n  | [[Toyota Celica#A40|Toyota Celica (A40)]]\n  }}\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#M|M-EU]]'' [[I6 engine|I6]] \n  | {{convert|2563|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#4M|4M-E]]'' I6 \n  | {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#5M|5M-E]]'' I6 \n  }}\n| powerout = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|92|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.0 L)\n  | {{convert|82|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.6 L)\n  | {{convert|87|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.8 L)\n  }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list\n  | 5-speed ''[[Toyota W transmission#W50|W50]]'' [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n  | 4-speed ''[[Toyota A transmission#A40D|A40D]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  | 4-speed ''[[Toyota A transmission#A43D|A43D]]'' automatic\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2629|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4615|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1651|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1290|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1270|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe first generation of the Supra was based largely upon the Toyota Celica [[liftback]], but was longer by {{convert|129.5|mm|in||abbr=on}}. The doors and rear section were shared with the Celica but the front panels were elongated to accommodate the [[Inline-6]] instead of the Celica's [[Inline-4|4-cylinder]] engine. Toyota's original plan for the Supra at this time was to make it a competitor to the very popular [[Datsun]] (now [[Nissan]]) [[Nissan Z-car|Z-car]].\n\n=== 1978 ===\nIn April 1978, Toyota began production of the Supra in Japan, as the Celica XX, and sold it alongside the Celica at Japanese dealership sales channels called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Corolla Store]]''\n\nThe Supra was offered with a {{convert|92|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} 2.0&nbsp;L 12-valve SOHC inline-6 engine ([[Toyota M engine#M|M-EU]], chassis code MA45) or the {{convert|82|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} {{convert|2563|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} 12-valve [[SOHC]] inline-6 engine ([[Toyota M engine#4M|4M-E]], chassis code MA46). The Japanese model was equipped with the smaller 2.0&nbsp;L engine so that buyers would not incur an additional tax under [[Vehicle size class#Japan|vehicle size and engine displacement regulations]].

Both transmissions featured an [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gear. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive gear whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The drive train for the Supra retained the T series [[solid axle|solid rear axle]] configuration of the Celica in the Japanese MA45 version and a larger F series (and optional [[Limited Slip Differential]]) in the MA46 and MA47. The car also came standard with 4-wheel [[disc brakes]] and featured a [[Multi-link suspension|four-link]] rear suspension with coil springs, lateral [[track bar]], and [[sway bar|stabilizer bar]]. The front suspension consisted of [[MacPherson strut]]s and a stabilizer bar.\n\nThe interior of the Supra had optional [[power windows]] and [[power locks]] as part of the convenience package. The convenience package also included [[cruise control]] and special door trim with door pull straps with an optional [[sunroof]]. As for standard features, in the centre console there was an extendable map light and a flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets on the backs of the front seats, and a [[tonneau cover]] under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art [[AM radio|AM]]/[[FM radio|FM]]/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.\n\n=== 1979 ===\nThe mid 1979, changes for the 1980 model year US model were mostly cosmetic. The interior received a redesigned center console and a digital quartz clock. On the exterior were redesigned side view mirrors and 14x5{{frac|1|2}} inch aluminum wheels were standard (the previous year had steel wheels with plastic wheel covers as standard and the aluminum wheels were optional). In addition, body molded mudflaps became available. On cars finished in copper metallic and white, the mudflaps were painted the body colour while the mudflaps were left black on all other colours. On the rear of the mudflaps, the word \"Celica\" was painted in white lettering.<ref name=\"csMKI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.celicasupra.com/historymki.htm |publisher=celicasupra.com |title=MK I Celica Supra History |accessdate=22 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207020926/http://www.celicasupra.com/historymki.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=7 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe official Supra site<ref name=\"OSS\"/> also notes that there was an addition of optional leather-trimmed seating and automatic climate-control.\n\n=== 1980 ===\n[[File:Perf pack for wiki.jpg|thumb|1981 Supra with Sports Performance Package (MA47, US)]]\n\nIn August 1980 (for the 1981 model year), the Supra received an upgrade in displacement with the {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} [[Toyota M engine#5M|5M-E]] engine.

The car's automatic transmission was changed to the revised Toyota [[Toyota A transmission#A43D|A43D]] and it gained a revised final drive gearing. Because of the change in engine and transmission a new chassis code of MA47 was given to the 1981 model. Performance figures for this model include a 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) acceleration time of 10.24 seconds and a 1/4-mile time of 17.5 seconds at a speed of {{convert|77.7|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"mtsvs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.celicasupra.com/images/MT2-82-3.jpg |work=Supra vs. Supra |title=1981 Toyota Celica Supra Road Test Data & Specifications |accessdate=22 December 2006 |format=JPG |date=February 1982 |page=46 |publisher=[[Motor Trend]]}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1980 (for the 1981 model year), a new Sports Performance Package became an option, which included sport suspension, raised white letter tyres, and front and rear spoilers.

It was offered in Japan during the years 1978\u20131981, and was redesigned in 1981. Toyota obtained engineering assistance from [[Lotus Cars]], and supplied some components for use in the [[Lotus Excel]]. The Supra was sold as the Celica XX only in Japan at Japanese dealership sales channels called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Corolla Store]]''. In worldwide markets, it was sold as the Celica Supra.\n\nThe 2000GT was the flagship model of the XX range. Featuring the smaller 2.0-litre six-cylinder DOHC 24-valve [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]], Yamaha took the base [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]] and improved it, resulting in the [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] significantly increasing the power output of the engine, this engine was also used in the 1985 [[Toyota Soarer|Soarer]]. The smaller-capacity meant that [[Road tax#Japan|road taxes]] were less than that of the 2800GT. [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] has a power output of {{convert|118|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 6,400&nbsp;rpm.\n\nThe 2800GT was the most powerful of the range, featuring the 2.8-litre six-cylinder DOHC 5M-GEU engine which has a power output of {{convert|129|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,600&nbsp;rpm.\nThe 2000G/S has the M-TEU engine, which has a power output of {{convert|118|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm, as much as the [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]], but has more torque lower down the rev range, {{cvt|230|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,000 rpm. The lower-range models, being 2000G/S, were the least powerful, featuring the [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]], which has a power output of {{convert|92|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm. They also lacked a lot of features found on other models in an effort to lower cost.\n\nIn 1981, the Celica XX introduced the world's first navigation computer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/products_technology/technology_development/electronics_parts/index.html |title=Technical Development Electronics Parts |publisher=Toyota Motor Corporation |year=2012 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|A60}} Second generation (A60) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation (A60)\n| image = 2nd-Toyota-Supra.jpg\n| caption = Toyota Supra P-Type (MA67)\n| aka = {{unbulleted list\n  | Toyota Celica XX (Japan)\n  | Toyota Celica Supra\n  }}\n| production = July 1981 \u2013 December 1985<ref name=\"A60-intro\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.toyota.co.uk/history-of-the-toyota-supra |title=History of the Toyota Supra |publisher=Toyota |location=UK |date=15 September 2018 |access-date=15 September 2018}}</ref>\n| assembly = Japan: [[Tahara, Aichi]] ([[Tahara plant]])<ref name=\"tahara\"/>\n| related = {{unbulleted list\n  | [[Toyota Carina#A60|Toyota Carina (A60)]]\n  | [[Toyota Celica#A60|Toyota Celica (A60)]]\n  }}\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]]'' I6 \n  | {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]]'' I6 \n  | {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#M-TEU|M-TEU]]'' [[turbocharged]] I6\n  | {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''5M-E'' I6 \n  | {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#5M-GE|5M-GE]]'' I6 \n  }}\n| powerout = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|93|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.0 L, ''1G-EU'')\n  | {{convert|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.0 L, ''1G-GEU'')\n  | {{convert|108|\u2013|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.0 L, ''M-TEU'')\n  | {{convert|104|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.8 L, ''5M-E'')\n  | {{convert|108|\u2013|133|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.8 L, ''5M-GE'')\n  }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list\n  | 5-speed ''[[Toyota W transmission#W55|W55]]'' manual\n  | 5-speed ''[[Toyota W transmission#W57|W57]]'' manual\n  | 5-speed ''[[Toyota W transmission#W58|W58]]'' manual\n  | 4-speed ''[[Toyota A transmission#A43DL|A43DL]]'' automatic\n  | 4-speed ''[[Toyota A transmission#A43DE|A43DE]]'' automatic\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2614|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4661|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n  | {{convert|1720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (2.8 L)\n  }}\n| height = {{convert|1321|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1361|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn mid 1981, Toyota completely redesigned the Celica Supra as well as the entire Celica lineup for the 1982 model year. In Japan, they were known as the Celica XX, but the Celica Supra name was used for the world market. Still based on the Celica platform, there were several key differences, most notably the design of the front end and fully retractable pop-up headlights. Other differences were the inline-six rather than four-cylinder engine, as well as an increase in length and wheelbase to accommodate the larger engine. Cars installed with the [[Toyota M engine#5M|5M]] engine were slightly wider, while other models remained compliant with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese dimension regulations]].\n\nIn 1981, Japanese buyers were offered an alternative to the Celica XX fastback bodystyle, called the [[Toyota Soarer|Soarer]] coup\u00e9, which was offered at a different Japanese Toyota dealership network called the ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]'', as the Celica XX was sold at the ''Toyota Corolla Store''. The four-door performance saloon called the Celica Camry was realigned with the Japanese market [[Toyota Chaser|Chaser]], while in North America the [[Toyota Cressida|Cressida]] took on that role.\n\n=== L-type and P-type ===\nIn the North American market, the Celica Supra was available in two distinct models. There was the \"Performance Type\" (P-type) and the \"Luxury Type\" (L-type). While being mechanically identical, they were differentiated by the available options; tire size, wheel size, and body trim. The P-type had fiberglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type did not get the option of a leather interior until 1983. Initially, Luxury Type ment Automatic transmission, and Performance Type stood for Manual. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6. The L-type also had the option of a digital instrument cluster with a [[trip computer]]; some Canadian models (both L-types and P-types) had this option as well as a few rare instances of American models. The L-type cluster was easily distinguished from the P-type cluster, by the 'ECT' function written on the dial plate. The digital cluster featured a digital tachometer, digital speedometer, and electronic fuel level and coolant level gauges. The trip computer could calculate and display various things such as [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in miles-per-gallon, [[estimated time of arrival]] (ETA), and distance remaining to destination. Supras with trip computers also came with cruise control. Excluding the 1982 model, all P-types were available with headlight washers as an option, but the L-types were never given such an option. Although gear ratios changed throughout the years, all P-types came standard with a [[limited slip differential]].\n\n=== 1982 ===\n[[File:Toyota Supra outside pub 1982.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Toyota Supra 2.8i L-Type (MA61)]]\n\nFor 1982, in the North American market, the Celica Supra's engine was the {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} 12-valve (two valves per cylinder) [[DOHC]] [[Toyota M engine#5M-GE|5M-GE]]. Power output was {{convert|108|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} SAE net and {{convert|155|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine used an 8.8:1 compression ratio to achieve the power and featured a vacuum advanced distributor. When the car debuted, it had a {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.348}}, a {{convert|0-60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration time of 9.8 seconds and a {{convert|1/4|mile|m|round=25|order=flip|abbr=in}} time of 17.2-seconds at {{convert|80|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"cd1081\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfmodelaclub.org/user/Car%20and%20Driver%20Oct%2081.pdf |work=Toyota Celica Supra |title=1982 Toyota Celica Specifications |accessdate=22 December 2006 |date=October 1981 |page=42 |publisher=[[Car and Driver]]}}</ref>\n\nThe standard transmission for this year was the [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] 5-speed manual with the [[Toyota A transmission#A43DL|A43DL]] 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions had an [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gear and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission had an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The 1982 model's rear differential had a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and had variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.\n\nOn the interior, this generation had standard power windows, power door locks, and power mirrors as well as a tilt steering wheel. The power door lock was located in the center console next to the power mirror control. The analog dash of this model only showed a top speed of {{convert|88|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in North America. The optional automatic climate control was renovated and was now seen as a standard feature on the A60. Cruise control and a retractable map light was standard in this generation. Some options included the addition of a sunroof, two-tone paint schemes, and a five-speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner with a cassette player (Fujitsu Ten Limited). The optional cassette stereo had a 105-watt power amplifier and a seven-band graphic equalizer. The standard stereo was a five-channel AM/FM/MPX tuner. Leather interior was an option on the L-type model, but the P-type models limited to standard striped cloth interior.\n\nThe AM/FM antenna was integrated into the front windshield rather than a typical external mast antenna. There was a key lock on the gas tank door (in lieu of a remote release) and the hatch and rear bumper were black regardless of exterior colour on the rest of the car. The P-type was available with an optional rear window visor above the hatch glass. The tail lights had a reverse light in the centre and the door handles opened the doors by pulling sideways. The front nose badge and B-pillar only read \"Supra\" for the first several months of production, but were changed to read \"Celica Supra\" midway through the model year. The L-type had front and rear mudflaps but P-type of this year did not.\n\n=== 1983 ===\nFor the 1983 model year, not much was altered, but there was an increase in power output to {{convert|112|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|159|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque from the same ''[[Toyota M engine#5M-GE|5M-GE]]'' engine. The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the [[Toyota A transmission#A43DL|A43DL]] 4-speed with a newly designed [[Toyota A transmission#A43DE|A43DE]] 4-speed. It had an electronic controller that would adjust its shift pattern for a balance between performance and economy. It was the first in the industry to provide an electronically controlled transmission (ECT). This allowed the driver to choose either the \"power\" driving mode or \"normal\" driving mode at the touch of the button. The power mode provided the quickest acceleration and the normal mode provided the best all-around performance.\n\nThe interior virtually had no changes, but changes to the exterior included a switch to a power mast antenna, mudflaps on all models, and the addition of headlight washers on the P-type. All B-pillar and nose badges for cars sold in North America read \"Celica Supra\" and only the P-type was available in two-tone colour schemes.\n\n=== 1984 ===\n[[File:1984 Toyota Supra, front left (P-type).jpg|thumb|1984 Toyota Supra 2.8 P-Type (MA67)]]\n\nChanges for the 1984 model year were significant. Power output was increased on the 5-speed models to {{convert|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|163|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The increase was achieved by a mixture of a redesigned intake manifold with \"D\"-shaped intake runners and an increase in compression ratio to: 9.2:1.<ref name=\"supfaq\"/> Another notable change in the 5-speed models was the switch to a 4.30:1 gear ratio in the rear differential. All automatic models retained the previous years power statistics, but the rear gear ratio was changed to 4.10:1.\n\nThe most notable exterior changes included the switch to wraparound front turn signals, the option of either a rear wing spoiler mounted high up on the rear hatch, or rear window and quarter window louvers. Also, the tail-lights were redesigned and the hatch received a billboard \"Supra\" sticker instead of the smaller sticker, which was previously positioned on the right. The rear hatch and bumper was changed and received the same colour as the rest of the car (instead of the black of previous years). The door handles were also switched, opening by pulling up instead of sideways. Two-tone paint schemes also became available on both the P-type and L-type models.\n\nSome interior controls such as the steering wheel, cruise control, and door lock switch were redesigned. Toyota included a {{convert|130|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} speedometer in North American models instead of the traditional 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) speedometer and the automatic climate control display was also changed. The previous year's cassette and equalizer stereo option was now made a standard feature.\n\n=== 1985\u20131986 ===\n[[File:1986 Toyota Supra (MA67, US), rear right.jpg|thumb|left|1986 Toyota Supra 2.8 with the third brake light (MA67)]]\n\nThe Supra was redesigned again in 1985. On the engine side, power output was increased to {{convert|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|169|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. All models of this year had the same amount of power (both automatic models and 5-speed models). The engine received a redesigned [[throttle position sensor]] (TPS) as well as a new [[exhaust gas recirculation|EGR]] system and knock sensor. With the slight increase in power the Supra was able to propel itself from 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 8.4 seconds and netted a 16.1 second quarter-mile at {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"cd85\">{{cite web |url=http://www.celicasupra.com/images/CD5-85-7.jpg |work=Having it All |title=Car and Driver test results |accessdate=22 December 2006 |format=JPG |date=May 1985 |page=74 |publisher=[[Car and Driver]]}}</ref>\n\nOther changes would be a redesigned, more integrated sunshade and spoiler on the rear hatch. The rear spoiler was changed from a one-piece to a two-piece. The L-types of this year were not available with a leather interior, but P-types were. Toyota added a standard factory theft deterrent system and the outside mirrors were equipped with a defogger that activated with the rear defroster. All Supras this year received automatic-off lights that also encompassed an automatic illuminated entry and fade-out system.\n\nWhile 1985 was to be the last year of production of the second generation model, delays in production of the third generation model led to a surplus of second generation models. During the first half of 1986 the 1985 P-type was still offered for sale, with only minor cosmetic changes as well as the addition of a now mandatory rear-mounted third brake light on the hatch. These were all labelled officially as 1986 models. The P-type were the only model available for the 1986 model year. Production for the A60 Supra ended in December 1985 in order to make way for the upcoming A70 Supra.\n\n=== Markets ===\n[[File:Toyota-CelicaXX2800GT.JPG|thumb|1982-1983 Toyota Celica XX 2800GT (MA61)]]\n[[File:1983-1986 Toyota Celica XX 2000GT.jpg|thumb|1983&ndash;1986 Toyota Celica XX 2000GT Twin Cam 24 (GA61)]]\n\nThe second generation of the Supra came in a variety of options around the world as well as only being offered during select years.\n\n==== Japan ====\nFrom August 1982 to 1983, the Celica XX, as it was named in Japan, had [[Wing mirror|fender mirrors]] and came in four models depending on the engine:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://global.toyota/en/detail/7732349|title=TOYOTA announces new Celica XX with high performance twin cam, 24-valve engine|last=|first=|date=17 August 1982|work=|access-date=|publisher=Toyota Motor Corp.}}</ref>\n\n* 2800GT Twin Cam: {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} DOHC ''[[Toyota M engine#5M-GE|5M-GEU]]'' {{convert|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|150|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n* 2000GT Twin Cam 24: {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} DOHC ''[[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]]'' {{convert|118|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|134|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n* 2000 Turbo: {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} DOHC turbocharged ''[[Toyota M engine#M-TEU|M-TEU]]'' {{convert|108|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|156|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n* 2000: {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} SOHC ''[[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]]'' {{convert|93|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|126|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nFrom August 1983 to 1986, the Celica XX had door-mounted mirrors and the same four engines options but with performances improvements.

The Celica changed to a front-wheel drive layout, using the [[List of Toyota platforms|Toyota \"T\" platform]] associated with the [[Toyota Corona|Corona]], while the Supra kept its rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine was updated to a more powerful {{convert|2954|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} [[inline-six engine]] rated at {{convert|149|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}. Although initially only available with [[naturally aspirated engine]]s, a turbocharged version was added in the 1987 model year. The Supra was now mechanically related to the Soarer for the Japanese market.\n\nAll Japanese market models with the various versions of the 2.0 L engine were slightly narrower overall so as to be in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] so that Japanese buyers weren't liable for yearly taxes for driving a larger car.\n\n[[File:1986 Toyota Supra (MA70) liftback (2015-07-14) 02.jpg|thumb|left|1986 Supra (MA70; rear view)]]\n\nThe new engine used in the A70 Supra, the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|Toyota 7M-GE]], was the flagship engine of Toyota's arsenal. Both versions of the engine contained 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead cams. The [[turbocharged]] [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTE]] engine was Toyota's first distributor-less engine offered in the US which used coil packs sitting on the cam covers and a cam position sensor driven by the exhaust camshaft.<ref name=\"mk3man\">{{cite web |url=http://www.importworkshop.com/files/manuals/toyota/MK3_1990_Toyota_Supra.pdf |work=Toyota A70 Supra: Factory Service Manual |title=FSM |accessdate=11 January 2008 |format=PDF |year=1990}}</ref> It was equipped with a CT26 turbocharger and was rated at {{convert|172|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,600 rpm while the naturally aspirated [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|7M-GE]] engine was rated at {{convert|149|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 6,000 rpm. Further refinement on the turbo model increased power to {{convert|173|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|254|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3,200 rpm in 1989. This was mostly due to a redesign of the wastegate. All models used the same tyre size of 225/50R16 on 16x7 inch wheels. Spare tyres were full-sized but on steel wheels.\n\nThe naturally aspirated model came standard with the [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] manual transmission. The turbocharged models included the [[Toyota R transmission#R154|R154]] manual transmission. Both were available with the optional 4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic transmission.\n\n{{anchor|TEMS|Toyota Electronically Modulated Suspension}}\n\nThe third-generation of the Supra represented an arsenal of new technology. In 1986, options available for the Supra included a 3-channel [[antilock braking system|ABS]] and [[Toyota TEMS|TEMS]] which gave the driver two settings which affected the damper rates; a third was automatically activated at [[wide open throttle]], hard braking and high speed maneuvering.\n\nACIS ([[Acoustic Control Induction System]]), a method of controlling air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was also a part of the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|7M-GE]]'s technological arsenal. All models were fitted with double [[wishbone suspension]] front and rear. A targa top was offered in all model years along with a metal power sliding sunroof (added in 1991).\n\nProduction numbers of the GA70/MA70/JZA70 Supra was estimated at 241,471 units.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n==== 1986 1/2====\nThe third generation of the Supra was introduced in February 1986 as a stand-alone model, officially being separate from the Celica. Whereas the Celica became a front-wheel-drive sport coup\u00e9, the Supra retained its image as a rear-wheel-drive sports/GT car. The new Supra would continue to move upscale and become a showcase for Toyota's technology. The Supra was powered by a 3.0-liter DOHC inline six-cylinder engine rated at {{convert|149|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}. Notable features included an electronically controlled independent suspension (called the Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension \u2013 TEMS), and some came with a removable Sport-Roof panel (Targa top).\n\n==== 1987 ====\nThe A70 Supra Turbo was introduced in 1987. The inter-cooled, turbocharged version of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to {{convert|172|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{Convert|240|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine, designated as 7M-GTE, is the first distributor-less mass production engine in the United States.  This was accomplished with 3 coils being shared.  The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and an integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new 4-channel Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. In 1987, a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1,000 cars were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin-turbocharged 1G-GT engine called [[T-VIS]] and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.\n\n==== 1988 ====\nChanges for the 1988 model year were nominal with the exception of the discontinuation of two-toned brown exterior paint. The spoiler mounted brake light changed from a square to a trapezoid shape. Seat pattern was changed from squares to lines, and \"foil\" on climate control and switch gear changed from light to dark gray. Japanese buyers could select from six different trim packages starting with the top level 3.0 GT Turbo Limited with the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTEU]] engine, followed by the 3.0 GT Turbo, GT Twin Turbo with the 1G-GTEU DOHC 2.0 L engine, the GT with the 2.0 L DOHC [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] engine, the G with the [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]] engine and the S with the [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]] engine as the base model. All Japanese models came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or the 4-speed automatic transmission with ECT-s except the G and the S on which the ECT-s wasn't available. In Japan, the 3.0 GT Turbo Limited, the 3.0 GT Turbo and the GT Twin Turbo were installed standard with a digital instrument panel, the 3.0 L models came with an AM/FM Cassette stereo with an integrated CD player and cruise control. Climate control was also standard on all turbocharged models, and leather interior was only available on the GT Turbo Limited.\n\n==== 1989 ====\nChanges for the 1989 model year include modifications to the wastegate actuator, feed location and engine management increased power output by {{convert|1.5|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} on the turbo model. The engine mount and brace were also revised in late 1989. The changes made to the cross member and mounts made to accommodate the 1JZ engine for Japanese models. The protective body molding was also changed by taking away the steel reinforcement. This made the molding lighter and prevented the rusting problem found on the previous year models. The \"white package\" was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white \"saw blade\" wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics changes, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3-point seat belts to replace the previous years' two-point lap belts. New tail lights, front bumper with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years' detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering wheel, door panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo. Addition of coat hooks on B-pillar and removal of rear seat pockets round out interior changes. Turbo models received three piece spoiler with an integrated [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] brake light. 1989 also marked the end of headlight washers in the US and SuperMonitor; an advanced system offered by Toyota able to calculate miles able to be traveled on current tank, ability to check vehicle codes from inside the cabin, among other features.\n\n==== 1990 ====\n[[File:Toyota Supra rear 20071102.jpg|left|thumb|1990 Toyota Supra 3.0i turbo (MA70)]]\n\nFor the 1990 model year, changes included larger protective laminate in front of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an [[airbag]] and airbag indicator light on dashboard, the left side of the switch panel was also redesigned, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. The lower dashboard panel became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally, the memory lever on the steering column was removed. In short, a plethora of the changes for the 1989 and 1990 were from the interior.\n\n==== 1991 ====\n[[File:Toyota Supra -- 09-12-2010.jpg|thumb|right|1991\u20131992 Toyota Supra 3.0i (MA70)]]\n\nFor the 1991 model year, the wheel design was changed to 5-spoke wheels. Both models wore 16x7 aluminum alloy wheels that were fitted with 225/50/16 tyres and full-sized spares on steel wheels. Body molding changed in colour to better match the exterior. The front \"Supra\" emblem was also changed to the current corporate oval Toyota symbol was used from this model year onwards. The speedometer was also revised, and included more line  that were removed in 1989, but still did not have as many (one line per mph) as 1986.5 to 1988 models. New interior colours, namely shadow gray and deep red, were introduced, which marked the end of medium gray, tan and burgundy. Blue interior became only available on white packages, and those with blue paint. Burgundy was replaced with white package-only deep red. Every other body colour received a shadow gray interior, with leather interiors retaining medium gray seats and interior inserts. Front speakers were changed from 3.5 inch to 6.5 inches and the speaker cover was also enlarged to accommodate them. Beginning in 1991, Toyota began to offer a factory spoiler-style panel sunroof. These sunroofs are now highly sought after and rare since they were introduced in the ending production years of the A70 Supra.\n\n==== 1992 ====\n[[File:Grey 92.jpg|thumb|1992 Toyota Supra with sunroof (MA70)|alt=]]\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the leather shadow gray interiors received black seats and inserts. Non-turbo models lost the option of a targa top, and a new optional subwoofer was available. Subwoofer-equipped Supras did without the rear bins and wooden \"floorboard\". Instead, rear carpet was molded to the spare tire, and there was a cut-out for the woofer housing.\n\n=== JZA70 and GA70 ===\nThe Japanese models of the Supra were given the chassis codes JZA70 and GA70 respectively. The JZA70 has a 2.5-litre {{convert|206|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} parallel twin-turbocharged [[Toyota JZ engine#1JZ-GTTE|1JZ-GTE]] engine, and the GA70 has a 2.0-litre {{convert|154|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} twin-turbocharged [[Toyota G engine#1G-GTE|1G-GTE]] and a naturally aspirated [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] engines respectively.\n\n=== JZA70-R ===\nIn addition to the introduction of the JZA70 in 1990, Toyota introduced a special version of the JZA70 with the 1JZ-GTE engine known as the 2.5 Twin Turbo R model (JZA70-R). It boasted additional upgrades, including lighter sway bars, a larger intercooler, [[Torsen]] differential, Interbred TEIN/[[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein]] sports suspension, Shadow/Dark grey interior trim, [[Momo (company)|MOMO]] steering wheel and gear knob and [[Recaro]] seats and door trim. The wheels were painted charcoal grey, and the front bumper lip featured channeled air ducts for the front brakes. The Twin Turbo R introduced a new and exclusive colour option in 1992 for JZA70-R models known as Jade Mica Green. The JZA70-R model is the lightest and fastest model of third generation of the Supra.\n\n=== Turbo A ===\nThe Turbo-A was Toyota's evolution model for the Group A [[Japanese Touring Car Championship]] (JTCC) all over the world that required a minimum [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] run of 500 units. The Turbo-A was manufactured for 2 months during the period of September and October 1988 and was available strictly in Japan. Thus the term 88 Spec A. Some notable differences between the standard MA70 Supra 3.0 GT and the Turbo-A model are both cosmetic and mechanical. The standard CT-26 turbo had a slightly larger inducer and can be identified by a stamped \"E\" on the raised casting on the compressor housing. The Turbo-A had a {{convert|65|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide throttle body and accompanied a larger diameter \"blank\" crossover pipe, instead of the standard [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTE]] {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} throttle body and original \"3000\" cast pipe. The Turbo-A also benefited from a larger volume steel air cleaner instead of the factory plastic unit, as well as thicker roll bars and ventilated brake discs all-round.\n\nThe fuel management used a MAP system, instead of the standard Karmen Vortex AFM. The front nose features an additional \"Turbo A duct\" to add airflow to the top area of the intercooler. Also unique was the side decal and rear badging (\"3.0GT Turbo A\") and a black paint job (paint code 202). All cars came standard with grey leather interior featuring a [[Momo (company)|MOMO]]-sourced steering wheel and shift knob. It is powered by a {{convert|204|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} Toyota [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTEU]] engine. It is important to note that the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTEU]] was standard in all Japanese MA70 models and is not unique to the Turbo-A. The \"U\" designation meant the engine came equipped with a catalytic converter as per Japan emission laws.\n\n[[File:Toyota Supra Smith & Morgan (16332526755).jpg|thumb|Toyota Supra MA70 Group-A in 1991 at Bathurst]]\n\nThe Group-A MA70 Supra had varying degrees of success in various fields such as Rally and 24HR, but is most known for its participation in the [[Japanese Touring Car Championship]] (JTCC). In the JTCC, the Supra did not win as many races as intended, which is primarily judged on the fact it was underdeveloped and its placement in a higher tier division under regulations because of the 3.0-litre engine displacement, imposing the Toyota with the performance inhibition of running with a higher curb weight and less power compared to the rest of its class.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Both the [[TOM'S]] and [[SARD]] teams fared well in results in the (JTCC) with the [[TOM'S]] team winning on its debut in 1987, before abruptly ending their (JTCC) career with the MA70 Group-A in 1989.\nUpon its initial [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (ATCC) debut in 1989, the Group-A Supra failed to finish its first race. With DNF's becoming a regular upset owing to the lack of power and heavy weight of the Supra, it began to strike doubt in the car's capability of success in the (ATCC) which suffered increasingly due to constant rules and regulation changes issuing a red-faced outcome against its main rivals like the [[Ford Sierra Cosworth|Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500]], Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R and the [[BMW M3#E30 M3|BMW M3 (E30)]] which were lighter, more powerful, and had smaller displacement engines. Hopes would further diminish for Toyota in the top division by the introduction of the domineering [[Nissan Skyline GT-R#R32|Nissan Skyline GT-R (R32)]] in the (JTCC) in 1989 and the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (ATCC) in 1990. Toyota in 1991 would switch to racing the Corolla Levin instead in the lower tier divisions, while many privateer teams soldiered on with the Supra until the Group A racing's final demise in 1993. It is said that than a handful of Group-A MA70's remain in existence after being returned to Japan to be destroyed once the Group-A racing ended. One of those known to be intact was retained by an original driver and privateer of the (ATCC) John Smith in Australia, which still sees track time and limelight at car shows today.\n\nOnly eleven MA70 Group-A cars were built by [[Toyota Racing Development|TRD]] Japan for homologation racing. A few out of many special developed parts that were fitted to the various Group-A race cars happen to include a cast magnesium nine litre oil pan with matching high flow oil pump, 288 camshafts with 10.88mm lift, Hollinger close proportion 5-speed gear-set in the R154 case, Harrop 4 piston brake calipers with 15.5 \u2033 (393&nbsp;mm) rotors, and TRD-sourced torque-vectoring mechanical limited-slip differential with 50:50 left:right lockup on full throttle. TRD was also responsible for the thick rear-anti squat tram-rods which were integral to the multi-link rear suspension setup to control rear squat under hard acceleration and launching.\n\n=== Powertrain ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Code\n!Year\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Transmission\n!Market\n|-\n!rowspan=2|MA70\n|rowspan=2|February 1986 \u2013 May 1993\n|{{convert|2954|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|Toyota 7M-GE]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|{{convert|149|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|196|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic\n|Canada, Europe, United States and Australia\n|-\n|{{convert|2954|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTE]] [[turbo]] I6\n|{{convert|173|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|254|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=16093 |work=carfolio |title=1988 Toyota Turbo specifications |date=3 March 2013 |access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n|5-speed [[Toyota R transmission#R154|R154]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic\n|Canada, Europe, Japan and United States\n|-\n!rowspan=2|GA70\n|rowspan=2|February 1986 \u2013 1992\n|{{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] I6\n|{{convert|160|PS|kW hp PS|abbr=on|0|order=out}}\n|{{convert|130|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic\n|Japan\n|-\n|{{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota G engine#1G-GTE|1G-GTE]] [[twin-turbo#Parallel twin-turbo|twin-turbocharged]] I6\n|{{convert|210|PS|kW hp PS|abbr=on|0|order=out}}\n|{{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic\n|Japan\n|-\n!JZA70\n|1990\u20131993\n|{{convert|2491|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota JZ engine#1JZ|1JZ-GTE]] twin-turbocharged I6\n|{{convert|280|PS|kW hp PS|abbr=on|0|order=out}}\n|{{convert|268|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed [[Toyota R transmission#R154|R154]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]]<nowiki/> automatic\n|Japan\n|}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|A80}} Fourth generation (A80) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fourth generation (A80)\n| image = 1994 Toyota Supra Sport Roof in Red, front left.jpg\n| caption = \n| production = April 1993<ref name=\"supras1\">{{cite web|url=http://mkiv.supras.org.nz/specs.htm|title=Toyota Supra A80 : A80 Specifications|publisher=Mkiv.supras.org.nz|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> \u2013 August 2002\n| assembly = {{unbulleted list \n|Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi|Toyota City, Aichi]] ([[Motomachi plant]];

By the middle of 1990, a final A80 design concept from Toyota Technical Centre Aichi was approved and frozen for production in late 1990. The first test mules were hand-built in A70 bodies during late 1990, followed by the first A80 prototypes being hand-assembled in 1991. Again using subframe, suspension, and drivetrain assemblies from the [[Toyota Soarer#Z30|Z30 Soarer]] ([[Lexus SC#SC400|Lexus SC300/400]]), pre-production of the test models started in December 1992 with 20 units,<ref name=\"supras1\"/> and official mass production began in April 1993.<ref name=\"supras1\"/> The fourth generation of the Supra again shared its platform with the upscale Soarer coup\u00e9, sold in the U.S. as the Lexus SC. Although the two cars looked similar, the new Supra was more than 13 inches (340&nbsp;mm) shorter than its luxurious cousin.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://parts.olathetoyota.com/blog/5066/4th-gen-supra-history |title=Toyota's 4th Generation Supra History |work=Toyota Parts Blog |publisher=Toyota |location=Olathe, US |access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref> The rounded styling, while modern, does seem to borrow some elements from Toyota's first grand touring sports car, the 2000GT.\n\nThis redesign saw Toyota placing great emphasis on a more serious high-performance car. It featured two new engines: a [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] [[Toyota JZ engine#2JZ-GE|Toyota 2JZ-GE]] having a power output of {{convert|164|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,800 rpm and {{convert|210|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm of torque and a [[twin-turbo#Sequential twin-turbo|twin turbocharged]] [[Toyota JZ engine#2JZ-GTE|Toyota 2JZ-GTE]] having a power output of {{convert|206|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|318|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque for the Japanese model. For the export model (American/European markets) Toyota upgraded the Supra turbo's engine (by installing smaller, steel wheeled [[turbocharger]]s and bigger fuel injectors, etc.). This increased the power output to {{convert|239|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|315|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000 rpm ({{convert|243|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|325|lbft|0|abbr=on}} for European markets) Upon its launch in 1993, it was the first Toyota-badged vehicle to include a passenger airbag as standard (US-market only).<ref name=\"supras1\"/>\n\nThe turbocharged variant could accelerate to 97&nbsp;km/h in as low as 4.6 seconds and cover 1/4-mile (402 m) in 13.1 seconds at {{convert|109|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"cd93\">{{cite journal |url=http://mkiv.com/publications/car&driver/3_93/6-cd3-93.jpg |title=Toyota Supra Turbo: Think of it as a Lexus for Smokey Yunick |accessdate=27 April 2013 |format=JPG |year=1993 |issue=March |page=41 |work=[[Car and Driver]]}}</ref> The turbo version has a tested top speed of {{convert|285|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}, but the cars are restricted to just {{convert|180|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in Japan and {{convert|250|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in worldwide markets. European versions of the car also had an air intake or scoop on the [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]]. It has a {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.31}} for the naturally aspirated models and 0.32 for the turbo models but unknown with the rear spoiler.\n\nThe twin turbochargers operated in sequential mode instead of parallel. Initially, all of the exhaust gases are routed to the first turbine for reduced lag. This resulted in boost and enhanced torque as early as 1,800 rpm, where it already produced {{convert|300|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. At 3,500 rpm, some of the exhaust gases are routed to the second turbine for a \"pre-boost\" mode, although none of the compressor output is used by the engine at this point. At 4,000 rpm, the second turbo's output is used to augment the first turbo's output. Compared to the parallel mode, sequential mode turbo chargers provide quicker low RPM response and increased high RPM boost. This high RPM boost was also aided with technology originally present in the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|7M-GE]] in the form of the [[Acoustic Control Induction System]] (ACIS) which is a way of managing the air compression pulses within the intake piping as to increase power.\n\nFor this generation, the Supra received a new six-speed [[Getrag]]/Toyota ''V160'' gearbox on the turbo models while the naturally aspirated models were equipped with a five-speed manual [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] transmission, revised from the previous model. Each model was offered with a four-speed automatic with manual shifting mode. All vehicles were equipped with five-spoke aluminum alloy wheels, the naturally aspirated models had 16-inch wheels and the turbo models had 17-inch wheels. The difference in wheel size was to accommodate the larger brakes equipped as standard onto the turbo model, but in Japan were optional extras. Both models had a space saver spare tyre on a steel rim to save both space and weight.\n\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1994 Toyota Supra Sport Roof in Red, rear left.jpg\n| caption1 = Rear view \n| image2 = MKIV Cockpit.JPG\n| caption2 = Interior\n}}\n\nToyota took measures to reduce the weight of this new model. Aluminium was used for the hood, targa top (when fitted), front crossmember, oil and transmission pans, and forged upper suspension A-arms. Other measures included hollow carpet fibers, magnesium-alloy steering wheel, plastic gas tank and lid, dished out head bolts, gas injected rear spoiler, and a single pipe exhaust. Despite having more features such as dual airbags, traction control, larger brakes, wheels, tires, and an additional turbocharger, the car was at least {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} lighter than its predecessor. The base model with a manual transmission had a curb weight of {{convert|3210|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The targa top added {{convert|40|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} of weight while the automatic transmission added {{convert|55|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The fourth generation model had a 51:49 (front:rear) weight distribution. The turbo model weighed {{convert|3450|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} with a manual transmission while the automatic added another {{convert|10|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} to the overall weight. Weight distribution was 53% front/47% rear. The Supra was heavier than the spartan [[Mazda RX-7]] and all aluminium bodied [[Honda NSX|Acura/Honda NSX]], but was lighter than the [[Mitsubishi GTO|Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-reviews/car-comparison-tests/the-300-horsepower-club?click=main_sr |title=The 300 Horsepower Club |journal=Road & Track |date=26 March 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the 1996 model year in the US, the turbo model was only available with the automatic transmission owing to [[OBD-II]] certification requirements. The targa roof was also made standard on all turbo models. For 1997, manual transmission returned for the optional engine along with a redesign of the tail lights, headlights, front fascia, polished wheels, and other minor changes such as the radio and steering wheel designs. All 1997 models included badges indicating \"Limited Edition 15th Anniversary\". All turbo models came standard with the rear spoiler. For 1998, updates were a 3-spoke steering wheel, a redesigned radio, and VVT-i on the normally aspirated engine. In Japan, the turbo engines were installed with VVT-i. The SZ-R model was also updated with the introduction of a six-speed [[Getrag]] V161 transmission, the same used for the twin-turbo RZ models.\n\nThe standard A80 Supra chassis has also proven an effective platform for roadracing, with several top 20 and top 10 One Lap of America finishes in the SSGT1 class. In 1994, the A80 managed remarkable [[skidpad]] ratings of 0.95 lateral g's (200&nbsp;ft) and 0.98 lateral g's (300&nbsp;ft)<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://mkiv.com/publications/road&track/3_93/rt393_06.jpg |title=1993 Supra Turbo |work=Road & Track |year=1993 |issue=March |accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> The Supra also featured a four-sensor four-channel track tuned ABS system with yaw control whereby each caliper is sensored and the brakes are controlled individually according to the speed, angle, and pitch of the approaching corner.

The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the [[Tahara plant]] in [[Tahara, Aichi]], while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in [[Toyota, Aichi|Toyota City]]. The fifth generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the [[BMW Z4 (G29)|G29 BMW Z4]] in [[Graz, Austria]] by [[Magna Steyr]].\n\nThe Supra also traces much of its roots back to the [[Toyota 2000GT|2000GT]] owing to an [[inline-6]] layout. The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the [[Toyota Crown|Crown]]'s and 2000GT's [[Toyota M engine|M engine]]. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code \"A\".\n\nAlong with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. (The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what color it was. It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it too was discontinued.){{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth generation of the Supra in the United States,<ref name=\"OSS\"/> production of the fourth generation of the Supra ended in 2002.\n\nIn January 2019, the fifth generation of the Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 Z4,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.motor1.com/news/236633/supra-z4-magna-steyr-production/ |title=Toyota Supra And BMW Z4 Could Be Built Together By Magna Steyr |work=Motor1 |date=20 March 2018 |access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> was introduced.\n\n== {{anchor|A40|A50}} First generation (A40/A50) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (A40/A50)\n| image = Toyota Supra (2492707827).jpg\n| caption = Toyota Celica Supra (MA47)\n| aka = {{unbulleted list\n  | Toyota Celica XX (Japan)\n  | Toyota Celica Supra\n  }}\n| production = April 1978 \u2013 June 1981<ref name=\"parts catalogue 1977\u20131981\"/>\n| assembly = Japan: [[Tahara, Aichi]] ([[Tahara plant]])<ref name=\"tahara\">{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/production/production/japan/general_status/tahara.html |title=75 Years of Toyota {{!}} General Status of Plants in Japan {{!}} Tahara Plant |year=2012 |access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n| related = {{unbulleted list\n  | [[Toyota Carina#A40|Toyota Carina (A40)]]\n  | [[Toyota Celica#A40|Toyota Celica (A40)]]\n  }}\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#M|M-EU]]'' [[I6 engine|I6]] \n  | {{convert|2563|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#4M|4M-E]]'' I6 \n  | {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#5M|5M-E]]'' I6 \n  }}\n| powerout = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|92|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.0 L)\n  | {{convert|82|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.6 L)\n  | {{convert|87|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.8 L)\n  }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list\n  | 5-speed ''[[Toyota W transmission#W50|W50]]'' [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n  | 4-speed ''[[Toyota A transmission#A40D|A40D]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  | 4-speed ''[[Toyota A transmission#A43D|A43D]]'' automatic\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2629|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4615|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1651|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1290|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1270|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe first generation of the Supra was based largely upon the Toyota Celica [[liftback]], but was longer by {{convert|129.5|mm|in||abbr=on}}.

Both transmissions featured an [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gear. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive gear whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The drive train for the Supra retained the T series [[solid axle|solid rear axle]] configuration of the Celica in the Japanese MA45 version and a larger F series (and optional [[Limited Slip Differential]]) in the MA46 and MA47. The car also came standard with 4-wheel [[disc brakes]] and featured a [[Multi-link suspension|four-link]] rear suspension with coil springs, lateral [[track bar]], and [[sway bar|stabilizer bar]]. The front suspension consisted of [[MacPherson strut]]s and a stabilizer bar.\n\nThe interior of the Supra had optional [[power windows]] and [[power locks]] as part of the convenience package. The convenience package also included [[cruise control]] and special door trim with door pull straps with an optional [[sunroof]]. As for standard features, in the centre console there was an extendable map light and a flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets on the backs of the front seats, and a [[tonneau cover]] under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art [[AM radio|AM]]/[[FM radio|FM]]/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.\n\n=== 1979 ===\nThe mid 1979, changes for the 1980 model year US model were mostly cosmetic. The interior received a redesigned center console and a digital quartz clock. On the exterior were redesigned side view mirrors and 14x5{{frac|1|2}} inch aluminum wheels were standard (the previous year had steel wheels with plastic wheel covers as standard and the aluminum wheels were optional). In addition, body molded mudflaps became available. On cars finished in copper metallic and white, the mudflaps were painted the body colour while the mudflaps were left black on all other colours. On the rear of the mudflaps, the word \"Celica\" was painted in white lettering.<ref name=\"csMKI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.celicasupra.com/historymki.htm |publisher=celicasupra.com |title=MK I Celica Supra History |accessdate=22 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207020926/http://www.celicasupra.com/historymki.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=7 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe official Supra site<ref name=\"OSS\"/> also notes that there was an addition of optional leather-trimmed seating and automatic climate-control.\n\n=== 1980 ===\n[[File:Perf pack for wiki.jpg|thumb|1981 Supra with Sports Performance Package (MA47, US)]]\n\nIn August 1980 (for the 1981 model year), the Supra received an upgrade in displacement with the {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} [[Toyota M engine#5M|5M-E]] engine.

The car's automatic transmission was changed to the revised Toyota [[Toyota A transmission#A43D|A43D]] and it gained a revised final drive gearing. Because of the change in engine and transmission a new chassis code of MA47 was given to the 1981 model. Performance figures for this model include a 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) acceleration time of 10.24 seconds and a 1/4-mile time of 17.5 seconds at a speed of {{convert|77.7|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"mtsvs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.celicasupra.com/images/MT2-82-3.jpg |work=Supra vs. Supra |title=1981 Toyota Celica Supra Road Test Data & Specifications |accessdate=22 December 2006 |format=JPG |date=February 1982 |page=46 |publisher=[[Motor Trend]]}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1980 (for the 1981 model year), a new Sports Performance Package became an option, which included sport suspension, raised white letter tyres, and front and rear spoilers.

The Supra was sold as the Celica XX only in Japan at Japanese dealership sales channels called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Corolla Store]]''. In worldwide markets, it was sold as the Celica Supra.\n\nThe 2000GT was the flagship model of the XX range. Featuring the smaller 2.0-litre six-cylinder DOHC 24-valve [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]], Yamaha took the base [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]] and improved it, resulting in the [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] significantly increasing the power output of the engine, this engine was also used in the 1985 [[Toyota Soarer|Soarer]]. The smaller-capacity meant that [[Road tax#Japan|road taxes]] were less than that of the 2800GT. [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] has a power output of {{convert|118|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 6,400&nbsp;rpm.\n\nThe 2800GT was the most powerful of the range, featuring the 2.8-litre six-cylinder DOHC 5M-GEU engine which has a power output of {{convert|129|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,600&nbsp;rpm.\nThe 2000G/S has the M-TEU engine, which has a power output of {{convert|118|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm, as much as the [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]], but has more torque lower down the rev range, {{cvt|230|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,000 rpm. The lower-range models, being 2000G/S, were the least powerful, featuring the [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]], which has a power output of {{convert|92|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm. They also lacked a lot of features found on other models in an effort to lower cost.\n\nIn 1981, the Celica XX introduced the world's first navigation computer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/products_technology/technology_development/electronics_parts/index.html |title=Technical Development Electronics Parts |publisher=Toyota Motor Corporation |year=2012 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|A60}} Second generation (A60) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation (A60)\n| image = 2nd-Toyota-Supra.jpg\n| caption = Toyota Supra P-Type (MA67)\n| aka = {{unbulleted list\n  | Toyota Celica XX (Japan)\n  | Toyota Celica Supra\n  }}\n| production = July 1981 \u2013 December 1985<ref name=\"A60-intro\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.toyota.co.uk/history-of-the-toyota-supra |title=History of the Toyota Supra |publisher=Toyota |location=UK |date=15 September 2018 |access-date=15 September 2018}}</ref>\n| assembly = Japan: [[Tahara, Aichi]] ([[Tahara plant]])<ref name=\"tahara\"/>\n| related = {{unbulleted list\n  | [[Toyota Carina#A60|Toyota Carina (A60)]]\n  | [[Toyota Celica#A60|Toyota Celica (A60)]]\n  }}\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]]'' I6 \n  | {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]]'' I6 \n  | {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#M-TEU|M-TEU]]'' [[turbocharged]] I6\n  | {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''5M-E'' I6 \n  | {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota M engine#5M-GE|5M-GE]]'' I6 \n  }}\n| powerout = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|93|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.0 L, ''1G-EU'')\n  | {{convert|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.0 L, ''1G-GEU'')\n  | {{convert|108|\u2013|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.0 L, ''M-TEU'')\n  | {{convert|104|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.8 L, ''5M-E'')\n  | {{convert|108|\u2013|133|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} (2.8 L, ''5M-GE'')\n  }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list\n  | 5-speed ''[[Toyota W transmission#W55|W55]]'' manual\n  | 5-speed ''[[Toyota W transmission#W57|W57]]'' manual\n  | 5-speed ''[[Toyota W transmission#W58|W58]]'' manual\n  | 4-speed ''[[Toyota A transmission#A43DL|A43DL]]'' automatic\n  | 4-speed ''[[Toyota A transmission#A43DE|A43DE]]'' automatic\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2614|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4661|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n  | {{convert|1720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (2.8 L)\n  }}\n| height = {{convert|1321|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1361|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn mid 1981, Toyota completely redesigned the Celica Supra as well as the entire Celica lineup for the 1982 model year. In Japan, they were known as the Celica XX, but the Celica Supra name was used for the world market. Still based on the Celica platform, there were several key differences, most notably the design of the front end and fully retractable pop-up headlights. Other differences were the inline-six rather than four-cylinder engine, as well as an increase in length and wheelbase to accommodate the larger engine. Cars installed with the [[Toyota M engine#5M|5M]] engine were slightly wider, while other models remained compliant with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese dimension regulations]].\n\nIn 1981, Japanese buyers were offered an alternative to the Celica XX fastback bodystyle, called the [[Toyota Soarer|Soarer]] coup\u00e9, which was offered at a different Japanese Toyota dealership network called the ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]'', as the Celica XX was sold at the ''Toyota Corolla Store''. The four-door performance saloon called the Celica Camry was realigned with the Japanese market [[Toyota Chaser|Chaser]], while in North America the [[Toyota Cressida|Cressida]] took on that role.\n\n=== L-type and P-type ===\nIn the North American market, the Celica Supra was available in two distinct models. There was the \"Performance Type\" (P-type) and the \"Luxury Type\" (L-type). While being mechanically identical, they were differentiated by the available options; tire size, wheel size, and body trim. The P-type had fiberglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type did not get the option of a leather interior until 1983. Initially, Luxury Type ment Automatic transmission, and Performance Type stood for Manual. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6. The L-type also had the option of a digital instrument cluster with a [[trip computer]]; some Canadian models (both L-types and P-types) had this option as well as a few rare instances of American models. The L-type cluster was easily distinguished from the P-type cluster, by the 'ECT' function written on the dial plate. The digital cluster featured a digital tachometer, digital speedometer, and electronic fuel level and coolant level gauges. The trip computer could calculate and display various things such as [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in miles-per-gallon, [[estimated time of arrival]] (ETA), and distance remaining to destination. Supras with trip computers also came with cruise control. Excluding the 1982 model, all P-types were available with headlight washers as an option, but the L-types were never given such an option. Although gear ratios changed throughout the years, all P-types came standard with a [[limited slip differential]].\n\n=== 1982 ===\n[[File:Toyota Supra outside pub 1982.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Toyota Supra 2.8i L-Type (MA61)]]\n\nFor 1982, in the North American market, the Celica Supra's engine was the {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} 12-valve (two valves per cylinder) [[DOHC]] [[Toyota M engine#5M-GE|5M-GE]]. Power output was {{convert|108|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} SAE net and {{convert|155|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine used an 8.8:1 compression ratio to achieve the power and featured a vacuum advanced distributor. When the car debuted, it had a {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.348}}, a {{convert|0-60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration time of 9.8 seconds and a {{convert|1/4|mile|m|round=25|order=flip|abbr=in}} time of 17.2-seconds at {{convert|80|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"cd1081\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfmodelaclub.org/user/Car%20and%20Driver%20Oct%2081.pdf |work=Toyota Celica Supra |title=1982 Toyota Celica Specifications |accessdate=22 December 2006 |date=October 1981 |page=42 |publisher=[[Car and Driver]]}}</ref>\n\nThe standard transmission for this year was the [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] 5-speed manual with the [[Toyota A transmission#A43DL|A43DL]] 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions had an [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gear and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission had an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The 1982 model's rear differential had a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and had variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.\n\nOn the interior, this generation had standard power windows, power door locks, and power mirrors as well as a tilt steering wheel. The power door lock was located in the center console next to the power mirror control. The analog dash of this model only showed a top speed of {{convert|88|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in North America. The optional automatic climate control was renovated and was now seen as a standard feature on the A60. Cruise control and a retractable map light was standard in this generation. Some options included the addition of a sunroof, two-tone paint schemes, and a five-speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner with a cassette player (Fujitsu Ten Limited). The optional cassette stereo had a 105-watt power amplifier and a seven-band graphic equalizer. The standard stereo was a five-channel AM/FM/MPX tuner. Leather interior was an option on the L-type model, but the P-type models limited to standard striped cloth interior.\n\nThe AM/FM antenna was integrated into the front windshield rather than a typical external mast antenna. There was a key lock on the gas tank door (in lieu of a remote release) and the hatch and rear bumper were black regardless of exterior colour on the rest of the car. The P-type was available with an optional rear window visor above the hatch glass. The tail lights had a reverse light in the centre and the door handles opened the doors by pulling sideways. The front nose badge and B-pillar only read \"Supra\" for the first several months of production, but were changed to read \"Celica Supra\" midway through the model year. The L-type had front and rear mudflaps but P-type of this year did not.\n\n=== 1983 ===\nFor the 1983 model year, not much was altered, but there was an increase in power output to {{convert|112|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|159|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque from the same ''[[Toyota M engine#5M-GE|5M-GE]]'' engine. The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the [[Toyota A transmission#A43DL|A43DL]] 4-speed with a newly designed [[Toyota A transmission#A43DE|A43DE]] 4-speed. It had an electronic controller that would adjust its shift pattern for a balance between performance and economy. It was the first in the industry to provide an electronically controlled transmission (ECT). This allowed the driver to choose either the \"power\" driving mode or \"normal\" driving mode at the touch of the button. The power mode provided the quickest acceleration and the normal mode provided the best all-around performance.\n\nThe interior virtually had no changes, but changes to the exterior included a switch to a power mast antenna, mudflaps on all models, and the addition of headlight washers on the P-type. All B-pillar and nose badges for cars sold in North America read \"Celica Supra\" and only the P-type was available in two-tone colour schemes.\n\n=== 1984 ===\n[[File:1984 Toyota Supra, front left (P-type).jpg|thumb|1984 Toyota Supra 2.8 P-Type (MA67)]]\n\nChanges for the 1984 model year were significant. Power output was increased on the 5-speed models to {{convert|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|163|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The increase was achieved by a mixture of a redesigned intake manifold with \"D\"-shaped intake runners and an increase in compression ratio to: 9.2:1.<ref name=\"supfaq\"/> Another notable change in the 5-speed models was the switch to a 4.30:1 gear ratio in the rear differential. All automatic models retained the previous years power statistics, but the rear gear ratio was changed to 4.10:1.\n\nThe most notable exterior changes included the switch to wraparound front turn signals, the option of either a rear wing spoiler mounted high up on the rear hatch, or rear window and quarter window louvers. Also, the tail-lights were redesigned and the hatch received a billboard \"Supra\" sticker instead of the smaller sticker, which was previously positioned on the right. The rear hatch and bumper was changed and received the same colour as the rest of the car (instead of the black of previous years). The door handles were also switched, opening by pulling up instead of sideways. Two-tone paint schemes also became available on both the P-type and L-type models.\n\nSome interior controls such as the steering wheel, cruise control, and door lock switch were redesigned. Toyota included a {{convert|130|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} speedometer in North American models instead of the traditional 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) speedometer and the automatic climate control display was also changed. The previous year's cassette and equalizer stereo option was now made a standard feature.\n\n=== 1985\u20131986 ===\n[[File:1986 Toyota Supra (MA67, US), rear right.jpg|thumb|left|1986 Toyota Supra 2.8 with the third brake light (MA67)]]\n\nThe Supra was redesigned again in 1985. On the engine side, power output was increased to {{convert|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|169|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. All models of this year had the same amount of power (both automatic models and 5-speed models). The engine received a redesigned [[throttle position sensor]] (TPS) as well as a new [[exhaust gas recirculation|EGR]] system and knock sensor. With the slight increase in power the Supra was able to propel itself from 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 8.4 seconds and netted a 16.1 second quarter-mile at {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"cd85\">{{cite web |url=http://www.celicasupra.com/images/CD5-85-7.jpg |work=Having it All |title=Car and Driver test results |accessdate=22 December 2006 |format=JPG |date=May 1985 |page=74 |publisher=[[Car and Driver]]}}</ref>\n\nOther changes would be a redesigned, more integrated sunshade and spoiler on the rear hatch. The rear spoiler was changed from a one-piece to a two-piece. The L-types of this year were not available with a leather interior, but P-types were. Toyota added a standard factory theft deterrent system and the outside mirrors were equipped with a defogger that activated with the rear defroster. All Supras this year received automatic-off lights that also encompassed an automatic illuminated entry and fade-out system.\n\nWhile 1985 was to be the last year of production of the second generation model, delays in production of the third generation model led to a surplus of second generation models. During the first half of 1986 the 1985 P-type was still offered for sale, with only minor cosmetic changes as well as the addition of a now mandatory rear-mounted third brake light on the hatch. These were all labelled officially as 1986 models. The P-type were the only model available for the 1986 model year. Production for the A60 Supra ended in December 1985 in order to make way for the upcoming A70 Supra.\n\n=== Markets ===\n[[File:Toyota-CelicaXX2800GT.JPG|thumb|1982-1983 Toyota Celica XX 2800GT (MA61)]]\n[[File:1983-1986 Toyota Celica XX 2000GT.jpg|thumb|1983&ndash;1986 Toyota Celica XX 2000GT Twin Cam 24 (GA61)]]\n\nThe second generation of the Supra came in a variety of options around the world as well as only being offered during select years.\n\n==== Japan ====\nFrom August 1982 to 1983, the Celica XX, as it was named in Japan, had [[Wing mirror|fender mirrors]] and came in four models depending on the engine:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://global.toyota/en/detail/7732349|title=TOYOTA announces new Celica XX with high performance twin cam, 24-valve engine|last=|first=|date=17 August 1982|work=|access-date=|publisher=Toyota Motor Corp.}}</ref>\n\n* 2800GT Twin Cam: {{convert|2759|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} DOHC ''[[Toyota M engine#5M-GE|5M-GEU]]'' {{convert|119|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|150|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n* 2000GT Twin Cam 24: {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} DOHC ''[[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]]'' {{convert|118|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|134|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n* 2000 Turbo: {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} DOHC turbocharged ''[[Toyota M engine#M-TEU|M-TEU]]'' {{convert|108|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|156|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n* 2000: {{convert|1988|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} SOHC ''[[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]]'' {{convert|93|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|126|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nFrom August 1983 to 1986, the Celica XX had door-mounted mirrors and the same four engines options but with performances improvements.

The Celica changed to a front-wheel drive layout, using the [[List of Toyota platforms|Toyota \"T\" platform]] associated with the [[Toyota Corona|Corona]], while the Supra kept its rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine was updated to a more powerful {{convert|2954|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} [[inline-six engine]] rated at {{convert|149|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}. Although initially only available with [[naturally aspirated engine]]s, a turbocharged version was added in the 1987 model year. The Supra was now mechanically related to the Soarer for the Japanese market.\n\nAll Japanese market models with the various versions of the 2.0 L engine were slightly narrower overall so as to be in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] so that Japanese buyers weren't liable for yearly taxes for driving a larger car.\n\n[[File:1986 Toyota Supra (MA70) liftback (2015-07-14) 02.jpg|thumb|left|1986 Supra (MA70; rear view)]]\n\nThe new engine used in the A70 Supra, the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|Toyota 7M-GE]], was the flagship engine of Toyota's arsenal. Both versions of the engine contained 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead cams. The [[turbocharged]] [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTE]] engine was Toyota's first distributor-less engine offered in the US which used coil packs sitting on the cam covers and a cam position sensor driven by the exhaust camshaft.<ref name=\"mk3man\">{{cite web |url=http://www.importworkshop.com/files/manuals/toyota/MK3_1990_Toyota_Supra.pdf |work=Toyota A70 Supra: Factory Service Manual |title=FSM |accessdate=11 January 2008 |format=PDF |year=1990}}</ref> It was equipped with a CT26 turbocharger and was rated at {{convert|172|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,600 rpm while the naturally aspirated [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|7M-GE]] engine was rated at {{convert|149|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 6,000 rpm. Further refinement on the turbo model increased power to {{convert|173|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|254|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3,200 rpm in 1989. This was mostly due to a redesign of the wastegate. All models used the same tyre size of 225/50R16 on 16x7 inch wheels. Spare tyres were full-sized but on steel wheels.\n\nThe naturally aspirated model came standard with the [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] manual transmission. The turbocharged models included the [[Toyota R transmission#R154|R154]] manual transmission. Both were available with the optional 4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic transmission.\n\n{{anchor|TEMS|Toyota Electronically Modulated Suspension}}\n\nThe third-generation of the Supra represented an arsenal of new technology. In 1986, options available for the Supra included a 3-channel [[antilock braking system|ABS]] and [[Toyota TEMS|TEMS]] which gave the driver two settings which affected the damper rates; a third was automatically activated at [[wide open throttle]], hard braking and high speed maneuvering.\n\nACIS ([[Acoustic Control Induction System]]), a method of controlling air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was also a part of the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|7M-GE]]'s technological arsenal. All models were fitted with double [[wishbone suspension]] front and rear. A targa top was offered in all model years along with a metal power sliding sunroof (added in 1991).\n\nProduction numbers of the GA70/MA70/JZA70 Supra was estimated at 241,471 units.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n==== 1986 1/2====\nThe third generation of the Supra was introduced in February 1986 as a stand-alone model, officially being separate from the Celica. Whereas the Celica became a front-wheel-drive sport coup\u00e9, the Supra retained its image as a rear-wheel-drive sports/GT car. The new Supra would continue to move upscale and become a showcase for Toyota's technology. The Supra was powered by a 3.0-liter DOHC inline six-cylinder engine rated at {{convert|149|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}. Notable features included an electronically controlled independent suspension (called the Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension \u2013 TEMS), and some came with a removable Sport-Roof panel (Targa top).\n\n==== 1987 ====\nThe A70 Supra Turbo was introduced in 1987. The inter-cooled, turbocharged version of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to {{convert|172|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{Convert|240|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine, designated as 7M-GTE, is the first distributor-less mass production engine in the United States.  This was accomplished with 3 coils being shared.  The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and an integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new 4-channel Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. In 1987, a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1,000 cars were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin-turbocharged 1G-GT engine called [[T-VIS]] and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.\n\n==== 1988 ====\nChanges for the 1988 model year were nominal with the exception of the discontinuation of two-toned brown exterior paint. The spoiler mounted brake light changed from a square to a trapezoid shape. Seat pattern was changed from squares to lines, and \"foil\" on climate control and switch gear changed from light to dark gray. Japanese buyers could select from six different trim packages starting with the top level 3.0 GT Turbo Limited with the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTEU]] engine, followed by the 3.0 GT Turbo, GT Twin Turbo with the 1G-GTEU DOHC 2.0 L engine, the GT with the 2.0 L DOHC [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] engine, the G with the [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]] engine and the S with the [[Toyota G engine#1G-EU|1G-EU]] engine as the base model. All Japanese models came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or the 4-speed automatic transmission with ECT-s except the G and the S on which the ECT-s wasn't available. In Japan, the 3.0 GT Turbo Limited, the 3.0 GT Turbo and the GT Twin Turbo were installed standard with a digital instrument panel, the 3.0 L models came with an AM/FM Cassette stereo with an integrated CD player and cruise control. Climate control was also standard on all turbocharged models, and leather interior was only available on the GT Turbo Limited.\n\n==== 1989 ====\nChanges for the 1989 model year include modifications to the wastegate actuator, feed location and engine management increased power output by {{convert|1.5|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} on the turbo model. The engine mount and brace were also revised in late 1989. The changes made to the cross member and mounts made to accommodate the 1JZ engine for Japanese models. The protective body molding was also changed by taking away the steel reinforcement. This made the molding lighter and prevented the rusting problem found on the previous year models. The \"white package\" was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white \"saw blade\" wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics changes, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3-point seat belts to replace the previous years' two-point lap belts. New tail lights, front bumper with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years' detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering wheel, door panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo. Addition of coat hooks on B-pillar and removal of rear seat pockets round out interior changes. Turbo models received three piece spoiler with an integrated [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] brake light. 1989 also marked the end of headlight washers in the US and SuperMonitor; an advanced system offered by Toyota able to calculate miles able to be traveled on current tank, ability to check vehicle codes from inside the cabin, among other features.\n\n==== 1990 ====\n[[File:Toyota Supra rear 20071102.jpg|left|thumb|1990 Toyota Supra 3.0i turbo (MA70)]]\n\nFor the 1990 model year, changes included larger protective laminate in front of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an [[airbag]] and airbag indicator light on dashboard, the left side of the switch panel was also redesigned, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. The lower dashboard panel became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally, the memory lever on the steering column was removed. In short, a plethora of the changes for the 1989 and 1990 were from the interior.\n\n==== 1991 ====\n[[File:Toyota Supra -- 09-12-2010.jpg|thumb|right|1991\u20131992 Toyota Supra 3.0i (MA70)]]\n\nFor the 1991 model year, the wheel design was changed to 5-spoke wheels. Both models wore 16x7 aluminum alloy wheels that were fitted with 225/50/16 tyres and full-sized spares on steel wheels. Body molding changed in colour to better match the exterior. The front \"Supra\" emblem was also changed to the current corporate oval Toyota symbol was used from this model year onwards. The speedometer was also revised, and included more line  that were removed in 1989, but still did not have as many (one line per mph) as 1986.5 to 1988 models. New interior colours, namely shadow gray and deep red, were introduced, which marked the end of medium gray, tan and burgundy. Blue interior became only available on white packages, and those with blue paint. Burgundy was replaced with white package-only deep red. Every other body colour received a shadow gray interior, with leather interiors retaining medium gray seats and interior inserts. Front speakers were changed from 3.5 inch to 6.5 inches and the speaker cover was also enlarged to accommodate them. Beginning in 1991, Toyota began to offer a factory spoiler-style panel sunroof. These sunroofs are now highly sought after and rare since they were introduced in the ending production years of the A70 Supra.\n\n==== 1992 ====\n[[File:Grey 92.jpg|thumb|1992 Toyota Supra with sunroof (MA70)|alt=]]\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the leather shadow gray interiors received black seats and inserts. Non-turbo models lost the option of a targa top, and a new optional subwoofer was available. Subwoofer-equipped Supras did without the rear bins and wooden \"floorboard\". Instead, rear carpet was molded to the spare tire, and there was a cut-out for the woofer housing.\n\n=== JZA70 and GA70 ===\nThe Japanese models of the Supra were given the chassis codes JZA70 and GA70 respectively. The JZA70 has a 2.5-litre {{convert|206|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} parallel twin-turbocharged [[Toyota JZ engine#1JZ-GTTE|1JZ-GTE]] engine, and the GA70 has a 2.0-litre {{convert|154|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} twin-turbocharged [[Toyota G engine#1G-GTE|1G-GTE]] and a naturally aspirated [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] engines respectively.\n\n=== JZA70-R ===\nIn addition to the introduction of the JZA70 in 1990, Toyota introduced a special version of the JZA70 with the 1JZ-GTE engine known as the 2.5 Twin Turbo R model (JZA70-R). It boasted additional upgrades, including lighter sway bars, a larger intercooler, [[Torsen]] differential, Interbred TEIN/[[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein]] sports suspension, Shadow/Dark grey interior trim, [[Momo (company)|MOMO]] steering wheel and gear knob and [[Recaro]] seats and door trim. The wheels were painted charcoal grey, and the front bumper lip featured channeled air ducts for the front brakes. The Twin Turbo R introduced a new and exclusive colour option in 1992 for JZA70-R models known as Jade Mica Green. The JZA70-R model is the lightest and fastest model of third generation of the Supra.\n\n=== Turbo A ===\nThe Turbo-A was Toyota's evolution model for the Group A [[Japanese Touring Car Championship]] (JTCC) all over the world that required a minimum [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] run of 500 units. The Turbo-A was manufactured for 2 months during the period of September and October 1988 and was available strictly in Japan. Thus the term 88 Spec A. Some notable differences between the standard MA70 Supra 3.0 GT and the Turbo-A model are both cosmetic and mechanical. The standard CT-26 turbo had a slightly larger inducer and can be identified by a stamped \"E\" on the raised casting on the compressor housing. The Turbo-A had a {{convert|65|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide throttle body and accompanied a larger diameter \"blank\" crossover pipe, instead of the standard [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTE]] {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} throttle body and original \"3000\" cast pipe. The Turbo-A also benefited from a larger volume steel air cleaner instead of the factory plastic unit, as well as thicker roll bars and ventilated brake discs all-round.\n\nThe fuel management used a MAP system, instead of the standard Karmen Vortex AFM. The front nose features an additional \"Turbo A duct\" to add airflow to the top area of the intercooler. Also unique was the side decal and rear badging (\"3.0GT Turbo A\") and a black paint job (paint code 202). All cars came standard with grey leather interior featuring a [[Momo (company)|MOMO]]-sourced steering wheel and shift knob. It is powered by a {{convert|204|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} Toyota [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTEU]] engine. It is important to note that the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTEU]] was standard in all Japanese MA70 models and is not unique to the Turbo-A. The \"U\" designation meant the engine came equipped with a catalytic converter as per Japan emission laws.\n\n[[File:Toyota Supra Smith & Morgan (16332526755).jpg|thumb|Toyota Supra MA70 Group-A in 1991 at Bathurst]]\n\nThe Group-A MA70 Supra had varying degrees of success in various fields such as Rally and 24HR, but is most known for its participation in the [[Japanese Touring Car Championship]] (JTCC). In the JTCC, the Supra did not win as many races as intended, which is primarily judged on the fact it was underdeveloped and its placement in a higher tier division under regulations because of the 3.0-litre engine displacement, imposing the Toyota with the performance inhibition of running with a higher curb weight and less power compared to the rest of its class.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Both the [[TOM'S]] and [[SARD]] teams fared well in results in the (JTCC) with the [[TOM'S]] team winning on its debut in 1987, before abruptly ending their (JTCC) career with the MA70 Group-A in 1989.\nUpon its initial [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (ATCC) debut in 1989, the Group-A Supra failed to finish its first race. With DNF's becoming a regular upset owing to the lack of power and heavy weight of the Supra, it began to strike doubt in the car's capability of success in the (ATCC) which suffered increasingly due to constant rules and regulation changes issuing a red-faced outcome against its main rivals like the [[Ford Sierra Cosworth|Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500]], Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R and the [[BMW M3#E30 M3|BMW M3 (E30)]] which were lighter, more powerful, and had smaller displacement engines. Hopes would further diminish for Toyota in the top division by the introduction of the domineering [[Nissan Skyline GT-R#R32|Nissan Skyline GT-R (R32)]] in the (JTCC) in 1989 and the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (ATCC) in 1990. Toyota in 1991 would switch to racing the Corolla Levin instead in the lower tier divisions, while many privateer teams soldiered on with the Supra until the Group A racing's final demise in 1993. It is said that than a handful of Group-A MA70's remain in existence after being returned to Japan to be destroyed once the Group-A racing ended. One of those known to be intact was retained by an original driver and privateer of the (ATCC) John Smith in Australia, which still sees track time and limelight at car shows today.\n\nOnly eleven MA70 Group-A cars were built by [[Toyota Racing Development|TRD]] Japan for homologation racing. A few out of many special developed parts that were fitted to the various Group-A race cars happen to include a cast magnesium nine litre oil pan with matching high flow oil pump, 288 camshafts with 10.88mm lift, Hollinger close proportion 5-speed gear-set in the R154 case, Harrop 4 piston brake calipers with 15.5 \u2033 (393&nbsp;mm) rotors, and TRD-sourced torque-vectoring mechanical limited-slip differential with 50:50 left:right lockup on full throttle. TRD was also responsible for the thick rear-anti squat tram-rods which were integral to the multi-link rear suspension setup to control rear squat under hard acceleration and launching.\n\n=== Powertrain ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Code\n!Year\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Transmission\n!Market\n|-\n!rowspan=2|MA70\n|rowspan=2|February 1986 \u2013 May 1993\n|{{convert|2954|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|Toyota 7M-GE]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|{{convert|149|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|196|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic\n|Canada, Europe, United States and Australia\n|-\n|{{convert|2954|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota M engine#7M-GTE|7M-GTE]] [[turbo]] I6\n|{{convert|173|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|254|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=16093 |work=carfolio |title=1988 Toyota Turbo specifications |date=3 March 2013 |access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n|5-speed [[Toyota R transmission#R154|R154]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic\n|Canada, Europe, Japan and United States\n|-\n!rowspan=2|GA70\n|rowspan=2|February 1986 \u2013 1992\n|{{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota G engine#1G-GEU|1G-GEU]] I6\n|{{convert|160|PS|kW hp PS|abbr=on|0|order=out}}\n|{{convert|130|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic\n|Japan\n|-\n|{{convert|1988|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota G engine#1G-GTE|1G-GTE]] [[twin-turbo#Parallel twin-turbo|twin-turbocharged]] I6\n|{{convert|210|PS|kW hp PS|abbr=on|0|order=out}}\n|{{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]] automatic\n|Japan\n|-\n!JZA70\n|1990\u20131993\n|{{convert|2491|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Toyota JZ engine#1JZ|1JZ-GTE]] twin-turbocharged I6\n|{{convert|280|PS|kW hp PS|abbr=on|0|order=out}}\n|{{convert|268|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed [[Toyota R transmission#R154|R154]] manual<br>4-speed [[Toyota A transmission#A340E|A340E]]<nowiki/> automatic\n|Japan\n|}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|A80}} Fourth generation (A80) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fourth generation (A80)\n| image = 1994 Toyota Supra Sport Roof in Red, front left.jpg\n| caption = \n| production = April 1993<ref name=\"supras1\">{{cite web|url=http://mkiv.supras.org.nz/specs.htm|title=Toyota Supra A80 : A80 Specifications|publisher=Mkiv.supras.org.nz|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> \u2013 August 2002\n| assembly = {{unbulleted list \n|Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi|Toyota City, Aichi]] ([[Motomachi plant]];

By the middle of 1990, a final A80 design concept from Toyota Technical Centre Aichi was approved and frozen for production in late 1990. The first test mules were hand-built in A70 bodies during late 1990, followed by the first A80 prototypes being hand-assembled in 1991. Again using subframe, suspension, and drivetrain assemblies from the [[Toyota Soarer#Z30|Z30 Soarer]] ([[Lexus SC#SC400|Lexus SC300/400]]), pre-production of the test models started in December 1992 with 20 units,<ref name=\"supras1\"/> and official mass production began in April 1993.<ref name=\"supras1\"/> The fourth generation of the Supra again shared its platform with the upscale Soarer coup\u00e9, sold in the U.S. as the Lexus SC. Although the two cars looked similar, the new Supra was more than 13 inches (340&nbsp;mm) shorter than its luxurious cousin.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://parts.olathetoyota.com/blog/5066/4th-gen-supra-history |title=Toyota's 4th Generation Supra History |work=Toyota Parts Blog |publisher=Toyota |location=Olathe, US |access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref> The rounded styling, while modern, does seem to borrow some elements from Toyota's first grand touring sports car, the 2000GT.\n\nThis redesign saw Toyota placing great emphasis on a more serious high-performance car. It featured two new engines: a [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] [[Toyota JZ engine#2JZ-GE|Toyota 2JZ-GE]] having a power output of {{convert|164|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,800 rpm and {{convert|210|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm of torque and a [[twin-turbo#Sequential twin-turbo|twin turbocharged]] [[Toyota JZ engine#2JZ-GTE|Toyota 2JZ-GTE]] having a power output of {{convert|206|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|318|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque for the Japanese model. For the export model (American/European markets) Toyota upgraded the Supra turbo's engine (by installing smaller, steel wheeled [[turbocharger]]s and bigger fuel injectors, etc.). This increased the power output to {{convert|239|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}}at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|315|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000 rpm ({{convert|243|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|325|lbft|0|abbr=on}} for European markets) Upon its launch in 1993, it was the first Toyota-badged vehicle to include a passenger airbag as standard (US-market only).<ref name=\"supras1\"/>\n\nThe turbocharged variant could accelerate to 97&nbsp;km/h in as low as 4.6 seconds and cover 1/4-mile (402 m) in 13.1 seconds at {{convert|109|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"cd93\">{{cite journal |url=http://mkiv.com/publications/car&driver/3_93/6-cd3-93.jpg |title=Toyota Supra Turbo: Think of it as a Lexus for Smokey Yunick |accessdate=27 April 2013 |format=JPG |year=1993 |issue=March |page=41 |work=[[Car and Driver]]}}</ref> The turbo version has a tested top speed of {{convert|285|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}, but the cars are restricted to just {{convert|180|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in Japan and {{convert|250|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in worldwide markets. European versions of the car also had an air intake or scoop on the [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]]. It has a {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.31}} for the naturally aspirated models and 0.32 for the turbo models but unknown with the rear spoiler.\n\nThe twin turbochargers operated in sequential mode instead of parallel. Initially, all of the exhaust gases are routed to the first turbine for reduced lag. This resulted in boost and enhanced torque as early as 1,800 rpm, where it already produced {{convert|300|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. At 3,500 rpm, some of the exhaust gases are routed to the second turbine for a \"pre-boost\" mode, although none of the compressor output is used by the engine at this point. At 4,000 rpm, the second turbo's output is used to augment the first turbo's output. Compared to the parallel mode, sequential mode turbo chargers provide quicker low RPM response and increased high RPM boost. This high RPM boost was also aided with technology originally present in the [[Toyota M engine#7M-GE|7M-GE]] in the form of the [[Acoustic Control Induction System]] (ACIS) which is a way of managing the air compression pulses within the intake piping as to increase power.\n\nFor this generation, the Supra received a new six-speed [[Getrag]]/Toyota ''V160'' gearbox on the turbo models while the naturally aspirated models were equipped with a five-speed manual [[Toyota W Transmission#W58|W58]] transmission, revised from the previous model. Each model was offered with a four-speed automatic with manual shifting mode. All vehicles were equipped with five-spoke aluminum alloy wheels, the naturally aspirated models had 16-inch wheels and the turbo models had 17-inch wheels. The difference in wheel size was to accommodate the larger brakes equipped as standard onto the turbo model, but in Japan were optional extras. Both models had a space saver spare tyre on a steel rim to save both space and weight.\n\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1994 Toyota Supra Sport Roof in Red, rear left.jpg\n| caption1 = Rear view \n| image2 = MKIV Cockpit.JPG\n| caption2 = Interior\n}}\n\nToyota took measures to reduce the weight of this new model. Aluminium was used for the hood, targa top (when fitted), front crossmember, oil and transmission pans, and forged upper suspension A-arms. Other measures included hollow carpet fibers, magnesium-alloy steering wheel, plastic gas tank and lid, dished out head bolts, gas injected rear spoiler, and a single pipe exhaust. Despite having more features such as dual airbags, traction control, larger brakes, wheels, tires, and an additional turbocharger, the car was at least {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} lighter than its predecessor. The base model with a manual transmission had a curb weight of {{convert|3210|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The targa top added {{convert|40|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} of weight while the automatic transmission added {{convert|55|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The fourth generation model had a 51:49 (front:rear) weight distribution. The turbo model weighed {{convert|3450|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} with a manual transmission while the automatic added another {{convert|10|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} to the overall weight. Weight distribution was 53% front/47% rear. The Supra was heavier than the spartan [[Mazda RX-7]] and all aluminium bodied [[Honda NSX|Acura/Honda NSX]], but was lighter than the [[Mitsubishi GTO|Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-reviews/car-comparison-tests/the-300-horsepower-club?click=main_sr |title=The 300 Horsepower Club |journal=Road & Track |date=26 March 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the 1996 model year in the US, the turbo model was only available with the automatic transmission owing to [[OBD-II]] certification requirements. The targa roof was also made standard on all turbo models. For 1997, manual transmission returned for the optional engine along with a redesign of the tail lights, headlights, front fascia, polished wheels, and other minor changes such as the radio and steering wheel designs. All 1997 models included badges indicating \"Limited Edition 15th Anniversary\". All turbo models came standard with the rear spoiler. For 1998, updates were a 3-spoke steering wheel, a redesigned radio, and VVT-i on the normally aspirated engine. In Japan, the turbo engines were installed with VVT-i. The SZ-R model was also updated with the introduction of a six-speed [[Getrag]] V161 transmission, the same used for the twin-turbo RZ models.\n\nThe standard A80 Supra chassis has also proven an effective platform for roadracing, with several top 20 and top 10 One Lap of America finishes in the SSGT1 class. In 1994, the A80 managed remarkable [[skidpad]] ratings of 0.95 lateral g's (200&nbsp;ft) and 0.98 lateral g's (300&nbsp;ft)<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://mkiv.com/publications/road&track/3_93/rt393_06.jpg |title=1993 Supra Turbo |work=Road & Track |year=1993 |issue=March |accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> The Supra also featured a four-sensor four-channel track tuned ABS system with yaw control whereby each caliper is sensored and the brakes are controlled individually according to the speed, angle, and pitch of the approaching corner.
