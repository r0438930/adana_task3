Stephen |title=The Difference Between a Cook and a Chef |url=https://www.reluctantgourmet.com/difference-cook-chef/ |website=The Reluctant Gourmet |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref> and writer frequently appearing on television, at cookery demonstrations and in print with Major [[Johnnie Cradock]] who played the part of a slightly bumbling hen-pecked husband.\n\n==Early life==\nCradock's family background was one of respectable middle-class trade; her ancestors included the Pecheys (corn merchants and churchmen), the Vallentines (distillers) and the Hulberts (cabinet makers). She was the daughter of the novelist and lyricist [[Archibald Thomas Pechey]] and Bijou Sortain Hancock.\n\nCradock was born at her maternal grandparents' house, 33 Fairlop Road, Leytonstone. The birth was formally registered in London, in the district of [[West Ham]].<ref>GRO Register of Births: June Qtr, 1909, Phyllis Nan S. Pechey, at W. Ham, vol 4a, page 369</ref>\n\nAs a child, Cradock lived with her family at Fairlop Road, with her maternal grandparents. A plaque (with her name misspelled) can be found at Fairwood Court, Fairlop Road, London E11: \"Fanny Craddock 1909\u20131994. On this site until 1930 stood a house called Apthorp, birthplace of the famous TV cookery expert Fanny Craddock; born Phyllis Pechey.\"\n\nHer birthplace was named after Apthorp Villa, in Weston, Somerset, where her grandfather Charles Hancock had been born. Cradock's parents did not manage their money well; her mother, Bijou, spent extravagantly, and her father, Archibald, had sizeable gambling debts, many run up in [[Nice]]. In attempting to keep their creditors at bay, the family moved around the country, going to [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] in Kent, then to [[Swanage]] in Dorset and on to [[Bournemouth]] in [[Dorset]], where Archibald's brother, Richard Francis Pechey (1872\u20131963), had become the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in 1912.<ref>Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1923, page 1173-74</ref> Whilst in Bournemouth the 15-year-old Fanny attended Bournemouth High School (now Talbot Heath School).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/snapshotsofthepast/8489059.Bournemouth__a_town_with_so_much_character_/ |title=Bournemouth: a town with so much character! (From Bournemouth Echo) |publisher=Bournemouthecho.co.uk |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nArchibald moved the family again to [[Wroxham]] in Norfolk, c. 1927, where his creditors caught up with him and by 1930 he was appearing in Norfolk's bankruptcy court faced with debts of \u00a33,500. Cradock began the next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling cleaning products door to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop.\n\n==Culinary career==\nCradock's fortunes began to change when she started work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of [[Auguste Escoffier]]. She later wrote passionately about the change from ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' to ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.\n\nFanny and Johnnie Cradock began writing a column under the pen name of \"Bon Viveur\"<ref>The Cradocks were still using this byline at the end of their ''Telegraph'' career (Daily Telegraph Cooks' Book, London, W. H. Allen, 1978 {{ISBN|0-491-02472-X}}</ref> which appeared in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1950 to 1955. This sparked a theatre career, with the pair turning theatres into restaurants. Cradock would cook vast dishes that were served to the audience. They became known for their roast turkey, complete with stuffed head, tail feathers and wings. Complete with French accents, their act was one of a drunken hen-pecked husband and a domineering wife. At this time, they were known as Major and Mrs Cradock. She also wrote books under the names Frances Dale and Phyllis Cradock.\n\n==TV personality==\nIn 1955 Cradock recorded a pilot for what became a very successful [[BBC]] television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving a detailed account of every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, \"You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now.\" Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included \"This won't break you\", \"This is perfectly economical\", and \"This won't stretch your purse\". When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying \"But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4JFoyshIAM |title=Fanny Cradock Cooks For Christmas- Christmas Cakes part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs time went by, however, her food began to seem outdated, with her love of the [[piping bag]] and [[food coloring|vegetable dyes]]. As she grew older, she applied more and more make-up and wore vast [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] ballgowns on screen. Cradock had always included relatives and friends in her television shows. Johnnie suffered a minor heart attack in the early 1970s and was replaced with the daughter of a friend, Jayne. Another assistant was Sarah, and there was a series of young men who didn't last very long.\nThroughout her television career the Cradocks also worked for the British Gas Council, appearing at trade shows such as the Ideal Home Exhibition and making many \"infomercials,\" instructing cooks, usually newlywed women, on how to use gas cookers for basic dishes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T89IoUN43s |title=Kitchen Magic - Fanny Cradock (1963) Gas Council film NEW TRANSFER |publisher=YouTube |date=24 January 2015 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Despite the BBC's ban on advertising, Cradock used only gas stoves in her television shows and often stated that she \"hated\" electric stoves and ovens.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6i4IdtC4w |title=Fanny Cradock on TV-am \u2013 1985 |publisher=YouTube |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nHer series ''Fanny Cradock Cooks for Christmas'' is the only one of several she made to have survived in the TV archives and to have been repeated in recent years, on the UK digital television channels [[BBC4]], [[Good Food]] and [[Food Network|Food Network UK]], usually in the run-up to Christmas.

Troake was to organise a three-course Foyle's Literary Lunch at the Devonshire Hotel in honour of the former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], with [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and other dignitaries in attendance, and asked Fanny Cradock, by then a [[tax exile]] in Ireland, along with chef Eugene Kaufeler, actor and gourmet [[Robert Morley]], nutritionist Magnus Pyke and many other experts Troake admired to advise her.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/18e2f08ab23d45db8e4632e48f7d1e70 |title=The Big Time: 3: Gwen Troake 's Banquet |publisher=BBC One London |date=11 November 1976 |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe result brought the end of Fanny Cradock's television career.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/3340924/Fanny-Cradock-a-Christmas-cracker.html |title=Fanny Cradock - a Christmas cracker |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> Troake went through her menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with a lemon jelly-and-cornstarch fortified [[bramble]] sauce and coffee cream dessert with rum.  Her idea was that with seafood, water fowl and rum, the meal had a nautical \"theme,\" which would appeal to Mr Heath\u2019s love of sailing and also be an appropriate salute to the former Admiral Mountbatten.  Cradock, grimacing and acting as if on the verge of gagging, told Troake that her menu was far too rich and she would \"never in a million years\" serve a seafood cocktail before a duck. She appeared not to be familiar with the term \"bramble,\" and when told it meant a blackberry, was horrified that it would be paired with a savoury duck, remonstrated that a sauce like that should be brushed on flan.  She derisively declared that the jam in it was \"too English\" and that the [[English people|English]] had never had a cuisine, erroneously claimed that \"[[Yorkshire pudding]] came from [[Burgundy]]\". While accepting that Troake's dessert was delicious, she insisted that it was not suitable, as it was \"too sickly\" served after the sweetly-sauced, rich duck, countering Troake's numerous objections with \"Yes, dear, but now you're among professionals.\"\n\nFanny suggested that unless Troake were to serve salad and cheese afterward, as is done in France, then she should use small almond pastry barquettes filled with a palate-cleansing fruit sorbet with spun sugar sails - equally suitable for the naval theme. Troake kept insisting that she liked her signature coffee pudding with \"nautical\" rum in it, while Cradock appealed to her to think of her diners' taste buds and stomachs, and try to achieve a balance in her menu.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW-2fclfRpI |title=Fanny Cradock on The Big Time |publisher=YouTube |date=Jan 30, 2008|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> Unfortunately, the replacement dessert was not executed properly, and Morley said he felt that Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.\n\nThe public were incensed at her eye-rolling rudeness and condescension, and felt that Fanny Cradock had ruined Troake's special day. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote \"Not since 1940 can the people of England have risen in such unified wrath....\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/8a439957b53d49d0b710d199623c076e|title=The Big Time|date=1 December 1977|publisher=|issue=2821|pages=61|accessdate=13 December 2018|via=BBC Genome}}</ref> Fanny wrote a letter of apology to Troake, but the BBC terminated her contract two weeks after the broadcast of the programme.

J. Chapman, mmn = Primrose-Pechey</ref> but their marriage lasted less than a year before they separated. Cradock left her son Christopher and husband Arthur for a new life in Central London. Christopher was brought up in Norfolk by his father, an aunt and grandmother, although he made contact with Fanny in his adult life. Arthur Chapman became a Catholic and so would not give Fanny the divorce she later requested, as it was against the teachings of the Catholic Church. He was given only a single line in Fanny's autobiography.\n\nCradock married again on 26 September 1939, as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Chapman\"; her husband this time was Gregory Holden-Dye, a daredevil minor racing driver, driving Bentleys at [[Brooklands]] in Surrey.<ref>Marriage: 1939, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. Chapman & Gregory L. E. Holden-Dye, in Fulham, London, vol 1a, page 1615</ref> The marriage lasted only eight weeks, and produced no children, as she had soon met the love of her life  Johnnie Cradock. Gregory's mother had expressed a low opinion of Fanny, and ended up as a loathsome character in Fanny's first novel ''Scorpion's Suicide''. Cradock later concluded that as Arthur Chapman had not granted her a divorce, her marriage to Gregory was not lawful, and so never publicised it.\n\nJohn Whitby Cradock was a major in the [[Royal Artillery]] who was already married with four children. He soon left his wife, Ethel, and children to be with Fanny. Unable to marry Johnnie, because of Arthur's refusal to get divorced, she changed her surname to Cradock by deed poll in 1942. When she was misinformed that Arthur had died, she married Johnnie on 7 May 1977.<ref>Marriage: 1977, June Qtr, Phyllis Chapman & John Cradock, in Surrey South Western, vol 17, page 1154</ref> (Arthur actually lived until 1978.) For this marriage Cradock went with a pared down version of her name (\"Phyllis Chapman\"), and the then 68-year-old recorded her age as 55 on the marriage certificate, even though she had a son who was nearly fifty.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/livesandtimes/Fanny-Cradock.2809175.jp |title=Fanny Cradock - People - Scotsman.com |publisher=Heritage.scotsman.com |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nShe died following a stroke on 27 December 1994; the cause of death was cited as 'cerebrovascular atherosclerosis'. Both Fanny and Johnnie were cremated at [[Langney|Langney Crematorium]], [[Eastbourne]]. There is a memorial plaque and a rosebush in the grounds of the crematorium for both of them.\n\n==Legacy==\nFanny Cradock came to the attention of the public in the postwar-utility years, trying to inspire the average housewife with an exotic approach to cooking.<ref>'Something's Burning: The Autobiography of Two Cooks\u2019 by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (1960)</ref> She famously worked in various ball-gowns without the customary cook's apron, averring that women should feel cooking was easy and enjoyable, rather than messy and intimidating.<ref>\u2019Fabulous Fanny Cradock: TV's Outrageous Queen of Cuisine\u2019 by Clive Ellis</ref>\n\nIn her early anonymous role as a food critic, working with Major Cradock under the name of 'Bon Viveur',<ref>''The Daily Telegraph Cook's Book'' by Bon Viveur (1964)</ref> Fanny introduced the public to unusual dishes from France and Italy, popularising the [[pizza]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>''Common Market Cookery: France'' by Fanny Cradock (22 Nov 1973)</ref> She and Johnny worked together on a touring cookery show, sponsored by the Gas Council, to show how gas could be used easily in the kitchen and, as their fame increased, Fanny's shows transferred to television, where she enjoyed 20 years of success.<ref>''Time to Remember: A Cook for All Seasons'' by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (10 Aug 1981)</ref>\n\nIn the course of her shows Fanny made frequent concessions to the economic realities of the era, suggesting cheaper alternatives which would be within reach of the housewife's purse. The BBC published her recipes and suggestions for dinner-parties in a series of booklets, consolidating her reputation as the foremost celebrity chef of her day.<ref>\u2018Giving a Dinner Party\u2019 (Publications/British Broadcasting Corporation) by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (Jun 1969)</ref>\n\n[[Marguerite Patten]] has described Fanny Cradock as the saviour of British cooking after the war. [[Brian Turner (chef)|Brian Turner]] has said that he respects Fanny's career and [[Delia Smith]] has attributed her own career to early inspirations taken from the Cradocks' television programmes. Others are less complimentary and in the BBC series ''The Way We Cooked'' in an episode dedicated to Cradock and [[Graham Kerr]], [[Keith Floyd]] and [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]], amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skill. Despite their extravagant appearance and eccentricity, her recipes were extremely widely used and her [[cookery]] books sold in record numbers. In the third series of ''[[The F Word (TV series)|The F Word]]'', [[Gordon Ramsay]] held a series-long search for a new Fanny Cradock.\n\n==Media portrayals==\nFanny Cradock's husky voice and theatrical style was ripe for mimicry, such as [[Betty Marsden]]'s 'Fanny Haddock' in two BBC Radio comedy shows, ''[[Beyond our Ken]]'' (1958\u201364) and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964\u201368). Fanny and Johnnie were also parodied by ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' and on ''[[Benny Hill]]'', with Benny as Fanny and [[Bob Todd]] as an invariably drunk Johnnie.\n\nCradock's life has also been the subject of the plays ''Doughnuts Like Fanny's'' by [[Julia Darling]] and ''Fear of Fanny'' by Brian Fillis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodhallagency.com/index.php?art_id=000432 |title=The Knight Hall Agency Limited |publisher=Rodhallagency.com |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> After a successful run by the Leeds Library Theatre Company, touring the United Kingdom in October and November 2003, ''Fear of Fanny'' was turned into a television drama starring [[Mark Gatiss]] and [[Julia Davis]] and featuring [[Hayley Atwell]].

She was the daughter of the novelist and lyricist [[Archibald Thomas Pechey]] and Bijou Sortain Hancock.\n\nCradock was born at her maternal grandparents' house, 33 Fairlop Road, Leytonstone. The birth was formally registered in London, in the district of [[West Ham]].<ref>GRO Register of Births: June Qtr, 1909, Phyllis Nan S. Pechey, at W. Ham, vol 4a, page 369</ref>\n\nAs a child, Cradock lived with her family at Fairlop Road, with her maternal grandparents. A plaque (with her name misspelled) can be found at Fairwood Court, Fairlop Road, London E11: \"Fanny Craddock 1909\u20131994. On this site until 1930 stood a house called Apthorp, birthplace of the famous TV cookery expert Fanny Craddock; born Phyllis Pechey.\"\n\nHer birthplace was named after Apthorp Villa, in Weston, Somerset, where her grandfather Charles Hancock had been born. Cradock's parents did not manage their money well; her mother, Bijou, spent extravagantly, and her father, Archibald, had sizeable gambling debts, many run up in [[Nice]]. In attempting to keep their creditors at bay, the family moved around the country, going to [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] in Kent, then to [[Swanage]] in Dorset and on to [[Bournemouth]] in [[Dorset]], where Archibald's brother, Richard Francis Pechey (1872\u20131963), had become the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in 1912.<ref>Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1923, page 1173-74</ref> Whilst in Bournemouth the 15-year-old Fanny attended Bournemouth High School (now Talbot Heath School).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/snapshotsofthepast/8489059.Bournemouth__a_town_with_so_much_character_/ |title=Bournemouth: a town with so much character!

Cradock began the next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling cleaning products door to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop.\n\n==Culinary career==\nCradock's fortunes began to change when she started work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of [[Auguste Escoffier]]. She later wrote passionately about the change from ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' to ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.\n\nFanny and Johnnie Cradock began writing a column under the pen name of \"Bon Viveur\"<ref>The Cradocks were still using this byline at the end of their ''Telegraph'' career (Daily Telegraph Cooks' Book, London, W. H. Allen, 1978 {{ISBN|0-491-02472-X}}</ref> which appeared in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1950 to 1955. This sparked a theatre career, with the pair turning theatres into restaurants. Cradock would cook vast dishes that were served to the audience. They became known for their roast turkey, complete with stuffed head, tail feathers and wings. Complete with French accents, their act was one of a drunken hen-pecked husband and a domineering wife. At this time, they were known as Major and Mrs Cradock. She also wrote books under the names Frances Dale and Phyllis Cradock.\n\n==TV personality==\nIn 1955 Cradock recorded a pilot for what became a very successful [[BBC]] television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving a detailed account of every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, \"You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now.\" Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included \"This won't break you\", \"This is perfectly economical\", and \"This won't stretch your purse\". When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying \"But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4JFoyshIAM |title=Fanny Cradock Cooks For Christmas- Christmas Cakes part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs time went by, however, her food began to seem outdated, with her love of the [[piping bag]] and [[food coloring|vegetable dyes]]. As she grew older, she applied more and more make-up and wore vast [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] ballgowns on screen. Cradock had always included relatives and friends in her television shows. Johnnie suffered a minor heart attack in the early 1970s and was replaced with the daughter of a friend, Jayne.

Troake was to organise a three-course Foyle's Literary Lunch at the Devonshire Hotel in honour of the former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], with [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and other dignitaries in attendance, and asked Fanny Cradock, by then a [[tax exile]] in Ireland, along with chef Eugene Kaufeler, actor and gourmet [[Robert Morley]], nutritionist Magnus Pyke and many other experts Troake admired to advise her.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/18e2f08ab23d45db8e4632e48f7d1e70 |title=The Big Time: 3: Gwen Troake 's Banquet |publisher=BBC One London |date=11 November 1976 |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe result brought the end of Fanny Cradock's television career.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/3340924/Fanny-Cradock-a-Christmas-cracker.html |title=Fanny Cradock - a Christmas cracker |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> Troake went through her menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with a lemon jelly-and-cornstarch fortified [[bramble]] sauce and coffee cream dessert with rum.  Her idea was that with seafood, water fowl and rum, the meal had a nautical \"theme,\" which would appeal to Mr Heath\u2019s love of sailing and also be an appropriate salute to the former Admiral Mountbatten.  Cradock, grimacing and acting as if on the verge of gagging, told Troake that her menu was far too rich and she would \"never in a million years\" serve a seafood cocktail before a duck. She appeared not to be familiar with the term \"bramble,\" and when told it meant a blackberry, was horrified that it would be paired with a savoury duck, remonstrated that a sauce like that should be brushed on flan.  She derisively declared that the jam in it was \"too English\" and that the [[English people|English]] had never had a cuisine, erroneously claimed that \"[[Yorkshire pudding]] came from [[Burgundy]]\". While accepting that Troake's dessert was delicious, she insisted that it was not suitable, as it was \"too sickly\" served after the sweetly-sauced, rich duck, countering Troake's numerous objections with \"Yes, dear, but now you're among professionals.\"\n\nFanny suggested that unless Troake were to serve salad and cheese afterward, as is done in France, then she should use small almond pastry barquettes filled with a palate-cleansing fruit sorbet with spun sugar sails - equally suitable for the naval theme. Troake kept insisting that she liked her signature coffee pudding with \"nautical\" rum in it, while Cradock appealed to her to think of her diners' taste buds and stomachs, and try to achieve a balance in her menu.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW-2fclfRpI |title=Fanny Cradock on The Big Time |publisher=YouTube |date=Jan 30, 2008|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> Unfortunately, the replacement dessert was not executed properly, and Morley said he felt that Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.\n\nThe public were incensed at her eye-rolling rudeness and condescension, and felt that Fanny Cradock had ruined Troake's special day.

Fanny appeared alone on ''[[Wogan]]'', ''Parkinson'' and ''[[TV-am]]''. When she appeared on the television chat show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' with [[Danny La Rue]] and it was revealed to her that La Rue was actually a female impersonator, she stormed off the set.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/sep/10/broadcasting.uknews | title=Secret drugs menu of TV chef Fanny | publisher=The Guardian | date=10 September 2006 | accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> Her final [[BBC]] appearance and her final television appearance was in early 1988 on ''Windmill'' presented by Chris Serle.\n\n==Personal life==\nCradock married four times, twice bigamously.

Evans, in Sheppey,  Kent, vol 2a, page 2368a</ref> Cradock married as \"Phyllis Nan Primrose Pechey\"; \"Primrose Pechey\" was a form passed down her father's side.

Evans, mmn = Primrose-Pechey or Pechey</ref> who was adopted by his grandparents. Thanks to Johnnie Cradock, Peter later became a [[sous-chef]] at the [[Dorchester Hotel]].\n\nBy July of the following year Cradock had become pregnant again, and married the baby's father Arthur William Chapman on 23 July.<ref>Marriage: 1928, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. V. Evans & Arthur W. Chapman, in Norwich, Norfolk, vol 4b, page 316</ref> For this marriage Cradock gave her name as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Vernon Evans.\"\n\nThe couple had a son Christopher,<ref>GRO Register of Births: SEP 1929 4b 422 DOWNHAM \u2013 Christopher A. J. Chapman, mmn = Primrose-Pechey</ref> but their marriage lasted less than a year before they separated. Cradock left her son Christopher and husband Arthur for a new life in Central London. Christopher was brought up in Norfolk by his father, an aunt and grandmother, although he made contact with Fanny in his adult life. Arthur Chapman became a Catholic and so would not give Fanny the divorce she later requested, as it was against the teachings of the Catholic Church. He was given only a single line in Fanny's autobiography.\n\nCradock married again on 26 September 1939, as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Chapman\"; her husband this time was Gregory Holden-Dye, a daredevil minor racing driver, driving Bentleys at [[Brooklands]] in Surrey.<ref>Marriage: 1939, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. Chapman & Gregory L. E. Holden-Dye, in Fulham, London, vol 1a, page 1615</ref> The marriage lasted only eight weeks, and produced no children, as she had soon met the love of her life  Johnnie Cradock. Gregory's mother had expressed a low opinion of Fanny, and ended up as a loathsome character in Fanny's first novel ''Scorpion's Suicide''. Cradock later concluded that as Arthur Chapman had not granted her a divorce, her marriage to Gregory was not lawful, and so never publicised it.\n\nJohn Whitby Cradock was a major in the [[Royal Artillery]] who was already married with four children. He soon left his wife, Ethel, and children to be with Fanny. Unable to marry Johnnie, because of Arthur's refusal to get divorced, she changed her surname to Cradock by deed poll in 1942. When she was misinformed that Arthur had died, she married Johnnie on 7 May 1977.<ref>Marriage: 1977, June Qtr, Phyllis Chapman & John Cradock, in Surrey South Western, vol 17, page 1154</ref> (Arthur actually lived until 1978.) For this marriage Cradock went with a pared down version of her name (\"Phyllis Chapman\"), and the then 68-year-old recorded her age as 55 on the marriage certificate, even though she had a son who was nearly fifty.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/livesandtimes/Fanny-Cradock.2809175.jp |title=Fanny Cradock - People - Scotsman.com |publisher=Heritage.scotsman.com |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nShe died following a stroke on 27 December 1994; the cause of death was cited as 'cerebrovascular atherosclerosis'. Both Fanny and Johnnie were cremated at [[Langney|Langney Crematorium]], [[Eastbourne]]. There is a memorial plaque and a rosebush in the grounds of the crematorium for both of them.\n\n==Legacy==\nFanny Cradock came to the attention of the public in the postwar-utility years, trying to inspire the average housewife with an exotic approach to cooking.<ref>'Something's Burning: The Autobiography of Two Cooks\u2019 by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (1960)</ref> She famously worked in various ball-gowns without the customary cook's apron, averring that women should feel cooking was easy and enjoyable, rather than messy and intimidating.<ref>\u2019Fabulous Fanny Cradock: TV's Outrageous Queen of Cuisine\u2019 by Clive Ellis</ref>\n\nIn her early anonymous role as a food critic, working with Major Cradock under the name of 'Bon Viveur',<ref>''The Daily Telegraph Cook's Book'' by Bon Viveur (1964)</ref> Fanny introduced the public to unusual dishes from France and Italy, popularising the [[pizza]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>''Common Market Cookery: France'' by Fanny Cradock (22 Nov 1973)</ref> She and Johnny worked together on a touring cookery show, sponsored by the Gas Council, to show how gas could be used easily in the kitchen and, as their fame increased, Fanny's shows transferred to television, where she enjoyed 20 years of success.<ref>''Time to Remember: A Cook for All Seasons'' by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (10 Aug 1981)</ref>\n\nIn the course of her shows Fanny made frequent concessions to the economic realities of the era, suggesting cheaper alternatives which would be within reach of the housewife's purse. The BBC published her recipes and suggestions for dinner-parties in a series of booklets, consolidating her reputation as the foremost celebrity chef of her day.<ref>\u2018Giving a Dinner Party\u2019 (Publications/British Broadcasting Corporation) by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (Jun 1969)</ref>\n\n[[Marguerite Patten]] has described Fanny Cradock as the saviour of British cooking after the war. [[Brian Turner (chef)|Brian Turner]] has said that he respects Fanny's career and [[Delia Smith]] has attributed her own career to early inspirations taken from the Cradocks' television programmes. Others are less complimentary and in the BBC series ''The Way We Cooked'' in an episode dedicated to Cradock and [[Graham Kerr]], [[Keith Floyd]] and [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]], amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skill. Despite their extravagant appearance and eccentricity, her recipes were extremely widely used and her [[cookery]] books sold in record numbers. In the third series of ''[[The F Word (TV series)|The F Word]]'', [[Gordon Ramsay]] held a series-long search for a new Fanny Cradock.\n\n==Media portrayals==\nFanny Cradock's husky voice and theatrical style was ripe for mimicry, such as [[Betty Marsden]]'s 'Fanny Haddock' in two BBC Radio comedy shows, ''[[Beyond our Ken]]'' (1958\u201364) and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964\u201368). Fanny and Johnnie were also parodied by ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' and on ''[[Benny Hill]]'', with Benny as Fanny and [[Bob Todd]] as an invariably drunk Johnnie.\n\nCradock's life has also been the subject of the plays ''Doughnuts Like Fanny's'' by [[Julia Darling]] and ''Fear of Fanny'' by Brian Fillis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodhallagency.com/index.php?art_id=000432 |title=The Knight Hall Agency Limited |publisher=Rodhallagency.com |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> After a successful run by the Leeds Library Theatre Company, touring the United Kingdom in October and November 2003, ''Fear of Fanny'' was turned into a television drama starring [[Mark Gatiss]] and [[Julia Davis]] and featuring [[Hayley Atwell]].
