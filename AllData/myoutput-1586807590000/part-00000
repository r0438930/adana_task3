Ovechkin has denied that version of events, while Malkin confirmed it. On 21 January 2008, in Pittsburgh, Ovechkin took a run at Malkin, which would have seemingly resulted in a devastating hit had Malkin not ducked out of the way just in time. The two would also not make eye contact at the 2008 NHL Awards Ceremony. Ovechkin has repeatedly denied \"having it out\" for Malkin.<ref name=\"Ovechkin/Malkin Feud\" />\n\nThe feud raised many concerns as to its effect on the league,<ref name=\"Ovechkin/Malkin Feud\" /> and the Russian national team at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.canadaeast.com/qmjhl/article/article/539330|title=Ovechkin Malkin feud turns nasty|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=3 February 2009|agency=Associated Press}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> On 24 January 2009, at the [[NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition|SuperSkills Competition]], Malkin assisted Ovechkin in his stunt during the [[NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition#Breakaway Challenge|Breakaway Challenge]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/penguins/s_608711.html|title=Malkin, Ovechkin put feud to rest|date=25 January 2009|work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=3 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203132149/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/penguins/s_608711.html|archivedate=3 February 2009|url-status=dead|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Malkin handed Ovechkin his props for the stunt as well as handing him his stick and pouring some sports drink down Ovechkin's throat. Though there is no final word on the nature and status of the feud, considering their past interactions, this incident appears to show that the feud has effectively ended. It has been reported that [[Ilya Kovalchuk]], who was then the [[Atlanta Thrashers]]' captain and is also a teammate of Ovechkin and Malkin on the Russian national team, brokered the peace between the two.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalsinsider/2009/01/kovalchuk_brokers_ovechkin-mal.html|title=Kovalchuk Brokers Ovechkin-Malkin Peace|date=25 January 2009|work=Washington Post|accessdate=12 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==hi Personal life==\nOvechkin was formerly engaged to [[tennis]] player [[Maria Kirilenko]].

A highly touted prospect, Ovechkin was selected by the Capitals first overall in the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]]. With the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]] canceling the season, Ovechkin remained in Russia until 2005, joining the Capitals for the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]].

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time.\n\nOvechkin has won the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]], awarded annually to the NHL's leading goal scorer, an NHL-record eight times. His first such title came in [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308]], when his 65 goals and 112 points also earned him the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for most points scored, the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] for most valuable player, and the [[Ted Lindsay Award|Lester B.
