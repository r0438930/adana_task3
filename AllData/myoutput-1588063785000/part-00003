Public reception to the application for funding had been highly negative due to cost concerns after the cost overruns of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], and especially revelations about a series of hospitality-related demands that had been reportedly made by the IOC. The demands notably included \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and a cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described the IOC as a \"notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-olympics/29455789|title=Winter Olympics: What now for 2022 after Norway pulls out?|date=2014-10-02|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/10/02/ioc_demands_oslo_drops_bid_after_over_the_top_list_of_requirements.html|title=The IOC Demands That Helped Push Norway Out of Winter Olympic Bidding Are Hilarious|last=Mathis-Lilley|first=Ben|date=2014-10-02|work=Slate|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/olympics/ioc-reportedly-made-some-ridiculous-demands-to-help-push-oslo-out-of-2022-winter-olympics-bidding|title=IOC reportedly made some ridiculous demands to help push Oslo out of 2022 Winter Olympics bidding|date=2014-10-02|work=National Post|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>[https://www.vg.no/sport/ol-2022/ioc-krever-gratis-sprit-paa-stadion-og-cocktail-fest-med-kongen/a/23306598/ IOC krever gratis sprit p\u00e5 stadion og cocktail-fest med Kongen]</ref>\n\nBeijing was selected as host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics after beating Almaty by four votes on 31 July 2015 at the [[128th IOC Session|128th]] [[IOC Session]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2022 Winter Olympics bidding results\n|-\n!
