Starting March 1942, each month a new group of 100 Navy and Marine students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. ETP admission required passing the [[Eddy Test]], one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years.<ref>Test and Research Staff, Bureau of Naval Personnel; \"Psychological test construction and research in the Bureau of Naval Personnel.

By the fall of 1943, there were only 81 civilian men in the student body; thus, the presence of 300 or so servicemen contributed greatly in sustaining the College. This training at Grove City continued until April 1945; library records show that there were 49 classes graduating 3,759 persons.<ref>Dayton, David M.; \"The Naval Training School,\" ''Mid the Pines: A History of Grove City College'', Grove City Alumni Association, 1971</ref><ref>Watson, Raymond C., Jr.; ''Solving the Naval Radar Crisis'', Trafford Publishing, 2007, pp. 207-208, {{ISBN|978-1-4251-6173-6}}</ref>\n\n===Supreme Court case===\n{{Main|Grove City College v. Bell}}\n\nUnder President Dr. Charles S. MacKenzie, the college was the plaintiff-appellee in the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case in 1984, ''Grove City College v. Bell''. The ruling came seven years after the school's refusal to sign a [[Title IX]] compliance form, which would have subjected the entire school to federal regulations, even ones not yet issued. The court ruled 6\u20133 that acceptance by students of federal educational grants fell under the regulatory requirements of Title IX, but it limited the application to the school's financial aid department.\n\nIn 1988, new legislation subjected every department of any educational institution that received federal funding to Title IX requirements. In response, Grove City College withdrew from the [[Pell Grant]] program entirely beginning with the 1988\u201389 academic year, replacing such grants to students with its own program, the Student Freedom Fund.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Walter|title=Standing up to the Washington Leviathan|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-11-13/news/25650722_1_grove-city-college-student-loan-programs-pell-grant-program|work=Daily News|publisher=Philly.com of the Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> In October 1996, the college withdrew from the [[Stafford Loan]] program, providing entering students with replacements through a program with [[PNC Bank]].<ref name=\"Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA\">{{cite web|title=Tired of intrusions, school cuts ties with government|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&dat=19961024&id=XLRdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yF0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1379,3426486|work=Daily edition, 10/24/1996, page A9, AP-Pittsburgh|publisher=Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA|accessdate=2013-05-28}}</ref>\n\nGrove City is one of a handful of colleges (along with [[Hillsdale College]], which did likewise after the aforementioned 1984 case<ref name=\"Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA\"/>) that does not allow its students to accept federal financial aid of any kind, including grants, loans and scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|title=[GCC Financial Aid] FAQ|url=http://www.gcc.edu/Home/Admissions-Financial-Aid/Financial-Aid-Scholarships/Financial-Aid-Information/FAQ|accessdate=2019-08-19}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gcc quad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Grove City's central quad in the spring]]\n\n===Recent history===\nFrom 1963 until 2016, the [[American Association of University Professors]] placed Grove City under censure for violations of [[tenure]] and [[academic freedom]] because of the dismissal of Professor of History and Political Science Dr. Larry Gara. By the end of this period, Grove City's administration was on the AAUP's list of censured administrations longer than any other college on the list. In its report, the AAUP Investigative Committee at Grove City concluded that \"the absence of due process [in the dismissal of professors at Grove City] raises... doubts regarding the academic security of any persons who may hold appointment at Grove City College under existing administrative practice. These doubts are of an order of magnitude which obliges us to report them to the academic profession at large.\"  In 2013 Grove City started working to remove itself from the censure list.  Two years later, the school admitted that they would have handled Dr. Gara's case rather differently under their current procedures.  This led the AAUP to lift their sanction on the school at its annual meeting in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/9BCCF01E-DD4A-4A1A-87D7-89B490EE788A/0/GroveCity.pdf |format=PDF |title=Academic Freedom and Tenure : Grove City College |publisher=Aaup.org |accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/censuredadmins/|title=Censure List|work=aaup.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcc.edu/Home/News-Archive/News-Article/gcc-action-prompts-removal-of-half-century-censure-by-american-association-of-university-professors |title=GCC action prompts removal of half-century censure by American Association of University Professors |date=June 20, 2016 |publisher=Grove City College |access-date=January 21, 2019}}</ref> Gara received an apology from the school in October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2015/10/28/breaking-news/53-years-after-his-firing-college-professor-gets-apology-2/|title=53 years after his firing, college professor gets apology|last=Stacy|first=Mitch|date=October 8, 2015|work=Honolulu Star Adviser|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Grove City founded its [[Center for Vision and Values]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visandvals.org/|title=The Center for Vision & Values at Grove City College - a conservative think tank promoting truth and liberty through a vision of faith and freedom.|work=Visandvals.org|accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref> further advancing its programs in the humanities.

The base of the general requirements is centered around a humanities core, with courses on Western Civilization, Art, [[Literature]], and [[Bible|Biblical Revelation]]. Requirements for majors differ, but typically a student is also required to gain mastery in a foreign language and reach some mathematical proficiency. Many Grove City students take one to three general requirements classes in their freshman, sophomore, and sometimes junior years, along with classes for their respective major.\n\nMany students choose Grove City explicitly for its [[Christianity|Christian]] environment and traditional [[Humanities]] curriculum. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} A three-year required [[Humanities]] sequence focuses on the origin, development and implications of civilization\u2019s seminal ideas and [[worldviews]].

The call-letters were predated by experimental stations at the college dating back to 1914. In 1968, WSAJ-FM was put on the air and currently broadcasts at 91.1&nbsp;MHz, functioning as a learning tool for all students, but especially those in the communication and engineering majors. The 100-watt AM station, operating from a longwire antenna on 1340&nbsp;kHz, was one of the few remaining stations in the US to share time. It surrendered its broadcast license in 2006. The 1,600-watt FM signal covers a 30&nbsp;mi radius in Western Pennsylvania. The station broadcasts fine arts programming, college football and basketball games. It also airs community events and high school sports. Students host weekly music shows during the evening hours when school is in session.\n\n===Fraternities, sororities, and housing groups===\n[[Fraternities and sororities]] live on campus, in pre-selected upperclassman halls. Grove City's fraternities and sororities are local and are not affiliated with any of the national [[List of Greek umbrella organizations|Greek umbrella organizations]].<ref name=\"gcc.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/studentlife/campus-organizations/Pages/Social-Groups.aspx|title=Social Groups|work=gcc.edu|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>  Many of the social fraternities and sororities were established in the early 1900s and are among the country's oldest local fraternities and sororities. Over the years, other sororities and one fraternity, Chi Delta Epsilon, have ceased to exist. The most recent sorority to become defunct was the short-lived Delta Chi Omega, which was founded in 1980 and lasted approximately one decade.  Sigma Sigma Sigma, founded in 1917, changed its name to Zeta Zeta Zeta in 1989 in response to threats of trademark infringement litigation from the national sorority [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]]. They then changed their name again in 2018 to The Independents. Other fraternities and sororities have died out (meaning all their active members graduated or left the college) but have been reinstituted via block classes that assumed the organization's name, traditions and practices.\n\nBoth fraternities and sororities are overseen by governing bodies. The fraternities each send delegates to weekly meetings of the Interfraternity Council. The sororities' counterpart organization, the Pan-Hellenic Council, also meets each week. In the spring, the two councils hold joint meetings to plan the annual Greek Games. The Greek Games, a multi-day event which involved such activities as water balloon tossing and egg dropping, have declined in notoriety at Grove City College along with the size of Greek organizations; until the 1990s they were well-known on campus, with the majority of the student body either participating or spectating.  The annual All Campus Sing, formerly called Greek Sing, includes fraternities, sororities, housing groups, and independent groups and remains a popular competition occurring during Parents Weekend on the campus every year.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:GroveCityWolverines.png|thumb|left|Official athletics logo.]]\nGrove City has been fielding athletics teams for over a century.  In 1906, they were one of the 39 charter members of the IAAUS, the forerunner of the NCAA.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Economics of Intercollegiate Sports: Second Edition\n|author=Randy R Grant, John C Leadley, Zenon X Zygmont |isbn=9814583391 |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nGrove City College, known athletically as the Wolverines, competes in the [[Presidents' Athletic Conference]] (PAC) of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]].

[[Lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[rugby union]] and [[American football|football]] are varsity sports available to men only, while [[softball]], and [[water polo]] are varsity sports offered to women only.  In April 2016, men's lacrosse was announced as the 22nd varsity sport and will begin in the 2018 spring season as a member of the Ohio River Lacrosse Conference (joint venture between Presidents' Athletic Conference and Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference).\n\nGrove City also offers a number of club sports to men and women including but not limited to ultimate, and [[volleyball]] for men and [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], and [[rugby football|rugby]] for women. These teams have been very successful, most notably the men's club volleyball team, which has finished in the top 10 in the country each of the last two years, the men's lacrosse team, which finished in the top 10 in the country in 2015, and both the men's and women's rugby teams which have been ranked in the top 10 in the country by the National Small College Rugby Organization.\n\nIntramural sports for men are as follows: basketball, [[bowling]], dodgeball, football, soccer, softball, [[table tennis]], tennis, [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and volleyball. Women have [[badminton]], basketball, bowling, [[flag football]], [[indoor soccer]], [[kickball]], [[racquetball]], ultimate, and volleyball.\n\nGrove City has several teams with remarkable PAC Championship records. Grove City's women's tennis team had won 25 consecutive PAC championships from 1987 through 2011 and the men's tennis team won 26 consecutive PAC championships between 1990 and 2016. In addition, the women's cross country team has won 27 consecutive PAC championships (1989\u20132015). The men's swim team also has 5 consecutive PAC championships, 2008\u20132012, while the women won 10 consecutive PAC championships from 2009\u20132018. Also notable is the overall swim team record of 61 consecutive winning seasons, from 1952\u20132012.\n\nIn 2018, the schools assistant sports information director was charged with nearly 100 counts for crimes ranging from privacy violations to possession of child pornography after it was discovered he had been secretly recording students who were showering in the colleges locker room.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/shocking-allegations-surround-former-grove-city-college-official/1236987639|title=Shocking allegations surround former Grove City College official|last=Ricciutti|first=Gerry|date=2018-06-13|work=WKBN|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wfmj.com/story/38320404/former-grove-city-college-employee-allegedly-records-students|title=Former Grove City College employee allegedly records students|last=Koziol|first=Brandon|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://butlerradio.com/wv-man-accused-of-recording-grove-city-college-students-in-locker-room/|title=WV Man Accused Of Recording Grove City College Students In Locker Room - ButlerRadio.com - Butler, PA|date=2018-06-01|work=ButlerRadio.com - Butler, PA|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:gcc rainbow bridge.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Rainbow Bridge, which stretches over Wolf Creek and connects upper and lower campus.]]\n\n==Traditions==\n===Coat of Arms===\nThe coat of arms of Grove City College was adopted on June 13, 1911.<ref name=home/> It is [[blazon]]ed:\n\n:''Gules,<br> an open book argent,<br> inscribed \"Lux mea\" in letters sable,<br> bound of the second,<br> between three wolves' heads erased also of the second.''\n\nThe coat of arms is utilized on official documents like diplomas and transcripts, while the more modern three notched crimson shield logo is utilized on all college publications, stationary and related merchandise and materials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crimson shield introduced as new College logo in 2002|url=http://www.gcc.edu/news/campus/stories/shield.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020308044322/http://www.gcc.edu/news/campus/stories/shield.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Alma Mater===\nThe Grove City alma mater, entitled \"Mid the Pines\" was written in 1912 by student Edward G. Seel. Seel's lyrics were consequently put to music composed by Grove City professor Hermann Poehlmann. The lyrics are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Crimson Student Handbook, 2015-16|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ccfca9e4b03e8de40aed7f/t/5608a0abe4b0e8ed89e266fc/1443405995342/Crimson_2015-16.pdf}}</ref>\n\n:''\u2018Mid the pines in columns growing,<br>By the stream so deeply flowing,<br>Dear to hearts with mem\u2019ries glowing,<br>Stand the halls, the halls we love.<br><br>Chorus:<br>Hail to thee our Alma Mater,<br>Praises from each son and daughter,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own.<br><br>Tho\u2019 the land and sea may part us,<br>Far remove thy towers and campus,<br>Staunch and true there dwells within us,<br>All the spirit of thy life,<br>Staunch and true there dwells within us,<br>All the spirit of thy life.<br><br>Chorus.\n\nIn addition to the alma mater, Professor Poehlmann composed many other pieces of music for the college. In Grove City's early years, many unique songs were composed for different groups and occasions. In 1913, the administration of President Alexander T. Ormand had many of the school's songs compiled into a songbook known as ''Songs of Grove City College.'' Over the years, the practice of writing and singing original compositions diminished at Grove City and the songbook was eventually retired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Songs of Grove City College|url=https://alumni.gcc.edu/s/1472/17/interior.aspx?sid=1472&gid=1&pgid=252&cid=2942&ecid=2942&ciid=7013&crid=0}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n===Notable alumni===\n* [[David M.

Starting March 1942, each month a new group of 100 Navy and Marine students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. ETP admission required passing the [[Eddy Test]], one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years.<ref>Test and Research Staff, Bureau of Naval Personnel; \"Psychological test construction and research in the Bureau of Naval Personnel.

By the fall of 1943, there were only 81 civilian men in the student body; thus, the presence of 300 or so servicemen contributed greatly in sustaining the College.

Bell}}\n\nUnder President Dr. Charles S. MacKenzie, the college was the plaintiff-appellee in the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case in 1984, ''Grove City College v. Bell''. The ruling came seven years after the school's refusal to sign a [[Title IX]] compliance form, which would have subjected the entire school to federal regulations, even ones not yet issued. The court ruled 6\u20133 that acceptance by students of federal educational grants fell under the regulatory requirements of Title IX, but it limited the application to the school's financial aid department.\n\nIn 1988, new legislation subjected every department of any educational institution that received federal funding to Title IX requirements. In response, Grove City College withdrew from the [[Pell Grant]] program entirely beginning with the 1988\u201389 academic year, replacing such grants to students with its own program, the Student Freedom Fund.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Walter|title=Standing up to the Washington Leviathan|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-11-13/news/25650722_1_grove-city-college-student-loan-programs-pell-grant-program|work=Daily News|publisher=Philly.com of the Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> In October 1996, the college withdrew from the [[Stafford Loan]] program, providing entering students with replacements through a program with [[PNC Bank]].<ref name=\"Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA\">{{cite web|title=Tired of intrusions, school cuts ties with government|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&dat=19961024&id=XLRdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yF0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1379,3426486|work=Daily edition, 10/24/1996, page A9, AP-Pittsburgh|publisher=Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA|accessdate=2013-05-28}}</ref>\n\nGrove City is one of a handful of colleges (along with [[Hillsdale College]], which did likewise after the aforementioned 1984 case<ref name=\"Observer-Reporter, Washington, PA\"/>) that does not allow its students to accept federal financial aid of any kind, including grants, loans and scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|title=[GCC Financial Aid] FAQ|url=http://www.gcc.edu/Home/Admissions-Financial-Aid/Financial-Aid-Scholarships/Financial-Aid-Information/FAQ|accessdate=2019-08-19}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gcc quad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Grove City's central quad in the spring]]\n\n===Recent history===\nFrom 1963 until 2016, the [[American Association of University Professors]] placed Grove City under censure for violations of [[tenure]] and [[academic freedom]] because of the dismissal of Professor of History and Political Science Dr. Larry Gara. By the end of this period, Grove City's administration was on the AAUP's list of censured administrations longer than any other college on the list. In its report, the AAUP Investigative Committee at Grove City concluded that \"the absence of due process [in the dismissal of professors at Grove City] raises... doubts regarding the academic security of any persons who may hold appointment at Grove City College under existing administrative practice. These doubts are of an order of magnitude which obliges us to report them to the academic profession at large.\"  In 2013 Grove City started working to remove itself from the censure list.  Two years later, the school admitted that they would have handled Dr. Gara's case rather differently under their current procedures.  This led the AAUP to lift their sanction on the school at its annual meeting in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/9BCCF01E-DD4A-4A1A-87D7-89B490EE788A/0/GroveCity.pdf |format=PDF |title=Academic Freedom and Tenure : Grove City College |publisher=Aaup.org |accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/censuredadmins/|title=Censure List|work=aaup.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcc.edu/Home/News-Archive/News-Article/gcc-action-prompts-removal-of-half-century-censure-by-american-association-of-university-professors |title=GCC action prompts removal of half-century censure by American Association of University Professors |date=June 20, 2016 |publisher=Grove City College |access-date=January 21, 2019}}</ref> Gara received an apology from the school in October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2015/10/28/breaking-news/53-years-after-his-firing-college-professor-gets-apology-2/|title=53 years after his firing, college professor gets apology|last=Stacy|first=Mitch|date=October 8, 2015|work=Honolulu Star Adviser|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Grove City founded its [[Center for Vision and Values]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visandvals.org/|title=The Center for Vision & Values at Grove City College - a conservative think tank promoting truth and liberty through a vision of faith and freedom.|work=Visandvals.org|accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref> further advancing its programs in the humanities.

The call-letters were predated by experimental stations at the college dating back to 1914. In 1968, WSAJ-FM was put on the air and currently broadcasts at 91.1&nbsp;MHz, functioning as a learning tool for all students, but especially those in the communication and engineering majors. The 100-watt AM station, operating from a longwire antenna on 1340&nbsp;kHz, was one of the few remaining stations in the US to share time. It surrendered its broadcast license in 2006. The 1,600-watt FM signal covers a 30&nbsp;mi radius in Western Pennsylvania. The station broadcasts fine arts programming, college football and basketball games. It also airs community events and high school sports. Students host weekly music shows during the evening hours when school is in session.\n\n===Fraternities, sororities, and housing groups===\n[[Fraternities and sororities]] live on campus, in pre-selected upperclassman halls. Grove City's fraternities and sororities are local and are not affiliated with any of the national [[List of Greek umbrella organizations|Greek umbrella organizations]].<ref name=\"gcc.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/studentlife/campus-organizations/Pages/Social-Groups.aspx|title=Social Groups|work=gcc.edu|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>  Many of the social fraternities and sororities were established in the early 1900s and are among the country's oldest local fraternities and sororities. Over the years, other sororities and one fraternity, Chi Delta Epsilon, have ceased to exist. The most recent sorority to become defunct was the short-lived Delta Chi Omega, which was founded in 1980 and lasted approximately one decade.  Sigma Sigma Sigma, founded in 1917, changed its name to Zeta Zeta Zeta in 1989 in response to threats of trademark infringement litigation from the national sorority [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]]. They then changed their name again in 2018 to The Independents. Other fraternities and sororities have died out (meaning all their active members graduated or left the college) but have been reinstituted via block classes that assumed the organization's name, traditions and practices.\n\nBoth fraternities and sororities are overseen by governing bodies. The fraternities each send delegates to weekly meetings of the Interfraternity Council. The sororities' counterpart organization, the Pan-Hellenic Council, also meets each week. In the spring, the two councils hold joint meetings to plan the annual Greek Games. The Greek Games, a multi-day event which involved such activities as water balloon tossing and egg dropping, have declined in notoriety at Grove City College along with the size of Greek organizations; until the 1990s they were well-known on campus, with the majority of the student body either participating or spectating.  The annual All Campus Sing, formerly called Greek Sing, includes fraternities, sororities, housing groups, and independent groups and remains a popular competition occurring during Parents Weekend on the campus every year.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:GroveCityWolverines.png|thumb|left|Official athletics logo.]]\nGrove City has been fielding athletics teams for over a century.

Seel. Seel's lyrics were consequently put to music composed by Grove City professor Hermann Poehlmann. The lyrics are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Crimson Student Handbook, 2015-16|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ccfca9e4b03e8de40aed7f/t/5608a0abe4b0e8ed89e266fc/1443405995342/Crimson_2015-16.pdf}}</ref>\n\n:''\u2018Mid the pines in columns growing,<br>By the stream so deeply flowing,<br>Dear to hearts with mem\u2019ries glowing,<br>Stand the halls, the halls we love.<br><br>Chorus:<br>Hail to thee our Alma Mater,<br>Praises from each son and daughter,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own,<br>Pledges of love and honor Grove City still shall own.<br><br>Tho\u2019 the land and sea may part us,<br>Far remove thy towers and campus,<br>Staunch and true there dwells within us,<br>All the spirit of thy life,<br>Staunch and true there dwells within us,<br>All the spirit of thy life.<br><br>Chorus.\n\nIn addition to the alma mater, Professor Poehlmann composed many other pieces of music for the college. In Grove City's early years, many unique songs were composed for different groups and occasions. In 1913, the administration of President Alexander T. Ormand had many of the school's songs compiled into a songbook known as ''Songs of Grove City College.'' Over the years, the practice of writing and singing original compositions diminished at Grove City and the songbook was eventually retired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Songs of Grove City College|url=https://alumni.gcc.edu/s/1472/17/interior.aspx?sid=1472&gid=1&pgid=252&cid=2942&ecid=2942&ciid=7013&crid=0}}</ref>\n\n==People==\n===Notable alumni===\n* [[David M.
