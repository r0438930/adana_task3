During that time he was ordered to act as prisoner's friend at the [[court martial]] of a soldier accused of appearing late on parade, and then assaulting his superior officer when he eventually did turn up. He managed to get the soldier cleared of the more serious charge. The soldier's comment afterwards was \"Thanks awfully fur pretendin ah didnae dae it sur\".<ref>[[Sunday Post]] 1973</ref>\n\nHis original wish was for a job in the [[Foreign Office]], but he became a radio journalist with the BBC in Glasgow.\n\n==Theatre career==\nCuthbertson started acting at the Glasgow [[Citizens' Theatre]] in 1958 and became General Manager and Director of Productions in 1962.

The producer was Frank Cox.\n\nSutherland's Law dealt with the duties of the Procurator Fiscal in a small Scottish town. The major cast members included Cuthbertson (as John Sutherland), Gareth Thomas, Moultrie Kelsall, Victor Carin, Martin Cochrane, Maev Alexander and Edith MacArthur.\n\nA rather different achievement was his portrayal of the criminal and businessman Charlie Endell in both ''[[Budgie (TV series)|Budgie]]'' ([[London Weekend Television]]/[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]) with [[Adam Faith]] (1971\u201372)  and its sequel ''[[Charles Endell Esquire]]'' ([[Scottish Television]]/ITV) in 1979.\n\nOther roles include the lead in ''[[The Borderers]]'' ([[BBC]], 1968\u201370), ''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays (TV serial)|Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'' ([[BBC]], 1971) (as [[Thomas Arnold]]), ''[[The Stone Tape]]'' ([[BBC]], 1972),<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/iain-cuthbertson-actor-who-played-the-procuratorfiscal-in-sutherlands-law-and-charlie-endell-in-budgie-1785245.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Iain Cuthbertson: Actor who played the procurator-fiscal in 'Sutherland's Law' and Charlie Endell in 'Budgie' | date=11 September 2009}}</ref> ''[[Children of the Stones]]'' ([[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]/ITV, 1977), ''The Voyage of Charles Darwin'', ''[[Danger UXB]]'' ([[Thames Television]]/ITV, 1979), ''The House With Green Shutters''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/237819 |title=The House With The Green Shutters |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref> ([[BBC]], 1980).  He appeared in the pilot episode of ''[[Rab C Nesbitt]]'' (1988) as a magistrate.\n\nHe suffered a crippling stroke in January 1982, which forced him to give up theatre for fear of forgetting his lines. He resumed television and film work, though, as his lines could be written on crib boards.<ref name=\"times\"/> His first role following his stroke was as the villainous Scunner Campbell in ''[[Super Gran]]'' ([[Tyne Tees Television]]/ITV, 1985).<ref>{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Evans |title=The Guinness Television Encyclopedia |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd |year=1995 |page=506 |isbn=0-85112-744-4}}</ref> In 1989 he played the villain Brett Savernake in the episode of ''[[Campion (TV series)|Campion]]'' entitled \"Sweet Danger\".\n\nMinor parts in ongoing series include appearances in ''[[Z-Cars]]'' (BBC), ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' ([[Associated British Corporation|ABC]]/ITV), ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' ([[ITV Central|Central Television]]/ITV), ''[[Bulman]]'' ([[Granada Television]]/ITV), ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'' (BBC), ''[[The Duchess of Duke Street]]'', Colonel Mannering in ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'' story ''D For Destruction'' (1966) and Garron in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Ribos Operation]]''.

It took him almost two years to recover sufficiently to be able to act again. Although he avoided live theatre work thereafter, due to a fear of forgetting and/or stumbling on lines, he was still able to take parts in films and TV.

He appeared in the pilot episode of ''[[Rab C Nesbitt]]'' (1988) as a magistrate.\n\nHe suffered a crippling stroke in January 1982, which forced him to give up theatre for fear of forgetting his lines. He resumed television and film work, though, as his lines could be written on crib boards.<ref name=\"times\"/> His first role following his stroke was as the villainous Scunner Campbell in ''[[Super Gran]]'' ([[Tyne Tees Television]]/ITV, 1985).<ref>{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Evans |title=The Guinness Television Encyclopedia |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd |year=1995 |page=506 |isbn=0-85112-744-4}}</ref> In 1989 he played the villain Brett Savernake in the episode of ''[[Campion (TV series)|Campion]]'' entitled \"Sweet Danger\".\n\nMinor parts in ongoing series include appearances in ''[[Z-Cars]]'' (BBC), ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' ([[Associated British Corporation|ABC]]/ITV), ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' ([[ITV Central|Central Television]]/ITV), ''[[Bulman]]'' ([[Granada Television]]/ITV), ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'' (BBC), ''[[The Duchess of Duke Street]]'', Colonel Mannering in ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'' story ''D For Destruction'' (1966) and Garron in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Ribos Operation]]''.
