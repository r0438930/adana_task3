[[Julius Caesar]], commanding the Roman forces, was surprised and nearly defeated. According to Caesar's report, a combination of determined defence, skilled generalship, and the timely arrival of reinforcements allowed the Romans to turn a strategic defeat into a tactical victory. Few primary sources describe the battle in detail, with most information coming from Caesar's own report on the battle from his book, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. Little is therefore known about the Nervii perspective on the battle.\n\n==Prelude==\nDuring the winter of 58-57 BC rumours came to Caesar's ears that the Belgic tribes were forming a union because they feared possible Roman interference in their affairs.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#1|Bello Gallico 2.1]]</ref> The union included the [[Bellovaci]], [[Suessiones]], [[Nervii]], [[Atrebates]], [[Ambiani]], [[Morini]], [[Menapii]], [[Caleti]], [[Veliocasses]], [[Viromandui]], [[Aduatuci]], [[Condrusi]], [[Eburones]], [[Caeroesi]], and [[Paemani]] tribes, and was under the leadership of [[Galba (Suessiones)|Galba]], a king of the [[Suessiones]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#4|Bello Gallico 2.4]]</ref> These reports provided Caesar with a good pretext for conquering more than Gaul \"itself\", and for this, he raised two legions in Cisalpine Gaul ([[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII]] and [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV]])<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#2|Bello Gallico 2.2]]</ref> and convinced the [[Remi]] tribe to side with him.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#3|Bello Gallico 2.3]] - [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#5|2.5]]</ref>\n\nIn response, the other [[Belgae|Belgic]] and [[Celt]]ic tribes had attacked [[Bibrax]] (the [[oppidum]] of the Remi, situated near the [[Aisne River]]). Caesar countered by defending the oppidum and winning an action at the Aisne. In the face of this and because of shortage of provisions, the union collapsed and tribal armies retreated to their own lands, with the agreed future intention of coming to the support of any tribe invaded by the Romans. Caesar continued his advance and tribes surrendered one by one. However, four tribes, the Nervii, the Atrebates, the Aduatuci, and the Viromandui refused to submit.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#6|Bello Gallico 2.6]] - [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#14|Bello Gallico 2.14]]</ref>\n\nThe Ambiani told Caesar that the Nervii were the most hostile of the [[Belgae]] to Roman rule. A fierce and brave tribe, they did not allow the import of luxury items as they believed these had a corrupting effect and probably feared Roman influence. They had no intention of entering peace negotiations with the Romans. Caesar would move on them next.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#15|Bello Gallico 2.15]]</ref>\n\n==Forces==\nAs with all ancient battles, estimates of the forces available to both sides will always be a matter of some speculation. A [[Marian reforms#Marian reforms|Roman legion]] during this period had a theoretical strenght of some 4,800 fighting men with additional [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary forces]] (usually skirmishers and cavalry).  Eight Roman legions plus an unkown number of auxiliary (skirmishers: archers, slingers and javelinmen) and allied cavalry are recorded to have taken part in the battle.  It is not known if the legions were at full strength, but a reasonable estimate for Caesar's army might be in the range of 40,000\u201345,000 fighting men (including skirmishers and cavalry). The 40,000\u201345,000 range does not include non-combatants, although, in this case, they participated in the fighting during the final phase of the battle. A legions was usually accompanied by some 1,200 non-combatants (theoretically) so their numbers could have been 9,000-10,000 men.\n\nCaesar claims he had earlier received intelligence from the Remi that the various tribes of the Belgae had promised to contribute a total of 300,000 fighting men. According to Caesar the Remi estimates of the men promised by the four tribes now left to oppose Caesar were:  50,000 Nervii, 15,000 Atrebates, 10,000 Veromandui and 19,000 Aduatuci.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> If these figures were reliable it would mean that Caesar was immediately faced with a maximum of 75,000 men, as the Aduatuci were still en route.  Promises are not always kept so it is probable the actual number was smaller than this, though still high enough to outnumber the legionaries. Drawing on demographic data, [[Hans Delbr\u00fcck]] estimated a maximum of 30,000 combatants for the three tribes fighting at the Sabis, and probably far less.<ref name=Del/>\n\n===Order of battle===\n[[Image:Battle of the Sabis (Selle).png|thumb|Battlefield if the \"Sabis\" matches the River Selle.]]\n[[Image:Bataille laSambre -57.png|thumb|Battlefield if the \"Sabis\" matches the Sambre.]]\n\n[[Roman Republic]] \u2013 Julius Caesar's eight legions: [[Legio VII Claudia|VII]], [[Legio VIII Augusta|VIII]], [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Triumphalis'']], [[Legio X Gemina|X ''Equestris'']], [[Legio XI Claudia|XI]], [[Legio XII Fulminata|XII ''Victrix'']], [[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII]], [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV]] \u2013 auxiliaries: slingers, archers, javelinmen and cavalry. The IX and X legions formed the left flank, the VIII and the XI were in the centre, and the VII and XII were on the right. \n\nThe Belgae attacked with the Atrebates forming the right wing, the Viromandui in the centre, and the Nervi on the left. \n\nTraditionally it was believed that the battle was fought on the banks of the river [[Sambre]], near modern [[Aulnoye-Aymeries]], but in 1955 Turquin showed that it was fought on the west bank of the river [[Selle]], near modern [[Saulzoir]].<ref>Pierre Turquin (\"La Bataille de la Selle (du Sabis) en l' An 57 avant J.-C.\" in Les \u00c9tudes Classiques 23/2 (1955), 113-156)</ref>\n\n==Before the battle==\nCaesar's legions had been marching in Nervian territory for three days, following an ancient road.<ref>Essentially the road that was later paved by the Romans and connected Samarobriva ([[Amiens]]) with [[Cologne]], and is now often referred to as \"Via Belgica\". The position of Bronze Age and Iron Age tombs proves that it already existed in pre-Roman times.</ref> He learnt from prisoners that the Belgae were massing on the far side of the River Sabis, which was about {{convert|10|mi|km}} ahead. The Nervii had persuaded the [[Atrebates]] and the [[Veromandui]] to support them. The [[Aduatuci]] were marching to join them, but they did not arrive in time to take part in the battle.<!--Note: see Book 2.29 --> Their non-combatants had moved to a safe area screened by marshes, where an army could not approach.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#16|Bello Gallico 2.16]]</ref> The Belgae had made their preparations and were now waiting for the Romans.\n\nCaesar sent forward experienced scouts to choose the next campsite.\n\nHe learnt from prisoners taken later that sympathisers in the ragtag of surrendered Belgae and other Gauls travelling with the army had gone to the Nervii and reported the dispositionion of his column. They reported that the individual legionary baggage trains were interspersed between the legions and that it would be easy to cut off the leading legion from the rest and destroy it before any support could reach it. It was believed this would intimidate the Romans into withdrawing. The Nervii, having traditionally always relied on infantry rather than cavalry, had over the years developed a technique of building dense, impenetrable hedges of briars and thorns set between young trees as a defence against the raids of surrounding tribes. These would obstruct Caesar's advance and help the attack. It was agreed that the signal for an attack was to be the appearance of the baggage train behind the first legion.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#17|Bello Gallico 2.17]]</ref> In doing this, the Nervii were intending to use what is recognisable today as the modern army doctrine of [[force concentration]]. As will be seen, their plan would be frustrated by Caesar.\n\n==Battle==\nThe campsite was to be laid out on a hill which gently sloped down to the river. On the other side of the river there was another hill directly opposite, similarly sloping. The top of that hill was densely wooded but the lower part was open and sloped down to the river over a distance of 200 [[Pace (unit)|paces]] (roughly {{convert|300|m|yd}}). The enemy was concealed inside the woods, but a few cavalry pickets could be seen in the open area by the river. The river was very wide,<!--Note: see Book 2.27 --> but only about three&nbsp;feet (one&nbsp;metre) deep.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#18|Bello Gallico 2.18]]</ref>\n\nAt some point on his march to the Sabis, Caesar reorganised the column and reverted to his usual tactic of leading his forces with six legions in light marching order. Behind them was the baggage column of the entire army, followed by the newly recruited legions, [[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII]] and [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV]]. Caesar does not say whether this change was fortuitous or was made in response to the intelligence received. While Caesar's force began to set up camp on the slope running down to the river, his cavalry, together with slingers and archers, was ordered to cross the river to reconnoiter. This developed into a skirmish with the few troops of Belgic cavalry that had been observed on the far side. Caesar describes the enemy cavalry as sallying repeatedly from the woods at the top of the hill and says his cavalry did not dare follow them in when they retreated. He does not elaborate further so it will never be known if the Nervii were trying to entice the skirmishers onto their hidden position or holding them in play on the slopes in preparation for the planned rush.\n\nMeanwhile, the legions had started arriving at the camp site and began to build its fortifications. The Belgae, waiting for the baggage train to appear, gradually found themselves faced with not one legion, but six. Their plan of piecemeal destruction had to be abandoned, but they must have believed their numbers more than adequate to deal with their enemy.\n\n===Ambush===\nAs the Roman baggage train came into view, the Belgic force suddenly rushed out of the trees and surprised their opponents, overwhelming the Roman cavalry. They crossed the shallow river at full speed and charged up the hill against the legions setting up camp, giving them no time to get into battle formation. It seemed to Caesar that the Nervii came on with incredible speed, all at once pouring out of the trees, charging across the river and overrunning his legionaries.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#19|Bello Gallico 2.19]]</ref>\n\nTaken by surprise, Caesar had to rapidly give orders to sound the alarm both by raising the battle-standard and by trumpet, get his men away from construction work, recall the wood-cutting parties, and try to get his legions into some semblance of order. There was very little time and much had to be left undone. Two things, though, saved the legions from being immediately routed\u2014firstly, the knowledge and experience of the soldiers (which meant that they could decide for themselves what to do without waiting for orders) and secondly, Caesar had previously ordered all legion commanders to stay with their legions during the setting up of the camp.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#20|Bello Gallico 2.20]]</ref>\n\nCaesar went wherever he was needed, giving only essential orders and eventually found himself on the left wing with Legion X. Seeing that the enemy were within range of the Romans he gave the order to hurl a volley of pilae. Going to another part of the field, he found his men already fighting. The men had run from their building tasks to fall into ranks but many did not even have time to put on their helmets or take the covers off their shields.<ref>Shields were made of layers of wood and leather, then painted with casein-based paints. The shield was covered when not in use as a protection against rain.</ref> The legionaries had no opportunity to group with their own cohorts and instead congregated around the first friendly standard they saw.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#21|Bello Gallico 2.21]]</ref> Caesar states that the hedges were a considerable obstruction to his men during the battle, although he does not specify their locations on the field,<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#22|Bello Gallico 2.22]]</ref> but the woody hilltop is the one place we can infer their presence.\n\nThe soldiers of legions [[Legio X Equestris|X ''Equestris'']] and [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Triumphalis'']] on the left flank, having thrown their pilae at their Atrebates opponents, charged. They threw the enemy back and drove them into the river, killing many. The Romans crossed the river and found themselves on disadvantageous or uneven ground, but although the Atrebates regrouped and launched a counter-attack, the Romans put them to flight a second time. Further along, in the centre, two legions, [[Legio XI Claudia|XI]] and [[Legio VIII Augusta|VIII]], having checked the Viromandui with whom they were engaged, pushed them from the higher ground into the river.\n\nHowever, as these four legions pushed their opponents back, the front and left of the camp was left undefended and a gap opened up in the Roman line. A compact column of Nervii under [[Boduognatus]] (the overall commander of the Belgae) rushed through the opening. Part of the column turned to encircle the two legions holding the right flank; the rest continued upwards to attack the higher part of the camp.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#23|Bello Gallico 2.23]]</ref>\n\n===Crisis===\nMeanwhile, the routed Roman cavalry and skirmishers were just straggling into camp when they found themselves face to face with the Nervii \u2013 they ran again. Camp followers further up the hill by the camp's back gate had observed the success of the Romans at the river and came down in the hope of plunder, but noticed the Nervii in the camp and also ran. People accompanying the baggage train just arriving were horrified at the sight before them and panicked as well. Even the usually-dependable Treveri cavalry arriving to support the Romans looked at the seemingly hopeless situation and promptly turned for home to report the disaster.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#24|Bello Gallico 2.24]]</ref>\n\nAfter encouraging Legion X, Caesar went to the right wing. Things looked bad. He could see that the men of [[Legio XII Fulminata|XII ''Victrix'']] were crammed so closely together into one mass by their standards that they could not fight effectively. All (six) [[centurion]]s of the fourth cohort were dead, its standard bearer killed, and the standard missing. Of the remaining cohorts, almost all the centurions were either wounded or killed; Baculus,<ref>P. Sextius Baculus survived and is mentioned again by Caesar as an invalid.  See Gallic Wars Books 3.5 and 6.38</ref> the legion's [[Centurion|primipilus]], a fine soldier, had received so many minor and serious wounds that he could barely stand. The Nervii were attacking vigorously from lower ground and pressing at the front and both flanks. Caesar could see some men were shirking and trying to get to the rear; others were slowly ceasing effective resistance. There were no reserves. This was the crisis-point. He took a shield from a soldier at the rear and went to the first line. Calling his centurions by name, he ordered them to have the soldiers advance ([[Aquila (Roman)|signa inferre]]) and the [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]] open up and extend. As he tells it, his arrival brought hope and boosted the soldiers\u2019 morale. Every man was now keen to do well in front of his general. As a result, the enemy assault was checked slightly.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#25|Bello Gallico 2.25]]</ref>\n\n===Recovery===\nCaesar saw that [[Legio VII Claudia|Legion VII]] nearby was also hard-pressed. He ordered the [[tribunes]] to redeploy the two legions to gradually join and fight back to back. This further increased his men's confidence. By now, the legions escorting the baggage, having received a report of the action, had come on at double pace and the enemy could see them coming over the hill above the camp. Legion X, under [[Legatus|legate]] [[Labienus]], had overcome the Atrebates, crossed the river, and defeated the Belgic reserves. Now they seized the Belgic camp on the wooded hill. From the higher ground, Labienus could see that Caesar's right wing was in serious trouble. He ordered his men back across the river to attack the Nervii from the rear.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#26|Bello Gallico 2.26]]</ref>\n\nSoon Legions XIII and XIV joined the fight. Caesar does not detail their actions, but they probably cleared the camp (as it was their nearest target) and went to the right to relieve the pressure on Legions XII and VII. This, coupled with the return of Legion X, transformed the situation. Seeing the position begin to stabilise, cavalry and skirmishers took heart and, keen to wipe out their earlier shame, started to fight in earnest. The camp followers joined in now that they could see their enemy's dismay. The entire Roman force was now fully committed.\n\nAt this point of the battle it is clear that Caesar's opposition had little hope of survival. They were being pushed closer and closer into a dense pack that was being surrounded by Caesar's men who were using projectile weapons to pick off their remaining forces. Using peltasts (a light infantry man) equipped with slings and javelins and with the help of archers, they unleashed a barrage of missiles at the closely packed Nervii. The last of them fought with ferocity and courage for they were continuing to retaliate with their spears and catching the Romans javelins and throwing them back at them. The Nervii hadn't used any other projectile type weapon except for spears. The Nervii warriors fought to the last, standing on the bodies of their slain comrades, and throwing the Romans\u2019 own spears back at them. Eventually the few remaining Nervii broke and fled the field.\n\nCaesar's opinion of the Nervii was that they had shown great fighting spirit in carrying an attack forward so vigorously on to difficult ground and in continuing to fight stubbornly when the tide of battle turned irretrievably against them.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War/Book%202#27|title=Commentaries on the Gallic War|last=Caesar|first=Julius}}</ref> Caesar talks of a grimly inspiring image of the last of the Nervii who were atop a mound of corpses of their own warriors and shouting in defiance towards the Romans, fighting till their last breath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historum.com/ancient-history/60277-battle-sabis-57-bce.html|title=The Battle of the Sabis, 57 BCE - Historum - History Forums|website=historum.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> He goes on to say that they had outstanding courage, for they launched a surprise attack, crossed a river up its banks, then rushed on to attack all with a fighting spirit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/articles/battle/sabis-57-bce/|title=Sabis (57 BCE) - Livius|website=www.livius.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> He glorifies his victory by stating how well his army did without having to be ordered to launch a counter-attack. It was most probable that his soldiers were experienced veterans who were able to hold off their onslaught. Still he mitigated his losses by not including how many casualties he suffered or that they were in serious danger of losing. In his account of this battle in his book \"the Conquest of Gaul\" he gives his view of what actually happened in the battle but it remains one of the only primary sources during that time. And since it was written by Caesar much is unknown of the Nervii's side of the battle, such as how Bodougnats<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Aq48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=boduognats+leader&source=bl&ots=mQOAYGn4Oo&sig=dOI8kXTYjnr4cFGnFdSqGDVED_0&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=boduognats%20leader&f=false|title=Gaius Iulius Cearsar Gallic War|publisher=CUP Archive|language=en}}</ref> (the leader of the Nervii) ordered his men into battle.\n\n==Casualties==\nThe older men of the Nervii, described by Caesar as \u201csenators\u201d, came out of their hiding place in the marshland and surrendered.  They said that their council had been reduced from 600 men to three and that of 60,000 fighting men there were barely 500 left.  It is not entirely clear if this is a figure for the dead or if it includes wounded, nor is it clear if these are solely Nervii casualties or if the figure includes their allies.  Caesar states that he spared the Nervii and ordered the surrounding tribes not to take advantage of their weakness.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#28|Bello Gallico 2.28]]</ref>\n\nCaesar gives no indication of his own casualties.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Aduatuci turned for home as soon as they heard about the defeat.

[[Julius Caesar]], commanding the Roman forces, was surprised and nearly defeated. According to Caesar's report, a combination of determined defence, skilled generalship, and the timely arrival of reinforcements allowed the Romans to turn a strategic defeat into a tactical victory. Few primary sources describe the battle in detail, with most information coming from Caesar's own report on the battle from his book, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. Little is therefore known about the Nervii perspective on the battle.\n\n==Prelude==\nDuring the winter of 58-57 BC rumours came to Caesar's ears that the Belgic tribes were forming a union because they feared possible Roman interference in their affairs.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#1|Bello Gallico 2.1]]</ref> The union included the [[Bellovaci]], [[Suessiones]], [[Nervii]], [[Atrebates]], [[Ambiani]], [[Morini]], [[Menapii]], [[Caleti]], [[Veliocasses]], [[Viromandui]], [[Aduatuci]], [[Condrusi]], [[Eburones]], [[Caeroesi]], and [[Paemani]] tribes, and was under the leadership of [[Galba (Suessiones)|Galba]], a king of the [[Suessiones]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#4|Bello Gallico 2.4]]</ref> These reports provided Caesar with a good pretext for conquering more than Gaul \"itself\", and for this, he raised two legions in Cisalpine Gaul ([[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII]] and [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV]])<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#2|Bello Gallico 2.2]]</ref> and convinced the [[Remi]] tribe to side with him.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#3|Bello Gallico 2.3]] - [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#5|2.5]]</ref>\n\nIn response, the other [[Belgic]] and [[Celt]]ic tribes had attacked [[Bibrax]] (the [[oppidum]] of the Remi, situated near the [[Aisne River]]). Caesar countered by defending the oppidum and winning an action at the Aisne. In the face of this and because of shortage of provisions, the union collapsed and tribal armies retreated to their own lands, with the agreed future intention of coming to the support of any tribe invaded by the Romans. Caesar continued his advance and tribes surrendered one by one. However, four tribes, the Nervii, the Atrebates, the Aduatuci, and the Viromandui refused to submit.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#6|Bello Gallico 2.6]] - [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#14|Bello Gallico 2.14]]</ref>\n\nThe Ambiani told Caesar that the Nervii were the most hostile of the [[Belgae]] to Roman rule. A fierce and brave tribe, they did not allow the import of luxury items as they believed these had a corrupting effect and probably feared Roman influence. They had no intention of entering peace negotiations with the Romans. Caesar would move on them next.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#15|Bello Gallico 2.15]]</ref>\n\n==Forces==\nAs with all ancient battles, estimates of the forces available to both sides will always be a matter of some speculation. A [[Marian reforms#Marian reforms|Roman legion]] during this period had a theoretical strenght of some 4,800 fighting men with additional [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary forces]] (usually skirmishers and cavalry).  Eight Roman legions plus an unkown number of auxiliary (skirmishers: archers, slingers and javelinmen) and allied cavalry are recorded to have taken part in the battle.  It is not known if the legions were at full strength, but a reasonable estimate for Caesar's army might be in the range of 40,000\u201345,000 fighting men (including skirmishers and cavalry). The 40,000\u201345,000 range does not include non-combatants, although, in this case, they participated in the fighting during the final phase of the battle. A legions was usually accompanied by some 1,200 non-combatants (theoretically) so their numbers could have been 9,000-10,000 men.\n\nCaesar claims he had earlier received intelligence from the Remi that the various tribes of the Belgae had promised to contribute a total of 300,000 fighting men. According to Caesar the Remi estimates of the men promised by the four tribes now left to oppose Caesar were:  50,000 Nervii, 15,000 Atrebates, 10,000 Veromandui and 19,000 Aduatuci.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> If these figures were reliable it would mean that Caesar was immediately faced with a maximum of 75,000 men, as the Aduatuci were still en route.  Promises are not always kept so it is probable the actual number was smaller than this, though still high enough to outnumber the legionaries. Drawing on demographic data, [[Hans Delbr\u00fcck]] estimated a maximum of 30,000 combatants for the three tribes fighting at the Sabis, and probably far less.<ref name=Del/>\n\n===Order of battle===\n[[Image:Battle of the Sabis (Selle).png|thumb|Battlefield if the \"Sabis\" matches the River Selle.]]\n[[Image:Bataille laSambre -57.png|thumb|Battlefield if the \"Sabis\" matches the Sambre.]]\n\n[[Roman Republic]] \u2013 Julius Caesar's eight legions: [[Legio VII Claudia|VII]], [[Legio VIII Augusta|VIII]], [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Triumphalis'']], [[Legio X Gemina|X ''Equestris'']], [[Legio XI Claudia|XI]], [[Legio XII Fulminata|XII ''Victrix'']], [[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII]], [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV]] \u2013 auxiliaries: slingers, archers, javelinmen and cavalry. The IX and X legions formed the left flank, the VIII and the XI were in the centre, and the VII and XII were on the right. \n\nThe Belgae attacked with the Atrebates forming the right wing, the Viromandui in the centre, and the Nervi on the left. \n\nTraditionally it was believed that the battle was fought on the banks of the river [[Sambre]], near modern [[Aulnoye-Aymeries]], but in 1955 Turquin showed that it was fought on the west bank of the river [[Selle]], near modern [[Saulzoir]].<ref>Pierre Turquin (\"La Bataille de la Selle (du Sabis) en l' An 57 avant J.-C.\" in Les \u00c9tudes Classiques 23/2 (1955), 113-156)</ref>\n\n==Before the battle==\nCaesar's legions had been marching in Nervian territory for three days, following an ancient road.<ref>Essentially the road that was later paved by the Romans and connected Samarobriva ([[Amiens]]) with [[Cologne]], and is now often referred to as \"Via Belgica\". The position of Bronze Age and Iron Age tombs proves that it already existed in pre-Roman times.</ref> He learnt from prisoners that the Belgae were massing on the far side of the River Sabis, which was about {{convert|10|mi|km}} ahead. The Nervii had persuaded the [[Atrebates]] and the [[Veromandui]] to support them. The [[Aduatuci]] were marching to join them, but they did not arrive in time to take part in the battle.<!--Note: see Book 2.29 --> Their non-combatants had moved to a safe area screened by marshes, where an army could not approach.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#16|Bello Gallico 2.16]]</ref> The Belgae had made their preparations and were now waiting for the Romans.\n\nCaesar sent forward experienced scouts to choose the next campsite.\n\nHe learnt from prisoners taken later that sympathisers in the ragtag of surrendered Belgae and other Gauls travelling with the army had gone to the Nervii and reported the dispositionion of his column. They reported that the individual legionary baggage trains were interspersed between the legions and that it would be easy to cut off the leading legion from the rest and destroy it before any support could reach it. It was believed this would intimidate the Romans into withdrawing. The Nervii, having traditionally always relied on infantry rather than cavalry, had over the years developed a technique of building dense, impenetrable hedges of briars and thorns set between young trees as a defence against the raids of surrounding tribes. These would obstruct Caesar's advance and help the attack. It was agreed that the signal for an attack was to be the appearance of the baggage train behind the first legion.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#17|Bello Gallico 2.17]]</ref> In doing this, the Nervii were intending to use what is recognisable today as the modern army doctrine of [[force concentration]]. As will be seen, their plan would be frustrated by Caesar.\n\n==Battle==\nThe campsite was to be laid out on a hill which gently sloped down to the river. On the other side of the river there was another hill directly opposite, similarly sloping. The top of that hill was densely wooded but the lower part was open and sloped down to the river over a distance of 200 [[Pace (unit)|paces]] (roughly {{convert|300|m|yd}}). The enemy was concealed inside the woods, but a few cavalry pickets could be seen in the open area by the river. The river was very wide,<!--Note: see Book 2.27 --> but only about three&nbsp;feet (one&nbsp;metre) deep.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#18|Bello Gallico 2.18]]</ref>\n\nAt some point on his march to the Sabis, Caesar reorganised the column and reverted to his usual tactic of leading his forces with six legions in light marching order. Behind them was the baggage column of the entire army, followed by the newly recruited legions, [[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII]] and [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV]]. Caesar does not say whether this change was fortuitous or was made in response to the intelligence received. While Caesar's force began to set up camp on the slope running down to the river, his cavalry, together with slingers and archers, was ordered to cross the river to reconnoiter. This developed into a skirmish with the few troops of Belgic cavalry that had been observed on the far side. Caesar describes the enemy cavalry as sallying repeatedly from the woods at the top of the hill and says his cavalry did not dare follow them in when they retreated. He does not elaborate further so it will never be known if the Nervii were trying to entice the skirmishers onto their hidden position or holding them in play on the slopes in preparation for the planned rush.\n\nMeanwhile, the legions had started arriving at the camp site and began to build its fortifications. The Belgae, waiting for the baggage train to appear, gradually found themselves faced with not one legion, but six. Their plan of piecemeal destruction had to be abandoned, but they must have believed their numbers more than adequate to deal with their enemy.\n\n===Ambush===\nAs the Roman baggage train came into view, the Belgic force suddenly rushed out of the trees and surprised their opponents, overwhelming the Roman cavalry. They crossed the shallow river at full speed and charged up the hill against the legions setting up camp, giving them no time to get into battle formation. It seemed to Caesar that the Nervii came on with incredible speed, all at once pouring out of the trees, charging across the river and overrunning his legionaries.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#19|Bello Gallico 2.19]]</ref>\n\nTaken by surprise, Caesar had to rapidly give orders to sound the alarm both by raising the battle-standard and by trumpet, get his men away from construction work, recall the wood-cutting parties, and try to get his legions into some semblance of order. There was very little time and much had to be left undone. Two things, though, saved the legions from being immediately routed\u2014firstly, the knowledge and experience of the soldiers (which meant that they could decide for themselves what to do without waiting for orders) and secondly, Caesar had previously ordered all legion commanders to stay with their legions during the setting up of the camp.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#20|Bello Gallico 2.20]]</ref>\n\nCaesar went wherever he was needed, giving only essential orders and eventually found himself on the left wing with Legion X. Seeing that the enemy were within range of the Romans he gave the order to hurl a volley of pilae. Going to another part of the field, he found his men already fighting. The men had run from their building tasks to fall into ranks but many did not even have time to put on their helmets or take the covers off their shields.<ref>Shields were made of layers of wood and leather, then painted with casein-based paints. The shield was covered when not in use as a protection against rain.</ref> The legionaries had no opportunity to group with their own cohorts and instead congregated around the first friendly standard they saw.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#21|Bello Gallico 2.21]]</ref> Caesar states that the hedges were a considerable obstruction to his men during the battle, although he does not specify their locations on the field,<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#22|Bello Gallico 2.22]]</ref> but the woody hilltop is the one place we can infer their presence.\n\nThe soldiers of legions [[Legio X Equestris|X ''Equestris'']] and [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Triumphalis'']] on the left flank, having thrown their pilae at their Atrebates opponents, charged. They threw the enemy back and drove them into the river, killing many. The Romans crossed the river and found themselves on disadvantageous or uneven ground, but although the Atrebates regrouped and launched a counter-attack, the Romans put them to flight a second time. Further along, in the centre, two legions, [[Legio XI Claudia|XI]] and [[Legio VIII Augusta|VIII]], having checked the Viromandui with whom they were engaged, pushed them from the higher ground into the river.\n\nHowever, as these four legions pushed their opponents back, the front and left of the camp was left undefended and a gap opened up in the Roman line. A compact column of Nervii under [[Boduognatus]] (the overall commander of the Belgae) rushed through the opening. Part of the column turned to encircle the two legions holding the right flank; the rest continued upwards to attack the higher part of the camp.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#23|Bello Gallico 2.23]]</ref>\n\n===Crisis===\nMeanwhile, the routed Roman cavalry and skirmishers were just straggling into camp when they found themselves face to face with the Nervii \u2013 they ran again. Camp followers further up the hill by the camp's back gate had observed the success of the Romans at the river and came down in the hope of plunder, but noticed the Nervii in the camp and also ran. People accompanying the baggage train just arriving were horrified at the sight before them and panicked as well. Even the usually-dependable Treveri cavalry arriving to support the Romans looked at the seemingly hopeless situation and promptly turned for home to report the disaster.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#24|Bello Gallico 2.24]]</ref>\n\nAfter encouraging Legion X, Caesar went to the right wing. Things looked bad. He could see that the men of [[Legio XII Fulminata|XII ''Victrix'']] were crammed so closely together into one mass by their standards that they could not fight effectively. All (six) [[centurion]]s of the fourth cohort were dead, its standard bearer killed, and the standard missing. Of the remaining cohorts, almost all the centurions were either wounded or killed; Baculus,<ref>P. Sextius Baculus survived and is mentioned again by Caesar as an invalid.  See Gallic Wars Books 3.5 and 6.38</ref> the legion's [[Centurion|primipilus]], a fine soldier, had received so many minor and serious wounds that he could barely stand. The Nervii were attacking vigorously from lower ground and pressing at the front and both flanks. Caesar could see some men were shirking and trying to get to the rear; others were slowly ceasing effective resistance. There were no reserves. This was the crisis-point. He took a shield from a soldier at the rear and went to the first line. Calling his centurions by name, he ordered them to have the soldiers advance ([[Aquila (Roman)|signa inferre]]) and the [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]] open up and extend. As he tells it, his arrival brought hope and boosted the soldiers\u2019 morale. Every man was now keen to do well in front of his general. As a result, the enemy assault was checked slightly.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#25|Bello Gallico 2.25]]</ref>\n\n===Recovery===\nCaesar saw that [[Legio VII Claudia|Legion VII]] nearby was also hard-pressed. He ordered the [[tribunes]] to redeploy the two legions to gradually join and fight back to back. This further increased his men's confidence. By now, the legions escorting the baggage, having received a report of the action, had come on at double pace and the enemy could see them coming over the hill above the camp. Legion X, under [[Legatus|legate]] [[Labienus]], had overcome the Atrebates, crossed the river, and defeated the Belgic reserves. Now they seized the Belgic camp on the wooded hill. From the higher ground, Labienus could see that Caesar's right wing was in serious trouble. He ordered his men back across the river to attack the Nervii from the rear.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#26|Bello Gallico 2.26]]</ref>\n\nSoon Legions XIII and XIV joined the fight. Caesar does not detail their actions, but they probably cleared the camp (as it was their nearest target) and went to the right to relieve the pressure on Legions XII and VII. This, coupled with the return of Legion X, transformed the situation. Seeing the position begin to stabilise, cavalry and skirmishers took heart and, keen to wipe out their earlier shame, started to fight in earnest. The camp followers joined in now that they could see their enemy's dismay. The entire Roman force was now fully committed.\n\nAt this point of the battle it is clear that Caesar's opposition had little hope of survival. They were being pushed closer and closer into a dense pack that was being surrounded by Caesar's men who were using projectile weapons to pick off their remaining forces. Using peltasts (a light infantry man) equipped with slings and javelins and with the help of archers, they unleashed a barrage of missiles at the closely packed Nervii. The last of them fought with ferocity and courage for they were continuing to retaliate with their spears and catching the Romans javelins and throwing them back at them. The Nervii hadn't used any other projectile type weapon except for spears. The Nervii warriors fought to the last, standing on the bodies of their slain comrades, and throwing the Romans\u2019 own spears back at them. Eventually the few remaining Nervii broke and fled the field.\n\nCaesar's opinion of the Nervii was that they had shown great fighting spirit in carrying an attack forward so vigorously on to difficult ground and in continuing to fight stubbornly when the tide of battle turned irretrievably against them.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War/Book%202#27|title=Commentaries on the Gallic War|last=Caesar|first=Julius}}</ref> Caesar talks of a grimly inspiring image of the last of the Nervii who were atop a mound of corpses of their own warriors and shouting in defiance towards the Romans, fighting till their last breath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historum.com/ancient-history/60277-battle-sabis-57-bce.html|title=The Battle of the Sabis, 57 BCE - Historum - History Forums|website=historum.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> He goes on to say that they had outstanding courage, for they launched a surprise attack, crossed a river up its banks, then rushed on to attack all with a fighting spirit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/articles/battle/sabis-57-bce/|title=Sabis (57 BCE) - Livius|website=www.livius.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> He glorifies his victory by stating how well his army did without having to be ordered to launch a counter-attack. It was most probable that his soldiers were experienced veterans who were able to hold off their onslaught. Still he mitigated his losses by not including how many casualties he suffered or that they were in serious danger of losing. In his account of this battle in his book \"the Conquest of Gaul\" he gives his view of what actually happened in the battle but it remains one of the only primary sources during that time. And since it was written by Caesar much is unknown of the Nervii's side of the battle, such as how Bodougnats<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Aq48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=boduognats+leader&source=bl&ots=mQOAYGn4Oo&sig=dOI8kXTYjnr4cFGnFdSqGDVED_0&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=boduognats%20leader&f=false|title=Gaius Iulius Cearsar Gallic War|publisher=CUP Archive|language=en}}</ref> (the leader of the Nervii) ordered his men into battle.\n\n==Casualties==\nThe older men of the Nervii, described by Caesar as \u201csenators\u201d, came out of their hiding place in the marshland and surrendered.  They said that their council had been reduced from 600 men to three and that of 60,000 fighting men there were barely 500 left.  It is not entirely clear if this is a figure for the dead or if it includes wounded, nor is it clear if these are solely Nervii casualties or if the figure includes their allies.  Caesar states that he spared the Nervii and ordered the surrounding tribes not to take advantage of their weakness.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#28|Bello Gallico 2.28]]</ref>\n\nCaesar gives no indication of his own casualties.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Aduatuci turned for home as soon as they heard about the defeat. They were subsequently defeated by Caesar and some 53,000 of them sold into slavery.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#29|Bello Gallico 2.29]]</ref><ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#33|Bello Gallico 2.33]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]], the [[Unelli]], the [[Osismii]], the [[Curiosolitae]], the [[Sesuvii]], the [[Aulerci]] and the [[Rhedones]] were all brought under Roman control following the battle.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#34|Bello Gallico 2.34]]</ref>\n\nIn 54 BC [[Ambiorix]] persuaded the Nervii to join the Eburones after the latter had destroyed a legion and five cohorts under [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus|Sabinus]] and [[Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta|Cotta]] during the [[Ambiorix's revolt]].<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#38|Bello Gallico 5.38]]</ref>\n\nDuring [[Vercingetorix]]\u2019s revolt (52 BC) the Nervii were only asked to supply 5,000 men to the forces raised by a confederation of over forty tribes.<ref>[[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 7#75|Bello Gallico 7.75]]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n*Caesar, C.
