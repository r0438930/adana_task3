Bad Homburg is part of the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Regional Authority|Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area]]. The town's formal name is ''Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he'' (translated as \"Bad Homburg before the Height\") to distinguish it from other places named Homburg. The name is abbreviated as ''Bad Homburg v. d. H\u00f6he''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bad-homburg.de/vv/stadtrecht/10-1_Hauptsatzung-26-05-2011.pdf|title=Hauptsatzung der Stadt Bad Homburg v.d.

This ''Villa Tidenheim'' was equated with the Old Town, named \"Dietigheim\". Local historian R\u00fcdiger Kurth doubted this traditional story based on his study of written sources and local factors. During 2002 Kurth initiated [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavations, by the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]], managed by Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed that there was not any evidence of settlement between the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and the 13th century. It seems that the historical record which mentions Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch as Homburg's founder, as a documentary witness in Eberbach,<!--Is that the right way to translate \"in der Eberbacher Zeugenreihe\"? --> about 1180 is the first good evidence of the town's existence.\n[[File:White Tower Bad Homburg Germany.JPG|thumb|left|White Tower, viewed from Loewengasse 7.]]\n[[File:Landgrafenschloss.JPG|thumb|right|Landgraves' stately home with park and the ''Schlossturm'' (\"Wei\u00dfer Turm\" or \"White Tower\"), Bad Homburg's landmark.]]\n[[File:Bad-homburg-turm.jpg|thumb|right|''Schlossturm'' in Bad Homburg.]]\n[[File:Bad homburg golf club.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Homburg Golf Club House in the Kurpark.]]\n[[File:Bad homburg tennis club.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Homburg Tennis Club in the Kurpark.]]\n[[File:2007-09-16BadHomburgRussischeKapelle02.jpg|thumb|\"Russian Chapel\", or rather All Hallows' Church.]]\n\nAs early as 1962, in an excavation under the ''Hirschgangfl\u00fcgel'' (\"Hart-stalking-wing\") of Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' (stately home), two burnt layers were discovered, which the man conducting the dig, G\u00fcnther Binding, accepted as evidence of two former [[castle]]s having been built on the site, one after the other, but each having burnt down later.\n\nFurther digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' during April 2006, once again initiated by Kurth and managed by Professor Henning, resulted in the discovery that it was actually only one burnt layer, from a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] building\u2014- possibly a castle with towers\u2014- which from [[ceramic]] finds could be dated to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building had an association with Wortwin's \"castle\". Quite possibly, though, a further cultural layer from an even earlier time lies underneath these remains. Investigations using methods from natural science ([[carbon-14 dating]] and [[wikt:micromorphological|micromorphological]] analysis) will show whether the dating can be made more precise.\n\nHomberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.\n\nThe town's name, \"Homburg\", is from the ''Hohenberg'' Castle. The postfix \"vor der H\u00f6he\" was probably first recorded in a document of 1399. The designation ''\"Bad\"'' was not conferred until 1912.\n\nThe Hessen-Homburg noble family of [[landgrave]]s was initiated by Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680\u20131708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. During 1866, as a result of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Homburg became [[Prussia]]n territory.\n\n===Spa town and imperial residence===\nWith the beginning of the spa industry in the town during the mid-19th century, which profited greatly from its [[casino]], the town became an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was favoured particularly by Russian nobility for its baths.\n\nThe spa industry began with the discovery of the ''Elisabethenbrunnen'' (''Brunnen'' is German for \"well\") during 1834. The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built during 1841\u20131842 by the brothers [[Fran\u00e7ois Blanc|Fran\u00e7ois]] (1806\u20131877) and Louis Blanc (1806\u20131852), who later owned the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. During 1860, the town was connected with [[Frankfurt]] by a railway line, the ''[[Homburg Railway|Homburger Bahn]]''.\n\nDuring 1888, Homburg became known throughout the [[German Empire]] because [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared Homburg's ''Schloss'' an Imperial summer residence, and later financed the building of the [[Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg|Church of the Redeemer (Erl\u00f6serkirche)]] nearby. His mother, too, lived there for several years. [[Edward VII]] of the UK was also often a guest. It was he who introduced the [[Homburg hat]] and permanent turn-up trousers. He also experienced fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.\n\nThe \"Bad Homburger Golf Club 1899 e. V.\" in the ''R\u00f6derweisen'' in Dornholzhausen\u2014nowadays part of Bad Homburg\u2014- is Germany's oldest [[Country club|golf club]]. It had its beginnings in the Bad Homburg Spa Park (''Kurpark''), where the old clubhouse and even playable parts of the old [[golf course]] may still be found.\n\nNot far away stands the Russian Chapel\u2014- more properly called All Hallows' Church\u2014- an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] church the first stone of which was laid in the Russian Imperial couple's presence on 16 October 1896, although they did not attend when it was consecrated almost three years later<!---Yes, this contradicts the German article, but not the link in the German article.--->.\n\nKing [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam (Thailand) sent a Thai garden pavilion in gratitude for a successful cure. It was erected during 1914.\n\n[[Horex]] was a well known German motorcycle brand of the \"Horex\u2014Fahrzeugbau AG\", founded during 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.\n\n===Jewish history===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:Denkmal Samuel Agnon Bad Homburg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Memorial to [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] in Bad Homburg]]\n\nDuring 1335, permission was given by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] to [[Lords of Eppstein|Gottfried von Eppstein]] to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of [[Eppstein]], Homburg, and [[Steinheim (Hanau)|Steinheim]]; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first [[Jewish cemetery]] was purchased during the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that during 1703 the landgrave [[Frederick II of Hesse]] decided on the construction of a special [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Judengasse]] (Jewish quarter). A synagogue, built during 1731, was replaced by a new one during 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally part of the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] but began to appoint its own rabbis during the 19th century.\n\nA [[Hebrew]] printing house was located in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis during 1710 until 1713 when he relocated to [[Offenbach am Main]]. Among other items, he published [[Jacob ibn \u1e24abib]]'s ''[[Ein Ya'akov]]'' (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there during 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired during 1736 by Aaron ben \u1e92evi Dessau whose publications included the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]] ([[Choshen Mishpat|\u1e24oshen Mishpat]])'' with commentary (1742). The press was sold during 1748 and transferred during 1749 to [[Roedelheim]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) during 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 during 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported during 1942/1943.<ref>FJW, 215; ''[[Germania Judaica]]'', vol. 2 (1968), 369; PKG</ref>\n\n===Modern age===\nWhile the spa business experienced a long-term decrease after the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of [[Bizone|bizonal]] authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the \"Special Money and Credit Centre\" here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was managed by [[Ludwig Erhard]]. After the Federal Republic of Germany\u2014- West Germany\u2014- was founded with its capital in [[Bonn]], the Federal Debt Administration (''Bundesschuldenverwaltung''), the Office for Security Adjustment (''Amt f\u00fcr Wertpapierbereinigung'') and the Federal Equalization Office (''Bundesausgleichsamt'') stayed in Bad Homburg.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, one of its members, [[Alfred Herrhausen]], the manager of the [[Deutsche Bank]], was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It is alleged that this was an attack by the [[Red Army Faction]], though this has never been proven.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/herrhausen-mord-neue-theorie-ueber-die-herkunft-der-bombe-a-1005698.html|title=Herrhausen-Mord: Neue Theorie \u00fcber die Herkunft der Bombe|trans-title=Herrhausen-Murder: New Theory Regarding Origin of the Bomb|publisher=Spiegel Online|language=German|date=2014-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Bad Homburg-Panorama.jpg|1500px|Panorama}}\n\n===Lord Mayors===\n*Karl Tettenborn \t\u2014 \t1892\u20131901\n*Ernst Ritter von Marx \t\u2014 \t1901\u20131905\n*Konrad Ma\u00df \t\u2014 \t1905\u20131907\n*Walter L\u00fcbke \tDVP \t1907\u20131924\n*Georg Eberlein \tDVP \t1924\u20131933\n*Richard Hardt \tNSDAP \t1933\u20131934\n*Erich Meusel \tNSDAP \t1933\u20131945\n*Georg Eberlein [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], 1945-1948 \n*Karl Horn [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], 1948-1962\n*Armin Klein CDU, 1962-1980, since 1979 with official designation '' Lord Mayor ''\n*Wolfgang Assmann CDU, 1980-1998\n*Reinhard Wolters CDU, 1998-2003 Lord Mayor; His election was subsequently declared invalid, Wolters was thus never officially Lord Mayor.

The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal [[Canting arms|canting]].

Local historian R\u00fcdiger Kurth doubted this traditional story based on his study of written sources and local factors. During 2002 Kurth initiated [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavations, by the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]], managed by Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed that there was not any evidence of settlement between the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and the 13th century. It seems that the historical record which mentions Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch as Homburg's founder, as a documentary witness in Eberbach,<!--Is that the right way to translate \"in der Eberbacher Zeugenreihe\"? --> about 1180 is the first good evidence of the town's existence.\n[[File:White Tower Bad Homburg Germany.JPG|thumb|left|White Tower, viewed from Loewengasse 7.]]\n[[File:Landgrafenschloss.JPG|thumb|right|Landgraves' stately home with park and the ''Schlossturm'' (\"Wei\u00dfer Turm\" or \"White Tower\"), Bad Homburg's landmark.]]\n[[File:Bad-homburg-turm.jpg|thumb|right|''Schlossturm'' in Bad Homburg.]]\n[[File:Bad homburg golf club.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Homburg Golf Club House in the Kurpark.]]\n[[File:Bad homburg tennis club.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Homburg Tennis Club in the Kurpark.]]\n[[File:2007-09-16BadHomburgRussischeKapelle02.jpg|thumb|\"Russian Chapel\", or rather All Hallows' Church.]]\n\nAs early as 1962, in an excavation under the ''Hirschgangfl\u00fcgel'' (\"Hart-stalking-wing\") of Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' (stately home), two burnt layers were discovered, which the man conducting the dig, G\u00fcnther Binding, accepted as evidence of two former [[castle]]s having been built on the site, one after the other, but each having burnt down later.\n\nFurther digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' during April 2006, once again initiated by Kurth and managed by Professor Henning, resulted in the discovery that it was actually only one burnt layer, from a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] building\u2014- possibly a castle with towers\u2014- which from [[ceramic]] finds could be dated to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building had an association with Wortwin's \"castle\". Quite possibly, though, a further cultural layer from an even earlier time lies underneath these remains. Investigations using methods from natural science ([[carbon-14 dating]] and [[wikt:micromorphological|micromorphological]] analysis) will show whether the dating can be made more precise.\n\nHomberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.\n\nThe town's name, \"Homburg\", is from the ''Hohenberg'' Castle. The postfix \"vor der H\u00f6he\" was probably first recorded in a document of 1399. The designation ''\"Bad\"'' was not conferred until 1912.\n\nThe Hessen-Homburg noble family of [[landgrave]]s was initiated by Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680\u20131708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. During 1866, as a result of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Homburg became [[Prussia]]n territory.\n\n===Spa town and imperial residence===\nWith the beginning of the spa industry in the town during the mid-19th century, which profited greatly from its [[casino]], the town became an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was favoured particularly by Russian nobility for its baths.\n\nThe spa industry began with the discovery of the ''Elisabethenbrunnen'' (''Brunnen'' is German for \"well\") during 1834. The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built during 1841\u20131842 by the brothers [[Fran\u00e7ois Blanc|Fran\u00e7ois]] (1806\u20131877) and Louis Blanc (1806\u20131852), who later owned the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. During 1860, the town was connected with [[Frankfurt]] by a railway line, the ''[[Homburg Railway|Homburger Bahn]]''.\n\nDuring 1888, Homburg became known throughout the [[German Empire]] because [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared Homburg's ''Schloss'' an Imperial summer residence, and later financed the building of the [[Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg|Church of the Redeemer (Erl\u00f6serkirche)]] nearby. His mother, too, lived there for several years. [[Edward VII]] of the UK was also often a guest. It was he who introduced the [[Homburg hat]] and permanent turn-up trousers. He also experienced fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.\n\nThe \"Bad Homburger Golf Club 1899 e. V.\" in the ''R\u00f6derweisen'' in Dornholzhausen\u2014nowadays part of Bad Homburg\u2014- is Germany's oldest [[Country club|golf club]]. It had its beginnings in the Bad Homburg Spa Park (''Kurpark''), where the old clubhouse and even playable parts of the old [[golf course]] may still be found.\n\nNot far away stands the Russian Chapel\u2014- more properly called All Hallows' Church\u2014- an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] church the first stone of which was laid in the Russian Imperial couple's presence on 16 October 1896, although they did not attend when it was consecrated almost three years later<!---Yes, this contradicts the German article, but not the link in the German article.--->.\n\nKing [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam (Thailand) sent a Thai garden pavilion in gratitude for a successful cure. It was erected during 1914.\n\n[[Horex]] was a well known German motorcycle brand of the \"Horex\u2014Fahrzeugbau AG\", founded during 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.\n\n===Jewish history===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:Denkmal Samuel Agnon Bad Homburg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Memorial to [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] in Bad Homburg]]\n\nDuring 1335, permission was given by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] to [[Lords of Eppstein|Gottfried von Eppstein]] to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of [[Eppstein]], Homburg, and [[Steinheim (Hanau)|Steinheim]]; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first [[Jewish cemetery]] was purchased during the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that during 1703 the landgrave [[Frederick II of Hesse]] decided on the construction of a special [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Judengasse]] (Jewish quarter). A synagogue, built during 1731, was replaced by a new one during 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally part of the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] but began to appoint its own rabbis during the 19th century.\n\nA [[Hebrew]] printing house was located in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis during 1710 until 1713 when he relocated to [[Offenbach am Main]]. Among other items, he published [[Jacob ibn \u1e24abib]]'s ''[[Ein Ya'akov]]'' (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there during 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired during 1736 by Aaron ben \u1e92evi Dessau whose publications included the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]] ([[Choshen Mishpat|\u1e24oshen Mishpat]])'' with commentary (1742). The press was sold during 1748 and transferred during 1749 to [[Roedelheim]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) during 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 during 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported during 1942/1943.<ref>FJW, 215; ''[[Germania Judaica]]'', vol. 2 (1968), 369; PKG</ref>\n\n===Modern age===\nWhile the spa business experienced a long-term decrease after the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of [[Bizone|bizonal]] authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the \"Special Money and Credit Centre\" here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was managed by [[Ludwig Erhard]]. After the Federal Republic of Germany\u2014- West Germany\u2014- was founded with its capital in [[Bonn]], the Federal Debt Administration (''Bundesschuldenverwaltung''), the Office for Security Adjustment (''Amt f\u00fcr Wertpapierbereinigung'') and the Federal Equalization Office (''Bundesausgleichsamt'') stayed in Bad Homburg.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, one of its members, [[Alfred Herrhausen]], the manager of the [[Deutsche Bank]], was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It is alleged that this was an attack by the [[Red Army Faction]], though this has never been proven.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/herrhausen-mord-neue-theorie-ueber-die-herkunft-der-bombe-a-1005698.html|title=Herrhausen-Mord: Neue Theorie \u00fcber die Herkunft der Bombe|trans-title=Herrhausen-Murder: New Theory Regarding Origin of the Bomb|publisher=Spiegel Online|language=German|date=2014-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Bad Homburg-Panorama.jpg|1500px|Panorama}}\n\n===Lord Mayors===\n*Karl Tettenborn \t\u2014 \t1892\u20131901\n*Ernst Ritter von Marx \t\u2014 \t1901\u20131905\n*Konrad Ma\u00df \t\u2014 \t1905\u20131907\n*Walter L\u00fcbke \tDVP \t1907\u20131924\n*Georg Eberlein \tDVP \t1924\u20131933\n*Richard Hardt \tNSDAP \t1933\u20131934\n*Erich Meusel \tNSDAP \t1933\u20131945\n*Georg Eberlein [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], 1945-1948 \n*Karl Horn [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], 1948-1962\n*Armin Klein CDU, 1962-1980, since 1979 with official designation '' Lord Mayor ''\n*Wolfgang Assmann CDU, 1980-1998\n*Reinhard Wolters CDU, 1998-2003 Lord Mayor; His election was subsequently declared invalid, Wolters was thus never officially Lord Mayor.

The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal [[Canting arms|canting]]. The colours, with silver adzes in a blue field, have been in use at least since 1621.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/b/bad-homb.htm NGW.nl]</ref>\n\n==Schools==\n* [[Kaiserin-Friedrich-Gymnasium]]\n*
