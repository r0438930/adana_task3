Born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Jackson played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State]], and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].\n\nThe Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].\n\n==Early life and college career==\nJackson was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson then enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] and played three games for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team as a freshman but suffered a season-ending injury.

They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected.

And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach. So what can he do with coaching?\"<ref>\"That's a good question,\" many people reply, noting that Jackson is Seattle's only Black Mormon.

Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.\n\nOn September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that.

Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead.

Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions.

Jackson missed three games because of injuries, which included a strained groin, a concussion and a fractured index finger. The Vikings failed to make the playoffs.

Several analysts believed better quarterback play was all that was needed to make the Vikings one of the top contending teams in the NFL, and with the [[Green Bay Packers]] losing [[Brett Favre]] the [[NFC North Division]] was up for grabs.

Born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Jackson played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State]], and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].\n\nThe Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].\n\n==Early life and college career==\nJackson was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson then enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] and played three games for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team as a freshman but suffered a season-ending injury.

They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected.

And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach.

Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.\n\nOn September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that.

Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead.

Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions.
