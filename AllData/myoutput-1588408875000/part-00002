The Veenai is made by Lord Shiva himself. The Veenai is also Lord Parvati in instrumental form. Miracles would occur when certain tunes were played on it. The Rudhra Veenai arrives in Thodipuram carried by a Muslim man called Nawab Jan Baba, in AD 1702. 300 years later, in the year 2002, Thodipuram becomes the most prosperous village in South India because it housed the Rudhra Veenai. Mysterious happenings occur at Rani Bungalow, where Baba's spirit is believed to be roaming. Only women from the Dasi family could enter and leave the Bungalow without harm. Many people claiming to be Rudhran try to attain the Rudhra Veenai. The claims to be Rudhran are grounded in the logic that only a Rudhran sent by Lord Shiva would be able to play the Rudhra Veena.\n\nWho is the Rudhran? Where does the Veena go? Who plays the Veena every night? What is causing the heavy protection around the Rani Bungalow? Why are the Dasi women going to the Bungalow at night and engaging in some mysterious Poojai? All these questions are answered as the show progresses.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLormYfA9XqyDlyMCKj0ag1vr5oEpAXtbt Rudraveenai on Youtube]\n{{Sun TV shows}}\n[[Category:Sun TV television series]]\n[[Category:Tamil-language television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Tamil Nadu drama television series]]\n[[Category:2002 Tamil-language television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2004 Tamil-language television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s Tamil-language television series]]\n[[Category:Tamil-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television programmes based on Indian novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=August 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2015}}\n{{copyedit |date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Rudraveenai\n| image                    = \n| caption                  = \n| genre                    = [[Mystery film|mystery]]-[[Thriller film|suspense]]\n| creator                  = \n| based_on                 = Rudhraveenai novel by [[Indra Soundar Rajan]]\n| writer                   = [[Indra Soundar Rajan]]\n| director                 = Rakesh Sinha\n| starring                 = [[Chetan (actor)| Chethan]] <br> [[Santhoshi]] <br> [[Kaveri (Tamil actress) | Kaveri]] <br> [[Bala Singh]] <br> [[Y.
