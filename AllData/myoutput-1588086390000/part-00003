Based on [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|1999 novel of the same name]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Claire Danes]], [[Charlie Cox]], [[Sienna Miller]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and [[Robert De Niro]], with narration by [[Ian McKellen]].\n\nThe film follows Tristan, a young man from the fictional town of Wall in [[Great Britain]]. Wall is a town on the border of the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold. Tristan enters the magical world to collect a fallen star to give to his crush Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. He collects the star who, to his surprise, is a woman named Yvaine. [[Witches]] and the Princes of Stormhold are also hunting for Yvaine. Meanwhile, Tristan tries to get her back to Wall with him before Victoria's birthday, the deadline of her offer.\n\nThe film was released to positive reviews and grossed $137 million on a $70\u201388.5 million budget.<ref name=\"numbers\" /> In 2008, it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]].<ref name=\"hugo\" /> ''Stardust'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[HD DVD]] on December 18, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\nThe English village of Wall lies near a stone wall that borders the magical kingdom of Stormhold. A guard prevents anyone from crossing. Dunstan Thorne crosses over the wall and into the Wall Market. He meets an enslaved princess named Una, who offers him a glass [[snowdrop]] in exchange for a kiss. Nine months later, the Wall Guard delivers a baby to Dunstan, saying the baby's name is Tristan.\n\nEighteen years later, the dying King of Stormhold throws a ruby into the sky, decreeing that his successor will be the first of his [[fratricidal]] sons to recover it. The gem hits a star, they fall together, and the remaining sons, Primus and Septimus, independently search for the now clear gem.\n\nIn Wall, Tristan sees the star fall and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she left for him, which can take the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He chains her to bring her to Victoria.\n\nThree ancient witch sisters in Stormhold resolve to eat the fallen star's heart to recover their youth and replenish their powers. Their leader, [[Lamia]], eats the remnants of an earlier star's heart, and sets off to find Yvaine. She conjures up a wayside inn as a trap.\n\nYvaine becomes tired, so Tristan chains her to a tree and promises to bring food. In his absence, a [[unicorn]] releases her, but unwittingly takes her to Lamia's inn. Tristan discovers Yvaine gone, but the stars whisper that she is in danger, telling him to get on a passing coach, which happens to be Primus'. At the inn, they interrupt Lamia's attempt to kill Yvaine. Lamia kills Primus, but Tristan and Yvaine use the Babylon candle to escape into the clouds, where they are captured by [[Air pirate|pirates]] in a flying ship. The leader, Captain Shakespeare, befriends Tristan and Yvaine, teaching Tristan how to [[fencing|fence]] and Yvaine how to dance.\n\nSeptimus discovers that as the last surviving son, he needs only find the stone to claim the throne. He learns it is in the possession of the fallen star and realizes that the heart of a star grants [[immortality]].\n\nAfter leaving Captain Shakespeare's ship, Tristan and Yvaine confess their love for one another and spend the night together at an inn. Come morning, Tristan leaves Yvaine sleeping and goes to Wall with a lock of her hair, to tell Victoria he will not marry her, having fallen in love with Yvaine. When the lock turns to stardust, he realizes Yvaine will die if she crosses the wall, and rushes back to save her.\n\nYvaine finds Tristan gone, and starts walking towards the wall, thinking he has abandoned her for Victoria. Tristan's mother Una notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so she takes the [[Vardo (gypsy wagon)|caravan]] of her enslaver, a witch named Ditchwater Sal, to stop her. Lamia kills Sal, and captures Una and Yvaine, taking them to the witches' castle. Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the castle, Septimus recognises the princess as his long lost sister and Una informs Tristan that she is his mother.\n\nSeptimus and Tristan kill two of the witches, but Lamia uses a [[voodoo doll]] to kill Septimus. Lamia is about to finish Tristan off, when she appears to break down over the loss of her sisters. Lamia frees Yvaine, but her feigned defeat was a ruse, and she tries to kill them both. As Tristan and Yvaine embrace, their love allows her to shine once again, vaporising Lamia.\n\nTristan retrieves the jewel that Yvaine was wearing. As the jewel turns red, Una explains that, as her son, Tristan is the last male heir of Stormhold. He becomes king with Yvaine as his queen while Dunstan and Una are reunited. After eighty years of ruling Stormhold, they use a Babylon candle to ascend to the sky, where they live together as stars.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Michelle Pfeiffer 2007.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Michelle Pfeiffer at the Stardust premiere, by Jeremiah Christopher|Michelle Pfeiffer at the Stardust premiere, in Hollywood]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Yvaine, the fallen star\n* [[Charlie Cox]] as Tristan Thorn\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Lamia\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Prince Septimus\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Captain Shakespeare of the ''Caspartine''\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Prince Primus\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Prince Secundus\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Ferdiland \"Ferdy\" the [[Fence (criminal)|Fence]]\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Victoria Forester\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as the dying King of Stormhold\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as the Narrator\n* [[Kate Magowan]] as Princess Una\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Mormo, Lamia's sister\n* [[Sarah Alexander]] as Empusa,  Lamia's other sister\n* [[Mark Heap]] as Prince Tertius\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as the ghost of Prince Quartus\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as the ghost of Prince Quintus\n* [[David Walliams]] as the ghost of Prince Sextus\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Dunstan Thorn\n** [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as a young Dunstan Thorn\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Humphrey, Victoria's boyfriend\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as the Wall Guard\n* [[Melanie Hill]] as Ditchwater Sal\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Billy, the Goat converted into human form\n* [[Jake Curran]] as Bernard\n** [[Olivia Grant (actress born 1983)|Olivia Grant]] as Bernard's female form\n* [[George Innes]] as the Soothsayer\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as the Skinny Pirate\n* [[Eliot Sumner|Eliot (Coco) Sumner]] as Ingrid, Yvaine's sister\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] as the New Bishop\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''[[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|Stardust]]'' is an [[Fantasy literature|illustrated fantasy story]] created by [[Neil Gaiman]], with art by [[Charles Vess]].

Encouraged by publisher Avon Gaiman decided to adapt ''Stardust'' and in 1999 it was republished as a conventional novel in hardback without illustrations. Gaiman has compared the story to a fantasy version of the 1934 romantic comedy film ''[[It Happened One Night]]''.<ref name=\"den-10\" /><ref name=\"aintitcool\" />\n\nIn 1998 ''Stardust'' was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] for a film adaptation by [[Bob Weinstein]] at [[Miramax]].

Gilliam dropped out following his involvement with ''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|The Brothers Grimm]]'' not wanting to do another fairytale. Vaughn left to produce ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' but became the director for the first time on that project. After Vaughn withdrew from helming the film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' talks resumed and in January 2005, Vaughn acquired the option to develop the [[film adaptation]].<ref>{{cite news | date=16 January 2005 | author=Adam Dawtrey | url= https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/vaughn-pushes-ahead-with-u-n-c-l-e-feature-1117916360/ | title= Vaughn pushes ahead with 'U.N.C.L.E.' feature | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date= 2019-07-23 }}</ref> In October 2005, the director entered final negotiations with [[Paramount Pictures]] to direct and produce ''Stardust'' with a budget estimated at {{US$}}70 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/1566862/stardust-author-neil-gaiman-tells-why-he-turns-down-most-adaptations-but-not-this-one/ | title='Stardust' Author Neil Gaiman Tells Why He Turns Down Most Adaptations \u2013 But Not This One | publisher=MTV | date=10 August 2007 | access-date=2008-02-14 }}</ref>\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe adapted screenplay was written by Vaughn and screenwriter [[Jane Goldman]] who had been recommended by Gaiman.<ref name=\"latimes-adams\" /><ref name=\"aintitcool\" /> When asked how the book inspired his vision for the film, Vaughn said that he wanted \"to do ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|Princess Bride]]'' with a ''[[Midnight Run]]'' overtone.\"<ref name=\"superherohype\">{{cite web |date= 2 August 2007 |last= Douglas |first= Edward |title=Exclusive: Stardust Director Matthew Vaughn |publisher=Superherohype.com |url= https://www.superherohype.com/features/94533-exclusive-stardust-director-matthew-vaughn |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160114033149/https://www.superherohype.com/features/94533-exclusive-stardust-director-matthew-vaughn |archive-date= 2016-01-14 |url-status= dead |access-date= 2019-07-24 }}</ref> One of the difficulties with adapting the novel was its earnest and dark nature: an adult fairy tale in which sex and violence are presented unflinchingly. As a result of changes, the movie version has a greater element of whimsy and humour, with Gaiman's blessing given to the screenwriters. Gaiman did not want people to go to the theatre to see a film that attempted to be completely loyal to ''Stardust'' the book and failed.<ref>{{ cite news | date= 30 July 2007 | author= Anthony Breznican | title= Storyteller Gaiman wishes upon a star |access-date= 2007-09-27 | work= [[USA Today]] | url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-07-30-neil-gaiman_N.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080914052952/https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-07-30-neil-gaiman_N.htm |archive-date= 2008-09-14 |url-status= live }}</ref> After creating the [[audiobook]] version of the novel, Gaiman realised that there were 10\u00bd&nbsp;hours of material in the book.

Budgetary concerns also factored into the adaptation, even with the level of 2006 technology.<ref name=\"Brooke Tarnoff\" /> The character Captain Shakespeare was expanded extensively from the novel, and the character Ferdy the Fence was created for the film. \n\nVaughn and Goldman decided that the witches needed names (as in the book they were collectively the [[Lilim]] and their names were lost beneath the sea); their [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] decisions included names also found in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (Empusa) and ''[[Neverwhere]]'' (Lamia).<ref>{{cite web | first = Neil | last = Gaiman | title = Neil Gaiman's Journal: April 2006 | url= http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061115080729/http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html | archive-date = 15 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOn the film's differences from the novel, Gaiman commented: \"I sort of feel like my grounding in comics was actually very useful because in my head, that's just the [[Earth-Two]] version of ''Stardust''.

Vaughn]] and co-written by Vaughn and [[Jane Goldman]].

Wall is a town on the border of the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold. Tristan enters the magical world to collect a fallen star to give to his crush Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. He collects the star who, to his surprise, is a woman named Yvaine. [[Witches]] and the Princes of Stormhold are also hunting for Yvaine. Meanwhile, Tristan tries to get her back to Wall with him before Victoria's birthday, the deadline of her offer.\n\nThe film was released to positive reviews and grossed $137 million on a $70\u201388.5 million budget.<ref name=\"numbers\" /> In 2008, it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]].<ref name=\"hugo\" /> ''Stardust'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[HD DVD]] on December 18, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\nThe English village of Wall lies near a stone wall that borders the magical kingdom of Stormhold. A guard prevents anyone from crossing. Dunstan Thorne crosses over the wall and into the Wall Market. He meets an enslaved princess named Una, who offers him a glass [[snowdrop]] in exchange for a kiss. Nine months later, the Wall Guard delivers a baby to Dunstan, saying the baby's name is Tristan.\n\nEighteen years later, the dying King of Stormhold throws a ruby into the sky, decreeing that his successor will be the first of his [[fratricidal]] sons to recover it. The gem hits a star, they fall together, and the remaining sons, Primus and Septimus, independently search for the now clear gem.\n\nIn Wall, Tristan sees the star fall and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she left for him, which can take the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He chains her to bring her to Victoria.\n\nThree ancient witch sisters in Stormhold resolve to eat the fallen star's heart to recover their youth and replenish their powers. Their leader, [[Lamia]], eats the remnants of an earlier star's heart, and sets off to find Yvaine. She conjures up a wayside inn as a trap.\n\nYvaine becomes tired, so Tristan chains her to a tree and promises to bring food. In his absence, a [[unicorn]] releases her, but unwittingly takes her to Lamia's inn. Tristan discovers Yvaine gone, but the stars whisper that she is in danger, telling him to get on a passing coach, which happens to be Primus'. At the inn, they interrupt Lamia's attempt to kill Yvaine. Lamia kills Primus, but Tristan and Yvaine use the Babylon candle to escape into the clouds, where they are captured by [[Air pirate|pirates]] in a flying ship. The leader, Captain Shakespeare, befriends Tristan and Yvaine, teaching Tristan how to [[fencing|fence]] and Yvaine how to dance.\n\nSeptimus discovers that as the last surviving son, he needs only find the stone to claim the throne. He learns it is in the possession of the fallen star and realizes that the heart of a star grants [[immortality]].\n\nAfter leaving Captain Shakespeare's ship, Tristan and Yvaine confess their love for one another and spend the night together at an inn. Come morning, Tristan leaves Yvaine sleeping and goes to Wall with a lock of her hair, to tell Victoria he will not marry her, having fallen in love with Yvaine. When the lock turns to stardust, he realizes Yvaine will die if she crosses the wall, and rushes back to save her.\n\nYvaine finds Tristan gone, and starts walking towards the wall, thinking he has abandoned her for Victoria. Tristan's mother Una notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so she takes the [[Vardo (gypsy wagon)|caravan]] of her enslaver, a witch named Ditchwater Sal, to stop her. Lamia kills Sal, and captures Una and Yvaine, taking them to the witches' castle. Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the castle, Septimus recognises the princess as his long lost sister and Una informs Tristan that she is his mother.\n\nSeptimus and Tristan kill two of the witches, but Lamia uses a [[voodoo doll]] to kill Septimus. Lamia is about to finish Tristan off, when she appears to break down over the loss of her sisters. Lamia frees Yvaine, but her feigned defeat was a ruse, and she tries to kill them both. As Tristan and Yvaine embrace, their love allows her to shine once again, vaporising Lamia.\n\nTristan retrieves the jewel that Yvaine was wearing. As the jewel turns red, Una explains that, as her son, Tristan is the last male heir of Stormhold. He becomes king with Yvaine as his queen while Dunstan and Una are reunited. After eighty years of ruling Stormhold, they use a Babylon candle to ascend to the sky, where they live together as stars.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Michelle Pfeiffer 2007.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Michelle Pfeiffer at the Stardust premiere, by Jeremiah Christopher|Michelle Pfeiffer at the Stardust premiere, in Hollywood]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Yvaine, the fallen star\n* [[Charlie Cox]] as Tristan Thorn\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Lamia\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Prince Septimus\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Captain Shakespeare of the ''Caspartine''\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Prince Primus\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Prince Secundus\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Ferdiland \"Ferdy\" the [[Fence (criminal)|Fence]]\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Victoria Forester\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as the dying King of Stormhold\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as the Narrator\n* [[Kate Magowan]] as Princess Una\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Mormo, Lamia's sister\n* [[Sarah Alexander]] as Empusa,  Lamia's other sister\n* [[Mark Heap]] as Prince Tertius\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as the ghost of Prince Quartus\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as the ghost of Prince Quintus\n* [[David Walliams]] as the ghost of Prince Sextus\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Dunstan Thorn\n** [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as a young Dunstan Thorn\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Humphrey, Victoria's boyfriend\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as the Wall Guard\n* [[Melanie Hill]] as Ditchwater Sal\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Billy, the Goat converted into human form\n* [[Jake Curran]] as Bernard\n** [[Olivia Grant (actress born 1983)|Olivia Grant]] as Bernard's female form\n* [[George Innes]] as the Soothsayer\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as the Skinny Pirate\n* [[Eliot Sumner|Eliot (Coco) Sumner]] as Ingrid, Yvaine's sister\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] as the New Bishop\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''[[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|Stardust]]'' is an [[Fantasy literature|illustrated fantasy story]] created by [[Neil Gaiman]], with art by [[Charles Vess]]. It was first published by [[DC Comics]] in 1997 as a prestige format four-issue comic mini-series. Encouraged by publisher Avon Gaiman decided to adapt ''Stardust'' and in 1999 it was republished as a conventional novel in hardback without illustrations. Gaiman has compared the story to a fantasy version of the 1934 romantic comedy film ''[[It Happened One Night]]''.<ref name=\"den-10\" /><ref name=\"aintitcool\" />\n\nIn 1998 ''Stardust'' was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] for a film adaptation by [[Bob Weinstein]] at [[Miramax]].

Gilliam dropped out following his involvement with ''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|The Brothers Grimm]]'' not wanting to do another fairytale. Vaughn left to produce ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' but became the director for the first time on that project. After Vaughn withdrew from helming the film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' talks resumed and in January 2005, Vaughn acquired the option to develop the [[film adaptation]].<ref>{{cite news | date=16 January 2005 | author=Adam Dawtrey | url= https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/vaughn-pushes-ahead-with-u-n-c-l-e-feature-1117916360/ | title= Vaughn pushes ahead with 'U.N.C.L.E.' feature | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date= 2019-07-23 }}</ref> In October 2005, the director entered final negotiations with [[Paramount Pictures]] to direct and produce ''Stardust'' with a budget estimated at {{US$}}70 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/1566862/stardust-author-neil-gaiman-tells-why-he-turns-down-most-adaptations-but-not-this-one/ | title='Stardust' Author Neil Gaiman Tells Why He Turns Down Most Adaptations \u2013 But Not This One | publisher=MTV | date=10 August 2007 | access-date=2008-02-14 }}</ref>\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe adapted screenplay was written by Vaughn and screenwriter [[Jane Goldman]] who had been recommended by Gaiman.<ref name=\"latimes-adams\" /><ref name=\"aintitcool\" /> When asked how the book inspired his vision for the film, Vaughn said that he wanted \"to do ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|Princess Bride]]'' with a ''[[Midnight Run]]'' overtone.\"<ref name=\"superherohype\">{{cite web |date= 2 August 2007 |last= Douglas |first= Edward |title=Exclusive: Stardust Director Matthew Vaughn |publisher=Superherohype.com |url= https://www.superherohype.com/features/94533-exclusive-stardust-director-matthew-vaughn |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160114033149/https://www.superherohype.com/features/94533-exclusive-stardust-director-matthew-vaughn |archive-date= 2016-01-14 |url-status= dead |access-date= 2019-07-24 }}</ref> One of the difficulties with adapting the novel was its earnest and dark nature: an adult fairy tale in which sex and violence are presented unflinchingly. As a result of changes, the movie version has a greater element of whimsy and humour, with Gaiman's blessing given to the screenwriters. Gaiman did not want people to go to the theatre to see a film that attempted to be completely loyal to ''Stardust'' the book and failed.<ref>{{ cite news | date= 30 July 2007 | author= Anthony Breznican | title= Storyteller Gaiman wishes upon a star |access-date= 2007-09-27 | work= [[USA Today]] | url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-07-30-neil-gaiman_N.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080914052952/https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-07-30-neil-gaiman_N.htm |archive-date= 2008-09-14 |url-status= live }}</ref> After creating the [[audiobook]] version of the novel, Gaiman realised that there were 10\u00bd&nbsp;hours of material in the book. This led him to acknowledge that the film would have to compress the novel, leaving out portions of the work. Budgetary concerns also factored into the adaptation, even with the level of 2006 technology.<ref name=\"Brooke Tarnoff\" /> The character Captain Shakespeare was expanded extensively from the novel, and the character Ferdy the Fence was created for the film. \n\nVaughn and Goldman decided that the witches needed names (as in the book they were collectively the [[Lilim]] and their names were lost beneath the sea); their [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] decisions included names also found in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (Empusa) and ''[[Neverwhere]]'' (Lamia).<ref>{{cite web | first = Neil | last = Gaiman | title = Neil Gaiman's Journal: April 2006 | url= http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061115080729/http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html | archive-date = 15 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOn the film's differences from the novel, Gaiman commented: \"I sort of feel like my grounding in comics was actually very useful because in my head, that's just the [[Earth-Two]] version of ''Stardust''.
