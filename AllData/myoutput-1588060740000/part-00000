When Lee was approximately one year old, his father moved the family back to the United States, settling in California.<ref name=\"Tommy Lee AMG\"/>\n\nLee received his first drum sticks when he was four years old, and his first proper drum kit when he was a teenager. He dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music, starting with the L.A. club band Suite 19.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/people/tommy-lee-222294 |title=Tommy Lee Biography}}</ref> As a teenager, he listened to [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Van Halen]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[AC/DC]] and [[The Sweet|Sweet]].

He became acquainted with bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], whose bands [[Sister (band)|Sister]] and later [[London (heavy metal band)|London]] played the same circuit. Sixx was forming a theatrical band that borrowed heavily from Sister's fusion of occult imagery with a theatrical [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] performance, and became a fan of Lee's drumming. It was during this time period that Lee dropped his surname and earned the nickname \"T-bone\" due to his 6\u2032 2\u00bd\u2033 height and his lean physique. When London finally broke up in 1981, Lee and Sixx decided to form a new group together. Shortly afterward, guitarist [[Mick Mars]] joined the band. Seeking a charismatic frontman, Lee mentioned to the others a singer, [[Vince Neil]], whom he had known casually in high school; Neil soon joined the group, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was formed.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n===M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce===\n{{main|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce}}\n[[File:Crue CIMG4784.JPG|thumb|right|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce from left to right: [[Nikki Sixx]], Lee, [[Mick Mars]], and [[Vince Neil]]]]\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce quickly built a strong fanbase, and released its debut album ''[[Too Fast for Love]]'' in 1981 on its own independent label ([[Leath\u00fcr Records]]). [[Elektra Records]] decided to sign the band shortly thereafter, reissuing the debut in 1982. The band then began a string of hit releases throughout the decade\u20141983's ''[[Shout at the Devil]]'', 1985's ''[[Theatre of Pain]]'', 1987's ''[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]'', and 1989's ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]''\u2014establishing the quartet as one of the biggest [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|metal]] bands of the 1980s.\n\nLee used several memorable [[gimmicks]] during his drum solos at concerts, such as having his entire kit revolving and spinning, or having the entire kit float above the crowd while he continued to play. He was noted for [[mooning]] the crowd at nearly every show. The band was known for its decadent behavior both on and offstage, often consuming excessive amounts of drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, pills and alcohol.\n\nIn 2004, Lee reunited with the original M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce line-up to release the double-disc anthology album entitled ''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce]]'', which went quadruple-platinum and launched a monumental reunion tour to support it, ''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce ... Better Live Than Dead|The Red, White & Cr\u00fce Tour 2005: Better Live Than Dead]]'', the band's first tour in six years. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce finished the year at #8 on the Top Concert Money Earners list. It played 81 shows and grossed {{USD|33}} million according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Solo career===\n[[File:Tommy Lee at Digital Playground Party 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lee at Digital Playground Party on September 22, 2004.]]\nLee came back once with Motley Cr\u00fce to go on the ''Cr\u00fce's Greatest Hits'' tour in 1999. With the popularity of [[rap metal]], he formed a band called [[Methods of Mayhem]]. The band released a self-titled album the same year and toured in support of it. Although Lee distanced himself from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce after splitting, he agreed to take part in the band's 2001 autobiography, ''[[The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band|The Dirt]]''. In addition to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Methods of Mayhem, Lee has made guest appearances on albums by other artists, such as [[Stuart Hamm]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Rob Zombie]]. He also contributed a song, \"Planet Boom\" (originally on M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's [[Quaternary (EP)|Quaternary EP]]) to the soundtrack of then-wife [[Pamela Anderson]]'s 1996 movie, ''[[Barb Wire (film)|Barb Wire]]'', and produced an album for the pre-[[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]] project from [[John Feldmann]] and [[Simon Williams (bassist)|Simon Williams]], the [[Electric Love Hogs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K88GFEJCGc |work=YouTube |accessdate=2010-02-06 |date=March 12, 2008 |title=Electric Love Hogs in the Studio With Tommy Lee}}</ref>\nLee parted ways with [[Methods of Mayhem]] partner [[TiLo (rapper)|TiLo]] and began recording with members of [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]. He then released his first solo album. The album, 2002's ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Tommy Lee album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'', has tones of [[rap metal]] and [[electronica]]. The song \"Blue\" features guest vocalist [[Rodleen Getsic]] (the credits read: \"Rolleen\"). In August 2002, Tommy Lee and his solo band joined [[Ozzfest]], mainstage. In 2006, he formed a new band called [[Rock Star Supernova]] with [[Jason Newsted]] ([[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], ex-[[Metallica]]) and [[Gilby Clarke]] (ex-[[Guns N' Roses]]).\n\nThe 2006 [[Rock Star: Supernova|season]] of ''[[Rock Star (TV series)|Rock Star]]'' selected [[Lukas Rossi]] as the lead singer for Supernova. [[Dilana]], [[Magni \u00c1sgeirsson]], and [[Toby Rand]] with his own band [[Juke Kartel]] were the three runners up and accepted an offer to go on tour with Supernova. The self-titled debut album ''[[Rock Star Supernova (album)|Rock Star Supernova]]'' was released on November 21, 2006.\n\nLee released his autobiography, ''Tommyland'' and his second solo album, ''[[Tommyland: The Ride]]'' in 2005. The CD featured as a soundtrack to the book and includes the singles, \"Tryin to be Me\", \"[[Good Times (Tommy Lee song)|Good Times]]\" which was the theme song to his reality TV series ''[[Tommy Lee Goes to College]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=18859 |title=Tommy Lee Goes to College soundtrack |publisher= }}2011</ref> and \"Hello, Again\" which features [[Andrew McMahon]] from [[Something Corporate]] and [[Jack's Mannequin]]. Lee was also a guest DJ at [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] \"K-Rock\" in New York during the Fourth of July Monster Metal Meltdown in 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nHe also recorded drum tracks for the alternative rock band [[Jack's Mannequin]], which has released the album ''[[Everything in Transit]]''.\n\n[[File:Criss Angel and Tommy Lee.jpg|thumb|upright|Lee (right) with illusionist [[Criss Angel]] at the 2007 Scream Awards]]\nIn November 2007, it was announced by Nikki Sixx that Lee was no longer a member of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The drummer reportedly quit after the rest of the band sued his manager, [[Carl Stubner]], for forcing Tommy to take part in reality TV shows, thus forcing the cancellation of a lengthy leg of Cr\u00fce tour dates in 2006. Lee had already quit once in September 2007 before returning to the band. Vince Neil refuted the claims that Tommy Lee resigned from the band, and said that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce would be going into the studio in January to start recording its new album. In the end, Lee did end up recording the new album, ''Saints of Los Angeles'', and toured with the band in 2008 on its Cr\u00fce Fest tour.\n\nTommy Lee's current artistic endeavors include touring as an electronic dance music DJ with his Methods of Mayhem DJ/production partner, DJ Aero (birth name: Chester Deitz). As DJs, they are also known as Electro Mayhem and have clocked over 60 club dates as DJs throughout North America (with stops in the Bahamas and Central America) in 2007 alone, with more international dates planned for 2008 (including a stop in Iceland). Lee and Aero debuted as DJs on the mainstage at Ultra Music Festival during Winter Music Conference (WMC) in 2004. Lee and Aero have been DJing together since 2000, and they will again have a major presence at Miami's WMC in 2008. In 2009, Lee appeared in select cities with [[Sharam]], one half of Grammy-winning [[Deep Dish (band)|Deep Dish]], accompanying Sharam live on the piano during his house DJ sets. Lee and DJ Aero also accompanied [[deadmau5]] in his 2011 Meowington Hax tour. He played keyboards too with [[Deftones]] at a benefit show for defunct bassist Chi Cheng in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0D3Dh_XHA0|date=December 11, 2009|title=DEFTONES - Anniversary Of An Uninteresting Event - w/ Tommy Lee and Mike Shinoda}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview held backstage at the 2009 Download Festival, Lee confirmed that he is currently working on his yet-to-be-named third solo album. It is expected to be released sometime in 2010. On June 27, 2010 Tommy played drums for [[Ludacris]] at the BET Awards 2010. On March 25, 2010, he co-presented the International Dance Music Awards (IDMA) along with Roger Sanchez and [[DJ Rap]].\n\nIn 2014, Tommy Lee joined [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] to perform drums for their [[Monuments to an Elegy]] album.<ref name=SmashingPumpkins>{{cite web |last1=Grow |first1=Kory |title=Motley Crue's Tommy Lee to Drum on Smashing Pumpkins Record |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/motley-crues-tommy-lee-to-drum-on-smashing-pumpkins-record-20140508 |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> That same year Tommy Lee joined the rest of his M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce bandmates in a farewell tour. As part of the tour each member signed a legal document preventing them from ever touring under the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce moniker again.<ref name=SmashingPumpkins/>\n\n==Television career==\nIn 2004, he starred in a reality show for [[NBC]] called ''[[Tommy Lee Goes to College]]''. Lee was also one of the producers of the show. In spring 2008, Lee commenced filming another reality TV show with rapper [[Ludacris]] for [[Planet Green]] ([[Discovery Channel]]'s 24-hour eco-friendly network) titled ''[[Battleground Earth]]''.  He guest starred on Season 7, Episode 14 of ''The Goldbergs'' as Professor Lee.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Relationships===\nLee has been married four times; his first wife was Elaine Starchuk.

In 2010, Lee sent a letter to Terry Prather, the president of [[SeaWorld]], protesting the treatment of [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]] the killer whale. Lee believed the animal should be set free and claimed that SeaWorld would not comply, as Tilikum is their primary sperm donor. Lee wrote that he was appalled by SeaWorld's \"sick and twisted\" methods for obtaining Tilikum's sperm. Lee concluded that he wished to avoid further tragedies of trainers being killed, as these tragedies had resulted from the whales' aversion to captivity.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tommy Lee Explodes Over Whale Sperm | website = tmz.org | url =http://www.tmz.com/2010/12/07/tommy-lee-sea-world-killer-whale-peta-sperm-masturbation/ | accessdate = 2013-10-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Lee sent a letter to the [[Alberta]] Premier [[Alison Redford]] requesting that she end the [[Calgary Stampede]]'s chuckwagon races that have resulted in the deaths of 50 horses since 1986 (the horses were euthanized after suffering injuries).

He became acquainted with bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], whose bands [[Sister (band)|Sister]] and later [[London (heavy metal band)|London]] played the same circuit. Sixx was forming a theatrical band that borrowed heavily from Sister's fusion of occult imagery with a theatrical [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] performance, and became a fan of Lee's drumming. It was during this time period that Lee dropped his surname and earned the nickname \"T-bone\" due to his 6\u2032 2\u00bd\u2033 height and his lean physique. When London finally broke up in 1981, Lee and Sixx decided to form a new group together. Shortly afterward, guitarist [[Mick Mars]] joined the band. Seeking a charismatic frontman, Lee mentioned to the others a singer, [[Vince Neil]], whom he had known casually in high school; Neil soon joined the group, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was formed.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n===M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce===\n{{main|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce}}\n[[File:Crue CIMG4784.JPG|thumb|right|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce from left to right: [[Nikki Sixx]], Lee, [[Mick Mars]], and [[Vince Neil]]]]\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce quickly built a strong fanbase, and released its debut album ''[[Too Fast for Love]]'' in 1981 on its own independent label ([[Leath\u00fcr Records]]). [[Elektra Records]] decided to sign the band shortly thereafter, reissuing the debut in 1982. The band then began a string of hit releases throughout the decade\u20141983's ''[[Shout at the Devil]]'', 1985's ''[[Theatre of Pain]]'', 1987's ''[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]'', and 1989's ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]''\u2014establishing the quartet as one of the biggest [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|metal]] bands of the 1980s.\n\nLee used several memorable [[gimmicks]] during his drum solos at concerts, such as having his entire kit revolving and spinning, or having the entire kit float above the crowd while he continued to play. He was noted for [[mooning]] the crowd at nearly every show. The band was known for its decadent behavior both on and offstage, often consuming excessive amounts of drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, pills and alcohol.\n\nIn 2004, Lee reunited with the original M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce line-up to release the double-disc anthology album entitled ''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce]]'', which went quadruple-platinum and launched a monumental reunion tour to support it, ''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce ... Better Live Than Dead|The Red, White & Cr\u00fce Tour 2005: Better Live Than Dead]]'', the band's first tour in six years. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce finished the year at #8 on the Top Concert Money Earners list. It played 81 shows and grossed {{USD|33}} million according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Solo career===\n[[File:Tommy Lee at Digital Playground Party 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lee at Digital Playground Party on September 22, 2004.]]\nLee came back once with Motley Cr\u00fce to go on the ''Cr\u00fce's Greatest Hits'' tour in 1999. With the popularity of [[rap metal]], he formed a band called [[Methods of Mayhem]]. The band released a self-titled album the same year and toured in support of it. Although Lee distanced himself from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce after splitting, he agreed to take part in the band's 2001 autobiography, ''[[The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band|The Dirt]]''. In addition to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Methods of Mayhem, Lee has made guest appearances on albums by other artists, such as [[Stuart Hamm]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Rob Zombie]]. He also contributed a song, \"Planet Boom\" (originally on M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's [[Quaternary (EP)|Quaternary EP]]) to the soundtrack of then-wife [[Pamela Anderson]]'s 1996 movie, ''[[Barb Wire (film)|Barb Wire]]'', and produced an album for the pre-[[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]] project from [[John Feldmann]] and [[Simon Williams (bassist)|Simon Williams]], the [[Electric Love Hogs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K88GFEJCGc |work=YouTube |accessdate=2010-02-06 |date=March 12, 2008 |title=Electric Love Hogs in the Studio With Tommy Lee}}</ref>\nLee parted ways with [[Methods of Mayhem]] partner [[TiLo (rapper)|TiLo]] and began recording with members of [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]. He then released his first solo album. The album, 2002's ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Tommy Lee album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'', has tones of [[rap metal]] and [[electronica]]. The song \"Blue\" features guest vocalist [[Rodleen Getsic]] (the credits read: \"Rolleen\"). In August 2002, Tommy Lee and his solo band joined [[Ozzfest]], mainstage. In 2006, he formed a new band called [[Rock Star Supernova]] with [[Jason Newsted]] ([[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], ex-[[Metallica]]) and [[Gilby Clarke]] (ex-[[Guns N' Roses]]).\n\nThe 2006 [[Rock Star: Supernova|season]] of ''[[Rock Star (TV series)|Rock Star]]'' selected [[Lukas Rossi]] as the lead singer for Supernova. [[Dilana]], [[Magni \u00c1sgeirsson]], and [[Toby Rand]] with his own band [[Juke Kartel]] were the three runners up and accepted an offer to go on tour with Supernova. The self-titled debut album ''[[Rock Star Supernova (album)|Rock Star Supernova]]'' was released on November 21, 2006.\n\nLee released his autobiography, ''Tommyland'' and his second solo album, ''[[Tommyland: The Ride]]'' in 2005. The CD featured as a soundtrack to the book and includes the singles, \"Tryin to be Me\", \"[[Good Times (Tommy Lee song)|Good Times]]\" which was the theme song to his reality TV series ''[[Tommy Lee Goes to College]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=18859 |title=Tommy Lee Goes to College soundtrack |publisher= }}2011</ref> and \"Hello, Again\" which features [[Andrew McMahon]] from [[Something Corporate]] and [[Jack's Mannequin]]. Lee was also a guest DJ at [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] \"K-Rock\" in New York during the Fourth of July Monster Metal Meltdown in 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nHe also recorded drum tracks for the alternative rock band [[Jack's Mannequin]], which has released the album ''[[Everything in Transit]]''.\n\n[[File:Criss Angel and Tommy Lee.jpg|thumb|upright|Lee (right) with illusionist [[Criss Angel]] at the 2007 Scream Awards]]\nIn November 2007, it was announced by Nikki Sixx that Lee was no longer a member of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The drummer reportedly quit after the rest of the band sued his manager, [[Carl Stubner]], for forcing Tommy to take part in reality TV shows, thus forcing the cancellation of a lengthy leg of Cr\u00fce tour dates in 2006. Lee had already quit once in September 2007 before returning to the band. Vince Neil refuted the claims that Tommy Lee resigned from the band, and said that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce would be going into the studio in January to start recording its new album. In the end, Lee did end up recording the new album, ''Saints of Los Angeles'', and toured with the band in 2008 on its Cr\u00fce Fest tour.\n\nTommy Lee's current artistic endeavors include touring as an electronic dance music DJ with his Methods of Mayhem DJ/production partner, DJ Aero (birth name: Chester Deitz). As DJs, they are also known as Electro Mayhem and have clocked over 60 club dates as DJs throughout North America (with stops in the Bahamas and Central America) in 2007 alone, with more international dates planned for 2008 (including a stop in Iceland). Lee and Aero debuted as DJs on the mainstage at Ultra Music Festival during Winter Music Conference (WMC) in 2004. Lee and Aero have been DJing together since 2000, and they will again have a major presence at Miami's WMC in 2008. In 2009, Lee appeared in select cities with [[Sharam]], one half of Grammy-winning [[Deep Dish (band)|Deep Dish]], accompanying Sharam live on the piano during his house DJ sets. Lee and DJ Aero also accompanied [[deadmau5]] in his 2011 Meowington Hax tour.
