India grew rapidly in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of [[Public-sector undertaking|public sector enterprises]] that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] to help in setting up an All India Institute of Management Studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named ''Indian Institutes of Management''. Calcutta and [[Ahmedabad]] were chosen as the locations for the two new institutes.<ref name=\"IIMReviewCommitteeReport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author1=RC Bhargava |author2=Ajit Balakrishnan |author3=Anusua Basu |author4=Ram S Tarneja |author5=Ashok Thakur |accessdate=19 March 2010 |publisher=GOVERNMENT OF INDIA: MINISTRY OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT |date=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006173642/http://education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe institute at Calcutta was established first, on 13 November 1961,<ref name=\"Director\">{{cite news| title = Q&A: Shekhar Chaudhury, Director, IIM Calcutta| author = Swati Garg| url= http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/qa-shekhar-chaudhury-director-iim-calcutta/435269/ |newspaper=[[Business Standard]] |location=Calcutta |date=12 May 2011}}</ref> and was named ''[[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]]'' or ''IIM Calcutta''.

The first year coursework generally consists of core courses in various management disciplines, while in the second year students are allowed to select courses from an exhaustive list of electives. The PGP is a general, fully integrated management programme with no specialisation, and typically includes courses in accounting, behavioural science, finance, economics, human-resource management (HRM), management sciences and information technology, marketing, business operations, business mathematics, public policy, statistics and decision analysis, strategy, and general management.\n\nSince 2006, some IIMs have started offering one-year, full-time post graduate diploma programmes for professionals having approximately 5 years or more of work experience. This program was necessitated because the normal 2-year program is primarily aimed at new graduates or graduates with less than 4\u20135 years of work experience. These 1 years programmes are general, fully integrated management programmes with no specialization, and typically include the same courses as offered in a typical 2-year MBA program. These intensive programmes typically require 75 credits or around 750 hours of classroom teaching along with projects and other coursework as in a normal, global 2-year MBA program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/rigour-of-a-global-2-year-mba-in-one-year-113011600095_1.html|website=Business Standard|title=Rigour of a global 2-year MBA in one year|date=January 16, 2013|author=Shikhar Mohan }}</ref>\n\nDesigned as a regular MBA programme, which focuses on using the prior work experience of the students, the one-year MBA is named differently by different IIMs. It is called the Post Graduate Program for Executives at IIM Calcutta and IIM Shillong (PGPEX for short), and at IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Udaipur (PGPX for short). It is called the Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) at IIM Bangalore and IIM Indore, and the International Programme in Management for Executives (IPMX) at IIM Lucknow. The exact structure, admission criteria, and other details of these programmes vary. However, all these programmes admit only candidates with approximately 5 or more years of professional experience and usually use a combination of GMAT score, essays, and personal interviews as entry criteria, similar to other globally reputed MBA programmes. The median GMAT score of the batches at IIM Bangalore is usually around 710.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/postgraduate/epgp/admission/information |title=Admission Information |accessdate= 18 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther than these general variants, many IIMs offer specialty programmes built which focus on different areas, e.g. Post Graduate Programme in Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) at IIM Lucknow,<ref name=\"iiml.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iiml.ac.in/programme/post-graduate-programmes/pgp-sm|title=PGP-SM - IIM Lucknow|publisher=}}</ref> Post Graduate Diploma in Human Resource Management (PGDHRM) at IIM Ranchi<ref name=\"iimranchi.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iimranchi.ac.in/?page_id=1014|title=PGDHRM - IIM Ranchi|publisher=}}</ref> and many more.<!-- Adding all specialty programmes is impossible.

The program is called IPM (Integrated Programme in Management) at both the institutes. The course structures are similar though not same at both the institutes. For the first three years, they are taught a combination of \"statistics, economics and humanities\", making them unique in their way. The last two years, they undergo the program with PGP students at their respective institutes. IIM Indore first started this program in 2011 and thereby became the first IIM to have a bachelors program. Four batches of IIM Indore's IPM have been graduated and inducted in the industry. IIM Rohtak has launched this program in 2019 and the first batch is expected to graduate in 2024. IIM Indore offers Bachelor of Arts (Foundations of Management) and MBA (dual-degree) to the graduates of this program. IIM Rohtak has decided to offer Masters of Management Studies (MMS) to five-year graduates and Bachelors of Management Studies (BMS) to students who opt-out after three years.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Doctoral education ===\nIIMs offer a Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) as a full-time doctoral-level programme in management. This programme is aimed at preparing students for careers in teaching or research in different disciplines of management, as well as for careers outside academics that demand a high degree of investigative and analytical ability. A student who completes this programme at any IIM, where (s)he is registered as a doctoral scholar, is awarded the title of ''Fellow'' of that institute (e.g. ''Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta''). This Fellow Programme is equivalent to the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree. Students receiving such a fellowship every year, across all IIMs, work in close association with one another in specific research areas of their choice.\n\n=== Executive education ===\nMany IIMs offer executive education-certificate programmes targeted at working professionals. These are often short-term or part-time programmes and are known by various names such as  ''Management Development Programme'' (MDP), ''Advanced Masters Program in Management of Global Enterprises'' (AMPM), and ''Executive General Management Programme'' (EGMP). The certificate programmes at IIMs are not considered as equivalent to an MBA or EMBA. Only the diploma-level programmes are considered as equivalent, depending on whether it is full-time or part-time. Many IIMs\u2014such as IIMC, IIMB, IIMK, IIM Kashipur, and IIM Rohtak\u2014have partnered with third-party companies to enable these courses to be provided under a distributed model.\n\n=== Other programmes ===\nSome IIMs offer specialised programmes targeted at various management segments. IIM Ahmedabad offers a six-month, full-time programme called the ''Armed Forces Programme'' (AFP) aimed at military personnel. IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore offer full-time programmes in [[public management]] and are called the ''Post Graduate Programme in Public Management and Policy'' (PGP-PMP) and ''Post Graduate Programme in Public Policy Management'' (PGPPM), respectively. IIM Bangalore offers a two-year, part-time programme called the ''Post-Graduate Programme in Software Enterprise Management'' (PGPSEM),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/node/2021/|title=Distinctive Features of PGSEM - Indian Institute of Management Bangalore|publisher=}}</ref> an executive general-management education programme designed for the specific needs of professionals working in the software and information-technology industry.

Admission for residents of India to the flagship two-year PGP programmes at all IIMs is based on the [[Common Admission Test]] (CAT).

Some IIMs require candidates to make a presentation of a broad research idea or take a Research Aptitude Test (RAT) followed by round of interviews while all are compelled to accept scores on standardised tests such as the [[Common Admission Test|CAT]], [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering|GATE]], [[GMAT]], and [[GRE]]. The overall profiles of candidates, including past academic and professional accomplishments, are considered for all programmes, along with valid standard test scores. Some programmes require essays and academic or professional recommendations. The final round of admission evaluations involve an [[interview]], before which some IIMs conduct other evaluation processes like written assessment tests and group discussions.\n\n=== Entrance exam ===\nThe [[Common Admission Test]] (CAT) is a management aptitude test conducted by the IIMs primarily as an evaluation tool for admission to their two-year PGP programmes.

As per the provisions, 15% of the seats are reserved for students of [[Scheduled Castes]], and 7.5% for [[Scheduled Tribes]]. Since 2008, the [[Other Backward Classes]] have also been given 27% reservation, after the [[Supreme Court of India]] upheld the validity of relevant government regulation. The provisions are being implemented in a phased manner due to resource constraints. All aspirants have to take the [[Common Admission Test]] which consists of an objective-type exam, a group-discussion round, and personal interviews, with the cut-off for reserved-category candidates being possibly lower than for general-category candidates. Once admitted to a programme, a reserved category student has to meet all the criteria for completing the programme as a general-category student.

India grew rapidly in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of [[Public-sector undertaking|public sector enterprises]] that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] to help in setting up an All India Institute of Management Studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named ''Indian Institutes of Management''. Calcutta and [[Ahmedabad]] were chosen as the locations for the two new institutes.<ref name=\"IIMReviewCommitteeReport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author1=RC Bhargava |author2=Ajit Balakrishnan |author3=Anusua Basu |author4=Ram S Tarneja |author5=Ashok Thakur |accessdate=19 March 2010 |publisher=GOVERNMENT OF INDIA: MINISTRY OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT |date=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006173642/http://education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe institute at Calcutta was established first, on 13 November 1961,<ref name=\"Director\">{{cite news| title = Q&A: Shekhar Chaudhury, Director, IIM Calcutta| author = Swati Garg| url= http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/qa-shekhar-chaudhury-director-iim-calcutta/435269/ |newspaper=[[Business Standard]] |location=Calcutta |date=12 May 2011}}</ref> and was named ''[[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]]'' or ''IIM Calcutta''.

The committee noted that the three IIMs were producing around 400 PGP graduates every year and that they had reached their optimum capacity. It proposed the opening of two more IIMs to meet the rising demand for management professionals. It also recommended expanding the Fellowship programmes, similar to PhD programmes, to meet the growing demand for faculty in management schools in India. The fourth IIM, [[IIM Lucknow]], was established in 1984 based on the committee's recommendation.\n\nTwo more IIMs, the fifth and sixth, were established at [[IIM Kozhikode|Kozhikode]] and [[IIM Indore|Indore]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iimk.ac.in/abtiimk/bog.php |title=Board of Governors |website=iimk.ac.in |accessdate=6 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828044411/http://iimk.ac.in/abtiimk/bog.php |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimidr.ac.in/iimi/pages/institute/about-iimi.php |title=Indian Institute of Management Indore \u2013 About IIMI |website=iimidr.ac.in |accessdate=17 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915052521/http://www.iimidr.ac.in/iimi/pages/institute/about-iimi.php |archivedate=15 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[IIM Shillong]] was the seventh IIM to be established, following a 2005 decision by the Government of India;<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/25/stories/2005102506591200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Seventh IIM to be set up in Shillong | date=25 October 2005}}</ref> its foundation stone was laid on 1 December 2007;<ref>{{cite news|title=CAG rap on VIP helipad|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100322/jsp/northeast/story_12244613.jsp|accessdate=17 February 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=22 March 2010|location=Calcutta, India}}</ref> and its first academic session was 2008\u201309.<ref name=\"NIC-1\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iimshillong.in/iim-shillong/iim-campus.asp |title=IIM Shillong Campus |website=iimshillong.in |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> Since 2007, fourteen new IIMs have been set up, bringing the total number of IIMs to 20, IIM-Jammu being the latest one, starting in 2016.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe Union Cabinet, on 24 January 2017, approved the bill that became the [[Indian Institutes of Management Act, 2017]], which declares IIMs as [[List of Institutes of National Importance|Institutes of National Importance]] and enables them to grant degrees and to further make other important changes to the institute.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/01/24/cabinet-passes-iim-bill-2017-students-to-get-degrees-instead-of/|title=Cabinet Passes IIM Bill 2017, Students To Get Degrees Instead Of Diplomas|website=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202045556/http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/01/24/cabinet-passes-iim-bill-2017-students-to-get-degrees-instead-of/|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The IIM bill was passed by the [[Lok Sabha]] on 28 July 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-live-updates-monsoon-session-july-28-2017/article19376604.ece|title=IIM Bill Passed|last=|first=|date=|website=The Hindu|access-date=}}</ref> and by the [[Rajya Sabha]] on 19 December 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Final and real autonomy for IIMs is here|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/final-and-real-autonomy-for-iims-is-here/story-wA5AZDuzj2nIA6nxID3ojJ.html|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=25 December 2017|language=en}}</ref> After receiving presidential assent, the IIM bill became an Act on 31 December 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=IIMs can now award degrees instead of diplomas|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iims-can-now-award-degrees-instead-of-diplomas-new-law/articleshow/62324997.cms|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=1 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iims-can-now-award-degrees-instead-of-diplomas-new-law/articleshow/62324997.cms|title=IIMs can now award degrees instead of diplomas|date=2018|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref>\n\n== Academics ==\nThe IIMs mainly offer postgraduate, doctoral, and executive education programmes.

The first year coursework generally consists of core courses in various management disciplines, while in the second year students are allowed to select courses from an exhaustive list of electives. The PGP is a general, fully integrated management programme with no specialisation, and typically includes courses in accounting, behavioural science, finance, economics, human-resource management (HRM), management sciences and information technology, marketing, business operations, business mathematics, public policy, statistics and decision analysis, strategy, and general management.\n\nSince 2006, some IIMs have started offering one-year, full-time post graduate diploma programmes for professionals having approximately 5 years or more of work experience. This program was necessitated because the normal 2-year program is primarily aimed at new graduates or graduates with less than 4\u20135 years of work experience. These 1 years programmes are general, fully integrated management programmes with no specialization, and typically include the same courses as offered in a typical 2-year MBA program. These intensive programmes typically require 75 credits or around 750 hours of classroom teaching along with projects and other coursework as in a normal, global 2-year MBA program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/rigour-of-a-global-2-year-mba-in-one-year-113011600095_1.html|website=Business Standard|title=Rigour of a global 2-year MBA in one year|date=January 16, 2013|author=Shikhar Mohan }}</ref>\n\nDesigned as a regular MBA programme, which focuses on using the prior work experience of the students, the one-year MBA is named differently by different IIMs. It is called the Post Graduate Program for Executives at IIM Calcutta and IIM Shillong (PGPEX for short), and at IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Udaipur (PGPX for short). It is called the Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) at IIM Bangalore and IIM Indore, and the International Programme in Management for Executives (IPMX) at IIM Lucknow. The exact structure, admission criteria, and other details of these programmes vary. However, all these programmes admit only candidates with approximately 5 or more years of professional experience and usually use a combination of GMAT score, essays, and personal interviews as entry criteria, similar to other globally reputed MBA programmes. The median GMAT score of the batches at IIM Bangalore is usually around 710.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/postgraduate/epgp/admission/information |title=Admission Information |accessdate= 18 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther than these general variants, many IIMs offer specialty programmes built which focus on different areas, e.g. Post Graduate Programme in Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) at IIM Lucknow,<ref name=\"iiml.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iiml.ac.in/programme/post-graduate-programmes/pgp-sm|title=PGP-SM - IIM Lucknow|publisher=}}</ref> Post Graduate Diploma in Human Resource Management (PGDHRM) at IIM Ranchi<ref name=\"iimranchi.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iimranchi.ac.in/?page_id=1014|title=PGDHRM - IIM Ranchi|publisher=}}</ref> and many more.<!-- Adding all specialty programmes is impossible.

The program is called IPM (Integrated Programme in Management) at both the institutes. The course structures are similar though not same at both the institutes. For the first three years, they are taught a combination of \"statistics, economics and humanities\", making them unique in their way. The last two years, they undergo the program with PGP students at their respective institutes. IIM Indore first started this program in 2011 and thereby became the first IIM to have a bachelors program. Four batches of IIM Indore's IPM have been graduated and inducted in the industry. IIM Rohtak has launched this program in 2019 and the first batch is expected to graduate in 2024. IIM Indore offers Bachelor of Arts (Foundations of Management) and MBA (dual-degree) to the graduates of this program. IIM Rohtak has decided to offer Masters of Management Studies (MMS) to five-year graduates and Bachelors of Management Studies (BMS) to students who opt-out after three years.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Doctoral education ===\nIIMs offer a Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) as a full-time doctoral-level programme in management. This programme is aimed at preparing students for careers in teaching or research in different disciplines of management, as well as for careers outside academics that demand a high degree of investigative and analytical ability. A student who completes this programme at any IIM, where (s)he is registered as a doctoral scholar, is awarded the title of ''Fellow'' of that institute (e.g. ''Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta''). This Fellow Programme is equivalent to the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree. Students receiving such a fellowship every year, across all IIMs, work in close association with one another in specific research areas of their choice.\n\n=== Executive education ===\nMany IIMs offer executive education-certificate programmes targeted at working professionals. These are often short-term or part-time programmes and are known by various names such as  ''Management Development Programme'' (MDP), ''Advanced Masters Program in Management of Global Enterprises'' (AMPM), and ''Executive General Management Programme'' (EGMP). The certificate programmes at IIMs are not considered as equivalent to an MBA or EMBA. Only the diploma-level programmes are considered as equivalent, depending on whether it is full-time or part-time. Many IIMs\u2014such as IIMC, IIMB, IIMK, IIM Kashipur, and IIM Rohtak\u2014have partnered with third-party companies to enable these courses to be provided under a distributed model.\n\n=== Other programmes ===\nSome IIMs offer specialised programmes targeted at various management segments. IIM Ahmedabad offers a six-month, full-time programme called the ''Armed Forces Programme'' (AFP) aimed at military personnel. IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore offer full-time programmes in [[public management]] and are called the ''Post Graduate Programme in Public Management and Policy'' (PGP-PMP) and ''Post Graduate Programme in Public Policy Management'' (PGPPM), respectively. IIM Bangalore offers a two-year, part-time programme called the ''Post-Graduate Programme in Software Enterprise Management'' (PGPSEM),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/node/2021/|title=Distinctive Features of PGSEM - Indian Institute of Management Bangalore|publisher=}}</ref> an executive general-management education programme designed for the specific needs of professionals working in the software and information-technology industry.

Admission for residents of India to the flagship two-year PGP programmes at all IIMs is based on the [[Common Admission Test]] (CAT). CAT scores are often used as the primary short-listing criteria for admissions. International/overseas applicants have the option to apply using [[Graduate Management Admission Test|GMAT]] scores in lieu of CAT scores.<ref name=\"IIMA Website\">{{cite web|title=How to apply|url=http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgp/how-to-apply/admission-procedure.html|website=IIM Ahmedabad|accessdate=22 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106125206/http://iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgp/how-to-apply/admission-procedure.html|archivedate=6 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> GMAT scores are a prerequisite short-listing criteria used for admission to the one-year full-time programme for experienced executives.<ref name=\"IIMA PGPX Website\">{{cite web|title=Eligibility|url=http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgpx/how-to-apply/eligibility-criteria.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105141856/http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgpx/how-to-apply/eligibility-criteria.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 January 2011|website=IIM Ahmedabad|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"IIML IPMX Website\">{{cite web|title=Eligibility|url=http://www.iiml.ac.in/post_graduate_program_ipmx_eligibility.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717121219/http://www.iiml.ac.in/post_graduate_program_ipmx_eligibility.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 July 2010|website=IIM Lucknow|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> Test requirements for doctoral programmes vary. Some IIMs require candidates to make a presentation of a broad research idea or take a Research Aptitude Test (RAT) followed by round of interviews while all are compelled to accept scores on standardised tests such as the [[Common Admission Test|CAT]], [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering|GATE]], [[GMAT]], and [[GRE]]. The overall profiles of candidates, including past academic and professional accomplishments, are considered for all programmes, along with valid standard test scores. Some programmes require essays and academic or professional recommendations. The final round of admission evaluations involve an [[interview]], before which some IIMs conduct other evaluation processes like written assessment tests and group discussions.\n\n=== Entrance exam ===\nThe [[Common Admission Test]] (CAT) is a management aptitude test conducted by the IIMs primarily as an evaluation tool for admission to their two-year PGP programmes.

The seven older IIMs did not announce plans to change the admission process.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.livemint.com/2011/08/09234233/New-IIMs-set-to-break-traditio.html |title=New IIMs set to break tradition, scrap group discussion round - Home - livemint.com |first=Prashant K. |last=Nanda|location=New Delhi |website=livemint.com  |accessdate=10 August 2011|date=9 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe admissions for the two-year full-time programme is done by shortlisting based on GMAT scores in conjunction with candidate profile suitability. This is followed by evaluation of essays and a panel-interview round. The quality of prior work experience and future leadership potential is a critical factor in the selections.<ref name=\"IIMA PGPX Website2\">{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgpx/how-to-apply/faq.html#faq04|website=IIM Ahmedabad|accessdate=17 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213190527/http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgpx/how-to-apply/faq.html#faq04|archive-date=13 February 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"IIMB EPGP Website\">{{cite web|title=Admission Information|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/postgraduate/epgp/admission/information|website=IIM Bangalore|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"IIM PGPEX Website\">{{cite web|title=Eligibiliy and Selection Criteria|url=http://programslive.iimcal.ac.in/pgpex/admissions/eligibility|website=IIM Calcutta|accessdate=17 February 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Reservation policy ===\nIIMs also follow a [[Reservation in India|quota]] system, as per the provisions of the [[Indian constitution]]. As per the provisions, 15% of the seats are reserved for students of [[Scheduled Castes]], and 7.5% for [[Scheduled Tribes]]. Since 2008, the [[Other Backward Classes]] have also been given 27% reservation, after the [[Supreme Court of India]] upheld the validity of relevant government regulation. The provisions are being implemented in a phased manner due to resource constraints. All aspirants have to take the [[Common Admission Test]] which consists of an objective-type exam, a group-discussion round, and personal interviews, with the cut-off for reserved-category candidates being possibly lower than for general-category candidates. Once admitted to a programme, a reserved category student has to meet all the criteria for completing the programme as a general-category student. Regular counselling sessions, extra classes, and tutorials, by senior students, for needy students are a regular feature of the IIMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbauniverse.com/article.php?id=3613|title=IIM student & alumnus to answer queries on Live Expert Chat|publisher=mbauniverse.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923161108/http://www.mbauniverse.com/article.php?id=3613|archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IIM USA|url=http://www.iimusa.org/|website=iimusa.org|accessdate=17 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225175553/http://www.iimusa.org/|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> IIMs provide financial support to needy and deserving students in the form of scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|title=IIM Society|url=https://sites.google.com/a/iim-alumni.org/www/home|website=iim-alumni.org|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Course Fees ==\nIn 2004, IIMs charged a fee of approximately {{INRConvert|1.50|l}} per year ({{INRConvert|3|l}} for two years) for their flagship programmes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/12-per-cent-hike-in-iima-fees/article3141889.ece|title=12 per cent hike in IIM-A fees|date=2006-04-03|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/bline/2004/02/06/stories/2004020602320100.htm|title=The Hindu Business Line : Govt slashes IIM course fees to Rs 30,000|last=ndgks|website=www.thehindubusinessline.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/jul/13bspec1.htm|title=What will the fees at IIMs now be?|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/2004/01/02/stories/2004010210901200.htm|title=The Hindu : HRD Ministry to rationalise IIMs' fees|website=www.thehindu.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref> By 2016, the fee was almost {{INRConvert|19|l}}.<ref>{{cite news |last=Puranik |first=Apoorva |title=IIM Bangalore hikes fees, gets the tag of costliest IIM |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/iim-bangalore-hikes-fees-gets-the-tag-of-costliest-iim/story-EFD0SofFFz78NKKCC9vLCL.html |date=9 January 2015 |newspaper=Hindustan Times|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=IIM-C raises course fee by Rs 2.7 lakhs |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/iim-c-fee/1/634515.html |date=4 April 2016 |magazine=[[India Today]] |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=IIM-Ahmedabad Hikes Post-Graduate Course Fee By Rs.1 Lakh |url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/iim-ahmedabad-hikes-post-graduate-course-fee-by-rs-1-lakh-1290190 |date=24 March 2016 |website=[[NDTV]] |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=IIM-A raises fees by Rs 1 lakh for PGPM course |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/education/iim-a-raises-fees-by-rs-1-lakh-for-pgpm-course/ |date=23 March 2016 |newspaper=The Indian Express |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> Inflation in India<ref>{{cite web |title=Inflation, consumer prices (annual %) \u2013 India |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?locations=IN |website=The World Bank |access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Historic inflation India - CPI inflation |url=http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/india/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-india.aspx |website=inflation.eu |access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> has been cited as one of the reasons for the fee hikes at IIMs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Basu |first1=Sreeradha D |last2=Shinde |first2=Ranjit Shinde |title=Fees in top B-schools to rise by Rs 46K-3.2 lakh, depending on the institute |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-04-09/news/72186338_1_19-lakh-management-development-institute-indian-institute |date=9 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919081715/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-04-09/news/72186338_1_19-lakh-management-development-institute-indian-institute |archive-date=19 September 2016 |newspaper=[[The Economic Times]] |access-date=10 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Inflation forces IIM to hike fees  |url=http://digitallearning.eletsonline.com/2014/11/inflation-forces-iim-to-hike-fees/ |date=20 November 2014  |website=Digital Learning |access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Post-graduate program fees ====\nThe IIM post graduation program fees structure varies from {{INRConvert|9|l}}\u2014at IIM Amritsar, a more recent institute\u2014to {{INRConvert|23|l}}\u2014at IIM Ahmedabad.
