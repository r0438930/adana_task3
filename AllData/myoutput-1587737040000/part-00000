These disputes concerned estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in chief]] from the crown, but also others which he had held from [[Honour of Peverel|the Peverel family]] as [[Lord|overlords]]. They included particularly [[Whittington Castle]], held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Whittington Castle stands on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which before and during the Norman era formed the border between England and [[Wales]]. The site was fortified with a castle by [[William Peverel the Younger]] in 1138 in support of the Empress Matilda.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 35</ref>\n\nIn the late 1140s the [[Marcher lord|lordship]] of [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], as with [[Oswestry]] and Overton, ceased to be part of England and became a Welsh [[marcher lord]]ship within the [[Kingdom of Powys]].<ref>P.

However, on 11 April 1200 [[John, King of England|King John]] granted it to Maurice (son of Roger of Powis), who had offered half that sum.

He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, by his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers, but it was clearly considerable, for in the spring of 1201, when King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]] with 100 knights to counter the rebellion of Fulk and of William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref> In July 1202 Fulk and his men were reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire.

One other, Eustace de Kivilly, had been pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\n===Settlement and status===\nAfter years as an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned, together with over thirty of his followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, and their cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L.

The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)]], a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref> On 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\n===Later confrontations===\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. \n\nIn 1223 however Whittington Castle fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], Prince of Wales. Fulk regained it the following year, although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized. By 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41-42</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*First, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

These disputes concerned estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in chief]] from the crown, but also others which he had held from [[Honour of Peverel|the Peverel family]] as [[Lord|overlords]]. They included particularly [[Whittington Castle]], held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Whittington Castle stands on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which before and during the Norman era formed the border between England and [[Wales]]. The site was fortified with a castle by [[William Peverel the Younger]] in 1138 in support of the Empress Matilda.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 35</ref>\n\nIn the late 1140s the [[Marcher lord|lordship]] of [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], as with [[Oswestry]] and Overton, ceased to be part of England and became a Welsh [[marcher lord]]ship within the [[Kingdom of Powys]].<ref>P.

He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, by his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers, but it was clearly considerable, for in the spring of 1201, when King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]] with 100 knights to counter the rebellion of Fulk and of William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref> In July 1202 Fulk and his men were reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire.

In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L.

The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)]], a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref> On 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him.

Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. \n\nIn 1223 however Whittington Castle fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], Prince of Wales. Fulk regained it the following year, although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized. By 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41-42</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*First, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.
