The book follows up with heavy topics such as colorism within the south Asian community and the islamophobia he faced before and after the [[September 11 attacks]]. For more lighthearted episodes of Tan's life he describes his first trip to NYC, how he got involved in fashion, how he secretly and hilariously switched major course and how he fell in love with his husband. He also writes about \"his winding journey of coming of age, finding his voice (and style!), and how he finally came out to his family at the age of 34, revealing that he was happily married to the love of his life: a Mormon cowboy from [[Salt Lake City]].\" <ref>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40174034-naturally-tan</ref>\n\n== Further reading==\n* [https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/2018/5/09/tan-france-sold-fashion-business-and-became-tv-star-35-you-can-too Tan France sold his Fashion Business and Became a TV Star at 35, You Can Too]\n* [https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/alexa-chung-tan-france-netflix-next-in-fashion-dilemmas-style-tips-what-to-wear/353807 Alexa Chung and Tan France Offer Next In Fashion Style Tips]\n* [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-07-18/queer-eye-tan-france-naturally-tan Queer Eye\u2019s\u2019 Tan France faced racism as a kid.
