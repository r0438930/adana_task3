Part of one of the major trunk lines in the country, it passes through an industrial-mining area and handles high volumes of freight, particularly coal and iron ore.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Tatanagar\u2013Bilaspur section of Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line passes through the [[Saranda forest]] on the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] in southern [[Jharkhand]]. The area through which it passes includes portions of northern [[Odisha]] and northern [[Chhattisgarh]], with topography similar to that of the Chota Nagpur Plateau. It is generally forested area amidst hills alternating with valleys. The major rivers flowing through the area are: [[Subarnarekha River|Subarnarekha]], [[Kharkai River|Kharkai]], [[South Karo River|South Karo]], [[South Koel River|South Koel]], [[Sankh River|Sankh]], [[Brahmani River|Brahmani]], [[Ib River|Ib]], [[Mand River|Mand]] and [[Hasdeo River|Hasdeo]]. While the eastern portion of this line connects to iron ore mines spread on both sides of the Jharkhand\u2013Odisha border, the western portion caters to the [[Ib Valley Coalfield]] in Odisha and the [[Korba Coalfield]] in Chhattisgarh. There are three steel plants in the area: the [[Jamshedpur]] Works of [[Tata Steel]], [[Rourkela Steel Plant]] of [[Steel Authority of India Limited|SAIL]] and [[Jindal Steel and Power]] at [[Raigarh]]. [[Bharat Aluminium Company]] has its plant at Korba. There are several engineering units on this line, as for example [[Tata Motors]] at Jamshedpur, Tata Growth Shop and [[Tayo Rolls]] at [[Adityapur]], and [[Larsen & Toubro]] at [[Kansbahal]]. The line extends support to numerous cement plants, power plants, refractory units, ferro alloy plants and a paper mill.<ref name=bondamunda>{{cite web| url = http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,6,400,659 |title = Chakradharpur Division| publisher= South Eastern Railway| accessdate = 2012-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://bilaspur.nic.in/Glance.html |title =Bilaspur - the pride of Chhattisgarh |work= |last= |first=| publisher= Bilaspur district administration | accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://korba.gov.in/ataglancefs.htm | title = Korba - the Power Hub of Chhattisgarh | publisher = Korba district administration | accessdate = 2012-11-10 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017233743/http://korba.gov.in/ataglancefs.htm | archivedate = 17 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.orissatourism.gov.in/rourkela.html| title = Explore Orissa \u2013 the soul of India| publisher = Orissa Tourism| accessdate = 2012-11-10| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121104080743/http://www.orissatourism.gov.in/rourkela.html| archivedate = 4 November 2012| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://ordistricts.nic.in/district_home.php?did=kjr |title = The District Portal of Kendujhar| publisher=Kendujhar district administration | accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://sundergarh.nic.in/geography.html |title =Sundergarh District |work= Geography and Physical Features| publisher= Sundergarh district  administration| accessdate = 2012-11-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Kalinganagar]] is an upcoming industrial hub in [[Odisha]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-12-24/news/27604436_1_steel-units-iron-ore-orissa-mining-corporation  |title = Orissa promises New Year bailout package to steel units in Kalinga Nagar|last=Patnaik|first= Nageshwar| publisher=  The Economic Times, 24 December 2010| accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.orissalinks.com/orissagrowth/archives/4020 |title = Vision Kalinganagar : To be developed for a population of 10 lakhs by 2025| accessdate = 2012-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Howrah\u2013Allahabad\u2013Mumbai line]], a joint effort of [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] and [[East Indian Railway Company]] came up in 1870.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history2.html | title = IR History: Early Days \u2013 II | work = Chronology of railways in India, Part 2 (1870 - 1899)| publisher = | accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref> The [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]] was formed in 1887 for the purpose of upgrading the [[Nagpur Chhattisgarh Railway]] and then extending it via [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] to [[Asansol Junction|Asansol]], in order to develop a shorter Howrah-Mumbai route than the one via Allahabad.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://railwaysofraj.blogspot.in/2011/08/number-1-down-mail.html |title = Number 1 Down Mail| publisher= Railways of the Raj| accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref> The Bengal Nagpur Railway main line from Nagpur to [[Asansol Junction|Asansol]], on the [[Howrah-Delhi main line]], was opened for goods traffic on 1 February 1891.<ref name=ser>{{cite web|url=http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1|title=Major Events in the Formation of S.E.

New lines were laid and connections made to facilitate the movement of iron ore to the new steel plants - TISCO and IISCO at Tatanagar and Burnpur respectively. To tap the coal reserves in Jharia, a 115-mile-long (184 km) line connecting Midnapore with Bhojudih was set up in 1903 and extended to Gomoh in 1907. In 1922, the Talcher coalfields were linked by a rail line taking off from Nergundi on the East Coast. The Raipur-Vizianagaram link was completed in 1931, connecting the East Coast with the Central Province.

While the eastern portion of this line connects to iron ore mines spread on both sides of the Jharkhand\u2013Odisha border, the western portion caters to the [[Ib Valley Coalfield]] in Odisha and the [[Korba Coalfield]] in Chhattisgarh. There are three steel plants in the area: the [[Jamshedpur]] Works of [[Tata Steel]], [[Rourkela Steel Plant]] of [[Steel Authority of India Limited|SAIL]] and [[Jindal Steel and Power]] at [[Raigarh]]. [[Bharat Aluminium Company]] has its plant at Korba. There are several engineering units on this line, as for example [[Tata Motors]] at Jamshedpur, Tata Growth Shop and [[Tayo Rolls]] at [[Adityapur]], and [[Larsen & Toubro]] at [[Kansbahal]].

Daily, lakhs of tonnes of minerals are transported from this station to various parts of the country. Even passengers trains operate to various major destinations like Kacheguda(Hyderabad), Visakhapattanam, Bhubaneswar, Tatanagar, Rourkela. But distance between town and the station is creating issue due to improper distance, and pollution.\n\nA delegation of the railways led by top officials like SK Singh, GK Sahu took stock of the area from Banspani to Bachu Hutting on 10/05/2019.\n\n\u201cIf the railway station is shifted to Joda town, passengers will feel it easy, and it can be a major station of this region in future.\u201d they added.\n\nHead of the delegation SK Singh said that technical aspect of the proposal is being checked and a report will be submitted to the higher authorities soon.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{external media\n| align=right\n| video1= [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4WDHizGlNo  Saranda  forests and tunnel]\n}}\n\n{{Railway lines in Eastern India}}\n{{Railways in Central India}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tatanagar - Bilaspur section}}\n[[Category:5 ft 6 in gauge railways in India]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Jharkhand]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Odisha]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Chhattisgarh]]\n[[Category:Chakradharpur railway division|*]]\n[[Category:Bilaspur railway division|*]]\n[[Category:Khurda Road railway division|*]]\n[[Category:Transport in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]]\n[[Category:Transport in Jamshedpur]]\n", "name_user": "Lakun.patra", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1992-93 \u2192 1992\u201393 (2), 1961-62 \u2192 1961\u201362 (9)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatanagar%E2%80%93Bilaspur_section"}
