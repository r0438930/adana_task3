Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] wrote mixed comments about the season, saying, \"The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of ''Family Guy''.

As a result, Quagmire loses his job and is forced to live with the Griffins until he can find another place to work. Peter claims he is no longer going to be a redneck, although this fails to comfort Quagmire over his loss.

The plan backfires, however, as Quagmire does not get on the plane in time. Quagmire eventually contacts Peter, Cleveland and Joe via air traffic control and instructs Peter on landing the plane safely.  The plan succeeded and Quagmire got his job back, even though Peter took responsibility for hijacking accusations.\n |Viewers=8.59<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=030607_05|title=Weekly Program Rankings |publisher=ABC Medianet |date=2007-03-06 |access-date=2010-05-01| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528010304/http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=030607_05| archive-date= 28 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>\n |LineColor=FF9933\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|Family Guy (season 5)\n |EpisodeNumber=93\n |EpisodeNumber2=13\n |Title=[[Bill & Peter's Bogus Journey]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|3|11}}\n |DirectedBy=[[Dominic Polcino]]\n |WrittenBy=Steve Callaghan\n |ProdCode= 5ACX07\n |ShortSummary= After being attacked by an octopus at the aquarium, Peter decides to become physically fit, and spends a mere fifteen minutes at the gym, then believing that he is now fit. Later, former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] car breaks down outside their house, and Peter, thinking he is strong enough, attempts to lift the car without a jack, which results in him getting a sudden severe hernia and being hospitalized. Depressed at the concept of becoming old, he confides in Clinton, after he visits Peter in the hospital, who tells Peter that age is only a state of mind. When Peter recovers, Bill takes him out to help him realize he can still have fun, but things eventually get out of hand when they start smoking marijuana, then steal things and cause mischief while high. Meanwhile, Stewie and Brian attempt to be toilet trained by buying an instructional video hosted by [[Roy Scheider]] (appearing as himself), but Brian persists to leave his feces in the garden, thus making Lois force him to wear a diaper.\n |Viewers=8.05<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=031307_04|title=Weekly Program Rankings |publisher=ABC Medianet |date=2007-03-13 |access-date=2010-05-01| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528010314/http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=031307_04| archive-date= 28 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>\n |LineColor=FF9933\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|Family Guy (season 5)\n |EpisodeNumber=94\n |EpisodeNumber2=14\n |Title=[[No Meals on Wheels]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|3|25}}\n |DirectedBy=Greg Colton\n |WrittenBy=[[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]]\n |ProdCode= 5ACX09\n |ShortSummary=Peter is irritated by [[Mort Goldman|Mort]], the local pharmacist in Quahog, constantly borrowing his things, so he makes a \"Scare-Jew\" out of his best suit.

While wearing them, he begins to notice that he can shock people with static electricity by rubbing his feet on the carpet. Annoyed by this, Lois has the carpet completely removed.

When the priest wants to exorcise him, aided by the entire town, the Griffin family escapes to Lois' sister Carol's house in Texas. While there, the family adapts to the Texan lifestyle, and Stewie enters a beauty pageant.

Outraged, Lois decides to run against West in the upcoming mayoral election. Peter and his friends, meanwhile, become strong supporters of Lois' campaign, realizing that they could get away with anything because of their relations to Lois if she becomes mayor. As such, they do everything in their power to gain the town's support so that she can win the race. Lois is then elected, and succumbs to pressure by the toxic dump owner to allow him to resume dumping in the lake.
