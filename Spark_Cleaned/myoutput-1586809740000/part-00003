{"title_page": "Compossibility", "text_new": "'''Compossibility''' is a philosophical concept from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. According to Leibniz, a complete individual thing (for example a person) is characterized by all its properties, and these determine its relations with other individuals. The existence of one individual may contradict the existence of another. A possible world is made up of individuals that are '''compossible'''&mdash;that is, individuals that can exist together. Leibniz indicates that a world is a set of compossible things, however, that a world is a kind of collection of things that God could bring into existence.
