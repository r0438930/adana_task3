Most of its bones were in a poor condition and removed on preparation, leaving two sets of hollow impressions on the plate and counterplate. The two plates do not overlap completely. The hollows, serving as a natural mold, have since been used to produce several casts in [[gypsum]] and [[latex]] to facilitate the study of the specimen.

Prior to the 1960s, it was often assigned to some [[ornithopod]] group. In 1974 [[Teresa Marya\u0144ska]] suggested it to be a pachycephalosaur, one of the oldest known, due to the apparent exclusion of the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] from the [[Acetabulum#Perforate Acetabulum|acetabulum]], and the presence of strong caudal ribs. [[Peter Galton]] in 1982 showed that the \"pubis\" was actually part of the acetabulum, and the so-called \"caudal ribs\" were [[sacrum|sacral]] ribs. The curvature of the [[ischium]] and absence of an [[obturator foramen]] were not characteristics seen in other pachycephalosaurs. Galton concluded ''Stenopelix'' to be [[ceratopia]]n.<ref>*H.-D.
