It takes a critical stance on Eurocentric assumptions and myths about world history, in order to pursue methodological studies of the latter. Some of the critics of the movement believe that it often denies or minimizes European, [[Near East]]ern, and [[Asian culture|Asian]] cultural influences while exaggerating certain aspects of historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on the history of [[Africa]] and its role in contemporary African-American culture among others.\n\nWhat is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African-American intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the activism of African-American intellectuals in the U.S. [[civil rights movement]] and in the development of African-American Studies programs in universities. However, following the development of universities in African colonies in the 1950s, African scholars became major contributors to African historiography.<ref>General History of Africa, Vol 1, p41, UNESCO, 1981</ref> A notable pioneer is the professor [[Kenneth Dike]] of the [[University of Ibadan]], who became chairman of the Committee on African Studies at Harvard in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/obituaries/kenneth-o-dike-dies-in-a-nigerian-hospital.html|title=Kenneth O.

Afrocentrists led by Molefe Asante have organised their critics into three categories, Capitulationists, Europeanised Loyalists, and Maskers.\n\n<blockquote> \"Capitulationists condemn Afrocentricity because they are uncomfortable with themselves and do not believe that Africans should be considered agents. They include amongst black scholars Anthony Appiah and Stanley Crouch. The functioning element for these critics is self-hatred, accompanied by the belief that these African critics are really nothing but whites in black skin. Their rejection of Afrocentricity is tied to their rejection of themselves. Europeanised Loyalists include many Marxists and integrationists such as Mary Lefkowitz, [[Stanley Crouch]], and Wilson Moses (staunch critics of Afrocentricity), who believe that blacks can do no good. These critics are strangers to the Afrocentric idea because they have immersed themselves in alien canon of knowledge without knowing African history. The last type, the Maskers, are the critics who are ashamed of Afrocentricity and therefore do all they can to conceal their identities.

It takes a critical stance on Eurocentric assumptions and myths about world history, in order to pursue methodological studies of the latter. Some of the critics of the movement believe that it often denies or minimizes European, [[Near East]]ern, and [[Asian culture|Asian]] cultural influences while exaggerating certain aspects of historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on the history of [[Africa]] and its role in contemporary African-American culture among others.\n\nWhat is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African-American intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the activism of African-American intellectuals in the U.S. [[civil rights movement]] and in the development of African-American Studies programs in universities. However, following the development of universities in African colonies in the 1950s, African scholars became major contributors to African historiography.<ref>General History of Africa, Vol 1, p41, UNESCO, 1981</ref> A notable pioneer is the professor [[Kenneth Dike]] of the [[University of Ibadan]], who became chairman of the Committee on African Studies at Harvard in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/obituaries/kenneth-o-dike-dies-in-a-nigerian-hospital.html|title=Kenneth O.

They include amongst black scholars Anthony Appiah and Stanley Crouch. The functioning element for these critics is self-hatred, accompanied by the belief that these African critics are really nothing but whites in black skin. Their rejection of Afrocentricity is tied to their rejection of themselves. Europeanised Loyalists include many Marxists and integrationists such as Mary Lefkowitz, [[Stanley Crouch]], and Wilson Moses (staunch critics of Afrocentricity), who believe that blacks can do no good. These critics are strangers to the Afrocentric idea because they have immersed themselves in alien canon of knowledge without knowing African history. The last type, the Maskers, are the critics who are ashamed of Afrocentricity and therefore do all they can to conceal their identities.

She notes that he used sources that predated the deciphering of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. He failed to acknowledge that many of his theories were overturned by the evidence of later findings. She contends that ancient Egyptian texts show little similarity to Greek philosophy. Lefkowitz also pointed out that [[Aristotle]] could not have stolen his ideas from the great [[Library at Alexandria]] as James suggested, because the library was founded ''after'' Aristotle's death. Because of such fundamental errors of fact, Lefkowitz has criticized Afrocentrism as \"an excuse to teach myth as history.\"<ref name=\"Lefkowitz1996\"/>{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 1994 the Manhattan Institute, a public policy forum, published ''Alternatives to Afrocentrism'', a collection of highly critical essays by, among others, Lefkowitz, [[Gerald Early]], Stanley Crouch, Wilson Moses, and Frank Yurco.
