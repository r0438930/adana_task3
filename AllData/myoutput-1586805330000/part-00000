On April 13, 1945, on the Isenschnibbe estate near the [[North Germany|northern German]] town of [[Gardelegen]], the troops forced 1,016 slave laborers who were part of a transport evacuated from the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] Concentration Camp and from the Hannover-St\u00f6cken Concentration Camp into a large barn which was then set on fire.\n1016 prisoners, of which the largest group were Poles, were burned alive or shot trying to escape. The crime was discovered two days later by F Company, 2nd Battalion, 405th Regiment, [[U.S. 102nd Infantry Division]], when the U.S. Army occupied the area. Eleven prisoners were found alive \u2013 7 Poles, 3 Russians and 1 Frenchman. The testimonies of survivors were collected and published by Melchior Wa\u0144kowicz in 1969, in the book ''From Sto\u0142pc\u00f3w to Cairo''. Gardelegen became a part of the newly established [[German Democratic Republic]] in 1947 and is now in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Germany.\n\n==Details==\n[[File:Gardelegen Massacre, Soldiers in barn viewing bodies, Charles Overstreet.jpg|thumb|American soldiers view bodies in barn]]\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1    = Political prisoners of the Nazis who met their deaths at the hands of SS troops who set the barn afire.

The consensus account is that American [[Lieutenant]] Emerson Hunt, a liaison officer <!--(____unit____)--> between Ozark HQ and the 701st Tank Battalion, was captured by German forces on April 14, 1945, that he bluffed the German forces defending the town of Gardelegen into believing that American tanks were approaching the city, and that this induced the German commander to surrender to the American forces.  The Americans arrived at the site before the Germans had time to bury all of the bodies.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/with102dinfantry00unit/with102dinfantry00unit_djvu.txt</ref>\n\nOn April 3\u20134, following the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s crossing of the [[Rhine River]] and push into [[Germany]], the [[SS]] camp administration at [[Dora-Mittelbau]] had ordered the evacuation of prisoners from the main camp and a number of its affiliated subcamps. The goal was to transport the inmates by train or by foot to the other north German concentration camps: [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], or [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]].\n\nWithin days, some 4,000 prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora, its satellite camps, and from the Neuengamme subcamp Hannover-St\u00f6cken arrived in the Gardelegen area, where they had to deboard from the freight cars because the trains could not advance any further due to air raid damage to the rail lines. Greatly outnumbered by the prisoners, the SS guards began recruiting auxiliary forces from the local fire department, the air force, the aged [[Volkssturm|home guard]], the [[Hitler Youth]], and other organizations to watch over the inmates.\n\nOn April 13, more than a thousand prisoners, many of them sick and too weak to march any further, were taken from the town of Gardelegen to a large barn on the [[Isenschnibbe]] estate and forced inside the building. The assembled guards then barricaded the doors and set fire to gasoline-soaked straw. Prisoners who escaped the conflagration by digging under the barn's walls were killed by the guards. The next day, the SS and local auxiliaries returned to dispose of the evidence of their crime. They planned to incinerate what remained of the bodies and the barn, and kill any survivors of the blaze. The swift advance of the [[102nd Infantry Division (United States)]], however, prevented the SS and its accomplices from completely carrying out this plan.\n\nOn April 14, the 102nd entered Gardelegen and, the following day, discovered the atrocity. They found the corpses of 1,016 prisoners in the still-smoldering barn and nearby trenches, where the SS had had the charred remains dumped. They also interviewed several of the prisoners who had managed to escape the fire and the shootings. [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] photographers soon arrived to document the Nazi crime and by April 19, 1945, the story of the Gardelegen massacre began appearing in the Western press. On that day, both the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran stories on the massacre, quoting one American soldier who stated:\n<blockquote>\n\nI never was so sure before of exactly what I was fighting for. Before this you would have said those stories were [[propaganda]], but now you know they weren't. There are the bodies and all those guys are dead.\n</blockquote>\n\nEleven prisoners survived the burning of the barn and were found alive by U.S. soldiers \u2013 seven Poles, three Russians and one severely wounded Frenchman.\n\nOn April 21, 1945, the local commander of the 102nd ordered between 200 and 300 men from the town of Gardelegen to give the murdered prisoners a proper burial. Over the next few days, the German civilians exhumed 586 bodies from the trenches and recovered 430 bodies from the barn, placing each in an individual grave. On April 25, the 102nd carried out a ceremony to honor the dead and erected a memorial tablet to the victims, which stated that the townspeople of Gardelegen are charged with the responsibility that the \u201cgraves are forever kept as green as the memory of these unfortunates will be kept in the hearts of freedom-loving men everywhere.\u201d Also on April 25, Colonel George Lynch addressed German civilians at Gardelegen with the following statement:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe German people have been told that stories of German atrocities were Allied propaganda. Here, you can see for yourself. Some will say that the Nazis were responsible for this crime. Others will point to the Gestapo. The responsibility rests with neither \u2014 it is the responsibility of the German people....Your so-called Master Race has demonstrated that it is master only of crime, cruelty and sadism. You have lost the respect of the civilized world.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n==Investigation==\n[[File:Erhard Brauny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|{{ill|Erhard Brauny|de}}]]\nAn investigation was undertaken by Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward E.
