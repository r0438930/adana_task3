The state bordered the [[Gilgit Agency]] to the south and the former princely state of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]]); another old settlement is [[Ganish Village]] which means \"ancient gold\" village. Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years until the [[British Raj|British]] gained control of it and the neighboring valley of Nagar between 1889 and 1891 through military conquest.
