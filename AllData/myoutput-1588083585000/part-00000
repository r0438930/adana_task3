These can be defined as geologically brief (<200,000 year) events characterized by rapid global warming, major changes in the environment, and massive carbon addition. Of these, the PETM was the most extreme and perhaps the first (at least within the [[Cenozoic]]). Another hyperthermal clearly occurred at approximately 53.7 Ma, and is now called [[Eocene Thermal Maximum 2|ETM-2]] (also referred to as H-1, or the Elmo event). However, additional hyperthermals probably occurred at about 53.6 Ma (H-2), 53.3 (I-1), 53.2 (I-2) and 52.8 Ma (informally called K, X or ETM-3). The number, nomenclature, absolute ages, and relative global impact of the Eocene hyperthermals are the source of considerable current research. Whether they only occurred during the long-term warming, and whether they are causally related to apparently similar events in older intervals of the geological record (e.g. the [[Toarcian turnover]] of the [[Jurassic]]) are open issues.\n\nAcidification of deep waters, and the later spreading from the North Atlantic can explain spatial variations in carbonate dissolution.

Oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca of carbonate shells precipitated in surface waters of the ocean are commonly used measurements for reconstructing past temperature; however, both paleotemperature proxies can be compromised at low latitude locations, because re-crystallization of carbonate on the seafloor renders lower values than when formed. On the other hand, these and other temperature proxies (e.g., TEX<sub>86</sub>) are impacted at high latitudes because of seasonality; that is, the \u201ctemperature recorder\u201d is biased toward summer, and therefore higher values, when the production of carbonate and organic carbon occurred.\n\nCertainly, the central Arctic Ocean was ice-free before, during, and after the PETM.

The iconic sediment interval for examining and dating the PETM is a core recovered in 1987 by the [[Ocean Drilling Program]] at Hole 690B at [[Maud Rise]] in the South Atlantic Ocean.

Increased weathering from the enhanced runoff formed thick paleosoil enriched with [[Concretion|carbonate nodules]] ([[Microcodium]] like), and this suggests a [[semi-arid climate]].<ref name=Adatte2014 />\n\n==Possible causes==\nDiscriminating between different possible causes of the PETM is difficult. Temperatures were rising globally at a steady pace, and a mechanism must be invoked to produce an instantaneous spike which may have been accentuated by positive feedbacks. The biggest aid in disentangling these factors comes from a consideration of the carbon isotope mass balance. We know the entire [[wikt:exogenic|exogenic]] [[carbon cycle]] (i.e. the carbon contained within the oceans and atmosphere, which can change on short timescales) underwent a \u22120.2&nbsp;% to \u22120.3&nbsp;% perturbation in {{delta|13|C|}}, and by considering the isotopic signatures of other carbon reserves, can consider what mass of the reserve would be necessary to produce this effect.

To put this in perspective, this is about 200 times the background rate of degassing for the rest of the Paleocene. There is no indication that such a burst of volcanic activity has occurred at any point in Earth's history. However, substantial volcanism had been active in East Greenland for around the preceding million years or so, but this struggles to explain the rapidity of the PETM. Even if the bulk of the 1,500 gigatons of carbon was released in a single pulse, further feedbacks would be necessary to produce the observed isotopic excursion.\n\nOn the other hand, there are suggestions that surges of activity occurred in the later stages of the volcanism and associated continental rifting. Intrusions of hot magma into carbon-rich sediments may have triggered the degassing of isotopically light methane in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and the observed isotope anomaly. This hypothesis is documented by the presence of extensive intrusive sill complexes and thousands of kilometer-sized hydrothermal vent complexes in sedimentary basins on the mid-Norwegian margin and west of Shetland.<ref name=Svensen2004>{{cite journal\n | author = Svensen, H.\n |author2=Planke, S. |author3=Malthe-S\u00f8renssen, A. |author4=Jamtveit, B. |author5=Myklebust, R. |author6=Eidem, T. |author7=Rey, S.

The most obvious feedback mechanism that could amplify the initial perturbation is that of [[methane clathrate]]s. Under certain temperature and pressure conditions, methane \u2013 which is being produced continually by decomposing microbes in sea bottom sediments \u2013 is stable in a complex with water, which forms ice-like cages trapping the methane in solid form. As temperature rises, the pressure required to keep this clathrate configuration stable increases, so shallow clathrates dissociate, releasing methane gas to make its way into the atmosphere. Since biogenic clathrates have a {{delta|13|C|}} signature of \u221260&nbsp;\u2030 (inorganic clathrates are the still rather large \u221240&nbsp;\u2030), relatively small masses can produce large {{delta|13|C|}} excursions. Further, methane is a potent [[greenhouse gas]] as it is released into the atmosphere, so it causes warming, and as the ocean transports this warmth to the bottom sediments, it destabilizes more clathrates. It would take around 2,300 years for an increased temperature to diffuse warmth into the sea bed to a depth sufficient to cause a release of clathrates, although the exact time-frame is highly dependent on a number of poorly constrained assumptions.<ref name=Katz2001>{{cite journal\n |author      = Katz, M.E.\n |author2     = Cramer, B.S.\n |author3     = Mountain, G.S.\n |author4     = Katz, S.\n |author5     = Miller, K.G.\n |year        = 2001\n |title       = Uncorking the bottle: What triggered the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum methane release\n |journal     = Paleoceanography\n |volume      = 16\n |issue       = 6\n |pages       = 667\n |url         = http://geology.rutgers.edu/pdf/Katz.etal.2001.pdf\n |access-date  = 2008-02-28\n |doi         = 10.1029/2000PA000615\n |bibcode     = 2001PalOc..16..549K\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513053145/http://geology.rutgers.edu/pdf/Katz.etal.2001.pdf\n |archive-date = 2008-05-13\n |df          = \n|citeseerx     = 10.1.1.173.2201\n }}</ref> Ocean warming due to flooding and pressure changes due to a sea-level drop may have caused clathrates to become unstable and release methane.

The {{delta|18|O|}} of benthic or planktonic forams does not show any pre-warming in any of these localities, and in an ice-free world, it is generally a much more reliable indicator of past ocean temperatures.\n\nAnalysis of these records reveals another interesting fact: planktonic (floating) forams record the shift to lighter isotope values earlier than benthic (bottom dwelling) forams. The lighter (lower {{delta|13|C|}}) methanogenic carbon can only be incorporated into the forams' shells after it has been oxidised. A gradual release of the gas would allow it to be oxidised in the deep ocean, which would make benthic forams show lighter values earlier. The fact that the planktonic forams are the first to show the signal suggests that the methane was released so rapidly that its oxidation used up all the oxygen at depth in the water column, allowing some methane to reach the atmosphere unoxidised, where atmospheric oxygen would react with it. This observation also allows us to constrain the duration of methane release to under around 10,000 years.<ref name=Thomas2002/>\n\nHowever, there are several major problems with the methane hydrate dissociation hypothesis. The most parsimonious interpretation for surface-water forams to show the {{delta|13|C|}} excursion before their benthic counterparts (as in the Thomas et al. paper) is that the perturbation occurred from the top down, and not the bottom up.  If the anomalous {{delta|13|C|}} (in whatever form: CH<sub>4</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>) entered the atmospheric carbon reservoir first, and then diffused into the surface ocean waters, which mix with the deeper ocean waters over much longer time-scales, we would expect to observe the planktonics shifting toward lighter values before the benthics.  Moreover, careful examination of the Thomas et al. data set shows that there is not a single intermediate planktonic foram value, implying that the perturbation and attendant {{delta|13|C|}} anomaly happened over the lifespan of a single foram \u2013 much too fast for the nominal 10,000-year release needed for the methane hypothesis to work.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThere is a debate about whether there was a large enough amount of methane hydrate to be a major carbon source; a recent paper proposed that was the case.<ref name=Gu2011>{{cite journal\n | author = Gu, Guangsheng\n |author2=Dickens, G.R. |author3=Bhatnagar, G. |author4=Colwell, F.S. |author5=Hirasaki, G.J. |author6= Chapman, W.G. \n | year = 2011\n | title = Abundant Early Palaeogene marine gas hydrates despite warm deep-ocean temperatures\n | journal = Nature Geoscience\n | volume =4\n | issue =12\n | pages =848\u2013851\n | doi = 10.1038/ngeo1301\n| bibcode= 2011NatGe...4..848G}}</ref> The present-day global methane hydrate reserve is poorly constrained, but is mostly considered to be between 2,000 and 10,000 Gt.

These can be defined as geologically brief (<200,000 year) events characterized by rapid global warming, major changes in the environment, and massive carbon addition. Of these, the PETM was the most extreme and perhaps the first (at least within the [[Cenozoic]]). Another hyperthermal clearly occurred at approximately 53.7 Ma, and is now called [[Eocene Thermal Maximum 2|ETM-2]] (also referred to as H-1, or the Elmo event). However, additional hyperthermals probably occurred at about 53.6 Ma (H-2), 53.3 (I-1), 53.2 (I-2) and 52.8 Ma (informally called K, X or ETM-3). The number, nomenclature, absolute ages, and relative global impact of the Eocene hyperthermals are the source of considerable current research. Whether they only occurred during the long-term warming, and whether they are causally related to apparently similar events in older intervals of the geological record (e.g. the [[Toarcian turnover]] of the [[Jurassic]]) are open issues.\n\nAcidification of deep waters, and the later spreading from the North Atlantic can explain spatial variations in carbonate dissolution.

Oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca of carbonate shells precipitated in surface waters of the ocean are commonly used measurements for reconstructing past temperature; however, both paleotemperature proxies can be compromised at low latitude locations, because re-crystallization of carbonate on the seafloor renders lower values than when formed. On the other hand, these and other temperature proxies (e.g., TEX<sub>86</sub>) are impacted at high latitudes because of seasonality; that is, the \u201ctemperature recorder\u201d is biased toward summer, and therefore higher values, when the production of carbonate and organic carbon occurred.\n\nCertainly, the central Arctic Ocean was ice-free before, during, and after the PETM. This can be ascertained from the composition of sediment cores recovered during the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) at 87\u00b0N on [[Lomonosov Ridge]].<ref name=Moran2006>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Moran | first1 = K.\n | last2 = Backman | first2 = J.\n | last3 = Pagani | first3 = others\n | title = The Cenozoic palaeoenvironment of the Arctic Ocean\n | year = 2006 | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7093\n |pages = 601\u2013605 | doi=10.1038/nature04800| pmid = 16738653\n | bibcode = 2006Natur.441..601M| hdl = 11250/174276\n | hdl-access = free}}</ref> Moreover, temperatures increased during the PETM, as indicated by the brief presence of subtropical dinoflagellates,<ref>the [[dinoflagellate]]s ''Apectodinium spp.''</ref> and a marked increase in TEX<sub>86</sub>.<ref name=Sluijs2006>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Sluijs | first1 = A.\n | last2 = Schouten | first2 = S.\n | last3 = Pagani | first3 = M.\n | last4 = Woltering | first4 = M. |author5=Brinkhuis, H. |author6=Damst\u00e9, J.S.S. |author7=Dickens, G.R. |author8=Huber, M. |author9=Reichart, G.J. |author10=Stein, R. \n | title = Subtropical Arctic Ocean temperatures during the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum\n | year = 2006 | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7093 | pages = 610\u2013613\n | doi = 10.1038/nature04668 | pmid = 16752441|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..610S |display-authors=etal| hdl = 11250/174280\n | url = https://brage.npolar.no/npolar-xmlui/bitstream/11250/174280/1/SluijsNature2006.pdf }}</ref> The latter record is intriguing, though, because it suggests a 6&nbsp;\u00b0C (11&nbsp;\u00b0F) rise from ~{{Convert|17|C|F|0}} before the PETM to ~{{Convert|23|C|F|0}} during the PETM.

First, a prominent negative excursion in the carbon isotope composition ({{delta|13|C|}}) of carbon-bearing phases characterizes the PETM in numerous (>130) widespread locations from a range of environments.<ref name=McInerney2011/> Second, carbonate dissolution marks the PETM in sections from the deep sea.\n\nThe total mass of carbon injected to the ocean and atmosphere during the PETM remains the source of debate.

This is because the total duration of the CIE, from the rapid drop in {{delta|13|C|}} through the near recovery to initial conditions, relates to key parameters of our global carbon cycle, and because the onset provides insight to the source of [[Carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C]]-depleted CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe total duration of the CIE can be estimated in several ways. The iconic sediment interval for examining and dating the PETM is a core recovered in 1987 by the [[Ocean Drilling Program]] at Hole 690B at [[Maud Rise]] in the South Atlantic Ocean. At this location, the PETM CIE, from start to end, spans about 2 m.<ref name=Kennett1991/> Long-term age constraints, through biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy, suggest an average Paleogene sedimentation rate of about 1.23&nbsp;cm/1,000yrs. Assuming a constant sedimentation rate, the entire event, from onset though termination, was therefore estimated at about 200,000 years.<ref name=Kennett1991/> Subsequently, it was noted that the CIE spanned 10 or 11 subtle cycles in various sediment properties, such as Fe content. Assuming these cycles represent precession, a similar but slightly longer age was calculated by Rohl et al. 2000.<ref name=Rohl2000>{{cite journal\n | author = R\u00f6hl, U. |author2=Bralower, T.J. |author3=Norris, R.D. |author4= Wefer, G.\n | title = New chronology for the late Paleocene thermal maximum and its environmental implications\n | year = 2000 | journal = Geology | volume = 28 | issue = 10 | pages = 927\u2013930\n | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(2000)28<927:NCFTLP>2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2000Geo....28..927R}}</ref> A ~200,000 duration for the CIE is estimated from models of global carbon cycling.<ref name=Dickens2000>{{cite journal\n | author = Dickens, G.R.\n | title = Methane oxidation during the late Palaeocene thermal maximum\n | year = 2000 | journal = Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9ologique de France | volume = 171 | pages = 37\u201349}}</ref>\nIf a massive amount of <sup>13</sup>C-depleted CO<sub>2</sub> is rapidly injected into the modern ocean or atmosphere and projected into the future, a ~200,000 year CIE results because of slow flushing through quasi steady-state inputs (weathering and volcanism) and outputs (carbonate and organic) of carbon.\n\nThe above approach can be performed at many sections containing the PETM.

Increased weathering from the enhanced runoff formed thick paleosoil enriched with [[Concretion|carbonate nodules]] ([[Microcodium]] like), and this suggests a [[semi-arid climate]].<ref name=Adatte2014 />\n\n==Possible causes==\nDiscriminating between different possible causes of the PETM is difficult. Temperatures were rising globally at a steady pace, and a mechanism must be invoked to produce an instantaneous spike which may have been accentuated by positive feedbacks. The biggest aid in disentangling these factors comes from a consideration of the carbon isotope mass balance. We know the entire [[wikt:exogenic|exogenic]] [[carbon cycle]] (i.e. the carbon contained within the oceans and atmosphere, which can change on short timescales) underwent a \u22120.2&nbsp;% to \u22120.3&nbsp;% perturbation in {{delta|13|C|}}, and by considering the isotopic signatures of other carbon reserves, can consider what mass of the reserve would be necessary to produce this effect. The assumption underpinning this approach is that the mass of exogenic carbon was the same in the [[Paleogene]] as it is today \u2013 something which is very difficult to confirm.\n\n===Eruption of large kimberlite field===\nAlthough the cause of the initial warming has been attributed to a massive injection of carbon (CO<sub>2</sub> and/or CH<sub>4</sub>) into the atmosphere, the source of the carbon has yet to be found. The emplacement of a large cluster of [[kimberlite]] pipes at ~56 Ma in the [[Lac de Gras]] region of northern Canada may have provided the carbon that triggered early warming in the form of exsolved magmatic CO<sub>2</sub>.

To put this in perspective, this is about 200 times the background rate of degassing for the rest of the Paleocene. There is no indication that such a burst of volcanic activity has occurred at any point in Earth's history. However, substantial volcanism had been active in East Greenland for around the preceding million years or so, but this struggles to explain the rapidity of the PETM. Even if the bulk of the 1,500 gigatons of carbon was released in a single pulse, further feedbacks would be necessary to produce the observed isotopic excursion.\n\nOn the other hand, there are suggestions that surges of activity occurred in the later stages of the volcanism and associated continental rifting. Intrusions of hot magma into carbon-rich sediments may have triggered the degassing of isotopically light methane in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and the observed isotope anomaly. This hypothesis is documented by the presence of extensive intrusive sill complexes and thousands of kilometer-sized hydrothermal vent complexes in sedimentary basins on the mid-Norwegian margin and west of Shetland.<ref name=Svensen2004>{{cite journal\n | author = Svensen, H.\n |author2=Planke, S. |author3=Malthe-S\u00f8renssen, A. |author4=Jamtveit, B. |author5=Myklebust, R. |author6=Eidem, T. |author7=Rey, S.

The most obvious feedback mechanism that could amplify the initial perturbation is that of [[methane clathrate]]s. Under certain temperature and pressure conditions, methane \u2013 which is being produced continually by decomposing microbes in sea bottom sediments \u2013 is stable in a complex with water, which forms ice-like cages trapping the methane in solid form. As temperature rises, the pressure required to keep this clathrate configuration stable increases, so shallow clathrates dissociate, releasing methane gas to make its way into the atmosphere. Since biogenic clathrates have a {{delta|13|C|}} signature of \u221260&nbsp;\u2030 (inorganic clathrates are the still rather large \u221240&nbsp;\u2030), relatively small masses can produce large {{delta|13|C|}} excursions. Further, methane is a potent [[greenhouse gas]] as it is released into the atmosphere, so it causes warming, and as the ocean transports this warmth to the bottom sediments, it destabilizes more clathrates. It would take around 2,300 years for an increased temperature to diffuse warmth into the sea bed to a depth sufficient to cause a release of clathrates, although the exact time-frame is highly dependent on a number of poorly constrained assumptions.<ref name=Katz2001>{{cite journal\n |author      = Katz, M.E.\n |author2     = Cramer, B.S.\n |author3     = Mountain, G.S.\n |author4     = Katz, S.\n |author5     = Miller, K.G.\n |year        = 2001\n |title       = Uncorking the bottle: What triggered the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum methane release\n |journal     = Paleoceanography\n |volume      = 16\n |issue       = 6\n |pages       = 667\n |url         = http://geology.rutgers.edu/pdf/Katz.etal.2001.pdf\n |access-date  = 2008-02-28\n |doi         = 10.1029/2000PA000615\n |bibcode     = 2001PalOc..16..549K\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513053145/http://geology.rutgers.edu/pdf/Katz.etal.2001.pdf\n |archive-date = 2008-05-13\n |df          = \n|citeseerx     = 10.1.1.173.2201\n }}</ref> Ocean warming due to flooding and pressure changes due to a sea-level drop may have caused clathrates to become unstable and release methane.

The {{delta|18|O|}} of benthic or planktonic forams does not show any pre-warming in any of these localities, and in an ice-free world, it is generally a much more reliable indicator of past ocean temperatures.\n\nAnalysis of these records reveals another interesting fact: planktonic (floating) forams record the shift to lighter isotope values earlier than benthic (bottom dwelling) forams. The lighter (lower {{delta|13|C|}}) methanogenic carbon can only be incorporated into the forams' shells after it has been oxidised. A gradual release of the gas would allow it to be oxidised in the deep ocean, which would make benthic forams show lighter values earlier. The fact that the planktonic forams are the first to show the signal suggests that the methane was released so rapidly that its oxidation used up all the oxygen at depth in the water column, allowing some methane to reach the atmosphere unoxidised, where atmospheric oxygen would react with it. This observation also allows us to constrain the duration of methane release to under around 10,000 years.<ref name=Thomas2002/>\n\nHowever, there are several major problems with the methane hydrate dissociation hypothesis. The most parsimonious interpretation for surface-water forams to show the {{delta|13|C|}} excursion before their benthic counterparts (as in the Thomas et al. paper) is that the perturbation occurred from the top down, and not the bottom up.  If the anomalous {{delta|13|C|}} (in whatever form: CH<sub>4</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>) entered the atmospheric carbon reservoir first, and then diffused into the surface ocean waters, which mix with the deeper ocean waters over much longer time-scales, we would expect to observe the planktonics shifting toward lighter values before the benthics.  Moreover, careful examination of the Thomas et al. data set shows that there is not a single intermediate planktonic foram value, implying that the perturbation and attendant {{delta|13|C|}} anomaly happened over the lifespan of a single foram \u2013 much too fast for the nominal 10,000-year release needed for the methane hypothesis to work.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThere is a debate about whether there was a large enough amount of methane hydrate to be a major carbon source; a recent paper proposed that was the case.<ref name=Gu2011>{{cite journal\n | author = Gu, Guangsheng\n |author2=Dickens, G.R. |author3=Bhatnagar, G. |author4=Colwell, F.S. |author5=Hirasaki, G.J. |author6= Chapman, W.G. \n | year = 2011\n | title = Abundant Early Palaeogene marine gas hydrates despite warm deep-ocean temperatures\n | journal = Nature Geoscience\n | volume =4\n | issue =12\n | pages =848\u2013851\n | doi = 10.1038/ngeo1301\n| bibcode= 2011NatGe...4..848G}}</ref> The present-day global methane hydrate reserve is poorly constrained, but is mostly considered to be between 2,000 and 10,000 Gt.

Our understanding of these patterns is still in a preliminary stage. Models show that there are possible mechanisms to quickly transport heat to the shallow, clathrate-containing ocean shelves, given the right bathymetric profile, but the models cannot yet match the distribution of data we observe.  \"Warming accompanying a south-to-north switch in deepwater formation would produce sufficient warming to destabilize seafloor gas hydrates over most of the world ocean to a water depth of at least 1900 m.\"<ref name=Bice2002 /> This destabilization could have resulted in the release of more than 2000 gigatons of methane gas from the clathrate zone of the ocean floor.<ref name=Bice2002>{{cite journal\n |author       = Bice, K.L.\n |author2      = Marotzke, J.\n |year         = 2002\n |title        = Could changing ocean circulation have destabilized methane hydrate at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary\n |journal      = Paleoceanography\n |volume       = 17\n |issue        = 2\n |pages        = 1018\n |doi          = 10.1029/2001PA000678\n |bibcode      = 2002PalOc..17b...8B\n |df           = \n |url          = https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/231/1/BICE_%2526_MAROTZKE_paper_paleoce_figures.pdf\n |access-date  = 2019-09-01\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120419090536/http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/231/1/BICE_%26_MAROTZKE_paper_paleoce_figures.pdf\n |archive-date = 2012-04-19\n |url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\nArctic freshwater input into the North Pacific could serve as a catalyst for methane hydrate destabilization, an event suggested as a precursor to the onset of the PETM.<ref name=\"Cope, Jesse Tiner\">{{cite journal\n | author = Cope, Jesse Tiner\n | year = 2009\n | title = On The Sensitivity Of Ocean Circulation To Arctic Freshwater Pulses During The Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum\n | url = http://dspace.uta.edu/handle/10106/2004\n | format = PDF\n | accessdate = 2013-08-07\n | journal = \n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100725030324/http://dspace.uta.edu/handle/10106/2004\n | archive-date = 2010-07-25\n | url-status = live\n }}</ref>\n\n==Recovery==\n[[Proxy (climate)|Climate proxies]], such as ocean sediments (depositional rates) indicate a duration of \u223c83 ka, with \u223c33 ka\nin the early rapid phase and \u223c50 ka in a subsequent gradual phase.<ref name=McInerney2011/>\n\nThe most likely method of recovery involves an increase in biological productivity, transporting carbon to the deep ocean.
