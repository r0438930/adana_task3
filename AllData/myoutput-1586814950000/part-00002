He released two studio albums in three years and was also acting in television series ''Yalanc\u0131 Yarim'' (My Lying Lover) which aired on [[Star TV (Turkey)|Star TV]].\n\nOn 29 June 2007, he was seriously injured in a car accident on his way back from a charity concert for children. After spending five days in an intensive care unit, he died of complications from the accident on 4 July 2007, at the age of 28.\n\n== Early life ==\nAkarsu was born and raised in [[Bart\u0131n]], in northern [[Turkey]]. He was a huge fan of rock music, listening to music from [[Ruhi Su]], [[Cem Karaca]] and [[Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o]] as well as Western acts like [[Led Zeppelin]] or [[U2]].\n\nHis friends and Akarsu gathered at the seaside of Amasra to chat and sing songs while playing guitar. There, Akarsu formed his early ties with singing and playing instruments. Music always played a crucial part in his life. His other big ambition was [[tae kwon do]], basketball and sailing (in high-school he was sailing professionally in Amasra Sailing Club).<ref>[http://www.haber7.com/haber.php?haber_id=253775 Haber7.com July 5, 2007]</ref>\n\n== Musical career ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Baris Akarsu.jpg|thumb|right|Bar\u0131\u015f Akarsu in 2006]] -->\nBefore rising to fame with his musical and screen projects, Akarsu worked as an entertainer in beach resorts in [[Antalya]]. Later he moved to [[Karadeniz Ere\u011fli]], where he started singing regularly at bars, the local television and radio shows before joining the TV show ''Academy Turkey''. Shortly after winning the show, he moved to [[Istanbul]] to pursue a career in music.\n\nBar\u0131\u015f Akarsu released his first album ''[[Islak Islak]]'', followed by his second ''[[D\u00fc\u015fmeden Bulutlarda Ko\u015fmam Gerek]]'' released in August 2006. He appeared on music videos for his songs \u201cIslak Islak\u201d, \u201cKimdir O\u201d, \u201cMavi\u201d and \u201cAmasra\u201d from his first and \u201cVurdum En Dibe Kadar\u201d and \u201cYaz Demedim\u201d from his second album.

Their car collided with a truck at an intersection with no traffic lights. The driver of the car, Zeynep Ko\u00e7ak, and passenger Nalan Kahraman died on the day of the accident.

On July 4, 2007, Akarsu died due to complications arising from the accident.\n\nThe location of the accident is a crossroads at the end of a long and straight downhill grade.
