The series' success has led to [[comic book]]s, [[novelization]]s, an [[anime]] series, guides, collectibles and a variety of [[action figure]]s. Its first game focuses on devil hunter [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]]'s mission to avenge the death of his mother, Eva, by exterminating demons. In the process he encounters his long-lost twin brother, [[Vergil (Devil May Cry)|Vergil]], with whom he has a dysfunctional relationship. As the story progresses, Dante encounter his father's nemesis, a demon emperor, [[#Mundus|Mundus]], who is found to be responsible for the murder of Dante's mother.\n\nYears after the first game, Capcom developed new ''Devil May Cry'' games with new characters. In ''Devil May Cry 2'', an older Dante aids a woman named [[#Lucia|Lucia]] in freeing a town from the demons. In ''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;3: Dante's Awakening]]'', a young Dante awakens his demonic powers when confronting his brother and matures upon seeing [[Lady (Devil May Cry)|Lady]], a woman struggling to redeem her family. ''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;4]]'' and ''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;5]]'' focus on a young demon hunter named [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]] who is connected to Dante in terms of heritage as well as [[#V|V]], a young man from ''5'' who wishes somebody would defeat the demon king [[#Urizen|Urizen]]. [[Ninja Theory]] also created a reboot titled ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'' that follows an alternative version of Demon as he learns of his heritage while confronting demons controlling Limbo.\n\nNero and several characters in ''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;2]]'' and the later games were conceived by several staff members, most notably [[Bingo Morihashi]] with designers Daigo Ikeno and Tatsuya Yoshikawa, taking over. While each game changes the cast's designs, the RE Engine was used for ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'' to give them a more realistic look. Dante's characterization and role in the games was well received by game journalists with the recurring cast being praised since ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'' because of the handling of the narrative.\n\n=={{anchor|Character conception and influence}}Conception and influences==\nSeries creator Hideki Kamiya said that the title character from the [[manga]] series ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]'', by [[Buichi Terasawa]], was the basis for Dante.<ref name=DMCgraphic>{{Cite web|url=http://www.survivhor.com/morbidcreations/dmc_behind/int_hideki/dmc_int_hideki_3.htm |title=Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya Interview: Translated from ''Devil May Cry: Graphic Edition'' |accessdate=March 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928065052/http://www.survivhor.com/morbidcreations/dmc_behind/int_hideki/dmc_int_hideki_3.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref name=cvg.com>{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=17957 |title=PS2 News: CVG goes straight to hell with Devil May Cry director - ComputerAndVideoGames.com |accessdate=March 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113012026/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=17957 |archivedate=January 13, 2007}}</ref> Dante wears a red cloak to make the character's actions more eye-catching; red is the traditional Japanese color for a hero.

Morihashi was once again employed, but this time took on a bigger role during the game's development. As he had no experience planning, he was given the role of writing the scenario. The game's main character, Dante, was given a different characterization than in the first ''Devil May Cry'' because his original creator, [[Hideki Kamiya]], was not going to be involved with the project. While feeling his own take on the character did not equal the popularity of the original one, [[Bingo Morihashi]] enjoyed Dante's role in the game. Morihashi felt challenged creating the character of Vergil since he had no prior design experience yet he had to come up with an entire new one for the artists.<ref name=\"mori\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=11\u201312}}</ref> Dante and Vergi's Devil Trigger forms were designed by [[Kazuma Kaneko]] of [[Atlus]].<ref name=\"IGNKanekoDesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3134856&did=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041106214235/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3134856&did=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2004|title=Devil May Cry 3 PS2 Preview, Devil May Cry 3 PlayStation 2 Preview|publisher=[[1Up.com]]|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"GameSpotKanekoDesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6107931.html |title=Atlus designer Kazuma Kaneko working on Devil May Cry 3 \u2013 News at GameSpot |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929223856/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6107931.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> The Capcom staff was impressed with Kaneko's work, and Daigo Ikeno felt that it was not difficult to model.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|page=205}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Capcom DMC Concept Art 011.jpg|thumb|alt=White-haired man in red, standing in a carpeted hallway|Early concept art for ''Devil May Cry'', showing Dante with a submachine gun]]\n''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;4]]'' producer [[Hiroyuki Kobayashi (producer)|Hiroyuki Kobayashi]] said before the game's release that he wanted to make Dante appear more powerful than the other protagonist, Nero, to contrast the strength of a \"veteran\" with that of a \"rookie\".

Urizen is voiced by Daniel Southworth in the English version and [[Shunsuke Sakuya]] in the Japanese version. Urizen was meant to remind players of the original Demon King from the 2001 ''Devil May Cry'' game. Itsuno said, \"Urizen is definitely the strongest enemy of the entire ''Devil May Cry'' saga&nbsp;... the most powerful.

In Dante's storyline in the PlayStation&nbsp;2 version of ''Viewtiful Joe'', he possesses [[List of Viewtiful Joe characters#Captain Blue|Captain Blue]] to take revenge on Dante and Trish. Mundus also appears in the second ''Devil May Cry'' novel in a parallel universe, where he is confronted by Dante and Nelo Angelo's forces. An alternate version of Mundus appears as the main antagonist of ''DmC: Devil May Cry''.\n\n===Arius===\nArius, the primary antagonist in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2'', is an insane, wealthy businessman who owns an international company, Uroboros.<ref name=\"Matier\">'''Matier:'''Oh yes. ..

Near the end of the game, in Lucia's scenario, Arius survives his battle with Dante. Infused with the power of Argosax, he attacks Lucia (first as a demonic version of himself). As he begins to lose, he mutates into a giant creature.\n\n===Argosax the Chaos===\nArgosax the Chaos was a cruel demonic deity who once rivaled Mundus and was the final antagonist of ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2''.

Instead, as Dante had switched the Medaglia coin with his own, the ritual was incomplete and caused Arius to become possessed upon dying.\n\nDespite its faulty execution, the ritual was sufficient enough to create a portal to the devil's prison\u2014enough to enable Argosax to escape if given time. Seeking to put an end to this scheme, Dante elects to enter the gateway and face the demon deity like his father before him. When he first appears, his native form\u2014the Despair Embodied, a fiery horned hermaphrodite with angelic wings\u2014is gestating inside of a chrysalis composed of the reanimated corpses of assorted bosses from games ''1'' and ''2''. He's capable of channeling their power while in this form.\n\nEmerging from the destroyed mass after a lengthy battle, the Despair Embodied challenges Dante. It is able to use energy and projectile attacks with its wings as well as teleport and shapeshift its arms into swords in its male form, and whips in its female form, as its main weapons. After another long confrontation, the demon's wings shatter from exhaustion and Dante finally destroys the disgraced lord with a lighting-infused gunshot from Ivory. However, with the portal having sealed behind him during their battle, Dante was now trapped in the demonic realm.\n\n===Arkham===\n{{Nihongo|Arkham|\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30e0|\u0100kamu}} is the one of main antagonists in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'', which takes place before the events of the first ''Devil May Cry'' game, and the estranged father of Lady.<ref>\"Demon's Legacy: Arkham,\" ''[[GameInformer]]'' 179 (March 2008): 113.</ref> In the game, he is a scholar in the demonology and the supernatural who sought to break the seal Sparda made to prevent Temen-ni-gru tower from serving as a Hell Gate. Arkham also desired to become a demon. A failed attempt by sacrificing his wife Kalina Ann resulted in the left side of his face being scarred but gave him some power. Arkham tricks Vergil into helping him while assuming the guise of the lunatic {{Nihongo|Jester|\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Jesut\u0101}} to lead Dante through Temen-ni-gru. He plays the brothers against each other along with exploiting Lady's attempts to avenge her mother, to bring all the factors of unsealing Temen-ni-gru into place.<ref>'''Jester:''' It was quite a ride, you know! If any of you had died before getting here, our little plan would have gone to waste! Therefore, my job was to get you to battle each other in order to weaken you. But at the same time, I needed to guide you here and make sure you were kept alive. I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot! (''Devil May Cry 3'') [[Capcom]], 2005</ref><ref>'''Arkham:''' He plucks the threads that make us dance, finger and toe! We surrender in joy to the lowest of the foul and rank; we submerge through darkness, rancid filth. Hour by hour, we move downward, ever closer to Hell, in a slow, steady gait. Now, let the world resonate! Sloth! Gluttony! Greed! Envy! Lust! Wrath! And pride! A bell of chaos that tolls human desires! After two thousand long years, the once sealed gate to the demonic world will open! Destruction! Carnage and Despair! Let your instincts drive you! Entrap this world in fear! As its very name Temen-ni-gru strikes terror into the heart of mankind. Then I will become the ultimate ruler of this wasteland engulfed with pandemonium. The demonic power that Sparda once imprisoned... will be mine! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005</ref>  Arkham then travels through the completed gate to retrieves the Force Edge, combining its power with the restored halves of Eva's amulet to absorb Sparda's power. Though he becomes a demon resembling Sparda, Arkham's body is unable to compensate for the power as he mutates into an amorphous abomination that Dante and Vergil defeat together. Arkham is reverted to his original state as he ends up back in the human world where Lady kills him.\n\nThe character, in form his normal and Jester forms, is voiced and motion-captured by Adam D Clark.<!---Editors please note that there is no period after the 'D' in the name \"Adam D Clerk\"---><ref name=\"imdbdmc3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426437/|title=IMDB entry for Devil May Cry 3|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=November 6, 2007}}</ref> Arkham's name was intended to be Hyne (pronounced \"Hai-neh\"), but Reuben Langdon (who voices Dante) thought it would be inappropriate in English and convinced Capcom to change it.

Itsuno said he did not like the idea of Lady killing Arkham, as he believed a child should never kill their parent. Morihashi wanted this scene in the final product, along with Dante defeating Vergil, as themes of the game. To balance this, Morihashi wrote a scene leading up to Arkham's death, where Lady said that Arkham was her responsibility.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=211}}</ref>\n\n===Sanctus===\nSanctus is the primary antagonist in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4''. The proclaimed [[Vicar]] of Sparda and general of the Holy Knights, he is regarded as one of the greatest spiritual leaders of the Order of the Sword. Sanctus was apparently killed by Dante at the beginning of the game, but in reality, Sanctus survived as he had himself infused with demonic essence in an ascension ceremony. Sanctus originally planned to use Dante to give life to the Savior, a colossus in Sparda's image housing collected demon essence. But he decides to use Nero after his righthand, Angus, revealed the truth of the Order's actions.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=Capcom|developer=[[Capcom]]|year=2008|quote='''Sanctus:''' Held back by love. Such a shame. Still, I must salute a man who carries the blood of Sparda. While not in Dante's league, you still presented a harder fight than I had anticipated. / '''Nero:''' Dante...? / '''Sanctus:''' I had originally intended to absorb him into our Savior, but circumstances presenting, I'd rather choose the option at hand.}}</ref> Sanctus takes matters into his own hands by having Agnus kidnap Kyrie to have the Savior absorb her so it can assimilate Nero. Sanctus than uses the Yamato to open the artificial Hellgates before merging into Savior to commence his plan to wipe out all demons and rule the world while projecting himself through an animated suit of armor. Dante manages to sabotage Sanctus's scheme before freeing Nero to rescue Kyrie while defeating a mental construct of Sanctus, Nero. He completely destroys him by using the Devil Bringer on the Savior. The character is voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] in English, and [[Ikuya Sawaki]] in the Japanese version of ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition''. Yoshikawa designed him <!--to give him the reverse idea to the player in regards to his looks, resulting in him (No idea what this means.)---> to become intimidating across the storyline.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=116}}</ref>\n\n===Agnus===\nAgnus is the Order of Sparda's chief technology researcher and alchemist in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4'', developing demon-killing weapons for the Knights. An introverted workaholic with a habit of stuttering when stressed, Angus rarely appears outside his office and very few in the cult know about him. It is later learned that he has been experimenting with the broken Yamato and created demon-based weapons like the Angelos, even turning himself into the insect-like Agnus Angelo before being killed by Dante when he attempts to keep him from the Yamato. He is indirectly mentioned with contempt by his surviving daughter Nico in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5''. The character is voiced by [[T.J. Storm]] in English,<ref>{{IMDb name|0832622|T.J Storm}}</ref> and [[Y\u016bya Uchida (voice actor)|Y\u016bya Uchida]] in Japanese version of ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition''.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Trish===\n{{main|Trish (Devil May Cry)}}\nTrish is a demon created by Mundus who strangely resembles Dante's mother, Eva. She has enhanced strength and agility, accelerated healing and the ability to use [[lightning]]. In English, Trish is voiced by [[Sarah Lafleur]] in ''Devil May Cry'',<ref name=\"imdbdmc\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268256/|title=IMDB entry for Devil May Cry|accessdate=April 16, 2007}}</ref> and ''[[Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble]]'', Danielle Burgio in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4'' and ''Marvel vs. Capcom&nbsp;3'', [[Wendee Lee]] in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', and [[Luci Christian]] in ''The Animated Series''. In Japanese, she is voiced by [[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]] in ''The Animated Series'', ''Marvel vs. Capcom&nbsp;3'', and ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition''.\n\n===Lady===\n{{main|Lady (Devil May Cry)}}\nLady is a [[Freelancer|freelance]] demon hunter. A human, she is skilled in acrobatics and armed [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. Lady has black hair, [[Heterochromia iridum|eyes of different colors]] and a signature weapon, the Kalina-Ann (a customized missile launcher, similar to [[Man-portable air-defense systems|MANPADS]]). When fighting, she uses a [[CZ75]] pistol with a compensator and a [[VZ61]] submachine gun with a bayonet attached to it. She was named Mary by her father, Arkham, but she renounced the name when he murdered her mother in a ritual to obtain demonic power, an act which drove Mary to psychosis and obsessive vengeance. Lady first appears in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'',<ref>\"Demon's Legacy: Lady,\" ''[[GameInformer]]'' 179 (March 2008): 113.</ref> when she refuses to identify herself to Dante; he replies, \"Whatever, lady!\"<ref>'''Dante:''' You're right. So tell me, what's your name? '''Lady:''' I don't have a name. '''Dante:''' Oh, then what should I call you? '''Lady:''' I don't care. Whatever you want. '''Dante:''' Whatever, lady. I'll leave this to you, because I don't want to miss the party. (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005</ref> Lady formalizes her name in the game's denouement when she shoots Arkham, telling him that \"Mary\" is dead.<ref>'''Lady:''' Mary died a long time ago. My name is Lady. ''Devil May Cry 3'' [[Capcom]], 2005</ref> Although she is not a villain, her role in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'' is that of an [[antagonist]], as she seeks to deter Dante and even fights him twice before finally coming to terms with him.\n\n===Sparda===\nSparda is the demonic knight who rebelled for humanity's sake 2,000 years before the events of Vergil's ''[[Devil May Cry 4|Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition]]''. He defeated many demons and their emperor, Mundus, before sealing the gateway between the demonic and human worlds. Sparda's heroism made him legendary in the human world, and he is known as \"the Legendary Dark Knight\".<ref name=\"Sparda\">'''Narrator:''' \"Two {{sic|millenniums}} ago there was a war, between the human world and the other, the under world, but somebody from the underworld woke up to justice, and stood up against this legion, alone. His name was Sparda. Later he quietly reigned the human world, and continued to preserve harmony until his death. He became a legend.\" The legendary dark knight, Sparda (''Devil May Cry'') [[Capcom]], 2001</ref>\n\nIn ''Devil May Cry'' and its successors, Sparda left his power in his sword (known as the Force Edge or the Sparda) in the demonic realm.<ref>\"Demon's Legacy: Force Edge/Sparda,\" ''[[GameInformer]]'' 179 (March 2008): 112.</ref> (\"Sparda\" is the Japanese inflection for \"[[:wikt:spada#Italian|spada]]\", a Latin word for \"sword\".) To seal the gateway between the worlds Sparda sacrificed his blood and that of a mortal priestess, using two complementary amulets as a key which he brought into the human world.<ref>'''Arkham:''' \"Two amulets... a setmore key. He sacrificed two things to suppress the tremendous force of this tower: His own Devil's blood, and a mortal priestess. I needed you, in whose body flows the same blood as the sacrificed woman. His spell cannot be undone without your blood!\" (''Devil May Cry 3'') [[Capcom]], 2005</ref> To work, the amulets must be joined.<ref>'''Vergil:''' The portal to the human world is closing Dante, because the amulets have been separated. (''Devil May Cry 3'') [[Capcom]], 2005</ref> Near the end of his life Sparda took a human wife (Eva) and fathered twin sons (Dante and Vergil).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">'''Eva:''' Vergil. ..Dante. ..Happy Birthday '''Dante:''' Wow! Cool!! '''Vergil:''' I want chocolate!! '''Dante:''' No, I want chocolate!! (''DMC Devil May Cry'') [[Capcom]], 2013</ref> He gave the amulets to Eva, who passed them on to their sons.<ref>'''Jester:''' And of course, your brother Vergil is the one who controls it by using your mommy's amulet. '''Dante:''' Amulet? '''Jester:''' He's headed to the control room in the basement. If you don't hop down there quick like a bunny, he'll open the gate to hell. Isn't that a scary thought? (''Devil May Cry 3'') [[Capcom]], 2005</ref> Sparda also gave his son enchanted swords with opposing powers: Dante's broadsword Rebellion that allows the user to absorb anything, and Vergil's katana [[Katana#\u014ckatana|Yamato]] that can split one's being or open a link to the Demon World.<ref>Devil May Cry 3, [[Capcom]], 2005</ref> It is unknown how Sparda died, and Dante believed that there was a lot of confusion surrounding his father and his legacy.<ref>'''Dante:''' \"''Well from what I can figure there's a lot of confusion surrounding him''\" (''Devil May Cry 4'') [[Capcom]], 2008</ref>\n\n===Eva===\nEva is Sparda's human wife and the mother of Dante and Vergil, giving her sons each half of Sparda's amulet as a birthday gift.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Eva was later murdered by demons sent by Mundus in her home in Red Grave City while looking for Vergil after safely hiding Dante away. Mundus later created Trish with Eva's appearance in a failed attempt to lure Dante to his death.<ref name=\"Mundus\" />  In ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', like Trish, Eva is voiced by [[Wendee Lee]] in English and [[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]] in Japanese.\n\n===Patty Lowell===\nFirst appearing in ''The Animated Series'', Patty is a young girl, descended from a powerful sorcerer who imprisoned the demon known as Abigail. After Dante protects her from some demons, she lives with him at Devil May Cry until Abigail is destroyed, after which she is reunited with her birth mother. Patty makes a voice-only cameo appearance in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', repeatedly attempting to invite Dante to her 18th birthday party. In English, Patty is voiced by [[Hilary Haag]] in ''The Animated Series'' and Haviland Stillwell in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;''. In Japanese, she is voiced by [[Misato Fukuen]] in the anime and [[Y\u016b Shimamura]] in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5''.\n\n===J.D. Morrison===\nFirst appearing in ''The Animated Series'', Morrison is Dante's closest friend and broker. He finds Dante jobs, acts as a handyman to keep Devil May Cry functioning, and offers him advice on how to be a better person. Morrison returns in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', having been heavily redesigned from his previous appearance. Following the game's events, Morrison becomes the new owner of the Devil May Cry office. In English, Morrison is voiced by [[Rob Mungle]] in ''The Animated Series'' and [[Joey Camen]] in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5''. In Japanese, he is voiced by [[Akio \u014ctsuka]].\n\n===Matier===\nMatier, a supporting character in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2'', is an old woman and (like Lucia) part of the Protectorate clan. When she was younger, she and her clan fought the demons with Sparda. Matier is cheerful and optimistic, certain of Dante's eventual victory.<ref name=\"Matier\" /> She guides Lucia to reunite the Arcanas (mystical relics) and lure Dante (whom she calls \"Son of Sparda\") to their island. Although it is first claimed that Matier is Lucia's mother, it is later revealed that Lucia was created by Arius (who planned to dispose of her when Matier found and raised her). The character is voiced by [[Flo DiRe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0224241/|title=Flo Di Re page on IMDB|accessdate=January 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Credo===\nCredo, captain of hundreds of Holy Knights, is a strict, just man who is admired for his prowess on the battlefield. Kyrie's older brother, he sees Nero as family but finds him unreliable.<ref>{{Cite book| title=The Art of Devil May Cry 4| year=2008| publisher=[[Capcom]]| page=38}}</ref> He was designed with key motifs representing his job, which Yoshikawa found fun to create.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=112}}</ref> He orders Nero to capture Dante for Sanctus' \"assassination\", but is part of Sanctus' plan to bring about the Order's \"Savior\". Credo tries to arrest Nero after he learn about the latter's demonic power, and transforms into a winged creature he believes is angelic. When Kyrie is kidnapped to be used by the Order for Sanctus's grand plan, Credo loses his faith in the Order for using his sister as a tool and tries to help Nero save her. He is mortally wounded by Sanctus while trying to save Nero from capture, and Nero is absorbed into the Savior. Dying, Credo asks Dante to save Nero and Kyrie as his body dissipates into light.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=[[Capcom]]|developer=Capcom|year=2008|quote='''Credo:''' Please... honor my one last request... Save them... Kyrie... and... Nero... / '''Dante:''' I'll do it. I wouldn't want to deny anyone their dying request.}}</ref> He is voiced by TJ Rotolo in English, and [[Rikiya Koyama]] in the Japanese version of ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition''. His devil form was meant to contrast Nero's and Dante's due to how he looks like a heroic person when he still looks like a demon.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=129}}</ref>\n\n===Kyrie===\nKyrie is a supporting character introduced in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4''. She was born and raised in Fortuna and works as a singer for the Order of the Sword. She is Credo's sister, and Nero's childhood friend and love interest.<ref name=\"dev4\" /> After being misled into thinking that Nero is evil, Kyrie was held hostage by Agnus under orders of Sanctus to lure Nero to the Savior. He arrives too late however, as she had already fused with the Savior. Her fusion causes Credo to defect from the Order after recognizing Santus' evil scheme. When Dante frees Nero from captivity in the Savior, Nero can free Kyrie as she begins her new life with him. She makes two off-screen cameos in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', the first when Nero lost the Devil Bringer and the second in renewing his resolve to end the animosity between Dante and Vergil. The character is voiced by [[Stephanie Sheh]] in the English versions and [[Saori Hayami]] in the Japanese versions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1315809/resume |title=IMDB Resume for Stephanie Sheh|accessdate=April 24, 2008}}</ref> and motion-captured by [[Laura Napoli]].<ref>{{IMDb name|1004753|Laura Napoli}}</ref> Itsuno was responsible for most of Kyrie's elements. She was envisioned as an \"ordinary, cute heroine\" who had a big impact on Nero despite not being a fighter. Her role was to motivate Nero and the player as the story progresses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=209}}</ref>\n\n===Nicoletta \"Nico\" Goldstein===\nNicoletta Goldstein, nicknamed Nico, is a weapons designer introduced in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'' who acts as Nero's tech support. She is the daughter of Agnus, whom she speaks of with great disdain, and the granddaughter of Nell Goldstein, the gunsmith proprietor of \".45 Caliber Works\" who made Dante's signature handguns, \"Ebony & Ivory\". She considers her weapons works of art, having developed Nero's Devil Breaker prosthetic arms. Nico is motion-captured and voiced by Faye Kingslee in English, and is voiced by [[Lynn (voice actress)|Lynn]] in Japanese. Nico was created to be a contrasting heroine to Nero's girlfriend, Kyrie; Nico is more used to fighting.<ref name=\"GIPreview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/31/smokin-sexy-style|title=Devil May Cry 5|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|date=August 31, 2018|accessdate=September 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906052647/https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/31/smokin-sexy-style|archive-date=September 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\n\n===Critical reception===\nWhen ''Devil May Cry'' was released Dante's personality was praised, with [[IGN]] describing the character as a \"maverick head-hunter\" \"believable\" and \"awesome\".<ref name=\"IGN\" /> His confident, fearless attitude have made him popular; the character ranked seventh on ''[[GameCrush]]'s'' Top 10: Most Badass Video Game Characters list and third on ''[[ScrewAttack]]'''s Top Ten Coolest Video Game Characters list.<ref name=\"Gamecrush\">{{Cite web|author=Rocco Inzauto, Edward |url=http://gamecrush.blogspot.com/2007/02/top-10-most-badass-video-game-charaters.html |title=Top 10: Most Badass Video Game Characters |date=2007-02-25 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129042015/http://gamecrush.blogspot.com/2007/02/top-10-most-badass-video-game-charaters.html |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Screwattack\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelastboss.com/post.phtml?pk=2160 |title=Top ten coolest games |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809013318/http://www.thelastboss.com/post.phtml?pk=2160 |archivedate=2007-08-09 }}</ref> The original game's demonic enemies were \"ferocious\", the sub-bosses \"incredibly tough\" and the bosses (particularly Vergil) \"very tough\", providing many of the game's challenges.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{Cite web| url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/165/165620p6.html| title=Review: Devil May Cry| author=Doug Perry|  publisher=IGN.com| date=2001-10-16| accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> [[Eurogamer]] called the demons \"some of the most bizarre-looking creatures you will find this side of ''[[American McGee's Alice]]''\" and the bosses \"vast\", with their battles requiring a variety of strategies (although the fight with Nightmare was considered repetitive).<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=2281|  title=Devil May Cry: Review| author=Gestalt| publisher=Eurogamer| date=2001-12-08| accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> Because Dante and Vergil are half demon and half human, they were noted to bring in religious overtones, although it was initially subtle.

The series' success has led to [[comic book]]s, [[novelization]]s, an [[anime]] series, guides, collectibles and a variety of [[action figure]]s. Its first game focuses on devil hunter [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]]'s mission to avenge the death of his mother, Eva, by exterminating demons. In the process he encounters his long-lost twin brother, [[Vergil (Devil May Cry)|Vergil]], with whom he has a dysfunctional relationship. As the story progresses, Dante encounter his father's nemesis, a demon emperor, [[#Mundus|Mundus]], who is found to be responsible for the murder of Dante's mother.\n\nYears after the first game, Capcom developed new ''Devil May Cry'' games with new characters. In ''Devil May Cry 2'', an older Dante aids a woman named [[#Lucia|Lucia]] in freeing a town from the demons. In ''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;3: Dante's Awakening]]'', a young Dante awakens his demonic powers when confronting his brother and matures upon seeing [[Lady (Devil May Cry)|Lady]], a woman struggling to redeem her family. ''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;4]]'' and ''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;5]]'' focus on a young demon hunter named [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]] who is connected to Dante in terms of heritage as well as [[#V|V]], a young man from ''5'' who wishes somebody would defeat the demon king [[#Urizen|Urizen]]. [[Ninja Theory]] also created a reboot titled ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'' that follows an alternative version of Demon as he learns of his heritage while confronting demons controlling Limbo.\n\nNero and several characters in ''[[Devil May Cry&nbsp;2]]'' and the later games were conceived by several staff members, most notably [[Bingo Morihashi]] with designers Daigo Ikeno and Tatsuya Yoshikawa, taking over. While each game changes the cast's designs, the RE Engine was used for ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'' to give them a more realistic look. Dante's characterization and role in the games was well received by game journalists with the recurring cast being praised since ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'' because of the handling of the narrative.\n\n=={{anchor|Character conception and influence}}Conception and influences==\nSeries creator Hideki Kamiya said that the title character from the [[manga]] series ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]'', by [[Buichi Terasawa]], was the basis for Dante.<ref name=DMCgraphic>{{Cite web|url=http://www.survivhor.com/morbidcreations/dmc_behind/int_hideki/dmc_int_hideki_3.htm |title=Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya Interview: Translated from ''Devil May Cry: Graphic Edition'' |accessdate=March 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928065052/http://www.survivhor.com/morbidcreations/dmc_behind/int_hideki/dmc_int_hideki_3.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref name=cvg.com>{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=17957 |title=PS2 News: CVG goes straight to hell with Devil May Cry director - ComputerAndVideoGames.com |accessdate=March 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113012026/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=17957 |archivedate=January 13, 2007}}</ref> Dante wears a red cloak to make the character's actions more eye-catching; red is the traditional Japanese color for a hero.

Morihashi was once again employed, but this time took on a bigger role during the game's development. As he had no experience planning, he was given the role of writing the scenario. The game's main character, Dante, was given a different characterization than in the first ''Devil May Cry'' because his original creator, [[Hideki Kamiya]], was not going to be involved with the project. While feeling his own take on the character did not equal the popularity of the original one, [[Bingo Morihashi]] enjoyed Dante's role in the game.

He is the secondary [[antagonist]]-turned-[[antihero]] in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'' and a playable character in the game's special edition, ending up as Mundus's servant Nelo Angelo in the first ''Devil May Cry '' game.<ref>\"Demon's Legacy: Vergil,\" ''[[GameInformer]]'' 179 (March 2008): 113.</ref> While appearing in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4'' and playable in its special edition to hint at his relation to Nero, fragments of Nelo Angelo's form were used as the basis for the Angelo-type demons developed by Agnus for Sanctus's use.

In Japanese, he is voiced by [[Hiroaki Hirata]] in ''Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom&nbsp;3'', ''Project X Zone&nbsp;2'', ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition'', and ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5''.\n\n===Urizen===\nUrizen, the primary antagonist in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', is the demonic half of Vergil that came into being when Vergil used the Yamato to purge his humanity to become a full Demon. Urizen proceeds to plant a Qliphoth Tree in Red Grave City so he can acquire its fruit to become the undisputed ruler of the Underworld, only to be defeated by Dante and absorbed by his other half&nbsp;V. Urizen is voiced by Daniel Southworth in the English version and [[Shunsuke Sakuya]] in the Japanese version. Urizen was meant to remind players of the original Demon King from the 2001 ''Devil May Cry'' game. Itsuno said, \"Urizen is definitely the strongest enemy of the entire ''Devil May Cry'' saga&nbsp;... the most powerful. You've seen it: every time he appears, he sits on his throne and, maybe sometimes, he moves a little, but that's it.  We want to make people understand how a fight against him can be completely crazy.\"{{cite quote|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Mundus===\nMundus is the Emperor of the Underworld, a semi-amorphous creature with three orb-like eyes who poses as a giant white-skinned [[seraph]] with a third eye on his forehead and a scar on his chest.<ref>\"Demon's Legacy: Mundus,\" ''[[GameInformer]]'' 179 (March 2008): 112\u2013113.</ref> Mundus was defeated by Sparda two millennia ago, making him a nemesis to Dante and Vergil as he murdered their mother Eva and sent endless demons to kill the brothers. In the aftermath of ''Devil May Cry 3'', Mundus captured Vergil when he challenged him and turned the young man into the first of the Angelo demons.<ref name=\"Sparda\" /> As the primary antagonist in ''Devil May Cry'', concealing himself in a statue, Mundus begins to enter the human world and created Trish in Eva's image to lure Dante to Mallet Island to kill him.<ref name=\"Mundus\">'''Mundus:''' Those eyes... deep in them I see the same light as in Sparda's eyes. '''Dante:''' Why my mother? '''Mundus:''' That useless being? If you need a mother, I can create as many as you want. Just like I created Trish. '''Dante:''' Silence! (''Devil May Cry'') [[Capcom]], 2001</ref> But as his forces failed him, gleefully killing off his minion Griffon before Dante's eyes, Mundus was forced back into the Demon World after Dante defeats him with the help of Trish after she decided to aid him.<ref>'''Mundus:''' Dante, I will return...And I will rule this world! (''Devil May Cry'') [[Capcom]], 2001</ref>\n\nA statue of Mundus can be seen briefly in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2''. He is also referenced in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'' as having eaten the fruit of the Qliphoth to become ruler of the Underworld. In Dante's storyline in the PlayStation&nbsp;2 version of ''Viewtiful Joe'', he possesses [[List of Viewtiful Joe characters#Captain Blue|Captain Blue]] to take revenge on Dante and Trish. Mundus also appears in the second ''Devil May Cry'' novel in a parallel universe, where he is confronted by Dante and Nelo Angelo's forces. An alternate version of Mundus appears as the main antagonist of ''DmC: Devil May Cry''.\n\n===Arius===\nArius, the primary antagonist in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2'', is an insane, wealthy businessman who owns an international company, Uroboros.<ref name=\"Matier\">'''Matier:'''Oh yes. .. We are the guardians of. .. this land, Vie de Marii. .. Our clan once fought against the demons with Sparda. Son of Sparda, we must ask this favor of you.

Please deal with Arius and his master? '''Dante:'''Looks like it's your lucky day. (''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2'') [[Capcom]], 2003</ref> He wants to find the legendary Arcana, artifacts which would allow him to raise Argosax from the demonic realm and use his power to control the world.<ref>'''Arius:''' I must obtain the power of Argosax. .. Or I cannot transcend all living things! (''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2'') [[Capcom]], 2003</ref> Human at the beginning of the game, Arius has access to powerful magic (which enables him to fight demon hunters like Dante) and can create his own demons. Near the end of the game, in Lucia's scenario, Arius survives his battle with Dante. Infused with the power of Argosax, he attacks Lucia (first as a demonic version of himself). As he begins to lose, he mutates into a giant creature.\n\n===Argosax the Chaos===\nArgosax the Chaos was a cruel demonic deity who once rivaled Mundus and was the final antagonist of ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2''. Like his sovereign, Argosax was imprisoned in the void of the Underworld by Sparda when the rebellious knight came to the aide of the clan of Dumary Island.<ref>'''Devil May Cry 2's instruction manual''': \"One recent tale, only a few hundred years old, told of a great swordsman appearing from \"the outside\" to aid in exorcising the most evil god of all time.\"</ref> Using the Arcanas\u2014sacred relics used to exorcise Argosax centuries prior\u2014Arius intended to absorb the demon's power to achieve apotheosis. Instead, as Dante had switched the Medaglia coin with his own, the ritual was incomplete and caused Arius to become possessed upon dying.\n\nDespite its faulty execution, the ritual was sufficient enough to create a portal to the devil's prison\u2014enough to enable Argosax to escape if given time. Seeking to put an end to this scheme, Dante elects to enter the gateway and face the demon deity like his father before him. When he first appears, his native form\u2014the Despair Embodied, a fiery horned hermaphrodite with angelic wings\u2014is gestating inside of a chrysalis composed of the reanimated corpses of assorted bosses from games ''1'' and ''2''. He's capable of channeling their power while in this form.\n\nEmerging from the destroyed mass after a lengthy battle, the Despair Embodied challenges Dante. It is able to use energy and projectile attacks with its wings as well as teleport and shapeshift its arms into swords in its male form, and whips in its female form, as its main weapons. After another long confrontation, the demon's wings shatter from exhaustion and Dante finally destroys the disgraced lord with a lighting-infused gunshot from Ivory. However, with the portal having sealed behind him during their battle, Dante was now trapped in the demonic realm.\n\n===Arkham===\n{{Nihongo|Arkham|\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30e0|\u0100kamu}} is the one of main antagonists in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'', which takes place before the events of the first ''Devil May Cry'' game, and the estranged father of Lady.<ref>\"Demon's Legacy: Arkham,\" ''[[GameInformer]]'' 179 (March 2008): 113.</ref> In the game, he is a scholar in the demonology and the supernatural who sought to break the seal Sparda made to prevent Temen-ni-gru tower from serving as a Hell Gate. Arkham also desired to become a demon. A failed attempt by sacrificing his wife Kalina Ann resulted in the left side of his face being scarred but gave him some power. Arkham tricks Vergil into helping him while assuming the guise of the lunatic {{Nihongo|Jester|\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Jesut\u0101}} to lead Dante through Temen-ni-gru. He plays the brothers against each other along with exploiting Lady's attempts to avenge her mother, to bring all the factors of unsealing Temen-ni-gru into place.<ref>'''Jester:''' It was quite a ride, you know! If any of you had died before getting here, our little plan would have gone to waste! Therefore, my job was to get you to battle each other in order to weaken you. But at the same time, I needed to guide you here and make sure you were kept alive. I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot! (''Devil May Cry 3'') [[Capcom]], 2005</ref><ref>'''Arkham:''' He plucks the threads that make us dance, finger and toe! We surrender in joy to the lowest of the foul and rank; we submerge through darkness, rancid filth. Hour by hour, we move downward, ever closer to Hell, in a slow, steady gait. Now, let the world resonate! Sloth! Gluttony! Greed! Envy! Lust! Wrath! And pride! A bell of chaos that tolls human desires! After two thousand long years, the once sealed gate to the demonic world will open! Destruction! Carnage and Despair! Let your instincts drive you! Entrap this world in fear! As its very name Temen-ni-gru strikes terror into the heart of mankind. Then I will become the ultimate ruler of this wasteland engulfed with pandemonium. The demonic power that Sparda once imprisoned... will be mine! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005</ref>  Arkham then travels through the completed gate to retrieves the Force Edge, combining its power with the restored halves of Eva's amulet to absorb Sparda's power. Though he becomes a demon resembling Sparda, Arkham's body is unable to compensate for the power as he mutates into an amorphous abomination that Dante and Vergil defeat together. Arkham is reverted to his original state as he ends up back in the human world where Lady kills him.\n\nThe character, in form his normal and Jester forms, is voiced and motion-captured by Adam D Clark.<!---Editors please note that there is no period after the 'D' in the name \"Adam D Clerk\"---><ref name=\"imdbdmc3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426437/|title=IMDB entry for Devil May Cry 3|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=November 6, 2007}}</ref> Arkham's name was intended to be Hyne (pronounced \"Hai-neh\"), but Reuben Langdon (who voices Dante) thought it would be inappropriate in English and convinced Capcom to change it.

Itsuno said he did not like the idea of Lady killing Arkham, as he believed a child should never kill their parent. Morihashi wanted this scene in the final product, along with Dante defeating Vergil, as themes of the game. To balance this, Morihashi wrote a scene leading up to Arkham's death, where Lady said that Arkham was her responsibility.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=211}}</ref>\n\n===Sanctus===\nSanctus is the primary antagonist in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4''. The proclaimed [[Vicar]] of Sparda and general of the Holy Knights, he is regarded as one of the greatest spiritual leaders of the Order of the Sword. Sanctus was apparently killed by Dante at the beginning of the game, but in reality, Sanctus survived as he had himself infused with demonic essence in an ascension ceremony. Sanctus originally planned to use Dante to give life to the Savior, a colossus in Sparda's image housing collected demon essence. But he decides to use Nero after his righthand, Angus, revealed the truth of the Order's actions.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=Capcom|developer=[[Capcom]]|year=2008|quote='''Sanctus:''' Held back by love.

Sanctus than uses the Yamato to open the artificial Hellgates before merging into Savior to commence his plan to wipe out all demons and rule the world while projecting himself through an animated suit of armor. Dante manages to sabotage Sanctus's scheme before freeing Nero to rescue Kyrie while defeating a mental construct of Sanctus, Nero. He completely destroys him by using the Devil Bringer on the Savior. The character is voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] in English, and [[Ikuya Sawaki]] in the Japanese version of ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition''. Yoshikawa designed him <!--to give him the reverse idea to the player in regards to his looks, resulting in him (No idea what this means.)---> to become intimidating across the storyline.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=116}}</ref>\n\n===Agnus===\nAgnus is the Order of Sparda's chief technology researcher and alchemist in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4'', developing demon-killing weapons for the Knights. An introverted workaholic with a habit of stuttering when stressed, Angus rarely appears outside his office and very few in the cult know about him. It is later learned that he has been experimenting with the broken Yamato and created demon-based weapons like the Angelos, even turning himself into the insect-like Agnus Angelo before being killed by Dante when he attempts to keep him from the Yamato. He is indirectly mentioned with contempt by his surviving daughter Nico in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5''. The character is voiced by [[T.J.

A human, she is skilled in acrobatics and armed [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. Lady has black hair, [[Heterochromia iridum|eyes of different colors]] and a signature weapon, the Kalina-Ann (a customized missile launcher, similar to [[Man-portable air-defense systems|MANPADS]]). When fighting, she uses a [[CZ75]] pistol with a compensator and a [[VZ61]] submachine gun with a bayonet attached to it. She was named Mary by her father, Arkham, but she renounced the name when he murdered her mother in a ritual to obtain demonic power, an act which drove Mary to psychosis and obsessive vengeance. Lady first appears in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'',<ref>\"Demon's Legacy: Lady,\" ''[[GameInformer]]'' 179 (March 2008): 113.</ref> when she refuses to identify herself to Dante; he replies, \"Whatever, lady!\"<ref>'''Dante:''' You're right.

My name is Lady. ''Devil May Cry 3'' [[Capcom]], 2005</ref> Although she is not a villain, her role in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;3'' is that of an [[antagonist]], as she seeks to deter Dante and even fights him twice before finally coming to terms with him.\n\n===Sparda===\nSparda is the demonic knight who rebelled for humanity's sake 2,000 years before the events of Vergil's ''[[Devil May Cry 4|Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition]]''. He defeated many demons and their emperor, Mundus, before sealing the gateway between the demonic and human worlds.

(''Devil May Cry 3'') [[Capcom]], 2005</ref> Sparda also gave his son enchanted swords with opposing powers: Dante's broadsword Rebellion that allows the user to absorb anything, and Vergil's katana [[Katana#\u014ckatana|Yamato]] that can split one's being or open a link to the Demon World.<ref>Devil May Cry 3, [[Capcom]], 2005</ref> It is unknown how Sparda died, and Dante believed that there was a lot of confusion surrounding his father and his legacy.<ref>'''Dante:''' \"''Well from what I can figure there's a lot of confusion surrounding him''\" (''Devil May Cry 4'') [[Capcom]], 2008</ref>\n\n===Eva===\nEva is Sparda's human wife and the mother of Dante and Vergil, giving her sons each half of Sparda's amulet as a birthday gift.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Eva was later murdered by demons sent by Mundus in her home in Red Grave City while looking for Vergil after safely hiding Dante away. Mundus later created Trish with Eva's appearance in a failed attempt to lure Dante to his death.<ref name=\"Mundus\" />  In ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', like Trish, Eva is voiced by [[Wendee Lee]] in English and [[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]] in Japanese.\n\n===Patty Lowell===\nFirst appearing in ''The Animated Series'', Patty is a young girl, descended from a powerful sorcerer who imprisoned the demon known as Abigail. After Dante protects her from some demons, she lives with him at Devil May Cry until Abigail is destroyed, after which she is reunited with her birth mother. Patty makes a voice-only cameo appearance in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', repeatedly attempting to invite Dante to her 18th birthday party. In English, Patty is voiced by [[Hilary Haag]] in ''The Animated Series'' and Haviland Stillwell in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;''. In Japanese, she is voiced by [[Misato Fukuen]] in the anime and [[Y\u016b Shimamura]] in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5''.\n\n===J.D. Morrison===\nFirst appearing in ''The Animated Series'', Morrison is Dante's closest friend and broker. He finds Dante jobs, acts as a handyman to keep Devil May Cry functioning, and offers him advice on how to be a better person. Morrison returns in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', having been heavily redesigned from his previous appearance. Following the game's events, Morrison becomes the new owner of the Devil May Cry office. In English, Morrison is voiced by [[Rob Mungle]] in ''The Animated Series'' and [[Joey Camen]] in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5''. In Japanese, he is voiced by [[Akio \u014ctsuka]].\n\n===Matier===\nMatier, a supporting character in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;2'', is an old woman and (like Lucia) part of the Protectorate clan. When she was younger, she and her clan fought the demons with Sparda. Matier is cheerful and optimistic, certain of Dante's eventual victory.<ref name=\"Matier\" /> She guides Lucia to reunite the Arcanas (mystical relics) and lure Dante (whom she calls \"Son of Sparda\") to their island. Although it is first claimed that Matier is Lucia's mother, it is later revealed that Lucia was created by Arius (who planned to dispose of her when Matier found and raised her). The character is voiced by [[Flo DiRe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0224241/|title=Flo Di Re page on IMDB|accessdate=January 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Credo===\nCredo, captain of hundreds of Holy Knights, is a strict, just man who is admired for his prowess on the battlefield. Kyrie's older brother, he sees Nero as family but finds him unreliable.<ref>{{Cite book| title=The Art of Devil May Cry 4| year=2008| publisher=[[Capcom]]| page=38}}</ref> He was designed with key motifs representing his job, which Yoshikawa found fun to create.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=112}}</ref> He orders Nero to capture Dante for Sanctus' \"assassination\", but is part of Sanctus' plan to bring about the Order's \"Savior\". Credo tries to arrest Nero after he learn about the latter's demonic power, and transforms into a winged creature he believes is angelic. When Kyrie is kidnapped to be used by the Order for Sanctus's grand plan, Credo loses his faith in the Order for using his sister as a tool and tries to help Nero save her. He is mortally wounded by Sanctus while trying to save Nero from capture, and Nero is absorbed into the Savior. Dying, Credo asks Dante to save Nero and Kyrie as his body dissipates into light.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=[[Capcom]]|developer=Capcom|year=2008|quote='''Credo:''' Please... honor my one last request... Save them... Kyrie... and... Nero... / '''Dante:''' I'll do it. I wouldn't want to deny anyone their dying request.}}</ref> He is voiced by TJ Rotolo in English, and [[Rikiya Koyama]] in the Japanese version of ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4: Special Edition''. His devil form was meant to contrast Nero's and Dante's due to how he looks like a heroic person when he still looks like a demon.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=129}}</ref>\n\n===Kyrie===\nKyrie is a supporting character introduced in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;4''. She was born and raised in Fortuna and works as a singer for the Order of the Sword. She is Credo's sister, and Nero's childhood friend and love interest.<ref name=\"dev4\" /> After being misled into thinking that Nero is evil, Kyrie was held hostage by Agnus under orders of Sanctus to lure Nero to the Savior. He arrives too late however, as she had already fused with the Savior. Her fusion causes Credo to defect from the Order after recognizing Santus' evil scheme. When Dante frees Nero from captivity in the Savior, Nero can free Kyrie as she begins her new life with him. She makes two off-screen cameos in ''Devil May Cry&nbsp;5'', the first when Nero lost the Devil Bringer and the second in renewing his resolve to end the animosity between Dante and Vergil. The character is voiced by [[Stephanie Sheh]] in the English versions and [[Saori Hayami]] in the Japanese versions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1315809/resume |title=IMDB Resume for Stephanie Sheh|accessdate=April 24, 2008}}</ref> and motion-captured by [[Laura Napoli]].<ref>{{IMDb name|1004753|Laura Napoli}}</ref> Itsuno was responsible for most of Kyrie's elements. She was envisioned as an \"ordinary, cute heroine\" who had a big impact on Nero despite not being a fighter. Her role was to motivate Nero and the player as the story progresses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=[[Capcom]], [[Udon Entertainment]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=209}}</ref>\n\n===Nicoletta \"Nico\" Goldstein===\nNicoletta Goldstein, nicknamed Nico, is a weapons designer introduced in ''Devil May Cry 5'' who acts as Nero's tech support. She is the daughter of Agnus, whom she speaks of with great disdain, and the granddaughter of Nell Goldstein, the gunsmith proprietor of \".45 Caliber Works\" who made Dante's signature handguns, \"Ebony & Ivory\". She considers her weapons works of art, having developed Nero's Devil Breaker prosthetic arms. Nico is motion-captured and voiced by Faye Kingslee in English, and is voiced by [[Lynn (voice actress)|Lynn]] in Japanese. Nico was created to be a contrasting heroine to Nero's girlfriend, Kyrie; Nico is more used to fighting.<ref name=\"GIPreview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/31/smokin-sexy-style|title=Devil May Cry 5|publisher=Game Informer|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906052647/https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/31/smokin-sexy-style|archive-date=6 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\n\n===Critical reception===\nWhen ''Devil May Cry'' was released Dante's personality was praised, with [[IGN]] describing the character as a \"maverick head-hunter\" \"believable\" and \"awesome\".<ref name=\"IGN\" /> His confident, fearless attitude have made him popular; the character ranked seventh on ''[[GameCrush]]'s'' Top 10: Most Badass Video Game Characters list and third on ''[[ScrewAttack]]'''s Top Ten Coolest Video Game Characters list.<ref name=\"Gamecrush\">{{Cite web|author=Rocco Inzauto, Edward |url=http://gamecrush.blogspot.com/2007/02/top-10-most-badass-video-game-charaters.html |title=Top 10: Most Badass Video Game Characters |date=2007-02-25 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129042015/http://gamecrush.blogspot.com/2007/02/top-10-most-badass-video-game-charaters.html |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Screwattack\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelastboss.com/post.phtml?pk=2160 |title=Top ten coolest games |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809013318/http://www.thelastboss.com/post.phtml?pk=2160 |archivedate=2007-08-09 }}</ref> The original game's demonic enemies were \"ferocious\", the sub-bosses \"incredibly tough\" and the bosses (particularly Vergil) \"very tough\", providing many of the game's challenges.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{Cite web| url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/165/165620p6.html| title=Review: Devil May Cry| author=Doug Perry|  publisher=IGN.com| date=2001-10-16| accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> [[Eurogamer]] called the demons \"some of the most bizarre-looking creatures you will find this side of ''[[American McGee's Alice]]''\" and the bosses \"vast\", with their battles requiring a variety of strategies (although the fight with Nightmare was considered repetitive).<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=2281|  title=Devil May Cry: Review| author=Gestalt| publisher=Eurogamer| date=2001-12-08| accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> Because Dante and Vergil are half demon and half human, they were noted to bring in religious overtones, although it was initially subtle.
