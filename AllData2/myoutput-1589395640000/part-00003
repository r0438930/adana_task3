Established in 1887, it is one of the oldest utilities in Canada.  It supplies electricity to approximately 24,300 customers located in the city of Cornwall, the townships of [[South Glengarry, Ontario|South Glengarry]] and [[South Stormont]], and on a portion of the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk people's]] territory of [[Akwesasne]] in [[Eastern Ontario]].  The utility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., a division of [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis Inc]].  Cornwall Electric is the only electricity distributor in the province of [[Ontario]] that obtains its electricity from the neighbouring province of [[Quebec]].  It is exempt from the OEB's rate regulations,<ref name=\"distribution\" /> and provides electricity consumers with some of the lowest rates in Ontario.{{Efn|name=a}}<ref name=\"rates_lower\" /><ref name=\"rates_comparison\" />\n\n== Transmission ==\nThe Cornwall Electric distribution system is powered by a 72-kilometre (45 mi) double-circuit 120-kilovolt (kV), 325-megawatt interconnection line.  It links between the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in the province of Quebec, to the National Grid Dennison substation in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120 kV.  It is capable of operating at 230 kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].<ref name=\"transmission_path\" />\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to the Town of Cornwall.  In 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'', incorporated after receiving a franchise to operate a streetcar service.  It started operating the service on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately {{Convert|4.8|km|mi|abbr=}} of track. In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.<ref name=\"transit_streetcar\" />\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company.''  In ''1''899 in order to generate additional revenues, the company purchased its first new freight locomotive and started a freight service. It would later purchase another.  The service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other businesses, including the town's post office.  In 1902, the company was in financial trouble and defaulted on its debt to Sun Life, giving it ownership of the company.<ref name=\"ownership\" />\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10|alt=]]Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased in 1905, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.'' With the consolidated operations, it would now have the electricity needed to power its streetcar and freight services, and to distribute it to power lights and heat.<ref name=\"ownership\" />\n\nThe company ended its  streetcar service, switching instead to [[trolleybus]] service in 1949.<ref name=\"transit_trolleybus\" /> It would later sell hot water heaters, powered by its electricity, and paid by its customers using a [[flat rate]] system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Sun Life began to slowly divest itself of the companies assets but retained its electricity distribution system which by now was operating as ''Cornwall Electric''.  Its railway freight operations were sold to [[Canadian National Railway|Canada National Railway]], and its passenger service was contracted out to ''A.J. McDonald Limited.''<ref name=\"transit_cornwall\" />\n\nIn 1977, the [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million. Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors. They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop. Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', expanded by acquiring the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.<ref name=\"privatization\"/>\n\nConcerned about its energy dependence on just one supplier, Cornwall Electric opened in 1995 the first municipally-owned hot water district heating and cogeneration system in Canada.  CDH District Heating Limited, a subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., feeds 5WMe of [[base load]] electricity into the municipal grid, and provides 7MWth of heat to city buildings and schools through a 4.5-kilometre (2.8 mi) underground distribution network.<ref name=\"district_heating\" />\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, twenty years after purchasing the utility, referred by some residents as the city's \"crown jewel\", the city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\"privatization\" /> Ernie Jackson, a former general manager of Cornwall Electric recalled \"that during the time of the sale, the company was entering a time of high risk, and said it was a good idea to put control of Cornwall Electric into private hands where the focus could be solely on keeping it profitable\".<ref name=\"commemoration\" />\n\n=== Ice storm ===\n[[File:Ice Storm 98 trees line Noaa6198.jpg|alt=Ice Storm covered power lines and damaged trees|thumb|Ice Storm covered power lines and damaged trees]]\nThe sale of Cornwall Electric was set to occur in February 1998 but was delayed due to the [[January 1998 North American ice storm]].  During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Even though the City of Cornwall is situated along the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring hydroelectric [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to Cornwall were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant during the storm.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and were hazardously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  Workers were then able to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the hydro lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\"privatization\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to hold a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref name=\"progress_bylaw\" />  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and to pay the mortgage on the city's new sports complex, the Benson Centre.<ref name=\"progress_funds\" />\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to Fortis Inc. in a cash deal worth CA$67 million. Both the Canadian [[Competition Bureau (Canada)|Competition Bureau]] and the Ontario Energy Board approved the sale which Fortis Inc. concluded on 18 October 2002.\u00a0 Fortis Inc. has roots in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's Newfoundland and Labrador]], and is an international company operating Cornwall Electric under its Ontario subsidiary, Fortis Ontario Inc.\n\n== LED adoption ==\nIn 2016, after an initial test run in certain areas, the City of Cornwall which still owns the utility poles and lights, converted approximate 5,000 street lamps to [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]].  The cost of the project was CA$3 million.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref name=\"led_cornwall\" />  In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted most of the nearby township of South Glengarry to LED bulbs, except for the village of Glen Walter which borders the city of Cornwall and serviced by Cornwall Electric.\n\nIn 2019 the Township of South Glengarry also wanted Cornwall Electric to convert Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref name=\"led_glengarry\" />  At a special council meeting on 24 January 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter. In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated: \"''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes. It\u2019s a true savings we miss out on every month we pay the bill and Cornwall Electric doesn\u2019t come to the table''.\" <ref name=\"glengarry_council\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cornwall, Ontario]]\n* [[Cornwall station]]\n* [[Cornwall Street Railway]]\n* [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]]\n* [[R.

In 1902, the company was in financial trouble and defaulted on its debt to Sun Life, giving it ownership of the company.<ref name=\"ownership\" />\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10|alt=]]Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased in 1905, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.'' With the combined operations, it could now provide electricity to power its streetcar and freight services, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.<ref name=\"ownership\" />\n\nThe company ended its  streetcar service, switching instead to [[trolleybus]] service in 1949.<ref name=\"transit_trolleybus\" /> It would later sell hot water heaters, powered by its electricity, and paid by its customers using a [[flat rate]] system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Sun Life began to slowly divest itself of most of the company's assets but retained its electricity distribution system which by now was operating as ''Cornwall Electric''.  Its railway freight operations were sold to [[Canadian National Railway|Canada National Railway]], and its passenger service was contracted out to ''A.J. McDonald Limited.''<ref name=\"transit_cornwall\" />\n\nIn 1977, the [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million. Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors. They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop. Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', expanded by acquiring the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.<ref name=\"privatization\"/>\n\nConcerned about its energy dependence on just one supplier, Cornwall Electric opened in 1995 the first municipally-owned hot water district heating and cogeneration system in Canada.  CDH District Heating Limited, a subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., feeds 5WMe of [[base load]] electricity into the municipal grid, and provides 7MWth of heat to city buildings and schools through a 4.5-kilometre (2.8 mi) underground distribution network.<ref name=\"district_heating\" />\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, twenty years after purchasing the utility, referred by some residents as the city's \"crown jewel\", the city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\"privatization\" /> Ernie Jackson, a former general manager of Cornwall Electric recalled \"that during the time of the sale, the company was entering a time of high risk, and said it was a good idea to put control of Cornwall Electric into private hands where the focus could be solely on keeping it profitable\".<ref name=\"commemoration\" />\n\n=== Ice storm ===\n[[File:Ice Storm 98 trees line Noaa6198.jpg|alt=Ice Storm covered power lines and damaged trees|thumb|Ice Storm covered power lines and damaged trees]]\nThe sale of Cornwall Electric was set to occur in February 1998 but was delayed due to the [[January 1998 North American ice storm]].  During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Even though the City of Cornwall is situated along the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring hydroelectric [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to Cornwall were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant during the storm.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and were hazardously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  Workers were then able to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the hydro lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\"privatization\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to hold a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref name=\"progress_bylaw\" />  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and to pay the mortgage on the city's new sports complex, the Benson Centre.<ref name=\"progress_funds\" />\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to Fortis Inc. in a cash deal worth CA$67 million. Both the Canadian [[Competition Bureau (Canada)|Competition Bureau]] and the Ontario Energy Board approved the sale which Fortis Inc. concluded on 18 October 2002.\u00a0 Fortis Inc. has roots in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's Newfoundland and Labrador]], and is an international company operating Cornwall Electric under its Ontario subsidiary, Fortis Ontario Inc.\n\n== LED adoption ==\nIn 2016, after an initial test run in certain areas, the City of Cornwall which still owns the utility poles and lights, converted approximate 5,000 street lamps to [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]].  The cost of the project was CA$3 million.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref name=\"led_cornwall\" />  In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted most of the nearby township of South Glengarry to LED bulbs, except for the village of Glen Walter which borders the city of Cornwall and serviced by Cornwall Electric.\n\nIn 2019 the Township of South Glengarry also wanted Cornwall Electric to convert Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref name=\"led_glengarry\" />  At a special council meeting on 24 January 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter. In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated: \"''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes. It\u2019s a true savings we miss out on every month we pay the bill and Cornwall Electric doesn\u2019t come to the table''.\" <ref name=\"glengarry_council\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cornwall, Ontario]]\n* [[Cornwall station]]\n* [[Cornwall Street Railway]]\n* [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]]\n* [[R.
