Avenatti stands accused of withholding client funds and applying most of the settlement money of $1.75 million, along with his included $1 million fee, in order to invest $2.5 million in a share of a private jet. He is further accused of misrepresenting Whiteside\u2019s settlement payment as monthly installments, which he paid out until June 2018, totaling $194,000.  Federal agents subsequently seized a Honda HA-420 twin-engine jet from Santa Barbara Airport that was co-owned by Avenatti and former client, Indigo Systems co-founder William J. Parrish, as the latter was about to embark on a flight. Parrish successfully sued Avenatti in 2017 for $2.1 million for failure to repay a 2013 loan.
