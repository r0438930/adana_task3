It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties.

By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country.

The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age.

While ''Neidi'' generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\nThe term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the west.\n\n== Official names ==\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|title=People's Republic of China\n|pic=PRC (Chinese characters.svg\n|piccap=\"People's Republic of China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=1.15\n|t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b}}\n|s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd}}\n|p=Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|gr=Jonghwa Renmin Gonqhergwo\n|mps=J\u016bnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|w=Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2 J\u00ean\u00b2-min\u00b2<br />Kung\u2074-ho\u00b2-kuo\u00b2\n|tp=Jhonghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|myr=J\u016bnghw\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gw\u00f3\n|mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2|-|r|en|2|.|m|in|2|-|g|ong|4|.|h|e|2|.|g|wo|2}}\n|sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> hua<sup>2</sup> Zen<sup>2</sup> min<sup>2</sup><br />Gong<sup>4</sup> hwe<sup>2</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n|bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca<br />\u3116\u3123\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u3107\u3127\u3123\u02ca<br />\u310d\u3128\u3125\u02cb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u311c\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n|xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \u0698\u064c\u0645\u064d \ufed7\u0652\ufeee\u062d\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0639\n|zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0416\u044b\u043d\u043c\u0438\u043d \u0413\u0443\u043d\u0445\u04d9\u0433\u0443\u0439\n|poj=Tiong-h\u00f4a J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|tl=Tiong-hu\u00e2 J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|gan=Chungfa Ninmin Khungfokoet\n|wuu=tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup> zin<sup>\u5e73</sup> min<sup>\u5e73</sup><br />gon<sup>\u53bb</sup> ghu<sup>\u5e73</sup> koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n|j=Zung1waa4 Jan4man4 Gung6wo4gwok3\n|ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}<br />''or''<br />{{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}\n|y=J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok<br />''or''<br />J\u016bng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok\n|hsn=/tan<sup>33</sup> go<sup>13</sup> \u014bin<sup>13</sup> min<sup>13</sup><br />gan<sup>45</sup> gu<sup>13</sup> kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n|h=dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup> ngin<sup>11</sup> min<sup>11</sup><br />kiung<sup>55</sup> fo<sup>11</sup> gued<sup>2</sup>\n|phfs=Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0 Ng\u00ecn-m\u00ecn<br />Khiung-f\u00f2-koet\n|buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0 \u00ccng-m\u00ecng<br />G\u00ea\u0324\u1e73ng-hu\u00f2-gu\u00f3k\n|hhbuc=De\u0324ng-hu\u00e1 C\u00edng-m\u00edng<br />G\u0113\u0324ng-h\u00f3\u0324-go\u0324h\n|mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-u\u01ce N\u00eang-m\u011bng<br />G\u014d\u0324ng-u\u01ce-g\u014f\n|mong=[[File:Mongolian-PRC2.svg|70px|alt=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus, \u182a\u1826\u182d\u1826\u1833\u1821 \u1828\u1820\u1836\u1822\u1837\u1820\u182e\u1833\u1820\u182c\u1824 \u1833\u1824\u182e\u1833\u1820\u1833\u1824 \u1820\u1837\u1820\u1833 \u1824\u182f\u1824\u1830]]\n|monr=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus\n|tib={{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f67\u0fad\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f58\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb1\u0f72<br />\u0f58\u0f50\u0f74\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f56}}\n|wylie=krung hwa mi dmangs spyi mthun rgyal khab\n|zwpy=Zhunghua Mimang Jitun Gyalkab\n|uig=\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u062e\u06c7\u0627 \u062e\u06d5\u0644\u0642 \u062c\u06c7\u0645\u06be\u06c7\u0631\u0649\u064a\u0649\u062a\u0649\n|uly=Jungxua Xelq Jumhuriyiti\n|uyy=Junghua H\u0259l\u2c6a Jum\u2c68uriyiti\n|sgs=Junghua H\u00e4lk\u0302 Jum\u0125uriyiti\n|usy=\u0496\u0443\u04a3\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0425\u04d9\u043b\u049b \u0496\u0443\u043c\u04bb\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0438\u0442\u0438\n|zha=Cunghvaz Yinzminz Gunghozgoz\n|mnc=\u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873<br />\u1828\u1873\u1836\u1820\u182f\u182e\u1820\u1873\u1875\u1864\u185d\u1828<br />\u1864\u1860\u1828\u1865\u185d \u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828\n|mnc_rom=Dulimbai niyalmairgen gunghe' gurun\n|showflag=p\n|order = st\n}}\n\nThe name '''New China''' has been frequently applied to China by the [[Communist Party of China]] as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, which eventually became '''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3''' (see below), known in English as the \"People's Republic of China\".

''Chinese History: A Manual.'' p. 32.</ref> With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of [[Taiwan]] and some other small islands.

An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; Books\n* {{cite book |title = Grounds of Judgment: Extraterritoriality and Imperial Power in Nineteenth-Century China and Japan |first = Par Kristoffer |last=Cassel |volume= |edition= |year = 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qlJpAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0199792122 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Chinas religionen ...|first=Rudolf |last=Dvo\u0159\u00e1k |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition=illustrated |year=1895 |publisher = Aschendorff (Druck und Verlag der Aschendorffschen Buchhandlung) |url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0199792054 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = New Qing Imperial History: The Making of Inner Asian Empire at Qing Chengde |first1=Ruth W. |last1=Dunnell |first2=Mark C. |last2=Elliott |first3=Philippe |last3=Foret |first4=James A |last4=Millward |volume=|edition=|year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |url = https://books.google.com/?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 1134362226 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|first=Mark C. |last=Elliott |volume=|edition=illustrated, reprint|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0804746842 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Mandschusprache |first = Erich |last= Hauer |editor-first = Oliver |editor-last = Corff |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition = illustrated |year = 2007 |publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |url = https://books.google.com/?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-3447055284 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |first = Joseph |last= Esherick |chapter=How the Qing Became China |title =Empire to Nation: Historical Perspectives on the Making of the Modern World |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2006 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title = China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia |first=Peter C. |last=Perdue |volume= |edition=reprint |year=2009 |publisher = Harvard University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0674042025 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Geoff |url = http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp188_yelang_china.pdf |title = The Polity of Yelang and the Origin of the Name 'China' |journal = Sino-Platonic Papers |volume = 188 |date = May 2009 |accessdate= 4 October 2011 |ref=harv}} \n*{{citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion|year=2012 |title=Chinese History: A New Manual |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute }}\n* {{cite book |last = Wilkinson |first = Endymion |year = 2015 |title = Chinese History: A New Manual, 4th edition |publisher = Harvard University Asia Center distributed by Harvard University Press |location = Cambridge, MA |isbn = 9780674088467 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Die Eroberung von Qinghai unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Tibet und Khams 1717 -

It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire]], and [[Wei Yuan]], a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from ''Zhongguo'', which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"[[China proper]]\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as ''Zhongguo'' (see the discussion below).<ref>{{harvp|Esherick|2006|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n''Dulimbai Gurun'' is the Manchu name for China.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&pg=PA117&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iT7tUsrhM4bhyQH_04HYBg&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Hauer 2007], p. 117.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA80&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-0PtUoKZEKWgyAH8oIHgBQ&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Dvo\u0159\u00e1k 1895], p. 80.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqVug_wN4hEC&pg=PA102&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m0PtUtv-OIOTyQHX8YCwAQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Wu 1995], p. 102.</ref> The historian Zhao Gang writes that \"not long after the collapse of the Ming, China [Zhongguo] became the equivalent of Great Qing (Da Qing)\u2014another official title of the Qing state\", and  \"Qing and China became interchangeable official titles, and the latter often appeared as a substitute for the former in official documents.\"{{sfnb|Zhao|2006| p = 7}}  The Qing dynasty referred to their realm as \"''Dulimbai Gurun''\" in Manchu.

This term is quite similar in usage to ''Tianxia'', and simply refers to the entire world, and here the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age.

Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\nThe term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the west.\n\n== Official names ==\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|title=People's Republic of China\n|pic=PRC (Chinese characters.svg\n|piccap=\"People's Republic of China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=1.15\n|t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b}}\n|s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd}}\n|p=Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|gr=Jonghwa Renmin Gonqhergwo\n|mps=J\u016bnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|w=Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2 J\u00ean\u00b2-min\u00b2<br />Kung\u2074-ho\u00b2-kuo\u00b2\n|tp=Jhonghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|myr=J\u016bnghw\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gw\u00f3\n|mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2|-|r|en|2|.|m|in|2|-|g|ong|4|.|h|e|2|.|g|wo|2}}\n|sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> hua<sup>2</sup> Zen<sup>2</sup> min<sup>2</sup><br />Gong<sup>4</sup> hwe<sup>2</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n|bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca<br />\u3116\u3123\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u3107\u3127\u3123\u02ca<br />\u310d\u3128\u3125\u02cb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u311c\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n|xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \u0698\u064c\u0645\u064d \ufed7\u0652\ufeee\u062d\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0639\n|zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0416\u044b\u043d\u043c\u0438\u043d \u0413\u0443\u043d\u0445\u04d9\u0433\u0443\u0439\n|poj=Tiong-h\u00f4a J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|tl=Tiong-hu\u00e2 J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|gan=Chungfa Ninmin Khungfokoet\n|wuu=tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup> zin<sup>\u5e73</sup> min<sup>\u5e73</sup><br />gon<sup>\u53bb</sup> ghu<sup>\u5e73</sup> koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n|j=Zung1waa4 Jan4man4 Gung6wo4gwok3\n|ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}<br />''or''<br />{{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}\n|y=J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok<br />''or''<br />J\u016bng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok\n|hsn=/tan<sup>33</sup> go<sup>13</sup> \u014bin<sup>13</sup> min<sup>13</sup><br />gan<sup>45</sup> gu<sup>13</sup> kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n|h=dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup> ngin<sup>11</sup> min<sup>11</sup><br />kiung<sup>55</sup> fo<sup>11</sup> gued<sup>2</sup>\n|phfs=Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0 Ng\u00ecn-m\u00ecn<br />Khiung-f\u00f2-koet\n|buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0 \u00ccng-m\u00ecng<br />G\u00ea\u0324\u1e73ng-hu\u00f2-gu\u00f3k\n|hhbuc=De\u0324ng-hu\u00e1 C\u00edng-m\u00edng<br />G\u0113\u0324ng-h\u00f3\u0324-go\u0324h\n|mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-u\u01ce N\u00eang-m\u011bng<br />G\u014d\u0324ng-u\u01ce-g\u014f\n|mong=[[File:Mongolian-PRC2.svg|70px|alt=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus, \u182a\u1826\u182d\u1826\u1833\u1821 \u1828\u1820\u1836\u1822\u1837\u1820\u182e\u1833\u1820\u182c\u1824 \u1833\u1824\u182e\u1833\u1820\u1833\u1824 \u1820\u1837\u1820\u1833 \u1824\u182f\u1824\u1830]]\n|monr=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus\n|tib={{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f67\u0fad\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f58\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb1\u0f72<br />\u0f58\u0f50\u0f74\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f56}}\n|wylie=krung hwa mi dmangs spyi mthun rgyal khab\n|zwpy=Zhunghua Mimang Jitun Gyalkab\n|uig=\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u062e\u06c7\u0627 \u062e\u06d5\u0644\u0642 \u062c\u06c7\u0645\u06be\u06c7\u0631\u0649\u064a\u0649\u062a\u0649\n|uly=Jungxua Xelq Jumhuriyiti\n|uyy=Junghua H\u0259l\u2c6a Jum\u2c68uriyiti\n|sgs=Junghua H\u00e4lk\u0302 Jum\u0125uriyiti\n|usy=\u0496\u0443\u04a3\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0425\u04d9\u043b\u049b \u0496\u0443\u043c\u04bb\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0438\u0442\u0438\n|zha=Cunghvaz Yinzminz Gunghozgoz\n|mnc=\u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873<br />\u1828\u1873\u1836\u1820\u182f\u182e\u1820\u1873\u1875\u1864\u185d\u1828<br />\u1864\u1860\u1828\u1865\u185d \u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828\n|mnc_rom=Dulimbai niyalmairgen gunghe' gurun\n|showflag=p\n|order = st\n}}\n\nThe name '''New China''' has been frequently applied to China by the [[Communist Party of China]] as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, which eventually became '''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3''' (see below), known in English as the \"People's Republic of China\". This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the [[Cold War]] as \"'''Communist China'''\" or \"Red China\" to distinguish it from the [[Republic of China]] which is commonly called \"Taiwan\", \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, \"China\" is often used to refer to [[mainland China]] to the exclusion of Hong Kong, [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nThe official name of

''Chinese History: A Manual.'' p. 32.</ref> With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of [[Taiwan]] and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"'''[[Taiwan]]'''\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See [[Taiwan Independence]].) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the [[Cold War]], the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u532a\u5340}}) by the ROC).

Martin, ''Dagur Mongolian Grammar, Texts, and Lexicon'', Indiana University Publications Uralic and Altaic Series, Vol. 4, 1961</ref> As in the case of the Manchu language, the Daur word ''Niaken'' is essentially an ethnonym, and the proper way to refer to the country of the Han Chinese (i.e., \"China\" in a cultural sense) is ''Niaken gurun'', while ''niakendaaci-'' is a verb meaning \"to talk in Chinese.\"\n\n===Kara===\nJapanese: ''Kara'' ({{lang|ja|\u304b\u3089}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n;
