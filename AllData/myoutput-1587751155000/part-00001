The article stated:<blockquote>When the Jordanian nationalist, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, allegedly shot Kennedy, ostensibly because of the senator's advocacy of U.S. support for Israel, the crime with which he was charged was in essence another manifestation of the centuries-old hatred between Arab and Jew.<ref>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 6, 1968|accessdate=September 9, 2009|title=Yorty Reveals That Suspect's Memo Set Deadline for Death|first=Jerry | last= Cohen| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/512460622.html?dids=512460622:512460622&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+6%2C+1968&author=JERRY+COHEN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281886-Current+File%29&edition=&startpage=0_1&desc=Yorty+Reveals+That+Suspect%27s+Memo+Set+Deadline+for+Death|page=Front Page|location=Los Angeles, Calif.}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[M.T.

An interview with Sirhan in 1980 revealed new claims that a combination of liquor and anger over the anniversary of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war triggered his actions. \"You must remember the circumstances of that night, June 5. That was when I was provoked,\" Sirhan says, recorded in a transcript of one of his interviews with Mehdi, later president of the New York-based American-Arab Relations Committee. \"That is when I initially went to observe the Jewish Zionist parade in celebration of the June 5, 1967, victory over the Arabs.

Sirhan was immediately subdued by several men in the pantry as Kennedy fell to the floor fatally wounded. Sirhan has claimed that after having coffee with the woman, the next thing he can remember is being choked and unable to breathe moments after the Kennedy shooting, stating: \"It's all vague now.
