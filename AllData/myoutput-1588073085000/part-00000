Adam''' (born 10 December 1985) is a Scottish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].\n\nAdam was part of the [[Dundee

senior career on loan to [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. While on loan to St Mirren during the [[2005\u201306 St Mirren F.C. season|2005\u201306]] season, Adam was part of the team that won both the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] and [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], playing in over thirty matches for the \"Saints\". Upon returning to Rangers at the end of the 2006 season, he became a regular under managers [[Paul Le Guen]] and [[Walter Smith]]. Adam was also part of the Rangers team that reached the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]].\n\nAfter falling out of favour at Rangers during [[2008\u201309 Rangers F.C. season|2008\u201309]], Adam was loaned out to English [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. The loan was made permanent at the start of the [[2009\u201310 Blackpool F.C. season|2009\u201310]] season, and Adam became an integral part of the Blackpool side, captaining the team to a [[2010 Football League Championship play-off Final|play-off victory]] over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] which resulted in their promotion to the [[Premier League]]. Adam shone in his first season in the [[Premier League]], his performances being recognised with a nomination for the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in April 2011. However, Blackpool were relegated and consequently he transferred to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in July 2011. After one season at [[Anfield]] Adam joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in August 2012 for a fee of \u00a34&nbsp;million. Adam spent seven seasons with Stoke making 179 appearances before joining [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in July 2019.  \n\nHe has played at [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]], [[Scotland B national football team|B]] and [[Scotland national football team|full international]] levels for Scotland.\n\n==Background==\nAdam is the son of former professional player [[Charlie Adam (footballer born 1962)|Charlie Adam]], a midfielder who played for various Scottish clubs in the 1980s and 1990s, he died on 17 December 2012, aged 50.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ex-footballer-charlie-adam-snr-dies-8423419.html |title=Ex-footballer Charlie Adam Snr dies |work=The Independent |author= Clare Carswell |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref> His father's cause of death was publicly revealed as suicide in 2015.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/stoke-midfielder-charlie-adam-says-6534849 Stoke midfielder Charlie Adam says mental health issues are 'difficult to talk about' in football].
