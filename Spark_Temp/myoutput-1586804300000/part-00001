The first county seat of Lawrence County was located at [[Palestine, Lawrence County, Indiana|Palestine]], situated on a high bluff near the [[White River (Indiana)|East Fork of the White River]]. 276 lots were laid out in Palestine, which were advertised for sale on May 25, 1818. Steps were immediately taken to build a courthouse and a jail. The first courthouse of the county was log and erected in the spring of 1818. This courthouse was temporary, and steps to construct a permanent courthouse began in November 1818. It was first designed in octagonal form, with brick walls, a stone foundation, with 45 windows and to be two stories tall. The courthouse was finished in the autumn of 1821, at a total cost of $5,500 (1821 [[United States Dollar|USD]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.
