The bank formed alliances with large regional banks, giving itself an entr\u00e9e into Germany's main industrial regions. Joint ventures were symptomatic of the concentration then under way in the German banking industry. For Deutsche Bank, domestic branches of its own were still something of a rarity at the time; the Frankfurt branch<ref>Historische Gesellschaft der Deutschen Bank (ed.), Die Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Zurich (Piper) 2005.</ref> dated from 1886 and the Munich branch from 1892, while further branches were established in Dresden and Leipzig<ref>Manfred Pohl / Angelika Raab-Rebentisch, Die Deutsche Bank in Leipzig 1901\u20132001, Munich, Zurich (Piper) 2001.</ref> in 1901.\n\nIn addition, the bank rapidly perceived the value of specialist institutions for the promotion of foreign business.

The 2011 US Senate Permanent Select Committee on Investigations report on Wall Street and the Financial Crisis analyzed Deutsche Bank as a case study of investment banking involvement in the mortgage bubble, CDO market, credit crunch, and recession. It concluded that even as the market was collapsing in 2007, and its top global CDO trader was deriding the CDO market and betting against some of the mortgage bonds in its CDOs, Deutsche bank continued to churn out bad CDO products to investors.<ref name=levcob>{{cite web|url=http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2011/PSI_WallStreetCrisis_041311.pdf|format=PDF|title=Levin\u2013Coburn report on Wall Street and the Financial Crisis|work=US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|date=13 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505035617/http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2011/PSI_WallStreetCrisis_041311.pdf|archivedate=5 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe report focused on one CDO, Gemstone VII, made largely of mortgages from Long Beach, Fremont, and New Century, all notorious subprime lenders. Deutsche Bank put risky assets into the CDO, like ACE 2006-HE1 M10, which its own traders thought was a bad bond. It also put in some mortgage bonds that its own mortgage department had created but could not sell, from the DBALT 2006 series. The CDO was then aggressively marketed as a good product, with most of it being described as having A level ratings. By 2009 the entire CDO was almost worthless and the investors (including Deutsche Bank itself) had lost most of their money.<ref name=levcob/>\n\nGreg Lippmann, head of global CDO trading, was betting against the CDO market, with approval of management, even as Deutsche was continuing to churn out product. He was a large character in Michael Lewis' book ''[[The Big Short]]'', which detailed his efforts to find 'shorts' to buy Credit Default Swaps for the construction of [[Synthetic CDO]]s. He was one of the first traders to foresee the bubble in the CDO market as well as the tremendous potential that CDS offered in this. As portrayed in ''The Big Short'', Lipmann in the middle of the CDO and MBS frenzy was orchestrating presentations to investors, demonstrating his bearish view of the market, offering them the idea to start buying CDS, especially to [[American International Group|AIG]] in order to profit from the forthcoming collapse. As regards the Gemstone VII deal, even as Deutsche was creating and selling it to investors, Lippman emailed colleagues that it 'blew', and he called parts of it 'crap' and 'pigs' and advised some of his clients to bet against the mortgage securities it was made of. Lippman called the CDO market a 'ponzi scheme', but also tried to conceal some of his views from certain other parties because the bank was trying to sell the products he was calling 'crap'. Lippman's group made money off of these bets, even as Deutsche overall lost money on the CDO market.<ref name=levcob/>\n\nDeutsche was also involved with [[Magnetar Capital]] in creating its first Orion CDO. Deutsche had its own group of bad CDOs called START. It worked with Elliot Advisers on one of them; Elliot bet against the CDO even as Deutsche sold parts of the CDO to investors as good investments. Deutsche also worked with John Paulson, of the [[Goldman Sachs]] Abacus CDO controversy, to create some START CDOs. Deutsche lost money on START, as it did on Gemstone.<ref name=levcob/>\n\nOn 3 January 2014 it was reported that Deutsche Bank would settle a lawsuit brought by US shareholders, who had accused the bank of bundling and selling bad real estate loans before the 2008 downturn.

He was one of the first traders to foresee the bubble in the CDO market as well as the tremendous potential that CDS offered in this. As portrayed in ''The Big Short'', Lipmann in the middle of the CDO and MBS frenzy was orchestrating presentations to investors, demonstrating his bearish view of the market, offering them the idea to start buying CDS, especially to [[American International Group|AIG]] in order to profit from the forthcoming collapse. As regards the Gemstone VII deal, even as Deutsche was creating and selling it to investors, Lippman emailed colleagues that it 'blew', and he called parts of it 'crap' and 'pigs' and advised some of his clients to bet against the mortgage securities it was made of. Lippman called the CDO market a 'ponzi scheme', but also tried to conceal some of his views from certain other parties because the bank was trying to sell the products he was calling 'crap'. Lippman's group made money off of these bets, even as Deutsche overall lost money on the CDO market.<ref name=levcob/>\n\nDeutsche was also involved with [[Magnetar Capital]] in creating its first Orion CDO. Deutsche had its own group of bad CDOs called START. It worked with Elliot Advisers on one of them; Elliot bet against the CDO even as Deutsche sold parts of the CDO to investors as good investments. Deutsche also worked with John Paulson, of the [[Goldman Sachs]] Abacus CDO controversy, to create some START CDOs. Deutsche lost money on START, as it did on Gemstone.<ref name=levcob/>\n\nOn 3 January 2014 it was reported that Deutsche Bank would settle a lawsuit brought by US shareholders, who had accused the bank of bundling and selling bad real estate loans before the 2008 downturn. This settlement came subsequent and in addition to Deutsche's $1.93&nbsp;billion settlement with the US Housing Finance Agency over similar litigation related to the sale of mortgage backed securities to [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.marketwatch.com/story/deutsche-bank-settles-with-us-shareholders-2014-01-03?reflink=MW_news_stmp|title= Deutsche Bank Settles with US Shareholders|publisher=Market Watch |date=3 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==== Leveraged super-senior trades ====\nFormer employees including Eric Ben-Artzi and Matthew Simpson have claimed that during the crisis Deutsche failed to recognise up to $12bn of paper losses on their $130bn portfolio of leveraged [[Senior debt#Super-senior status|super senior]] trades, although the bank rejects the claims.<ref name=FT20121205a>{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f03eb1d6-3efd-11e2-a095-00144feabdc0.html | title=Deutsche hid up to $12bn losses, say staff | date=5 December 2012 | first1=Tom | last1=Braithwaite | first2=Kara | last2=Scannell | first3=Michael | last3=Mackenzie| newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref> A company document of May 2009 described the trades as \"the largest risk in the trading book\",<ref name=FT20121205b>{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f03eb1d6-3efd-11e2-a095-00144feabdc0.html | title=Deutsche Bank: Show of strength or a fiction? | date=5 December 2012 | first1=Tom | last1=Braithwaite | first2=Michael | last2=Mackenzie | first3=Kara | last3=Scannell | newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref> and the whistleblowers allege that had the bank accounted properly for its positions its capital would have fallen to the extent that it might have needed a government bailout.<ref name=FT20121205a /> One of them claims that \"If Lehman Brothers didn't have to mark its books for six months it might still be in business, and if Deutsche had marked its books it might have been in the same position as Lehman.\"<ref name=FT20121205b />\n\nDeutsche had become the biggest operator in this market, which were a form of credit derivative designed to behave like the most senior tranche of a CDO.<ref name=FT20121205b /> Deutsche bought insurance against default by [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip companies]] from investors, mostly Canadian pension funds, who received a stream of insurance premiums as income in return for posting a small amount of collateral.<ref name=FT20121205b /> The bank then sold protection to US investors via the CDX [[Credit default swap index|credit index]], the spread between the two was tiny but was worth $270m over the 7 years of the trade.<ref name=FT20121205b /> It was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time, so Deutsche required collateral of just 10% of the contract value.\n\nThe risk of Deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option.<ref name=FT20121205b /> Ben-Artzi claims that after modelling came up with \"economically unfeasible\" results, Deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple 15% \"haircut\" on the trades (described as inadequate by another employee in 2006) and then in 2008 by a $1\u20132bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks, not just the gap option.<ref name=FT20121205b /> In October 2008 they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought S&P put options to guard against further market disruption, but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge.<ref name=FT20121205b /> A model from Ben-Artzi's previous job at Goldman Sachs suggested that the gap option was worth about 8% of the value of the trades, worth $10.4bn.
