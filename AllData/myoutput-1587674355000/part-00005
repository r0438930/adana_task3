The westernmost of these is the River Eskin which flows down through a small valley surrounded by the heights of C\u00e0rn a' Choire Sheilich {{convert|791|m}}, C\u00e0rn nan L\u00e0raiche Maoile {{convert|809|m}} and C\u00e0rn na Saobhaidh {{convert|766|m}}. To the south west the Abhainn Cro-chlach takes a direct route along a narrow and steep-sided defile that carries its waters from Carn Odhar na Criche {{convert|895|m}} and C\u00e0rn B\u00e0n {{convert|942|m}}. The two join by a small bridge in the heart of the Coignafearn Forest (which is a Scottish [[deer forest]] and devoid of trees). Arguably this is the point, some {{convert|500|m}} above sea level, at which the Findhorn itself is born but less than kilometre downstream the Allt Creagach joins them at Dalbeg and from here on this is unquestionably the Findhorn River.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} [[Strath]] Dearn descends from here in a southwesterly direction until the river reaches its outlet to the [[Moray Firth]]. \n[[File:River Findhorn near Coignafearn Lodge - geograph.org.uk - 1183575.jpg|thumb|left|Findhorn River near its headwaters in the Coignafearn [[deer forest]]]]\nIn its upper reaches the river is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bremner|first1=A|title=The River Findhorn|journal=Scottish Geographical Magazine|date=1939|volume=55|issue=2|pages=65\u201385|doi=10.1080/00369223908735107}}</ref> The next tributary to join the flow is the Elrick Burn, a substantial rivulet whose head waters are in the Monadhliaths east of the Abhainn Cro-chlach. Its confluence with the Findhorn is just south of the Coignafearn Lodge. {{convert|2|km}} further east is the first wooded area of the valley, on the left bank below Creag Irealis and just upstream from Coignafearn Old Lodge. Some {{convert|4|km}} downstream beyond the cliffs of Creag Dubh the valley takes on a definitely wooded appearance, although the surrounding hills remain bare [[Calluna|heather]] moor.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} \n[[File:The Gorge at Dulsie Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 1438691.jpg|thumb|Gorge at Dulsie Bridge]]\nThe Glenmazaran Burn is the next tributary on the right bank, and various farms and lodges provide habitation from here throughout most of the river's remaining length. [[Tomatin]] is the first settlement of any size on the river's banks and here the waters pass under both the [[Highland Main Line]] railway and the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9 road]]. Just beyond this the Allt Bruachaig tumbles down from the heights of the [[Slochd Summit|Slochd Mor]] and joins the Findhorn on its right bank. Here the river takes its only major bend, a lazy S-shape over a {{convert|5|km}} stretch at the end of which the Funtack Burn, which drains [[Loch Moy]] to the north, joins the Findhorn's left bank. Beyond this point the character of the landscape changes again as the river enters the Streens gorge. This {{convert|7|km}} long defile has no metalled road, is largely treeless and almost completely uninhabited.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} \n\nAt Drynachan lodge the valley reverts to its earlier wooded and inhabited character and roads again follow its course almost all the way to the sea. The river is joined by the Carnoch Burn and flows almost due east from here, passing the {{convert|200|m}} contour, and then shortly afterwards it is met by the Tor Burn on the right bank. This stream is only about a {{convert|1|km}} long, being formed by the confluence of the Rhilean and Leonach Burns, which flow through moorland before cascading down narrow gorges and over waterfalls in their final sections. There is a small, wooded river island in the Findhorn at the point at which it is joined by the Tor Burn - one of the few such islands along its length, none of which are named by the [[Ordnance Survey]]. Next, the river reaches the remains of the [[hillfort]] of [[Dunearn]] just south of Dulsie Bridge. Here the Findhorn turns northwards and flows through a sinuous and narrow gorge with [[Glenferness]] House on the right bank and the [[Ardclach]] bell tower on the left, after which it reverts to a generally north-westerly course once it passes under the [[A939 road|A939]] bridge.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}}\n\nBeyond Relugas the Findhorn is joined by the River Divie at the beauty spot of [[Randolph's Leap]]. The Divie's head waters lie in the hills to the south of the prominent [[Knock of Braemoray]], and shortly before its confluence with the Findhorn it is itself joined by the [[Dorback Burn, Findhorn|Dorback Burn]], which is fed by [[Lochindorb]].{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} Hereafter the waters provide kayaking opportunities for the experienced for the next {{convert|4|km}}<ref>[https://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/rivers/scotland/north-east/river-findhorn-randolphs-leap-to-mains-of-sluie \"River Findhorn - Gorge\"].

Passing under the Findhorn Bridge on the [[A96 road|A96]] and the main [[Aberdeen\u2013Inverness line|Inverness to Aberdeen railway line]] the river finally reaches relatively flat land just {{convert|3|km}} before it reaches [[Findhorn Bay]]. This is a large tidal basin and at low water the river is joined by the Muckle, Mosset and Kinloss Burns as it flows unimpeded over its sands. The combined streams flow on to the north with the village and military base of [[Kinloss]] to the right, crossing the bay and passing [[Findhorn Ecovillage]] and the harbour of the village of [[Findhorn]] before exiting the bay through a narrow, sandy channel and entering the [[Moray Firth]] with the [[Culbin Forest]] on the left.

[[William J.

However, he finds the argument lacking and suggests that the second syllable in Findhorn, [[Auldearn]] and [[River Deveron|Deveron]] may reflect a pre-Gaelic, or even pre-[[Celts|Celtic]], name.{{sfnp|Nicolaisen|1993|pp=260-61}} See also Mac an T\u00e0illeir's comments about Coignafearn below.}} \n\n'Burn' is a [[Scots language]] word for stream although most of the names referred to above are of Gaelic origin. Other common tributary names include ''abhainn'' (river or stream) and ''allt'' (brook, burn or stream).{{sfnp|Bauer|Robertson|2016}} \n\nMonadhliath is ''Am Monadh Liath'' in Gaelic and means grey mountain range and ''C\u00e0rn'' means a [[cairn]] or heap of stones.{{sfnp|Bauer|Robertson|2016}} Coignafearn is from ''C\u00f3ig na Fe\u00e0rna'' and means \"the fifth of the alder\", in this case \"fifth\" referring to a fraction of a [[davoch]], a land measurement that could be subdivided into halves, quarters or fifths.{{efn|Mac an T\u00e0illeir (2003) states that Strathdearn \"contains five c\u00f3igs, Coignafearn, Coignascallan, C\u00f3ig na S\u00ecthe, C\u00f3ig a' Mhuilinn and C\u00f3ig nam Fionndaraich. There is a saying comparing the five divisions of Strathdearn (which means the strath of Ireland, referring to the Findhorn River) with those of Ireland, ''Tha c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh an \u00c9irinn 's tha c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh an Srath \u00c9ireann, ach 's fhe\u00e0rr aon ch\u00f3igeamh na h-\u00c9ireann na c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh Srath \u00c9ireann'', 'There are five fifths in Ireland and five fifths in the strath of Ireland, but one fifth of Ireland is better than five fifths of the strath of Ireland'.

These rocks are typically metamorphosed sediments of [[sandstone]] that are rich in [[quartz]] mixed with some [[shale]] and [[mudstone]] that date from circa 750 mya. {{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=2-3}} The [[schist]]s that underlay the Streens in the middle reaches of the Findhorn were once thought to be part of the younger [[Dalriadan Supergroup]] but are now considered to be Moinian as well.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}} The Grampian Slide is a zone of shearing between the younger Grampian Division and the older Central Highland Division.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}}\n\nIn the lower Findhorn the bedrock is [[Old Red Sandstone]] that was deposited after the Caledonian orogeny. The rapid uplift of the mountain terrain to the south was accompanied by similarly rapid river erosion that resulted in sediment being spread throughout the Moray Firth basin and further north to [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] some 360\u2013400 mya. At this time the land lay some 20 degrees south of the equator and experienced a semi-arid climate.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=6-8}}\n\nDuring the [[Tertiary]] period some 65\u201350 mya volcanic activity on what is now the west coast of Scotland resulted in considerable uplift there and the creation of the slope that dips in an easterly direction that the modern Findhorn river follows.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=15-17}}\n\nWith the onset of [[Pleistocene]] glacial period some 2 mya the whole of northern Scotland became ice-bound. For example, the [[Cairngorms|Cairngorm]] mountains immediately to the south of the Findhorn valley became covered in ice some {{convert|1800|m}} thick. The melting of the ice, which occurred comparatively rapidly, resulted in \"vast volumes of meltwater\" creating further erosional and depositional features, such as [[river terrace]]s in the middle reaches of the Findhorn{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=16-17}} and [[moraine]]s such as the Cluny hills downstream.{{sfnp|Isaksen|2017|p=4}} \n[[File:Culbin Forest, Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|Looking from the Culbin forest towards the shifting coastal sand bars with the [[Moray Firth]] beyond]]\nThe great weight of the ice depressed the land surface and with the end of the glacial period there resulted both sea level rises and [[isostasy|isostatic]] rebound of the land which combined with periodic uplifts resulted in a complex interplay of land and sea{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=19}}{{sfnp|Ross|1992|pp=48-56}} with a prominent raised shoreline between Nairn and Forres that skirts the Culbin Forest.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=48}}\n\nHowever, the shores have not been static even in historic times.

The westernmost of these is the River Eskin which flows down through a small valley surrounded by the heights of C\u00e0rn a' Choire Sheilich {{convert|791|m}}, C\u00e0rn nan L\u00e0raiche Maoile {{convert|809|m}} and C\u00e0rn na Saobhaidh {{convert|766|m}}.

The two join by a small bridge in the heart of the Coignafearn Forest (which is a Scottish [[deer forest]] and devoid of trees). Arguably this is the point, some {{convert|500|m}} above sea level, at which the Findhorn itself is born but less than kilometre downstream the Allt Creagach joins them at Dalbeg and from here on this is unquestionably the Findhorn River.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} [[Strath]] Dearn descends from here in a southwesterly direction until the river reaches its outlet to the [[Moray Firth]]. \n[[File:River Findhorn near Coignafearn Lodge - geograph.org.uk - 1183575.jpg|thumb|left|Findhorn River near its headwaters in the Coignafearn [[deer forest]]]]\nIn its upper reaches the river is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bremner|first1=A|title=The River Findhorn|journal=Scottish Geographical Magazine|date=1939|volume=55|issue=2|pages=65\u201385|doi=10.1080/00369223908735107}}</ref> The next tributary to join the flow is the Elrick Burn, a substantial rivulet whose head waters are in the Monadhliaths east of the Abhainn Cro-chlach.

Some {{convert|4|km}} downstream beyond the cliffs of Creag Dubh the valley takes on a definitely wooded appearance, although the surrounding hills remain bare [[Calluna|heather]] moor.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} \n[[File:The Gorge at Dulsie Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 1438691.jpg|thumb|Gorge at Dulsie Bridge]]\nThe Glenmazaran Burn is the next tributary on the right bank, and various farms and lodges provide habitation from here throughout most of the river's remaining length. [[Tomatin]] is the first settlement of any size on the river's banks and here the waters pass under both the [[Highland Main Line]] railway and the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9 road]]. Just beyond this the Allt Bruachaig tumbles down from the heights of the [[Slochd Summit|Slochd Mor]] and joins the Findhorn on its right bank. Here the river takes its only major bend, a lazy S-shape over a {{convert|5|km}} stretch at the end of which the Funtack Burn, which drains [[Loch Moy]] to the north, joins the Findhorn's left bank. Beyond this point the character of the landscape changes again as the river enters the Streens gorge. This {{convert|7|km}} long defile has no metalled road, is largely treeless and almost completely uninhabited.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} \n\nAt Drynachan lodge the valley reverts to its earlier wooded and inhabited character and roads again follow its course almost all the way to the sea. The river is joined by the Carnoch Burn and flows almost due east from here, passing the {{convert|200|m}} contour, and then shortly afterwards it is met by the Tor Burn on the right bank. This stream is only about a {{convert|1|km}} long, being formed by the confluence of the Rhilean and Leonach Burns, which flow through moorland before cascading down narrow gorges and over waterfalls in their final sections. There is a small, wooded river island in the Findhorn at the point at which it is joined by the Tor Burn - one of the few such islands along its length, none of which are named by the [[Ordnance Survey]]. Next, the river reaches the remains of the [[hillfort]] of [[Dunearn]] just south of Dulsie Bridge. Here the Findhorn turns northwards and flows through a sinuous and narrow gorge with [[Glenferness]] House on the right bank and the [[Ardclach]] bell tower on the left, after which it reverts to a generally north-westerly course once it passes under the [[A939 road|A939]] bridge.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}}\n\nBeyond Relugas the Findhorn is joined by the River Divie at the beauty spot of [[Randolph's Leap]].

This is a large tidal basin and at low water the river is joined by the Muckle, Mosset and Kinloss Burns as it flows unimpeded over its sands. The combined streams flow on to the north with the village and military base of [[Kinloss]] to the right, crossing the bay and passing [[Findhorn Ecovillage]] and the harbour of the village of [[Findhorn]] before exiting the bay through a narrow, sandy channel and entering the [[Moray Firth]] with the [[Culbin Forest]] on the left.

However, he finds the argument lacking and suggests that the second syllable in Findhorn, [[Auldearn]] and [[River Deveron|Deveron]] may reflect a pre-Gaelic, or even pre-[[Celts|Celtic]], name.{{sfnp|Nicolaisen|1993|pp=260-61}} See also Mac an T\u00e0illeir's comments about Coignafearn below.}} \n\n'Burn' is a [[Scots language]] word for stream although most of the names referred to above are of Gaelic origin. Other common tributary names include ''abhainn'' (river or stream) and ''allt'' (brook, burn or stream).{{sfnp|Bauer|Robertson|2016}} \n\nMonadhliath is ''Am Monadh Liath'' in Gaelic and means grey mountain range and ''C\u00e0rn'' means a [[cairn]] or heap of stones.{{sfnp|Bauer|Robertson|2016}} Coignafearn is from ''C\u00f3ig na Fe\u00e0rna'' and means \"the fifth of the alder\", in this case \"fifth\" referring to a fraction of a [[davoch]], a land measurement that could be subdivided into halves, quarters or fifths.{{efn|Mac an T\u00e0illeir (2003) states that Strathdearn \"contains five c\u00f3igs, Coignafearn, Coignascallan, C\u00f3ig na S\u00ecthe, C\u00f3ig a' Mhuilinn and C\u00f3ig nam Fionndaraich.

These rocks are typically metamorphosed sediments of [[sandstone]] that are rich in [[quartz]] mixed with some [[shale]] and [[mudstone]] that date from circa 750 mya. {{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=2-3}} The [[schist]]s that underlay the Streens in the middle reaches of the Findhorn were once thought to be part of the younger [[Dalriadan Supergroup]] but are now considered to be Moinian as well.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}} The Grampian Slide is a zone of shearing between the younger Grampian Division and the older Central Highland Division.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}}\n\nIn the lower Findhorn the bedrock is [[Old Red Sandstone]] that was deposited after the Caledonian orogeny. The rapid uplift of the mountain terrain to the south was accompanied by similarly rapid river erosion that resulted in sediment being spread throughout the Moray Firth basin and further north to [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] some 360\u2013400 mya.
