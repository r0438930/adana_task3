It may be referred to as the ''Theiss'' in older [[English language|English]] references, after the [[German language|German]] name for the river, ''{{lang|de|Thei\u00df}}''. It is known as the ''Tibisco'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], and in older [[French language|French]] references (as for instance in relation to the naval battles on the [[Danube]] between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Empire]] in the 17th and 18th centuries) it is often referred to as the ''Tibisque''.\n\nModern names for the Tisza in the languages of the countries it flows through include:\n*{{lang-ro|Tisa}}, {{IPA-ro|\u02c8tisa|pron}};\n*{{lang-uk|\u0422\u0438\u0441\u0430|Tysa}}, {{IPA-uk|\u02c8t\u0268s\u0250|pron}};\n*{{lang-sk|Tisa}}, {{IPA-sk|\u02c8tisa|pron}};\n*{{lang-hu|Tisza}}, {{IPA-hu|\u02c8tis\u0252|pron}};\n*{{lang-sr|{{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0422\u0438\u0441\u0430}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|Tisa}}}}, {{IPA-sh|t\u00eesa|pron}}.\n\n==Regulation==\nThe length of the Tisza in Hungary used to be {{cvt|1419|km}}. It flowed through the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], which is one of the largest flat areas in central Europe. Since [[plain]]s can cause a river to flow very slowly, the Tisza used to follow a path with many curves and turns, which led to many large [[floods]] in the area.\n\nAfter several small-scale attempts, [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] organised the \"regulation of the Tisza\" ({{lang-hu|a Tisza szab\u00e1lyoz\u00e1sa}}) which started on August 27 1846, and substantially ended in 1880. The new length of the river in Hungary was reduced to {{cvt|966|km}} in total, with {{cvt|589|km}} of dead channels and {{cvt|136|km}} of new riverbed.<ref>{{citeweb|URL=http://danube.panda.org/wwf/web/search/details.jsp?pid=139|title = Danube + Tisza River|publisher = danube.panda.org|accessdate = 5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Lake Tisza ==\nIn the 1970s, the building of the [[Tisza Dam]] at [[Kisk\u00f6re]] started with the purpose of helping to control floods as well as storing water for drought seasons. However, the resulting [[Lake Tisza]] became one of the most popular tourist destinations in Hungary since it had similar features to [[Lake Balaton]] at drastically cheaper prices and was not crowded.\n\n== Navigation ==\nThe Tisza is navigable over much of its course. The river opened up for international navigation only recently; before, Hungary distinguished \"national rivers\" and \"international rivers\", indicating whether non-Hungarian vessels were allowed or not. After Hungary joined the [[European Union]], this distinction was lifted and vessels were allowed on the Tisza.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iea.uoregon.edu/treaty-text/2003-declarationtiszariverentxt|title=Declaration On Co-Operation Concerning The Tisza/Tisa River Basin And Initiative On The Sustainable Spatial Development Of The Tisza/Tisa River {{!}} International Environmental Agreements (IEA) Database Project|website=iea.uoregon.edu|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n\nConditions of navigation differ with the circumstances: when the river is in flood, it is often unnavigable, just as it is at times of extreme drought.<ref>[http://www.noordersoft.com/indexen.html NoorderSoft Waterway Database]; accessed 13 March 2016.</ref>\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe Tisza has a rich and varied wildlife. Over 200 species of birds reside in the bird reserve of Tiszaf\u00fcred. The flood plains along the river boast large amounts of diverse plant and animal life. In particular, the yearly \"flowering\" of the Tisza is considered a local natural wonder. The flowering attracts vast numbers of [[Palingenia longicauda|mayflies]] which is a well known spectacle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Konyvek|first1=Szalay|title=Our Beloved Hungaricums|date=2009|publisher=Pannon-Literatura Kft.|isbn=978-963-251-145 0|pages=94}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Klaushik |title=Blooming of the Tisza |url=https://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/09/blooming-of-tisza.html |website=amusingplanet.com |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Pollution==\n{{main|2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill}}\nIn early 2000, there was a sequence of serious pollution incidents originating from accidental industrial discharges in Romania.

It is known as the ''Tibisco'' in Italian, and in older French references (as for instance in relation to the naval battles on the Danube between the Ottoman Empire and the Austrian Habsburg Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries) it is often referred to as the ''Tibisque''.\n\nModern names for the Tisza in the languages of the countries it flows through include:\n*{{lang-ro|Tisa}} ({{IPA-ro|\u02c8tisa|pron}});\n*{{lang-uk|\u0422\u0438\u0441\u0430}} ({{IPA-uk|\u02c8t\u0268s\u0250|pron}});\n*{{lang-sk|Tisa}} ({{IPA-sk|\u02c8tisa|pron}});\n*{{lang-hu|Tisza}} ({{IPA-hu|\u02c8tis\u0252|pron}});\n*{{lang-sr|\u0422\u0438\u0441\u0430|Tisa}} ({{IPA-sh|t\u00eesa|pron}}).\n\n==Regulation==\nThe length of the Tisza in Hungary used to be {{cvt|1419|km}}. It flowed through the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], which is one of the largest flat areas in central Europe. Since [[plain]]s can cause a river to flow very slowly, the Tisza used to follow a path with many curves and turns, which led to many large [[floods]] in the area.\n\nAfter several small-scale attempts, [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] organised the \"regulation of the Tisza\" ({{lang-hu|a Tisza szab\u00e1lyoz\u00e1sa}}) which started on August 27 1846, and substantially ended in 1880. The new length of the river in Hungary was reduced to {{cvt|966|km}} in total, with {{cvt|589|km}} of dead channels and {{cvt|136|km}} of new riverbed.<ref>{{citeweb|URL=http://danube.panda.org/wwf/web/search/details.jsp?pid=139|title = Danube + Tisza River|publisher = danube.panda.org|accessdate = 5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Lake Tisza ==\nIn the 1970s, the building of the [[Tisza Dam]] at [[Kisk\u00f6re]] started with the purpose of helping to control floods as well as storing water for drought seasons. However, the resulting [[Lake Tisza]] became one of the most popular tourist destinations in Hungary since it had similar features to [[Lake Balaton]] at drastically cheaper prices and was not crowded.\n\n== Navigation ==\nThe Tisza is navigable over much of its course. The river opened up for international navigation only recently; before, Hungary distinguished \"national rivers\" and \"international rivers\", indicating whether non-Hungarian vessels were allowed or not. After Hungary joined the [[European Union]], this distinction was lifted and vessels were allowed on the Tisza.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iea.uoregon.edu/treaty-text/2003-declarationtiszariverentxt|title=Declaration On Co-Operation Concerning The Tisza/Tisa River Basin And Initiative On The Sustainable Spatial Development Of The Tisza/Tisa River {{!}} International Environmental Agreements (IEA) Database Project|website=iea.uoregon.edu|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n\nConditions of navigation differ with the circumstances: when the river is in flood, it is often unnavigable, just as it is at times of extreme drought.<ref>[http://www.noordersoft.com/indexen.html NoorderSoft Waterway Database]; accessed 13 March 2016.</ref>\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe Tisza has a rich and varied wildlife. Over 200 species of birds reside in the bird reserve of Tiszaf\u00fcred. The flood plains along the river boast large amounts of diverse plant and animal life. In particular, the yearly \"flowering\" of the Tisza is considered a local natural wonder. The flowering attracts vast numbers of [[Palingenia longicauda|mayflies]] which is a well known spectacle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Konyvek|first1=Szalay|title=Our Beloved Hungaricums|date=2009|publisher=Pannon-Literatura Kft.|isbn=978-963-251-145 0|pages=94}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Klaushik |title=Blooming of the Tisza |url=https://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/09/blooming-of-tisza.html |website=amusingplanet.com |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Pollution==\n{{main|2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill}}\nIn early 2000, there was a sequence of serious pollution incidents originating from accidental industrial discharges in Romania. The first, in January 2000, occurred when there was a release of sludge containing [[cyanide]] from a Romanian mine and killed {{convert|2000|t}} of fish. The second, from a mine pond at Baia Borsa, northern Romania, resulted in the release of {{convert|20000|m3}} of sludge containing [[zinc]], [[lead]] and [[copper]] occurred in early March 2000. A week later, the third spill occurred at the same mining site at Baia Borsa, staining the river black, possibly including heavy metals.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|title=Third pollution spill hits Hungary |date=15 March 2000 |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/678407.stm |accessdate=11 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThis series of incidents were described at the time as the most serious environmental disaster to hit central Europe since the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Use of river water for any purpose was temporarily banned and the Hungarian government pressed the Romanians and the [[European Union]] to close all installations that could lead to further pollution.<ref name=bbc />\n\nExamination of river sediments indicates that pollution incidents from mines have occurred for over a century.<ref name=springer>{{cite web|last=H.
