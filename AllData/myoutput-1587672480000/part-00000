It is carried out to normalize \u2013 or modulate \u2013 [[nervous tissue]] function. Neuromodulation is an evolving therapy that can involve a range of electromagnetic stimuli such as a magnetic field ([[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|rTMS]]), an [[electric current]], or a drug instilled directly in the subdural space (intrathecal drug delivery). Emerging applications involve targeted introduction of genes or gene regulators and light ([[optogenetics]]), and by 2014, these had been at minimum demonstrated in mammalian models, or first-in-human data had been acquired.<ref name=INS>{{cite web |url= http://www.neuromodulation.com/|title= International Neuromodulation Society home page|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref> The most clinical experience has been with electrical stimulation.\n\nNeuromodulation, whether electrical or magnetic, employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as [[dopamine]], or other chemical messengers such as the [[peptide]] [[Substance P]], that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a \"normalization\" of a neural network function from its perturbed state. Presumed mechanisms of action for neurostimulation include depolarizing blockade, stochastic normalization of [[neural firing]], [[axonal blockade]], reduction of neural firing keratosis, and suppression of neural network oscillations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Karas | first1 = Patrick J. | last2 = Mikell | first2 = Charles B. | last3 = Christian | first3 = Eisha | last4 = Liker | first4 = Mark A. | last5 = Sheth | first5 = Sameer A. | title = Deep brain stimulation: a mechanistic and clinical update. | journal = Neurosurgical Focus | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = E1 |date=2013 | doi = 10.3171/2013.9.focus13383| pmid = 24175861}}</ref> Although the exact mechanisms of neurostimulation are not known, the empirical effectiveness has led to considerable application clinically.\n\nExisting and emerging neuromodulation treatments also include application in medication-resistant [[epilepsy]],<ref name=\"Al-Otaibi 2011\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Al-Otaibi | first1 = FA. | last2 = Hamani | first2 = C. | last3 = Lozano | first3 = AM. | title = Neuromodulation in epilepsy. | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 957\u201379; discussion 979 |date=Oct 2011 | doi = 10.1227/NEU.0b013e31822b30cd | pmid = 21716154 }}</ref> chronic head pain conditions, and functional therapy ranging from bladder and bowel or respiratory control to improvement of sensory deficits, such as hearing ([[cochlear implants]] and [[auditory brainstem implant]]s) and vision ([[retinal implant]]s).<ref>Krames, Elliot S.; [[Peckham, P.

The stimulator, with the battery, similar to a pacemaker, may also be implanted, or may remain outside the body.\n\nIn general, neuromodulation systems deliver electrical currents and typically consist of the following components: An epidural, subdural or parenchymal electrode placed via minimally invasive needle techniques (so-called percutaneous leads) or an open surgical exposure to the target (surgical \"paddle\" or \"grid\" electrodes), or stereotactic implants for the central nervous system, and an implanted pulse generator (IPG).  Depending on the distance from the electrode access point an extension cable may also be added into the system. The IPG can have either a non-rechargeable battery needing replacement every 2\u20135 years (depending on stimulation parameters) or a rechargeable battery that is replenished via an external inductive charging system.\n\nAlthough most systems operate via delivery of a constant train of stimulation, there is now the advent of so-called \"feed-forward\" stimulation where the device's activation is contingent on a physiological event, such as an epileptic seizure. In this circumstance, the device is activated and delivers a desynchronizing pulse to the cortical area that is undergoing an epileptic seizure. This concept of feed-forward stimulation will likely become more prevalent as physiological markers of targeted diseases and neural disorders are discovered and verified.<ref name=\"pmid18164485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun FT, Morrell MJ, Wharen RE | title = Responsive cortical stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 68\u201374 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18164485 | pmc = 5084128 | doi = 10.1016/j.nurt.2007.10.069 }}</ref> The on-demand stimulation may contribute to longer battery life, if sensing and signal-processing demands of the system are sufficiently power-efficient.

Building on that concept, in 1967, the first dorsal column stimulator for pain control was demonstrated by Dr. Norm Shealy at Western Reserve Medical School, using a design adapted by Tom Mortimer, a graduate student at Case Institute of Technology, from cardiac nerve stimulators by Medtronic, Inc., where he had a professional acquaintance who shared the circuit diagram.

Further attempts at this \"behavioral modification\" in humans were difficult and seldom reliable, and contributed to the overall lack progress in central nervous system neuromodulation from that era. Attempts at intractable pain syndromes were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. In particular, the so-called DBS \"zero\" electrode, (consisting of a contact loop on its end) had an unacceptable failure rate and revisions were fraught with more risk than benefit. Overall, attempts at using electrical stimulation for \"behavioral modification\" were difficult and seldom reliable, slowing development of DBS. Attempts at addressing intractable pain syndromes with DBS were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. A number of physicians who hoped to address hitherto intractable problems sought development of more specialized equipment; for instance, in the 1960s, Wall's colleague Bill Sweet recruited engineer Roger Avery to make an implantable peripheral nerve stimulator. Avery started the Avery Company, which made a number of implantable stimulators. Shortly before his retirement in 1983, he submitted data requested by the FDA, which had begun to regulate medical devices following a 1977 meeting on the topic, regarding DBS for chronic pain. Medtronic and Neuromed also made deep brain stimulators at the time, but reportedly felt a complex safety and efficacy clinical trial in patients who were difficult to evaluate would be too costly for the size of the potential patient base, so did not submit clinical data on DBS for chronic pain to the FDA, and that indication was de-approved.<ref name=krames/>{{rp|13\u201316}}<ref name=lozano-textbook-2009 /><ref name=bittar-meta-analysis />\n\nHowever, near this time in France and elsewhere, DBS was investigated as a substitute for lesioning of brain nuclei to control motor symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and by the mid-1990s, this reversible, non-destructive stimulation therapy had become the primary application of DBS in appropriate patients, to slow progression of movement impairment from the disease and reduce side effects from long-term, escalating medication use.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Benabid | first1 = AL. | last2 = Chabardes | first2 = S. |last3 = Torres | first3 = N. | last4 = Piallat | first4 = B. | last5 = Krack | first5 = P. | last6 = Fraix | first6 = V. | last7 = Pollak | first7 = P.|title = Functional neurosurgery for movement disorders: a historial perspective. | journal = Prog.

The approach to electrical stimulation used in cochlear implants was soon modified by one manufacturer, Boston Scientific Corporation, for design of electrical leads to be used in spinal cord stimulation treatment of chronic pain conditions.<ref name=krames/>{{rp|13\u201316}}\n\n==Relationship to electroceuticals==\n\nIn 2012, the global pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline announced an initiative in bioelectric medicine in which the autonomic nervous system's impact on the immune system and inflammatory disease might be treated through electrical stimulation rather than pharmaceutical agents. The company's first investment in 2013 involved a small startup company, SetPoint Medical, which was developing neurostimulators to address inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cookson |first=Clive |date=31 July 2012 |title=Healthcare: Into the cortex Scientific advances on the brain promise to transform the pharmaceutical industry |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/487fb69e-db1f-11e1-8074-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Famm |first=Kristoffer |last2=Litt |first2=Brian |last3=Tracey |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Boyden |first4=Edward S.|last5= Siaoui |first5= Moncef |date=11 April 2013 |title=Drug discovery: A jump-start for electroceuticals |journal=Nature |volume= 496 |issue= 7444|pages=159\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/496159a |pmid=23579662 |pmc=4179459}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=John Carroll |title=GlaxoSmithKline stakes a pioneering effort to launch 'electroceutical' R&D |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/glaxosmithkline-stakes-pioneering-effort-launch-electroceutical-rd/2013-04-10 |newspaper=Fierce Biotech |location= |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the electroceuticals quest aims to find the electro-neural signature of disease and at a cellular level, in real time, play back the more normal electro-signature to help maintain the neural signature in the normal state. Unlike preceding neuromodulation therapy methods, the approach would not involve electrical leads stimulating large nerves or spinal cords or brain centers. It might involve methods that are emerging within the neuromodulation family of therapies, such as optogenetics or some new nanotechnology. Disease states and conditions that have been discussed as targets for future electroceutical therapy include diabetes, infertility, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Birmingham |first1=Karen |authorlink1= |last2=Gradinaru |first2=Viviana |authorlink2= |last3=Anikeeva |first3=Polina |authorlink3= |last4=Grill |first4=Warren M. |last5=McLaughlin |first5=Bryan |last6=Pansricha |first6=Pankaj |last7=Weber |first7=Douglas |last8=Ludwig |first8=Kip |authorlink9= |last9=Kristoffer |first9=Famm |first10=Victor |last10=Pikov |title=Bioelectronic medicines: A research roadmap |script-title= |trans-title= |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |type= |series= |language= |edition= |publication-date=30 May 2014 |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=399\u2013400 |doi=10.1038/nrd4351 |pmid=24875080 |year=2014|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/47172/7/nrd4351-s1.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alim-Louis Benabid]] \n* [[Brain computer interface|Brain computer interfacing (BCI)]]\n* [[BrainGate]]\n* [[International Neuromodulation Society]]\n* [[Interventional pain management]]\n* [[North American Neuromodulation Society]]\n* [[Neuromodulation (journal)|''Neuromodulation'' (journal)]]\n* [[Neuroprosthetics]]\n* [[Neurotechnology]]\n* [[Neurostimulation]]\n* [[Optogenetics]]\n* [[Visual prosthesis]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n\n* {{Cite journal  | last1 = Al\u00f3 | first1 = KM. | last2 = Holsheimer | first2 = J. | title = New trends in neuromodulation for the management of neuropathic pain. | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 690\u2013703; discussion 703\u20134 |date=Apr 2002 | pmid = 11904018 | doi=10.1097/00006123-200204000-00003}}\n* Althaus J: A Treatise on Medical Electricity, Theoretical and Practical; and Its Use in the Treatment of Paralysis, Neuralgia, and Other Diseases Philadelphia, Lindsay & Blakiston, 1860;163-170.\n* {{Cite journal  | last1 = Andrews | first1 = RJ. | title = Neuromodulation: advances in the next five years. | journal = Ann.

It is carried out to normalize \u2013 or modulate \u2013 [[nervous tissue]] function. Neuromodulation is an evolving therapy that can involve a range of electromagnetic stimuli such as a magnetic field ([[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|rTMS]]), an [[electric current]], or a drug instilled directly in the subdural space (intrathecal drug delivery). Emerging applications involve targeted introduction of genes or gene regulators and light ([[optogenetics]]), and by 2014, these had been at minimum demonstrated in mammalian models, or first-in-human data had been acquired.<ref name=INS>{{cite web |url= http://www.neuromodulation.com/|title= International Neuromodulation Society home page|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref> The most clinical experience has been with electrical stimulation.\n\nNeuromodulation, whether electrical or magnetic, employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as [[dopamine]], or other chemical messengers such as the [[peptide]] [[Substance P]], that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a \"normalization\" of a neural network function from its perturbed state.

The stimulator, with the battery, similar to a pacemaker, may also be implanted, or may remain outside the body.\n\nIn general, neuromodulation systems deliver electrical currents and typically consist of the following components: An epidural, subdural or parenchymal electrode placed via minimally invasive needle techniques (so-called percutaneous leads) or an open surgical exposure to the target (surgical \"paddle\" or \"grid\" electrodes), or stereotactic implants for the central nervous system, and an implanted pulse generator (IPG).  Depending on the distance from the electrode access point an extension cable may also be added into the system. The IPG can have either a non-rechargeable battery needing replacement every 2\u20135 years (depending on stimulation parameters) or a rechargeable battery that is replenished via an external inductive charging system.\n\nAlthough most systems operate via delivery of a constant train of stimulation, there is now the advent of so-called \"feed-forward\" stimulation where the device's activation is contingent on a physiological event, such as an epileptic seizure. In this circumstance, the device is activated and delivers a desynchronizing pulse to the cortical area that is undergoing an epileptic seizure.

Earlier practitioners of deep brain stimulation in the latter half of the 20th century (Delgado, Heath, Hosbuchi.

Heath, in the 1950s, stimulated subcortical areas and made detailed observations of behavioral changes. A new understanding of pain perception was ushered in<!--not a mistake--> in 1965, with the Gate Theory of Wall and Melzack.<ref name = \"Melzack&Wall61\u201369\">{{vcite book | author = Wall PD & Melzack R | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The challenge of pain | edition = 2nd | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 1996 | pages = 61\u201369 | isbn = 0-14-025670-9 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref> Although now considered oversimplified, the theory held that pain transmissions from small nerve fibers can be overridden, or the gate \"closed\", by competing transmissions along the wider touch nerve fibers. Building on that concept, in 1967, the first dorsal column stimulator for pain control was demonstrated by Dr. Norm Shealy at Western Reserve Medical School, using a design adapted by Tom Mortimer, a graduate student at Case Institute of Technology, from cardiac nerve stimulators by Medtronic, Inc., where he had a professional acquaintance who shared the circuit diagram.

Delgado hinted at the power of neuromodulation with his implants in the bovine septal region and the ability of electrical stimulation to blunt or alter behavior. Further attempts at this \"behavioral modification\" in humans were difficult and seldom reliable, and contributed to the overall lack progress in central nervous system neuromodulation from that era. Attempts at intractable pain syndromes were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. In particular, the so-called DBS \"zero\" electrode, (consisting of a contact loop on its end) had an unacceptable failure rate and revisions were fraught with more risk than benefit. Overall, attempts at using electrical stimulation for \"behavioral modification\" were difficult and seldom reliable, slowing development of DBS. Attempts at addressing intractable pain syndromes with DBS were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. A number of physicians who hoped to address hitherto intractable problems sought development of more specialized equipment; for instance, in the 1960s, Wall's colleague Bill Sweet recruited engineer Roger Avery to make an implantable peripheral nerve stimulator. Avery started the Avery Company, which made a number of implantable stimulators. Shortly before his retirement in 1983, he submitted data requested by the FDA, which had begun to regulate medical devices following a 1977 meeting on the topic, regarding DBS for chronic pain. Medtronic and Neuromed also made deep brain stimulators at the time, but reportedly felt a complex safety and efficacy clinical trial in patients who were difficult to evaluate would be too costly for the size of the potential patient base, so did not submit clinical data on DBS for chronic pain to the FDA, and that indication was de-approved.<ref name=krames/>{{rp|13\u201316}}<ref name=lozano-textbook-2009 /><ref name=bittar-meta-analysis />\n\nHowever, near this time in France and elsewhere, DBS was investigated as a substitute for lesioning of brain nuclei to control motor symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and by the mid-1990s, this reversible, non-destructive stimulation therapy had become the primary application of DBS in appropriate patients, to slow progression of movement impairment from the disease and reduce side effects from long-term, escalating medication use.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Benabid | first1 = AL. | last2 = Chabardes | first2 = S. |last3 = Torres | first3 = N. | last4 = Piallat | first4 = B. | last5 = Krack | first5 = P. | last6 = Fraix | first6 = V. | last7 = Pollak | first7 = P.|title = Functional neurosurgery for movement disorders: a historial perspective. | journal = Prog.

The approach to electrical stimulation used in cochlear implants was soon modified by one manufacturer, Boston Scientific Corporation, for design of electrical leads to be used in spinal cord stimulation treatment of chronic pain conditions.<ref name=krames/>{{rp|13\u201316}}\n\n==Relationship to electroceuticals==\n\nIn 2012, the global pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline announced an initiative in bioelectric medicine in which the autonomic nervous system's impact on the immune system and inflammatory disease might be treated through electrical stimulation rather than pharmaceutical agents. The company's first investment in 2013 involved a small startup company, SetPoint Medical, which was developing neurostimulators to address inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cookson |first=Clive |date=31 July 2012 |title=Healthcare: Into the cortex Scientific advances on the brain promise to transform the pharmaceutical industry |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/487fb69e-db1f-11e1-8074-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Famm |first=Kristoffer |last2=Litt |first2=Brian |last3=Tracey |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Boyden |first4=Edward S.|last5= Siaoui |first5= Moncef |date=11 April 2013 |title=Drug discovery: A jump-start for electroceuticals |journal=Nature |volume= 496 |issue= 7444|pages=159\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/496159a |pmid=23579662 |pmc=4179459}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=John Carroll |title=GlaxoSmithKline stakes a pioneering effort to launch 'electroceutical' R&D |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/glaxosmithkline-stakes-pioneering-effort-launch-electroceutical-rd/2013-04-10 |newspaper=Fierce Biotech |location= |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the electroceuticals quest aims to find the electro-neural signature of disease and at a cellular level, in real time, play back the more normal electro-signature to help maintain the neural signature in the normal state. Unlike preceding neuromodulation therapy methods, the approach would not involve electrical leads stimulating large nerves or spinal cords or brain centers. It might involve methods that are emerging within the neuromodulation family of therapies, such as optogenetics or some new nanotechnology. Disease states and conditions that have been discussed as targets for future electroceutical therapy include diabetes, infertility, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Birmingham |first1=Karen |authorlink1= |last2=Gradinaru |first2=Viviana |authorlink2= |last3=Anikeeva |first3=Polina |authorlink3= |last4=Grill |first4=Warren M. |last5=McLaughlin |first5=Bryan |last6=Pansricha |first6=Pankaj |last7=Weber |first7=Douglas |last8=Ludwig |first8=Kip |authorlink9= |last9=Kristoffer |first9=Famm |first10=Victor |last10=Pikov |title=Bioelectronic medicines: A research roadmap |script-title= |trans-title= |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |type= |series= |language= |edition= |publication-date=30 May 2014 |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=399\u2013400 |doi=10.1038/nrd4351 |pmid=24875080 |year=2014|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/47172/7/nrd4351-s1.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alim-Louis Benabid]] \n* [[Brain computer interface|Brain computer interfacing (BCI)]]\n* [[BrainGate]]\n* [[International Neuromodulation Society]]\n* [[Interventional pain management]]\n* [[North American Neuromodulation Society]]\n* [[Neuromodulation (journal)|''Neuromodulation'' (journal)]]\n* [[Neuroprosthetics]]\n* [[Neurotechnology]]\n* [[Neurostimulation]]\n* [[Optogenetics]]\n* [[Visual prosthesis]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n\n* {{Cite journal  | last1 = Al\u00f3 | first1 = KM. | last2 = Holsheimer | first2 = J. | title = New trends in neuromodulation for the management of neuropathic pain. | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 690\u2013703; discussion 703\u20134 |date=Apr 2002 | pmid = 11904018 | doi=10.1097/00006123-200204000-00003}}\n* Althaus J: A Treatise on Medical Electricity, Theoretical and Practical; and Its Use in the Treatment of Paralysis, Neuralgia, and Other Diseases Philadelphia, Lindsay & Blakiston, 1860;163-170.\n* {{Cite journal  | last1 = Andrews | first1 = RJ. | title = Neuromodulation: advances in the next five years. | journal = Ann.
