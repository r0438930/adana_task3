It was published in Japan by [[Taito]] and in North America by [[Romstar]]. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the player must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Tiger-Heli has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear the screen of enemies when fired. It was the first shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their third video game overall.\n\n''Tiger-Heli'' was the creation of video game composers Masahiro Yuge and [[Tatsuya Uemura]], who had previously worked on several titles for Japanese companies Orca and Crux before both of them declared bankruptcy in 1984. The development team drew inspiration from the arcade game ''[[Gyrodine]]''. The team wanted to create a scrolling shooter that balanced between being entertaining and fun, and to have players keep wanting to play it after dying. The staff chose a helicopter as the player's craft as they felt it would work for a game that had the screen continuously scrolling. The soundtrack, composed by Uemura, was made to convey a sense of bravery, which was hampered by technical limitations.\n\n''Tiger-Heli'' was well-received by critics for its gameplay, graphics and weapons, and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Micronics]], a conversion that was commended for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original. The NES version sold over one million copies. A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was released in 1996 by [[Banpresto]] as part of the compilation ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1''. It was followed by two sequels: ''[[Twin Cobra]]'' in 1987, and ''[[Twin Cobra II]]'' in 1995. The rights to ''Tiger-Heli'' are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese developer formed by Yuge and other former Toaplan employees.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Tiger-Heli.png|thumb|right|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n''Tiger-Heli'' is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through four increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like [[tank]]s, [[battleship]]s, and [[artillery]] as the main objective.<ref name=\"T-HACmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' instruction manual (Arcade, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' Game Pak Instructions (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|title=Tiger-Heli|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402223234/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Besides some [[airplane]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[helipad]] is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen's height and two [[bomb]]s.\n\nA unique gameplay feature is the bomb mechanic; unlike other games in the genre released at the time, the bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]].<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> The bombs also act as a shield against incoming enemy fire, however, as they can be triggered after taking enemy hits as well. There are also three types of [[Item (gaming)|item]]s scattered through every stage in total that appear as destructible flashing [[cross]]es: extra bomb stocks and two variations of helicopter \"options\" that attack at the player's will against incoming enemies, while is also possible to mix and match the two helicopter option types, totaling no more than two.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> These items can be picked up by shooting their respective cross color but grabbing any item when not necessary yields a 3000 point bonus.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>\n\nThe player are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter, in addition of collecting ten [[gold]] [[diamond]]s in a row by shooting them.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> Firing on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as certain [[setpiece]]s in some stages hosts a bonus secret within their scenery.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> There are also hidden bonus secrets to be found as well. The game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as the helicopter options and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n''Tiger-Heli'' was created under the working title ''Cobra'' by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy in 1984, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were [[Video game composer|composer]]s Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which recounted the project's development process and history between [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] and [[2012 in video gaming|2012]] through Japanese publications such as ''Shooting Gameside''.<ref name=\"PSGv10\">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=FSG|date=September 1989|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name=\"G49\">{{cite magazine|author=|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9a\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (1/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219234827/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation|date=2011-02-19}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9b\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (2/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034931/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2|date=2013-02-24}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9c\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (3/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122014305/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3|date=2019-11-22}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCa\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCb\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb \u7279\u8a2d\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4a\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Y\u016bsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u7279\u96c6  -

up|vertical-scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Toaplan]]. It was published in Japan by [[Taito]] and in North America by [[Romstar]]. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the player must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Tiger-Heli has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear the screen of enemies when fired. It was the first shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their third video game overall.\n\n''Tiger-Heli'' was the creation of video game composers Masahiro Yuge and [[Tatsuya Uemura]], who had previously worked on several titles for Japanese companies Orca and Crux before both of them declared bankruptcy in 1984. The development team drew inspiration from the arcade game ''[[Gyrodine]]''. The team wanted to create a scrolling shooter that balanced between being entertaining and fun, and to have players keep wanting to play it after dying. The staff chose a helicopter as the player's craft as they felt it would work for a game that had the screen continuously scrolling. The soundtrack, composed by Uemura, was made to convey a sense of bravery, which was hampered by technical limitations.\n\n''Tiger-Heli'' was well-received by critics for its gameplay, graphics and weapons, and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Micronics]], a conversion that was commended for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original. The NES version sold over one million copies. A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was released in 1996 by [[Banpresto]] as part of the compilation ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1''. It was followed by two sequels: ''[[Twin Cobra]]'' in 1987, and ''[[Twin Cobra II]]'' in 1995. The rights to ''Tiger-Heli'' are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese developer formed by Yuge and other former Toaplan employees.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Tiger-Heli.png|thumb|right|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n''Tiger-Heli'' is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through four increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like [[tank]]s, [[battleship]]s, and [[artillery]] as the main objective.<ref name=\"T-HACmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' instruction manual (Arcade, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' Game Pak Instructions (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|title=Tiger-Heli|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402223234/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Besides some [[airplane]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[helipad]] is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen's height and two [[bomb]]s.\n\nA unique gameplay feature is the bomb mechanic; unlike other games in the genre released at the time, the bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]].<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> The bombs also act as a shield against incoming enemy fire, however, as they can be triggered after taking enemy hits as well. There are also three types of [[Item (gaming)|item]]s scattered through every stage in total that appear as destructible flashing [[cross]]es: extra bomb stocks and two variations of helicopter \"options\" that attack at the player's will against incoming enemies, while is also possible to mix and match the two helicopter option types, totaling no more than two.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> These items can be picked up by shooting their respective cross color but grabbing any item when not necessary yields a 3000 point bonus.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>\n\nThe player are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter, in addition of collecting ten [[gold]] [[diamond]]s in a row by shooting them.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> Firing on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as certain [[setpiece]]s in some stages hosts a bonus secret within their scenery.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> There are also hidden bonus secrets to be found as well. The game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as the helicopter options and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n''Tiger-Heli'' was created under the working title ''Cobra'' by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy in 1984, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were [[Video game composer|composer]]s Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which recounted the project's development process and history between [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] and [[2012 in video gaming|2012]] through Japanese publications such as ''Shooting Gameside''.<ref name=\"PSGv10\">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=FSG|date=September 1989|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name=\"G49\">{{cite magazine|author=|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9a\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (1/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219234827/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation|date=2011-02-19}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9b\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (2/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034931/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2|date=2013-02-24}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9c\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (3/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122014305/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3|date=2019-11-22}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCa\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCb\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb \u7279\u8a2d\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4a\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Y\u016bsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u7279\u96c6  -
