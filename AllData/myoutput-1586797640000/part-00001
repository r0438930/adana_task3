They total in area about 290 hectares. The lava flows are quite recent, with the typical [[aa (lava flow)|{{okina}}a{{okina}}\u0101]] type less than 10,000 years old. The large cone is called ''Monta\u00f1a Grande'' (''Big Mountain'') and reaches a height of {{convert|276|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe Malpa\u00eds de G\u00fc\u00edmar were formed by a series of volcanic eruptions, the most recent and most evident occurring from fissures in the side of the Monta\u00f1a Grande cone less than 10,000 years ago.  Two peaks from former eruptions stand above the lava plain, ''Monta\u00f1a de la Mar'' (\"Mountain of the Sea\") and ''Las Morras del Corcho'' (\"Cork Bluff\"). In addition to aa lava flows, there have been [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] eruptions of ash and [[volcanic bomb]]s that formed the various cones.  The crater of Monta\u00f1a Grande is about 300 meters in diameter and about 50 meters deep. It has a certain asymmetry, being wider towards leeward due to the action of the wind during its period of formation.  The shore line has eroded since the last eruptions, and beaches have formed in a few areas.  In places [[lava tube]]s have been exposed.  Notable is ''Cueva Honda'' (\"Deep Cave\"), which was formed by a large gas bubble within a lava tube.\n\n==Climate==\n\nThere is little rainfall, and what does fall is quickly transported away from the surface by the volcanic soil.  The area is washed by the [[tradewinds]], and temperatures vary between a 17&nbsp;\u00b0C average in January and 23&nbsp;\u00b0C in August. In addition the area has a very high rate of days of sunshine, upwards of 2,500 hours per year.
