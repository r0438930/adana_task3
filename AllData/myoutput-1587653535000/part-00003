Perhaps one of the most salient ones deals with the nature and development of personality. Personality psychology studies one's distinctive style of [[cognition]], behavior, and [[affect (psychology)|affect]]. However, this concept elicits discord among psychologists as some have insisted that it does not exist,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} while others struggle with issues of measurement.\n\n==Personality exists==\n[[Personality]], one's characteristic way of feeling, behaving and thinking, is often conceptualized as a person's standing on each [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five personality trait]] ([[extraversion]], [[neuroticism]], [[openness to experience]], [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]]). A person's personality profile is thus gauged from their standing on five broad concepts which predict, among other life outcomes, behavior and the quality of interpersonal relationships. Initially, it was believed that one's Big Five profile was static and dichotomous in that one was either at one extreme of each trait or another <ref>Funder, D. C. (2010). The Personality Puzzle (5th Ed.). NY: Norton</ref> \nFor example, people are typically categorized as [[introverted]] or [[extraverted]]. Personality was therefore assessed in terms of generalities or averages. In noticing the strong inconsistencies in how people behaved across situations, some psychologists dismissed personality as nonexistent.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThis school of thought attributes human behavior to environmental factors, relegating individual differences to situational artifacts and contesting the existence of individual predispositions. It was led by [[Situationism (psychology)|situationists]] like [[Walter Mischel]] (1968). Their contention held that personality was a fictitious concept.  For them, the discrepancies observed across one's behaviors were evidence that interindividual differences did not exist <ref>Mischel, W. (1968). Personality and assessment. Hoboken, NJ US: John Wiley & Sons Inc.</ref>\nSome aspects of the situationist perspective even suggest that all human beings are the same and that the differences we observe are simply illusory biproducts of the environment. \n          \nHowever, personologists soon integrated these inconsistencies into their conceptualization of [[personality]]. They modified the old, more monolithic construct by measuring how people differ across situations. Their new methods of personality assessment describe fluctuations in personality characteristics as consistent and predictable for each person based on the environment he is in and his predispositions. Some work suggests that people can espouse different levels of a personality dimension as the social situations and time of day change<ref name=\"Fleeson, William 2001\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fleeson | first1 = William | year = 2001 | title = Towards a structure- and process-integrated view of personality: Traits as density distributions of states | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = 6| pages = 1011\u20131027 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.1011}}</ref>\n         \nTherefore, someone is not [[conscientious]] all the time, but can be conscientious at work and a lot less so when she is home. This work also suggests that intrapersonal variations on a [[trait theory|trait]] can be even larger than interpersonal variations. [[Extraversion]] varies more within a person than across individuals, for example. This work was based on individual self-ratings during the day across a long period of time. This allowed for researchers to assess moment-to-moment and day to day variations on personality attributes.<ref name=\"Fleeson, William 2001\"/>\nPersonologists now tend to agree that people's personalities are variegated and are not to be conceptualized through bipolar characterizations (e.g. extraversion vs introversion). Rather people oscillate between the two extremes of a trait. The pattern of this oscillation then constitutes personality.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==The impact of social roles==\nIn addition, social roles (e.g. employee) have been identified as a potential sources of [[personality]] change. Researchers have found strong correspondences between the demands of a [[social role]] and one's personality profile.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heller | first1 = D. | last2 = Perunovic | first2 = W.

Conversely, once he leaves that role and or takes on another which entails less conscientiousness, he will manifest a lower level standing on that trait. Longitudinal research demonstrates that people's personality trajectories can often be explained by the social roles they espoused and relinquished throughout their life stages. Thus social roles are often studied as fundamental predictors of personality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ozer | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Benet-Mart\u00ednez | first2 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Personality and the prediction of consequential outcomes | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 401\u2013421 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190127 | pmid=16318601| doi-access = free }}</ref> \nThe goals associated with them elicit the appropriation of certain personality profiles by the people enacting them. For example, employees judged effective by their peers and superiors are often described as conscientious as well.  \n            \nPersonality also changes through life stages. This may be due to physiological changes associated with development but also experiences that impact behavior. Adolescence and young adulthood have been found to be prime periods of personality changes, especially in the domains of extraversion and agreeableness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Soto | first1 = C.

Researchers distinguish between mean level and rank order changes in trait standing during old age.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = M\u00f5ttus | first1 = R. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = W. | last3 = Deary | first3 = I.

Mottus, Johnson and Geary (2012) found that instability engendered by aging does not necessarily affect one's standing within an age cohort. Hence, fluctuations and stability coexist so that one changes relative to one's former self but not relative to one's peers. Similarly, other psychologists found that [[Neuroticism]], [[Extraversion]] (only in men), and [[Openness to experience|Openness]] decreased with age after 70, but [[Conscientiousness]] and [[Agreeableness]] increased with age (the latter only in men). Moreover, they suggest that there is a decline on each trait after the age of 81.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = R.

Fleisher and Woehr (2008) suggest that that consistency across the Big Five is a construct that is fairly stable and contributes to the predictive validity of personality measures. Hence inconsistency is quantifiable much like a trait and constitutes an index of and enhances the fit of psychological models.\n\nTo accommodate the inconsistency demonstrated on personality tests, researchers developed the Frame Of Reference principle (FOR). According to this theory, people tend to think of their personality in terms of a specific social context when they are asked to rate them.  Whichever environment is cognitively salient at the time of the personality measurement will influence the respondent's ratings on a trait measure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Reddock | first1 = C.

Accounting for the FOR principle aims at increasing the validity of personality measures.  This demonstrates that the predictive validity of personality measures which specify a social context is a lot higher than those measures which take a more generic approach.\n          \nThis point is substantiated by yet another body of work suggesting that FOR instructions moderated the link between extraversion and openness scores on manager ratings of employee performance <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hunthausen | first1 = J.

A ''rank-order change'' refers to a change in an individual's personality trait relative to other individuals; such changes do not occur very often.<ref name=\"Funder 258\">{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The Personality Puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|pages=258|edition=5th|isbn=978-0-393-93348-2}}</ref>\nA ''mean-level change'' refers to an absolute change in the individual's level of a certain trait over time. Longitudinal research shows that mean-level change does occur.<ref name=\"Funder 258\" /> However, some [[Trait theory|traits]] tend to change while some traits tend to stay stable.\n\nDuring adolescence there are many increases or rapid changes in hormones, societal pressures, and environment among other things. These things theoretically factor into significant personality changes as one progresses through adolescence. As you progress through adulthood personality becomes more stable and predictable because you fall into a pattern of thinking, behaving, and feeling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borghuis|first=Jeroen|last2=Denissen|first2=Jaap J.

Biological transitions are stages like [[puberty]] or first childbirth. Social transitions might be changes in social roles like becoming a parent or working at a first job. These life transitions do not necessarily cause change, but they may be reasons for change. As humans we do not adapt just in our body, our mind also makes changes to itself in order to thrive in our environment. One theory says that whether or not these life transitions cause personality change is based on whether the transition was expected based on age or was unforeseen.<ref name=\"Caspi and Moffitt\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Caspi | first1 = Avshalom | last2 = Moffitt | first2 = Terrie E. | title = When Do Individual Differences Matter?

[[Therapy]] involves the same type of introspection. The individual along with the therapist identifies the behaviors that are inappropriate, and then self-monitors in order to change them. Eventually the individual internalizes the behavior they want to attain, and that trait will generalize to other areas of the individual's life.\nPersonality change also occurs when individuals observe the actions of others. Individuals may mimic the behaviors of others and then internalize those behaviors. Once the individual internalizes those behaviors they are said to be a part of that person's personality.<ref name=\"Caspi and Roberts\" />\nIndividuals also receive feedback from other individuals or groups about their own personality. This is a driving force of change because the individual has social motivations to change his or her personality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It has also been shown that major positive and negative life events can predict changes in personality.<ref name=\"Jeronimus2014\"/><ref name=\"Jeronimus2013\"/> Some of the largest changes are observed in individuals with psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.

This allowed for researchers to assess moment-to-moment and day to day variations on personality attributes.<ref name=\"Fleeson, William 2001\"/>\nPersonologists now tend to agree that people's personalities are variegated and are not to be conceptualized through bipolar characterizations (e.g. extraversion vs introversion). Rather people oscillate between the two extremes of a trait. The pattern of this oscillation then constitutes personality.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==The impact of social roles==\nIn addition, social roles (e.g. employee) have been identified as a potential sources of [[personality]] change. Researchers have found strong correspondences between the demands of a [[social role]] and one's personality profile.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heller | first1 = D. | last2 = Perunovic | first2 = W.

Conversely, once he leaves that role and or takes on another which entails less conscientiousness, he will manifest a lower level standing on that trait. Longitudinal research demonstrates that people's personality trajectories can often be explained by the social roles they espoused and relinquished throughout their life stages. Thus social roles are often studied as fundamental predictors of personality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ozer | first1 = D.

For example, employees judged effective by their peers and superiors are often described as conscientious as well.  \n            \nPersonality also changes through life stages. This may be due to physiological changes associated with development but also experiences that impact behavior. Adolescence and young adulthood have been found to be prime periods of personality changes, especially in the domains of extraversion and agreeableness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Soto | first1 = C.

Researchers distinguish between mean level and rank order changes in trait standing during old age.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = M\u00f5ttus | first1 = R. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = W. | last3 = Deary | first3 = I.

Mottus, Johnson and Geary (2012) found that instability engendered by aging does not necessarily affect one's standing within an age cohort. Hence, fluctuations and stability coexist so that one changes relative to one's former self but not relative to one's peers. Similarly, other psychologists found that [[Neuroticism]], [[Extraversion]] (only in men), and [[Openness to experience|Openness]] decreased with age after 70, but [[Conscientiousness]] and [[Agreeableness]] increased with age (the latter only in men). Moreover, they suggest that there is a decline on each trait after the age of 81.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = R.

Fleisher and Woehr (2008) suggest that that consistency across the Big Five is a construct that is fairly stable and contributes to the predictive validity of personality measures. Hence inconsistency is quantifiable much like a trait and constitutes an index of and enhances the fit of psychological models.\n\nTo accommodate the inconsistency demonstrated on personality tests, researchers developed the Frame Of Reference principle (FOR). According to this theory, people tend to think of their personality in terms of a specific social context when they are asked to rate them.  Whichever environment is cognitively salient at the time of the personality measurement will influence the respondent's ratings on a trait measure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Reddock | first1 = C.

Accounting for the FOR principle aims at increasing the validity of personality measures.  This demonstrates that the predictive validity of personality measures which specify a social context is a lot higher than those measures which take a more generic approach.\n          \nThis point is substantiated by yet another body of work suggesting that FOR instructions moderated the link between extraversion and openness scores on manager ratings of employee performance <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hunthausen | first1 = J.

A ''rank-order change'' refers to a change in an individual's personality trait relative to other individuals; such changes do not occur very often.<ref name=\"Funder 258\">{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The Personality Puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W.

Longitudinal research shows that mean-level change does occur.<ref name=\"Funder 258\" /> However, some [[Trait theory|traits]] tend to change while some traits tend to stay stable.\n\nDuring adolescence there are many increases or rapid changes in hormones, societal pressures, and environment among other things. These things theoretically factor into significant personality changes as one progresses through adolescence. As you progress through adulthood personality becomes more stable and predictable because you fall into a pattern of thinking, behaving, and feeling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borghuis|first=Jeroen|last2=Denissen|first2=Jaap J.

Biological transitions are stages like [[puberty]] or first childbirth. Social transitions might be changes in social roles like becoming a parent or working at a first job. These life transitions do not necessarily cause change, but they may be reasons for change. As humans we do not adapt just in our body, our mind also makes changes to itself in order to thrive in our environment. One theory says that whether or not these life transitions cause personality change is based on whether the transition was expected based on age or was unforeseen.<ref name=\"Caspi and Moffitt\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Caspi | first1 = Avshalom | last2 = Moffitt | first2 = Terrie E. | title = When Do Individual Differences Matter?

Individuals will change their behavior based on the ideas in their environment that emit [[Reward system#Psychological reward|rewards]] and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishments]]. Some of these ideas might be implicit, like social roles. The individual changes his or her personality to fit into a [[social role]] if it is favorable.

[[Therapy]] involves the same type of introspection. The individual along with the therapist identifies the behaviors that are inappropriate, and then self-monitors in order to change them. Eventually the individual internalizes the behavior they want to attain, and that trait will generalize to other areas of the individual's life.\nPersonality change also occurs when individuals observe the actions of others. Individuals may mimic the behaviors of others and then internalize those behaviors. Once the individual internalizes those behaviors they are said to be a part of that person's personality.<ref name=\"Caspi and Roberts\" />\nIndividuals also receive feedback from other individuals or groups about their own personality. This is a driving force of change because the individual has social motivations to change his or her personality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It has also been shown that major positive and negative life events can predict changes in personality.<ref name=\"Jeronimus2014\"/><ref name=\"Jeronimus2013\"/> Some of the largest changes are observed in individuals with psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.
