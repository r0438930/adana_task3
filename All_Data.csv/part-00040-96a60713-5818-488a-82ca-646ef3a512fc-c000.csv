{{History of Afghanistan}}
'''''Padshah Sultan'' Shuja‘ Shah Abdali Durrani''' (also known as ''Shah Shuja‘'', ''Shoja‘ Shah'') (4 November 1785 – 5 April 1842) was ruler of the [[Durrani Empire]] from 1803 to 1809. He then ruled from 1839 until his death in 1842. Son of [[Timur Shah Durrani]], Shuja‘ Shah was of the [[Sadduzai]] line of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] group of [[Ethnic Pashtuns]]. He became the fifth [[list of heads of state of Afghanistan|Emir of Afghanistan]].<ref>[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] – [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067071/Shah-Shoja Shah Shoja]</ref>

== Career ==
=== King of Afghanistan ===
Shuja‘ Shah was the governor of [[Herat]] and Peshawar from 1798 to 1801. He proclaimed himself as [[King of Afghanistan]] in October 1801 (after the deposition of his brother [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]]), but only properly ascended to the throne on July 13, 1803. In Afghanistan, a blind man by tradition cannot be Emir, and so Shah Shuja‘'s step-brother Mahmud Shah had Zaman blinded, however not killed.{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=16}} After coming to power in 1803, Shuja‘ ended the [[blood feud]] with the powerful [[Barakzai]] family and also forgave them. To create an alliance with them, he married their \"sister\" Wafa Begum.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=23}}

Shuja‘ allied Afghanistan with the [[United Kingdom]] in 1809, as a means of defending against an invasion of Afghanistan and [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]] by France.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=7}} In 1809, a British diplomatic mission was sent to Afghanistan, which at the time was to the British a remote and mysterious part of Asia. According to [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], \"The King of Kabul [Shah Shuja] was a handsome man\". He also wrote \"of an olive complexion with a thick black beard ... his voice clear, his address princely.\" Shuja‘ wore the [[Koh-i-Noor]] (\"Mountain of Light\") diamond in one of his bracelets when Elphinstone visited him, but rather undiplomatically described Shuja as having a \"vulgar nose\".{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=6}} [[William Fraser (British India civil servant)|William Fraser]], who accompanied Elphinstone to meet Shah Shuja‘ was \"struck with the dignity of his appearance and the romantic Oriental awe.\"{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=20}} Fraser also judged him to be \"about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in}} tall\" and his skin colour was \"very fair, but dead...his beard was thick jet black and shortened a little by the obliquely upwards, but turned again at the corners ... The eyelashes and the edges of his eyelids were blackened with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|antimony]].\" He also described Shuja's voice as \"loud and sonorous\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=21}}

[[File:Order of the Durrani Empire Afghanistan received by Sir Thomas Willshire 1789 1862.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Order of the Durrani Empire]], founded by Shuja‘ Shah in 1839. It was awarded to a number of officers of the [[Bengal Army]]. [[Musée national de la Légion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie]].]]
In June 1809,{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=27}} he was overthrown by his predecessor [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]] and went into exile in [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]], where he was captured by Jahandad Khan Bamizai and imprisoned at [[Attock]] (1811–1812) and then taken to [[Kashmir]] (1812–1813) by Atta Muhammad Khan. When [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]'s [[vizier]] [[Fateh Khan (vizier)|Fateh Khan]] invaded Kashmir alongside [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army, he chose to leave with the [[Sikh]] army. He stayed in [[Lahore]] from 1813 to 1814. During his time in India, Shuja‘ was imprisoned and forced to give up the Timur Ruby, Koh-i-Noor and the sister diamond dray-i-nur diamond to Ranjit Singh.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=23}}He escaped from Ranjit's detention at the Mubarek Haveli Lahore for Ludhiana and the East India Company.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=25}}

From 1818 onward, Shuja‘ who liked to live in a lavish style with his wives and concubines had collected a pension from the East India Company, which thought he might prove useful one day.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} Shuja stayed first in Ludhiana where he was joined by Zeman Shah in 1821. The place where he stayed in Ludhiana was occupied by the Main Post Office near Mata Rani Chowk and inside it there used to be a white marble stone commemorating his stay there. {{sfn |Husain|2018|p=386}}

=== Exile ===
During his time in exile, Shuja‘ indulged his cruelty by removing the noses, ears, tongues, penises, and testicles of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him in the slightest.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When the American adventurer Dr. [[Josiah Harlan]] visited Shuja‘'s court in exile he noted that all of Shuja‘'s courtiers and slaves were missing some part of their bodies as all had in some way displeased their master at some point along the line, to whom they were all slavishly devoted to despite his abuse of them as Harlan noted that there was an \"earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king's service\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When Shuja‘ went out for picnic with his four wives and the wind blew down his tent, Shuja‘ flew into a rage and he had the man responsible for putting up his tent, Khwajah Mika-a slave from East Africa who had already had his ears chopped off-to be castrated on the spot as punishment for not erecting his tent more firmly, much to Harlan's horror.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Shuja‘'s grand vizier, Mullah Shakur had grown his hair long to cover up that both his ears had been chopped off while he spoke in the distinctive high-pitched voice of a eunuch; Harlan noted he was lucky as the rest of his body was still intact.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Despite or perhaps because he was mutilated, Shuja's grand vizier took a great deal of pleasure in mutilating others and was always inciting his master to have somebody mutilated.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Harlan noted all of the men around Shuja‘ were missing at least one part of their bodies, if not more, and all seemed extremely afraid of their master, who was apt to fly into a rage whenever he did not get his way with anything, and when he was angry, body parts tended to get severed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan commend on \"the grace and dignity of His Highness's demeanor\", observing the sense of power he projected, but also that \"years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=30}} Harlan, a man without much military experience and knowledge of [[Pashto]], offered to lead an invasion of Afghanistan to restore Shuja, an offer that led the former monarch to break \"into a poetical effusion in praise of Kabul\" and its gardens, its trees laden with fruits, and its music culminating with \"Kabul is called the Crown of the Air. I pray for the possession of those pleasures which my native country alone can afford\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} When Harlan pressed him on whatever he wanted to accept his offer or not, Shuja‘ agreed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} Harlan had a tailor sew up an American flag, which Harlan hoisted up in Ludhiana, and started to recruit mercenaries for the invasion of Afghanistan, suggesting that he was working for the U.S. government (which he was not).{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan ultimately grew disillusioned with Shuja, writing he did not view him as the \"legitimate monarch, the victim of treasonable practices\", but rather as \"a wayward tyrant, inflexible in moods, vindictive in his enmities, faithless in his attachments, unnatural in his affections. He remembered his misfortunes only to avenge them\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|pp=170–171}}

In 1833 he struck a deal with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab: He was allowed to march his troops through Punjab, and in return he would cede [[Peshawar]] to the Sikhs if they could manage to take it. In a concerted campaign the following year, Shuja‘ marched on Kandahar while the Sikhs, commanded by General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] attacked Peshawar. In July, Shuja‘ Shah was narrowly defeated at [[Kandahar]] by the Afghans under Dost Mohammad Khan and fled. The Sikhs on their part reclaimed Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Restoration of power ===
In 1838 he had gained the support of the British and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost Mohammad Khan. [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], believed that most Afghans would welcome the return of Shuja as their rightful ruler, but in fact by 1838, most people in Afghanistan could not remember him, and those that did remembered him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler whom they absolutely hated.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=112}} During the march on Kabul, the main British camp was attacked by a force of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]]s, of whom 50 were captured.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} When the prisoners were brought before Shuja, one of them used a knife he had hidden in his robes to stab to death one of Shuja's ministers, causing Shuja to fly into one of his rages and to order all 50 prisoners to be beheaded on the spot.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} The British historian Sir [[John William Kaye]] wrote the \"wanton barbarity\" of the mass execution as all 50 prisoners were beheaded strained the campaign, stating the \"shrill cry\" of the prisoners as they waited to be executed was the \"funeral wail\" of the \"unholy policy\" of attempting to restore Shuja.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} Shuja was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839,{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=515}} 30 years after his deposition, but did not remain in power when the British left. Upon being restored, Shuja announced that he considered his own people to be \"dogs\" who needed to be taught to be obedient to their master, and spent his time exacting bloody vengeance on those Afghans whom he felt had betrayed him, making him extremely unpopular with his people.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=121}} He shut himself away in the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul]], and on leaving it he was assassinated by Shuja ud-Daula, at the insistence of his uncle [[Oosman Khan]] on April 5, 1842{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=304-306}}{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=552}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=C.

→‎Distributional semantic modeling,safe,Jussi Karlgren,"'''Distributional semantics''' is a research area that develops and studies theories and methods for quantifying and categorizing semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The basic idea of distributional semantics can be summed up in the so-called [[Distributionalism|Distributional]] hypothesis: ''linguistic items with similar distributions have similar meanings.''

==Distributional hypothesis==
The '''distributional hypothesis''' in [[linguistics]] is derived from the [[semantic theory]] of language usage, i.e. words that are used and occur in the same [[context (language use)|context]]s tend to purport similar meanings.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1954}}</ref> 

The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was popularized by [[J. R. Firth|Firth]] in the 1950s.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1957}}</ref>

The distributional hypothesis is the basis for [[statistical semantics]]. Although the Distributional Hypothesis originated in linguistics,<ref>{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2008}}</ref> it is now receiving attention in [[cognitive science]] especially regarding the context of word use.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Ramscar|2001}}</ref>

In recent years, the distributional hypothesis has provided the basis for the theory of [[similarity-based generalization]] in language learning: the idea that children can figure out how to use words they've rarely encountered before by generalizing about their use from distributions of similar words.<ref>{{harvnb| Gleitman|2002}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb| Yarlett|2008}}</ref>

The distributional hypothesis suggests that the more semantically similar two words are, the more distributionally similar they will be in turn, and thus the more that they will tend to occur in similar linguistic contexts.

Whether or not this suggestion holds has significant implications for both the [[data-sparsity]] problem in computational modeling,<ref>Wishart, Ryder, and Prokopis Prokopidis. “Topic Modelling Experiments on Hellenistic Corpora.” In ''Proceedings of the Workshop on Corpora in the Digital Humanities 17'', 39–47. Bloomington, IN: CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2017, Online: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bd71/ab40960e481006117bafd0ae952d3e8d1f66.pdf.</ref> and for the question of how children are able to learn language so rapidly given relatively impoverished input (this is also known as the problem of the [[poverty of the stimulus]]).

==Distributional semantic modeling in vector spaces==
Distributional semantics favor the use of linear algebra as computational tool and representational framework. The basic approach is to collect distributional information in high-dimensional vectors, and to define distributional/semantic similarity in terms of vector similarity.<ref>{{harvnb|Rieger |1991 }}</ref> Different kinds of similarities can be extracted depending on which type of distributional information is used to collect the vectors: '''topical''' similarities can be extracted by populating the vectors with information on which text regions the linguistic items occur in; '''paradigmatic''' similarities can be extracted by populating the vectors with information on which other linguistic items the items co-occur with. Note that the latter type of vectors can also be used to extract '''syntagmatic''' similarities by looking at the individual vector components.

The basic idea of a correlation between distributional and semantic similarity can be operationalized in many different ways. There is a rich variety of computational models implementing distributional semantics, including [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA),<ref>{{harvnb|Deerwester|Dumais|Furnas|Landauer|1990}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landauer|first=Thomas K.|last2=Dumais|first2=Susan T.|date=1997|title=A solution to Plato's problem: The latent semantic analysis theory of acquisition, induction, and representation of knowledge.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=104|issue=2|pages=211–240|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.104.2.211|issn=1939-1471}}</ref> [[Hyperspace Analogue to Language]] (HAL), syntax- or dependency-based models,<ref>{{harvnb|Padó|Lapata|2007}}</ref> [[random indexing]], [[semantic folding]]<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=1511.08855|title=Semantic Folding Theory And its Application in Semantic Fingerprinting|last=De Sousa Webber|first=Francisco|date=2015|publisher=|access-date=|class=cs.AI}}</ref> and various variants of the [[topic model]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Michael I.|last2=Ng|first2=Andrew Y.|last3=Blei|first3=David M.|date=2003|title=Latent Dirichlet Allocation|url=http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v3/blei03a.html|journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research|volume=3|issue=Jan|pages=993–1022|issn=1533-7928}}</ref>

Distributional semantic models differ primarily with respect to the following parameters:

* Context type (text regions vs. linguistic items)
* Context window (size, extension, etc.)
* Frequency weighting (e.g. [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]], [[pointwise mutual information]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Church|first=Kenneth Ward|last2=Hanks|first2=Patrick|date=1989|title=Word association norms, mutual information, and lexicography|journal=Proceedings of the 27th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics -|pages=76–83|location=Morristown, NJ, USA|publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics|doi=10.3115/981623.981633}}</ref> etc.)
* Dimension reduction (e.g. [[random indexing]], [[singular value decomposition]], etc.)
* [[Similarity measure]] (e.g. [[cosine similarity]], [[Minkowski distance]], etc.)

Distributional semantic models that use linguistic items as context have also been referred to as '''word space, or vector space models'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Schütze|1993}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2006}}</ref>

==Beyond Lexical Semantics==
While distributional semantics typically has been applied to lexical items -- words and multi-word terms -- with considerable success, not least due to its applicability as an input layer for neurally inspired deep learning models, lexical semantics, i.e. the meaning of words, will only carry part of the semantics of an entire utterance. The meaning of a clause, e.g. ''\"Tigers love rabbits.\"'', can only partially be understood from examining the meaning of the three lexical items it consists of. Distributional semantics can straightforwardly be extended to cover larger linguistic item such as constructions, with and without non-instantiated items, but some of the base assumptions of the model need to be adjusted somewhat. [[Construction grammar]] and its formulation of the lexical-syntactic continuum offers one approach for including more elaborate constructions in a distributional semantic model and some experiments have been implemented using the Random Indexing approach <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Karlgren|first1=Jussi|author-link1=Jussi Karlgren|last2=Kanerva|first2=Pentti|date=2019|title=High-dimensional distributed semantic spaces for utterances|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering/article/highdimensional-distributed-semantic-spaces-for-utterances/38A75548413F9A430D1B2B35CE34CE43 |journal= Natural Language Engineering|volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=503-517 |doi=10.1017/S1351324919000226 |access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. 

[[Compositional distributional semantics|Compositional distributional semantic]] models extend distributional semantic models by explicit semantic functions that use syntactically based rules to combine the semantics of participating lexical units into a ''compositional model'' to characterize the semantics of entire phrases or sentences. Different approaches to composition have been explored -- including neural models -- and are under discussion at established workshops such as [[SemEval]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task1/|title=SemEval-2014, Task 1}}</ref>

The '''Fire HDX''', formerly named '''Kindle Fire HDX''', is the high-end model in [[Amazon Fire]] line of [[tablet computer]]s. It was announced on September 25, 2013 and is available in two models, 7&nbsp;inch and 8.9&nbsp;inch. The 7&nbsp;inch WiFi model was released on October 18, 2013 and the 8.9&nbsp;inch WiFi model was released on November 7, 2013 in the United States.

In September 2014, Amazon released the second generation of the Fire HDX 8.9 model that has a faster processor and a more powerful graphics processing unit. In addition, the name \"Kindle\" was removed from all of the Fire tablets' names.

== Design ==

=== Hardware ===
Both the 7&nbsp;inch and 8.9&nbsp;inch [[LCD]] models contain a [[Qualcomm]] [[Snapdragon 800]] processor that has an [[Adreno]] 330 GPU.  The models also have a 1.2&nbsp;megapixel front camera that shoots [[720p]] HD video.  The 8.9&nbsp;inch model has an 8&nbsp;megapixel rear camera that shoots HD [[1080p]] video. The exterior surface has angular, raised plastic edges with the power and volume buttons located on the backside. The Fire HDX features Dolby Digital Plus audio engine powering the two attached speakers. A normal user will get about 12 hours of battery life from a full charge.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kingsley |first=Adrian |url=http://www.zdnet.com/five-ways-the-ipad-is-lagging-behind-the-kindle-fire-hdx_p4-7000025630/#photo |title=Five ways the iPad is lagging behind the Kindle Fire HDX &#124; Page 4 |publisher=ZDNet |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}</ref>

The Fire HDX 8.9\" refresh in 2014 uses a Qualcomm [[Snapdragon 805]] processor with an Adreno 420 GPU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgj.com/story/life/2014/09/24/2014-kindle-fire-hdx-89-preview-technobubble/16140103/|title=Technobubble: Sizing up Amazon's new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9|author=Jason Hidalgo, RGJ|date=24 September 2014}}</ref> The sound system features [[Dolby Atmos]] speaker technology and the Wi-Fi version weighs 13.2 ounces (375 grams).

=== Software ===
Both models use [[Fire OS]] 3 which is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 4.2.2. It features \"Mayday\", a button for free tech support available any time, \"[[Amazon Silk|Silk]]\", a cloud-accelerated browser, the [[Amazon Appstore]] for games and apps and Amazon.com services for media content purchases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wilson Rothman |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/amazons-kindle-fire-hdx-tablets-pose-real-threat-ipad-dominance-8C11252610 |title=Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX tablets pose real threat to iPad dominance |publisher=NBC News.com |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref> The tablets can send video content to a supported TV, game console or through a device like a Wireless Display HDMI adapter wirelessly using \"Second Screen\", but cannot send content via a HDMI cable like its predecessor, the [[Kindle Fire HD]].

The 2014 refresh uses Fire OS 4 \"Sangria\", which features profiles so each user on the tablet can have their own settings and apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidguys.com/2014/09/17/whats-new-amazons-fire-os-4-0-sangria/|title=What's new with Amazon's Fire OS 4.0 \"Sangria\"?|work=AndroidGuys}}</ref>

==== Mayday feature ====
Sascha Segan of PC Magazine mentioned: \"Press the Mayday button, and within 15 seconds, a live Amazon operator appears in a video chat window on your screen to answer all of your Kindle Fire questions. He or she will even tell you what apps to download. I've never seen anything else like it on a tablet.\"<ref name=\"pcmag\">{{cite web | title=Hands On With the New Kindle Fires | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2424815,00.asp|publisher=PC Magazine | accessdate=5 June 2014 | author=Sascha Segan}}</ref> In his review of the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" he called the Mayday remote video support feature as \"revolutionary\" and \"Amazon's most exciting feature\".<ref name=\"pcmag2\">{{cite web | title=Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7\" (Wi-Fi) |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2425068,00.asp| publisher=PC Magazine | accessdate=5 June 2014 | author=Sascha Segan}}</ref>

==== Fire OS UI ====
The Fire HDX's UI has a \"Carousel\" which contains the most recent apps used and ones that have been updated or purchased recently.<ref name=\"Using the Carousel, Favorites, and Content Libraries\">{{cite web|title=\"Using the Carousel, Favorites, and Content Libraries\"Amazon.com Help|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_201008200_content?nodeId=201008200#content|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>  The Carousel also holds documents, videos, music, and books. The  Fire HDX also has a favorites tab in which the user can access the users apps from any other application.

== Reception ==
[[Engadget]] gave the Fire HDX an 85 out of 100, saying that it may be the most compelling case for Amazon's tablet [[Closed platform|ecosystem]]. While advanced users may be turned off by the limited app selection, the display's gorgeous color accuracy may make the tablet a good buy for everyone else, especially Amazon Prime members.<ref>{{cite web|author=Engadget |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/12/31/2013-engadget-reviews/ |title=The year in reviews: 2013's best and worst gadgets scored and scrutinized |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>

[[PC Magazine]] gave the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7\" (Wi-Fi) edition 4 out of 5 and rated \"Excellent\" while following pros were noted: \"Sharp screen. Fast processor. Extremely easy to use. Amazing live tech support.\"<ref name=\"pcmag\"/>

The Fire HDX's screen has high color accuracy and high pixel density at 339&nbsp;PPI, and as of early 2013 was one of the highest of tablet devices commercially available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.displaymate.com/Tablet_ShootOut_3.htm |title=Flagship Tablet Display Technology Shoot-Out |publisher=Displaymate.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}</ref>  However, [[CNET]] pointed out that no [[Google Play]] access means limited app selection compared to other Android tablets and some users may be bothered by an additional $15 to remove ads on the lock screen, while ads on the home screen can be removed with a system setting.<ref>{{cite web|last=Franklin |first=Eric |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/amazon-kindle-fire-hdx-7-inch/ |title=Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7 Review - Watch CNET's Video Review |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}</ref>

== Reception ==
[[Engadget]] gave the Fire HDX an 85 out of 100, saying that it may be the most compelling case for Amazon's tablet [[Closed platform|ecosystem]]. While advanced users may be turned off by the limited app selection, the display's gorgeous color accuracy may make the tablet a good buy for everyone else, especially Amazon Prime members.<ref>{{cite web|author=Engadget |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/12/31/2013-engadget-reviews/ |title=The year in reviews: 2013's best and worst gadgets scored and scrutinized |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>

'''David Eugene Henry Pryce-Jones''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSL}} (born 15 February 1936) is a British [[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservative]] author and commentator.

==Early life==
Pryce-Jones was born on 15 February 1936,<ref>Ellen Doon. [http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.prycejon \"Alan Pryce-Jones Papers\"], Yale, New Haven, Connecticut. May 2003. Retrieved 28 February 2008.</ref> in [[Vienna]], Austria.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

He is the son of writer [[Alan Payan Pryce-Jones]] (1908–2000) by his first wife (married 1934), Therese \"Poppy\" Fould-Springer (1908–1953) of the [[Fould family]].<ref>The year of death is from the Pryce Jones papers at Yale and other sources.

The widow and the bereaved lover then married; he lived until 1953. The story, well known to their circle, was not revealed publicly until her British son-in-law Alan Pryce Jones wrote about it in his memoirs.

His parents married in 1934 in Vienna, where Pryce-Jones was born.

''Ibid''</ref> He acknowledged his uncle-by-marriage's efforts in saving his own life when Propper de Callejón retired from Spanish diplomatic service.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Pryce-Jones is a first cousin of Elena Propper de Callejón, wife of late banker [[Raymond Bonham Carter]] and mother of actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]]. Another cousin is [[Nathaniel Robert de Rothschild|Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild]], only son of the better known [[Élie de Rothschild|Baron Élie de Rothschild]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and earned a degree in history at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Career==
Pryce-Jones did his [[National Service]] in the [[Coldstream Guards]], in which he was commissioned in 1955, promoted [[lieutenant]] in 1956, and served in the [[British Army of the Rhine]]. In 1956, Pryce-Jones lectured the men under his command about the necessity of the [[Suez War]], but admits that he did not believe what he was saying.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\">Gellner, Ernest \"Up From Imperialism\" pp. 34–36 from ''The New Republic,'' Volume 200, Number 21, Issue #3, 879, 22 May 1989 p. 34</ref> At the time, he believed that the Islamic world would soon progress after decolonization, and was disappointed when this did not happen.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\"/> He has worked as a [[journalist]] and author. He was literary editor at the ''[[Financial Times]]'' 1959–61, and ''[[The Spectator]]'' from 1961 to 1963.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Pryce-Jones is a senior editor at ''[[National Review]]'' magazine. He also contributes to ''[[The New Criterion]]'' and ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', and for [[Benador Associates]]. He often writes about the contemporary events and the history of the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and intelligence matters.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In his 1989 book ''The Closed Circle'', Pryce-Jones examined what he considered to be the reasons for the backward state of the Arab world.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\"/> A review described the book as more of an \"indictment\" than an examination of the Arab world.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\"/> In Pryce-Jones's opinion, the root cause of Arab backwardness is the tribal nature of Arab political life, which reduces all politics to war of rival families struggling mercilessly for power.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\"/> As such, Pryce-Jones's view power in Arab politics consists of a network of client–patron relations between powerful and less powerful families and clans.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gellner, Ernest \"Up From Imperialism\" pp. 34–36 from ''The New Republic,'' Volume 200, Number 21, Issue #3, 879, 22 May 1989 p. 35</ref> Pryce-Jones considers as an additional retarding factor in Arab society the influence of [[Islam]], which hinders efforts to build a Western style society where the family and clan are not the dominant political unit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pryce-Jones argues that Islamic fundamentalism is a means of attempting to mobilize the masses behind the dominant clans.<ref>Gellner, Ernest \"Up From Imperialism\" pp. 34–36 from ''The New Republic'', Volume 200, Number 21, Issue #3, 879, 22 May 1989 p. 36</ref> In his book, ''[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/jews-arabs-and-french-diplomacy-a-special-report Betrayal: France, the Arabs, and the Jews]'', he has accused the French government of being [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and pro-Arab, and of consistently siding against [[Israel]] in the hope of winning the favour of the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Pryce-Jones wrote a biography, ''Evelyn Waugh and His World''. It was rather notorious for digging up conflict among the married Mitford siblings, with Pamela accusing Jessica of revealing private correspondence concerning their sister the Duchess of Devonshire. He has also written about Unity Mitford for ''[[The Spectator]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Personal life==

He married Clarissa Caccia, daughter of diplomat [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia]], in 1959.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} They have three surviving children, (one deceased, Sonia: 1970–1972), Jessica, Candida and Adam, and live in London.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Jessica is married to the BBC journalist [[David Shukman]].<ref>{{cite document |title=Shukman, David Roderick |work=Who's Who |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.U2000161 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How to be a good (cancer) patient |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-to-be-a-good-cancer-patient-jq0xbwlc7 |accessdate=10 February 2020 |work=The Times |date=30 December 2017}}</ref>

'''David Eugene Henry Pryce-Jones''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSL}} (born 15 February 1936) is a British [[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservative]] author and commentator.

==Early life==
Pryce-Jones was born on 15 February 1936,<ref>Ellen Doon. [http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.prycejon \"Alan Pryce-Jones Papers\"], Yale, New Haven, Connecticut. May 2003. Retrieved 28 February 2008.</ref> in [[Vienna]], Austria.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

He is the son of writer [[Alan Payan Pryce-Jones]] (1908–2000) by his first wife (married 1934), Therese \"Poppy\" Fould-Springer (1908–1953) of the [[Fould family]].<ref>The year of death is from the Pryce Jones papers at Yale and other sources.

The widow and the bereaved lover then married; he lived until 1953. The story, well known to their circle, was not revealed publicly until her British son-in-law Alan Pryce Jones wrote about it in his memoirs.

His parents married in 1934 in Vienna, where Pryce-Jones was born. In 1940, a four-year-old Pryce-Jones was stranded with his nanny in [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] and was rescued from the invading German army by his mother's brother-in-law [[Eduardo Propper de Callejón]].<ref>Jenni Frazer. ''Ibid''</ref> He acknowledged his uncle-by-marriage's efforts in saving his own life when Propper de Callejón retired from Spanish diplomatic service.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Pryce-Jones is a first cousin of Elena Propper de Callejón, wife of late banker [[Raymond Bonham Carter]] and mother of actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]]. Another cousin is [[Nathaniel Robert de Rothschild|Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild]], only son of the better known [[Élie de Rothschild|Baron Élie de Rothschild]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and earned a degree in history at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Career==
Pryce-Jones did his [[National Service]] in the [[Coldstream Guards]], in which he was commissioned in 1955, promoted [[lieutenant]] in 1956, and served in the [[British Army of the Rhine]]. In 1956, Pryce-Jones lectured the men under his command about the necessity of the [[Suez War]], but admits that he did not believe what he was saying.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\">Gellner, Ernest \"Up From Imperialism\" pp. 34–36 from ''The New Republic,'' Volume 200, Number 21, Issue #3, 879, 22 May 1989 p. 34</ref> At the time, he believed that the Islamic world would soon progress after decolonization, and was disappointed when this did not happen.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\"/> He has worked as a [[journalist]] and author. He was literary editor at the ''[[Financial Times]]'' 1959–61, and ''[[The Spectator]]'' from 1961 to 1963.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Pryce-Jones is a senior editor at ''[[National Review]]'' magazine. He also contributes to ''[[The New Criterion]]'' and ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', and for [[Benador Associates]]. He often writes about the contemporary events and the history of the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and intelligence matters.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In his 1989 book ''The Closed Circle'', Pryce-Jones examined what he considered to be the reasons for the backward state of the Arab world.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\"/> A review described the book as more of an \"indictment\" than an examination of the Arab world.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\"/> In Pryce-Jones's opinion, the root cause of Arab backwardness is the tribal nature of Arab political life, which reduces all politics to war of rival families struggling mercilessly for power.<ref name=\"Gellner pages 34-36\"/> As such, Pryce-Jones's view power in Arab politics consists of a network of client–patron relations between powerful and less powerful families and clans.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gellner, Ernest \"Up From Imperialism\" pp. 34–36 from ''The New Republic,'' Volume 200, Number 21, Issue #3, 879, 22 May 1989 p. 35</ref> Pryce-Jones considers as an additional retarding factor in Arab society the influence of [[Islam]], which hinders efforts to build a Western style society where the family and clan are not the dominant political unit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pryce-Jones argues that Islamic fundamentalism is a means of attempting to mobilize the masses behind the dominant clans.<ref>Gellner, Ernest \"Up From Imperialism\" pp. 34–36 from ''The New Republic'', Volume 200, Number 21, Issue #3, 879, 22 May 1989 p. 36</ref> In his book, ''[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/jews-arabs-and-french-diplomacy-a-special-report Betrayal: France, the Arabs, and the Jews]'', he has accused the French government of being [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and pro-Arab, and of consistently siding against [[Israel]] in the hope of winning the favour of the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Pryce-Jones wrote a biography, ''Evelyn Waugh and His World''. It was rather notorious for digging up conflict among the married Mitford siblings, with Pamela accusing Jessica of revealing private correspondence concerning their sister the Duchess of Devonshire. He has also written about Unity Mitford for ''[[The Spectator]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Personal life==

He married Clarissa Caccia, daughter of diplomat [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia]], in 1959.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} They have three surviving children, (one deceased, Sonia: 1970–1972), Jessica, Candida and Adam, and live in London.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Jessica is married to the BBC journalist [[David Shukman]].<ref>{{cite document |title=Shukman, David Roderick |work=Who's Who |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.U2000161 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How to be a good (cancer) patient |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-to-be-a-good-cancer-patient-jq0xbwlc7 |accessdate=10 February 2020 |work=The Times |date=30 December 2017}}</ref>

The ''' National Gridiron League''' ('''NGL''') is a professional [[gridiron football]] league. Prior to the postponed 2019 season, the league logo used was a near copy of the former [[United Football League (2009–2012)|United Football League]], while many of the team names and logos are also copies of former football teams. League chairman McClendon said that those trademarks had expired and it makes good business sense to recycle them in an attempt to capture the already existing fan-bases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/roanoke/new-roanoke-arena-football-league-tells-city-leaders-league-is-still-on-track |title=New Roanoke arena football league tells city leaders league is still on track |work=[[WSLS-TV]] |date=March 22, 2019}}</ref>

The ''' National Gridiron League''' ('''NGL''') is a proposed [[gridiron football]] league. Prior to the postponed 2019 season, the league logo used was a near copy of the former [[United Football League (2009–2012)|United Football League]], while many of the team names and logos are also copies of former football teams. League chairman McClendon said that those trademarks had expired and it makes good business sense to recycle them in an attempt to capture the already existing fan-bases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/roanoke/new-roanoke-arena-football-league-tells-city-leaders-league-is-still-on-track |title=New Roanoke arena football league tells city leaders league is still on track |work=[[WSLS-TV]] |date=March 22, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
Initially the league announced that it had planned to start play as an [[Indoor American football|indoor football]] league in spring 2019, with 12 teams aligned in two divisions<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgridiron.com/about|title=About Us|work=National Gridiron League|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref> starting on March 30, 2019, and conclude with the inaugural Gridiron Bowl game on August 10, 2019, in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgridiron.com/events|title=Events |work=National Gridiron League|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> However, the league pushed back the announced start of the inaugural season to May 2019 amid reports the league has not had finalized leases for many of its teams.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tristatehomepage.com/sports/indiana-firebirds-to-play-shorter-schedule-than-originally-planned/1844618279 |title=Indiana Firebirds to play shorter schedule than originally planned |website=TristateHomepage.com |date=March 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/roanoke/new-indoor-football-league-with-roanoke-based-team-delayed-questioned |title=Will arena football actually come to Roanoke? |work=[[WSLS-TV]] |date=March 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.citizensvoice.com/sports/arena-football-could-return-to-region-1.2452001 |title=Arena football could return to region |work=[[The Citizens' Voice]] |date=March 2, 2019}}</ref> 

By April 2, team coaches informed the players the season was canceled as the league was not going to be able to honor their original contracts and that none of the team staff or coaches had ever been paid.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wane.com/sports/letter-blue-bombers-inaugural-season-canceled/1895573199 |title=Letter: Blue Bombers inaugural season canceled |work=[[WANE-TV]] |date=April 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fortwaynesnbc.com/news/top-stories/2019/04/03/breaking-blue-bombers-coaches-not-paid-a-cent-amidst-potential-folding-of-ngl/ |title=Blue Bombers coaches not paid a cent, amidst potential folding of NGL |work=[[WPTA]] |date=April 3, 2019}}</ref> League chairman Joe McClendon announced the following day that league had postponed its inaugural season to 2020 citing organizational changes in personnel and the suspension of operations of the [[Alliance of American Football]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://katv.com/news/local/arkansas-twisters-returning-in-2020-season |title=Arkansas Twisters return pushed back to 2020 |work=[[KATV]] |date=April 3, 2019}}</ref> Its personnel later sued the league over their claims of non-payment for their work.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.courierpress.com/story/sports/2019/06/25/former-indiana-firebirds-president-jim-riggs-sues-national-gridiron-league/1559840001/ |title=Former Indiana Firebirds president Jim Riggs sues National Gridiron League in federal court |website=[[Evansville Courier & Press]] |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

==Teams==
===Announced 2019 teams===
<small>As of February 21, 2019. Cities in ''italics'' were locations identified by the league website, but no leases for an arena were confirmed to have been signed in the listed location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journalgazette.net/sports/20181017/indoor-football-team-still-hasnt-returned-lease-agreement |title=Indoor football team still hasn't returned lease agreement |work=[[The Journal Gazette]] |date=October 17, 2018}}</ref> Since the postponement, all arena references on the league website have been removed and most coaches have either been changed or moved on to other leagues.</small>

'''The \"War over Water\"''', also  the '''Battle over Water''', refers to a series of confrontations between [[Israel]] and its [[Arab League|Arab]] neighbors from November 1964 to May 1967 over [[Water politics in the Jordan River basin|control of  water sources]] in the [[Jordan River]] [[drainage basin]].

==History==
===Early tensions: 1949–64===

The [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] which followed the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], created three [[demilitarized zone]]s on the Israel-Syria border. The southernmost, and also the largest, stretched from the south-eastern part of the [[Sea of Galilee]] eastwards to the [[Yarmuk River]] where the borders of Israel, Jordan and Syria converge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowi|first=Miriam R.|title=Water and power: the politics of a scarce resource in the Jordan River basin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/?id=314KWutTkFkC&printsec=frontcover | isbn=978-0-521-55836-5}}</ref> The issue of water sharing from the Jordan–Yarmuk system turned out to be a major problem between Israel, Syria and Jordan.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seliktar|first=Ofira|date=June 2005|title=Turning Water into Fire: the Jordan River as the Hidden Factor in The Six Day War|journal=The Middle East Review of International Affairs|volume=9|issue=2|url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2005/issue2/jv9no2a4.html}}</ref>

Small scale water-related skirmishes had occurred following the 1949 agreements. In July 1953, Israel began construction of an intake for its National Water Carrier at the Daughters of Jacob Jordan Bridge in the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee. Syrian artillery units opened fire on the construction site.  The [[United Nations]] security council majority (excepting the USSR) voted for the resumption of work by Israel. The Israelis then moved the intake to an economically inferior site at the Sea of Galilee.<ref  name=\"IwaoH1998p129\"/>

In 1955 the [[Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan]] (Johnston Plan) was accepted by the technical committees of both Israel and the Arab League, but the Arab League Council decided not to ratify the plan on 11 October 1955. According to most observers, including Johnston himself, the Arab non-adoption of the plan was not total rejection. While they failed to approve it politically, they nevertheless seemed determined to adhere to the technical details of the agreement. Moreover, it continued to be taken seriously by Arab leaders.<ref  name=\"Gat2003p101\"/> Though the Unified Plan failed to be ratified, both [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]] undertook to operate within their allocation limits.

===Main phase: 1964–67===
[[Israel]] completed its [[National Water Carrier]] project, which siphoned water from the [[Sea of Galilee]] in 1964. The initial diversion capacity of the National Water Carrier, without supplementary booster pumps, was 320 million m<sup>3</sup>, well within the limits of the Johnston Plan.[[Image:National Water Carrier of Israel-en.svg|thumb|200px]] 
Nevertheless, the Arab states were not prepared to coexist with a project which seemed likely to make a major contribution to [[Israel]]'s economic growth. In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo and decided:
<blockquote> The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.<ref name=\"Shlaim2000p229\"/> </blockquote>

The Arab states decided to deprive Israel of 35% of the National Water Carrier capacity, by a [[Headwater Diversion Plan (Jordan River)|diversion of the Jordan River headwaters]] (both the Hasbani and the Banias) to the [[Yarmouk River]]. The scheme was only marginally feasible, as it was technically difficult and expensive.

A major escalation took place in 1964 when Israel declared it would regard the Diversion Project as an infringement on its sovereign rights.<ref name=\"Shapland1997p13\">{{cite book|author=Greg Shapland|title=Rivers of Discord: International Water Disputes in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDKJV-916UoC&pg=PR7|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=1997|publisher=C.

'''The \"War over Water\"''', also  the '''Battle over Water''', refers to a series of confrontations between [[Israel]] and its [[Arab League|Arab]] neighbors from November 1964 to May 1967 over [[Water politics in the Jordan River basin|control of  water sources]] in the [[Jordan River]] [[drainage basin]].

== Taxonomy ==

Primulaceae is one of 22 families in the order Ericales. Formerly, this order included some closely related families: [[Myrsinaceae]] (myrsine family), [[Theophrastaceae]] and Maesaceae (which contained only one genus, ''[[Maesa]]''). However, morphological and molecular data strongly support their membership in the primuloid [[clade]], which corresponds to the [[Primulales]] order in the 1981 [[Cronquist system]]. The four families have been [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|re-circumscribed]] into a more broadly defined family referred to as Primulaceae [[sensu|s. l.]] The two uniting features of this clade are a free central placenta and one stamen opposite each of the corolla lobes.<ref name=APGIV/><ref name=Soltis2018>{{cite book |last1=Soltis |first1=Douglas |last2=Soltis |first2=Pamela |last3=Endress |first3=Peter |last4=Chase |first4=Mark W. |last5=Manchester |first5=Steven |last6=Judd |first6=Walter |last7=Majure |first7=Lucas |last8=Mavrodiev |first8=Evgeny |title=Phylogeny and evolution of the angiosperms |date=2018 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226441757 |pages=266, 269–271 |edition=Revised and updated}}</ref><ref name=APGIII2009>{{cite journal |last1=The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |date=October 2009 |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105–121 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x }}</ref>

=== Stems ===
Primulaceae are mostly [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], having no woody stem, except that some [[Cushion plant|form cushions]] (spreading mats a few inches high) and their stems are stiffened by [[lignin]]. The stems can grow upright (''erect'') or spread out horizontally and then turn upright (''decumbent'').<ref name=Anderberg2013>{{cite book |first1=A. A. |last1=Anderberg |chapter=Primulaceae |editor-last1=Kubitzki |editor-first1=Klaus |title=Flowering plants - Dicotyledons : Celastrales, oxalidales, rosales, cornales, ericales |series=The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants |volume=6 |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9783662072578 |pages=313–319}}</ref><ref name=Xu>{{cite book |last1=Xu |first1=Zhenghao |last2=Chang |first2=Le |chapter=2. Primulaceae |title=Identification and control of common weeds. Volume 3 |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789811054037 |pages=51–82}}</ref>

=== Leaves ===
[[Leaf|Leaves]] are ''simple'', being directly attached to the stem by a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (stalk), but unlike the leaves of most flowering plants they have no [[stipule]]s. The petiole is short or the leaf tapers gradually towards the base. [[Phyllotaxis|Leaf arrangement]] is typically alternate but some are opposite or whorled, and there is generally a rosette at the base of the stem. The edges are toothed ([[Glossary of leaf morphology#Edge|''dentate'']]) or sawtoothed. New leaves in the bud are usually ''involute'' (rolled towards the upper surface) or ''conduplicate'' (folded upwards), but a few species roll downwards.<ref name=Anderberg2013/><ref name=Xu/>

=== Flowers ===
Each flower is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Flowering plants|bisexual]], having both [[stamen]]s and [[Gynoecium#Carpels|carpels]]. They have [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|radial symmetry]];  the [[petal]]s can be separate or partially or fully [[Connation|fused together]] to form a tube-shaped [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]] that opens up at the mouth to form a bell-like shape (as in item 8 in the figure) or a flat-faced flower. In most of the families of Ericales, stamens alternate with lobes, but in Primulaceae there is a stamen opposite each petal.<ref name=Anderberg2002/>

The [[sepal|calyx]] has 4 to 9 lobes and persists after flowering.<ref name=Xu/> They are grouped in unbranched, [[Inflorescence#Indeterminate or racemose|indeterminate clusters]] such as racemes, spikes, corymbs or umbels.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>

=== Reproductive anatomy ===
The fruit of Primulaceae begins as an [[ovary]] and inside it are the future seeds ([[ovule]]s). These are attached to a central axis without any partitions between them (an arrangement called ''[[Placentation#In plants|free central placentation]]''; see item 7 in the figure), and they are ''bitegmic'' (having a double protective layer around each ovule). Unlike in most other families of Ericales, both layers form the opening at the top (the ''micropyle'').<ref name=Anderberg2002/>

=== Seeds and fruit ===
As seeds develop, an [[endosperm]] grows around the embryo through free division of nuclei without forming walls (''nuclear endosperm formation''). The embryo forms a pair of short, narrow [[cotyledon]]s (item 10 in the figure).<ref name=Anderberg2013/> Usually multiple seeds are in a [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] that is carried on a straight stalk ([[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] or [[Scape (botany)|scape]]). After it matures, it [[Dehiscence (botany)|splits apart]], releasing the seeds ballistically.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>

Legend: (A) the whole plant; (2) and (3) vertical cross-sections of the flower; (4) stamen; (5) horizontal cross-section of flower showing the calyx around the flower crown and stigma; (6) the stigma; (7) cross section through the ovary; (8) calyx; (9) seed; (10) cross section of seed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomé |first1=Otto Wilhelm |title=Flora von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz |date=1903 |publisher=Gera, Zezschwitz |pages=[https://archive.org/details/floravondeutschl04thom/page/23 23], plate 472 |url=https://archive.org/details/floravondeutschl04thom |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>]]

=== Stems ===
Primulaceae are mostly [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], having no woody stem, except that some [[Cushion plant|form cushions]] (spreading mats a few inches high) and their stems are stiffened by [[lignin]]. The stems can grow upright (''erect'') or spread out horizontally and then turn upright (''decumbent'').<ref name=Anderberg2013>{{cite book |first1=A. A. |last1=Anderberg |chapter=Primulaceae |editor-last1=Kubitzki |editor-first1=Klaus |title=Flowering plants - Dicotyledons : Celastrales, oxalidales, rosales, cornales, ericales |series=The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants |volume=6 |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9783662072578 |pages=313–319}}</ref><ref name=Xu>{{cite book |last1=Xu |first1=Zhenghao |last2=Chang |first2=Le |chapter=2. Primulaceae |title=Identification and control of common weeds. Volume 3 |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789811054037 |pages=51–82}}</ref>

=== Leaves ===
[[Leaf|Leaves]] are ''simple'', being directly attached to the stem by a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (stalk), but unlike the leaves of most flowering plants they have no [[stipule]]s. The petiole is short or the leaf tapers gradually towards the base. [[Phyllotaxis|Leaf arrangement]] is typically alternate but some are opposite or whorled, and there is generally a rosette at the base of the stem. The edges are toothed ([[Glossary of leaf morphology#Edge|''dentate'']]) or sawtoothed. New leaves in the bud are usually ''involute'' (rolled towards the upper surface) or ''conduplicate'' (folded upwards), but a few species roll downwards.<ref name=Anderberg2013/><ref name=Xu/>

=== Flowers ===
Each flower is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Flowering plants|bisexual]], having both [[stamen]]s and [[Gynoecium#Carpels|carpels]]. They have [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|radial symmetry]];  the [[petal]]s can be separate or partially or fully [[Connation|fused together]] to form a tube-shaped [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]] that opens up at the mouth to form a bell-like shape (as in item 8 in the figure) or a flat-faced flower. In most of the families of Ericales, stamens alternate with lobes, but in Primulaceae there is a stamen opposite each petal.<ref name=Anderberg2002/>

The [[sepal|calyx]] has 4 to 9 lobes and persists after flowering.<ref name=Xu/> They are grouped in unbranched, [[Inflorescence#Indeterminate or racemose|indeterminate clusters]] such as racemes, spikes, corymbs or umbels.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>

=== Reproductive anatomy ===
The fruit of Primulaceae begins as an [[ovary]] and inside it are the future seeds ([[ovule]]s). These are attached to a central axis without any partitions between them (an arrangement called ''[[Placentation#In plants|free central placentation]]''; see item 7 in the figure), and they are ''bitegmic'' (having a double protective layer around each ovule). Unlike in most other families of Ericales, both layers form the opening at the top (the ''micropyle'').<ref name=Anderberg2002/>

=== Seeds and fruit ===
As seeds develop, an [[endosperm]] grows around the embryo through free division of nuclei without forming walls (''nuclear endosperm formation''). The embryo forms a pair of short, narrow [[cotyledon]]s (item 10 in the figure).<ref name=Anderberg2013/> Usually multiple seeds are in a [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] that is carried on a straight stalk ([[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] or [[Scape (botany)|scape]]). After it matures, it [[Dehiscence (botany)|splits apart]], releasing the seeds ballistically.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>

{{History of Afghanistan}}
'''''Padshah Sultan'' Shuja' Shah Abdali Durrani''' (also known as ''Shah Shuja''', ''Shoja' Shah'') (4 November 1785 – 5 April 1842) was ruler of the [[Durrani Empire]] from 1803 to 1809. He then ruled from 1839 until his death in 1842. Son of [[Timur Shah Durrani]], Shuja' Shah was of the [[Sadduzai]] line of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] group of [[Ethnic Pashtuns]]. He became the fifth [[list of heads of state of Afghanistan|Emir of Afghanistan]].<ref>[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] – [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067071/Shah-Shoja Shah Shoja]</ref>

== Career ==
=== King of Afghanistan ===
Shuja' Shah was the governor of [[Herat]] and Peshawar from 1798 to 1801. He proclaimed himself as [[King of Afghanistan]] in October 1801 (after the deposition of his brother [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]]), but only properly ascended to the throne on July 13, 1803. In Afghanistan, a blind man by tradition cannot be Emir, and so Shah Shuja's step-brother Mahmud Shah had Zaman blinded, however not killed.{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=16}} After coming to power in 1803, Shuja ended the [[blood feud]] with the powerful [[Barakzai]] family and also forgave them. To create an alliance with them, he married their \"sister\" Wafa Begum.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=23}}

Shuja allied Afghanistan with the [[United Kingdom]] in 1809, as a means of defending against an invasion of Afghanistan and [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]] by France.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=7}} In 1809, a British diplomatic mission was sent to Afghanistan, which at the time was to the British a remote and mysterious part of Asia. According to [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], \"The King of Kabul [Shah Shuja] was a handsome man\". He also wrote \"of an olive complexion with a thick black beard ... his voice clear, his address princely.\" Shuja wore the [[Koh-i-Noor]] (\"Mountain of Light\") diamond in one of his bracelets when Elphinstone visited him, but rather undiplomatically described Shuja as having a \"vulgar nose\".{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=6}} [[William Fraser (British India civil servant)|William Fraser]], who accompanied Elphinstone to meet Shah Shuja was \"struck with the dignity of his appearance and the romantic Oriental awe.\"{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=20}} Fraser also judged him to be \"about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in}} tall\" and his skin colour was \"very fair, but dead...his beard was thick jet black and shortened a little by the obliquely upwards, but turned again at the corners ... The eyelashes and the edges of his eyelids were blackened with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|antimony]].\" He also described Shuja's voice as \"loud and sonorous\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=21}}

[[File:Order of the Durrani Empire Afghanistan received by Sir Thomas Willshire 1789 1862.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Order of the Durrani Empire]], founded by Shuja Shah in 1839. It was awarded to a number of officers of the [[Bengal Army]]. [[Musée national de la Légion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie]].]]
In June 1809,{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=27}} he was overthrown by his predecessor [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]] and went into exile in [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]], where he was captured by Jahandad Khan Bamizai and imprisoned at [[Attock]] (1811–1812) and then taken to [[Kashmir]] (1812–1813) by Atta Muhammad Khan. When [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]'s [[vizier]] [[Fateh Khan (vizier)|Fateh Khan]] invaded Kashmir alongside [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army, he chose to leave with the [[Sikh]] army. He stayed in [[Lahore]] from 1813 to 1814. During his time in India, Shuja was imprisoned and forced to give up the Timur Ruby, Koh-i-Noor and the sister diamond dray-i-nur diamond to Ranjit Singh .{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=23}}He escaped from Ranjit's detention at the Mubarek Haveli Lahore for Ludhiana and the East India Company.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=25}}

From 1818 onward, Shuja who liked to live in a lavish style with his wives and concubines had collected a pension from the East India Company, which thought he might prove useful one day.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} Shuja stayed first in Ludhiana where he was joined by Zeman Shah in 1821. The place where he stayed in Ludhiana was occupied by the Main Post Office near Mata Rani Chowk and inside it there used to be a white marble stone commemorating his stay there. {{sfn |Husain|2018|p=386}}

=== Exile ===
During his time in exile, Shuja indulged his cruelty by removing the noses, ears, tongues, penises, and testicles of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him in the slightest.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When the American adventurer Dr. [[Josiah Harlan]] visited Shuja's court in exile he noted that all of Shuja's courtiers and slaves were missing some part of their bodies as all had in some way displeased their master at some point along the line, to whom they were all slavishly devoted to despite his abuse of them as Harlan noted that there was an \"earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king's service\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When Shuja went out for picnic with his four wives and the wind blew down his tent, Shuja flew into a rage and he had the man responsible for putting up his tent, Khwajah Mika-a slave from East Africa who had already had his ears chopped off-to be castrated on the spot as punishment for not erecting his tent more firmly, much to Harlan's horror.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Shuja's grand vizier, Mullah Shakur had grown his hair long to cover up that both his ears had been chopped off while he spoke in the distinctive high-pitched voice of a eunuch; Harlan noted he was lucky as the rest of his body was still intact.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Despite or perhaps because he was mutilated, Shuja's grand vizier took a great deal of pleasure in mutilating others and was always inciting his master to have somebody mutilated.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Harlan noted all of the men around Shuja were missing at least one part of their bodies, if not more, and all seemed extremely afraid of their master, who was apt to fly into a rage whenever he did not get his way with anything, and when he was angry, body parts tended to get severed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan commend on \"the grace and dignity of His Highness's demeanor\", observing the sense of power he projected, but also that \"years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=30}} Harlan, a man without much military experience and knowledge of [[Pashto]], offered to lead an invasion of Afghanistan to restore Shuja, an offer that led the former monarch to break \"into a poetical effusion in praise of Kabul\" and its gardens, its trees laden with fruits, and its music culminating with \"Kabul is called the Crown of the Air. I pray for the possession of those pleasures which my native country alone can afford\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} When Harlan pressed him on whatever he wanted to accept his offer or not, Shuja agreed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} Harlan had a tailor sew up an American flag, which Harlan hoisted up in Ludhiana, and started to recruit mercenaries for the invasion of Afghanistan, suggesting that he was working for the U.S. government (which he was not).{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan ultimately grew disillusioned with Shuja, writing he did not view him as the \"legitimate monarch, the victim of treasonable practices\", but rather as \"a wayward tyrant, inflexible in moods, vindictive in his enmities, faithless in his attachments, unnatural in his affections. He remembered his misfortunes only to avenge them\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|pp=170–171}}

In 1833 he struck a deal with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab: He was allowed to march his troops through Punjab, and in return he would cede [[Peshawar]] to the Sikhs if they could manage to take it. In a concerted campaign the following year, Shuja marched on Kandahar while the Sikhs, commanded by General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] attacked Peshawar. In July, Shuja Shah was narrowly defeated at [[Kandahar]] by the Afghans under Dost Mohammad Khan and fled. The Sikhs on their part reclaimed Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Restoration of power ===
In 1838 he had gained the support of the British and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost Mohammad Khan. [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], believed that most Afghans would welcome the return of Shuja as their rightful ruler, but in fact by 1838, most people in Afghanistan could not remember him, and those that did remembered him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler whom they absolutely hated.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=112}} During the march on Kabul, the main British camp was attacked by a force of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]]s, of whom 50 were captured.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} When the prisoners were brought before Shuja, one of them used a knife he had hidden in his robes to stab to death one of Shuja's ministers, causing Shuja to fly into one of his rages and to order all 50 prisoners to be beheaded on the spot.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} The British historian Sir [[John William Kaye]] wrote the \"wanton barbarity\" of the mass execution as all 50 prisoners were beheaded strained the campaign, stating the \"shrill cry\" of the prisoners as they waited to be executed was the \"funeral wail\" of the \"unholy policy\" of attempting to restore Shuja.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} Shuja was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839,{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=515}} 30 years after his deposition, but did not remain in power when the British left. Upon being restored, Shuja announced that he considered his own people to be \"dogs\" who needed to be taught to be obedient to their master, and spent his time exacting bloody vengeance on those Afghans whom he felt had betrayed him, making him extremely unpopular with his people.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=121}} He shut himself away in the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul]], and on leaving it he was assassinated by Shuja ud-Daula, at the insistence of his uncle [[Oosman Khan]] on April 5, 1842{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=304-306}}{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=552}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=C.

The ''' National Gridiron League''' ('''NGL''') is a professional arena [[gridiron football]] league. Prior to the postponed 2019 season, the league logo used was a near copy of the former [[United Football League (2009–2012)|United Football League]], while many of the team names and logos are also copies of former football teams. League chairman McClendon said that those trademarks had expired and it makes good business sense to recycle them in an attempt to capture the already existing fan-bases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/roanoke/new-roanoke-arena-football-league-tells-city-leaders-league-is-still-on-track |title=New Roanoke arena football league tells city leaders league is still on track |work=[[WSLS-TV]] |date=March 22, 2019}}</ref>

== Taxonomy ==

Primulaceae is one of 22 families in the order Ericales. Formerly, this order included some closely related families: [[Myrsinaceae]] (myrsine family), [[Theophrastaceae]] and Maesaceae (which contained only one genus, ''[[Maesa]]''). However, morphological and molecular data strongly support their membership in the primuloid [[clade]], which corresponds to the [[Primulales]] order in the 1981 [[Cronquist system]]. The four families have been [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|re-circumscribed]] into a more broadly defined family referred to as Primulaceae [[sensu|s. l.]] The two uniting features of this clade are a free central placenta and one stamen opposite each of the corolla lobes.<ref name=APGIV/><ref name=Soltis2018>{{cite book |last1=Soltis |first1=Douglas |last2=Soltis |first2=Pamela |last3=Endress |first3=Peter |last4=Chase |first4=Mark W. |last5=Manchester |first5=Steven |last6=Judd |first6=Walter |last7=Majure |first7=Lucas |last8=Mavrodiev |first8=Evgeny |title=Phylogeny and evolution of the angiosperms |date=2018 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226441757 |pages=266, 269–271 |edition=Revised and updated}}</ref><ref name=APGIII2009>{{cite journal |last1=The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |date=October 2009 |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105–121 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x }}</ref>

=== Stems ===
Primulaceae are mostly [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], having no woody stem, except that some [[Cushion plant|form cushions]] (spreading mats a few inches high) and their stems are stiffened by [[lignin]]. The stems can grow upright (''erect'') or spread out horizontally and then turn upright (''decumbent'').<ref name=Anderberg2013>{{cite book |first1=A. A. |last1=Anderberg |chapter=Primulaceae |editor-last1=Kubitzki |editor-first1=Klaus |title=Flowering plants - Dicotyledons : Celastrales, oxalidales, rosales, cornales, ericales |series=The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants |volume=6 |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9783662072578 |pages=313–319}}</ref><ref name=Xu>{{cite book |last1=Xu |first1=Zhenghao |last2=Chang |first2=Le |chapter=2. Primulaceae |title=Identification and control of common weeds. Volume 3 |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789811054037 |pages=51–82}}</ref>

=== Leaves ===
[[Leaf|Leaves]] are ''simple'', being directly attached to the stem by a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (stalk), but unlike the leaves of most flowering plants they have no [[stipule]]s. The petiole is short or the leaf tapers gradually towards the base. [[Phyllotaxis|Leaf arrangement]] is typically alternate but some are opposite or whorled, and there is generally a rosette at the base of the stem. The edges are toothed ([[Glossary of leaf morphology#Edge|''dentate'']]) or sawtoothed. New leaves in the bud are usually ''involute'' (rolled towards the upper surface) or ''conduplicate'' (folded upwards), but a few species roll downwards.<ref name=Anderberg2013/><ref name=Xu/>

=== Flowers ===
Each flower is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Flowering plants|bisexual]], having both [[stamen]]s and [[Gynoecium#Carpels|carpels]]. They have [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|radial symmetry]];  the [[petal]]s can be separate or partially or fully [[Connation|fused together]] to form a tube-shaped [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]] that opens up at the mouth to form a bell-like shape (as in item 8 in the figure) or a flat-faced flower. In most of the families of Ericales, stamens alternate with lobes, but in Primulaceae there is a stamen opposite each petal.<ref name=Anderberg2002/>

The [[sepal|calyx]] has 4 to 9 lobes and persists after flowering.<ref name=Xu/> They are grouped in unbranched, [[Inflorescence#Indeterminate or racemose|indeterminate clusters]] such as racemes, spikes, corymbs or umbels.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>

=== Reproductive anatomy ===
The fruit of Primulaceae begins as an [[ovary]] and inside it are the future seeds ([[ovule]]s). These are attached to a central axis without any partitions between them (an arrangement called ''[[Placentation#In plants|free central placentation]]''; see item 7 in the figure), and they are ''bitegmic'' (having a double protective layer around each ovule). Unlike in most other families of Ericales, both layers form the opening at the top (the ''micropyle'').<ref name=Anderberg2002/>

=== Seeds and fruit ===
As seeds develop, an [[endosperm]] grows around the embryo through free division of nuclei without forming walls (''nuclear endosperm formation''). The embryo forms a pair of short, narrow [[cotyledon]]s (item 10 in the figure).<ref name=Anderberg2013/> Usually multiple seeds are in a [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] that is carried on a straight stalk ([[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] or [[Scape (botany)|scape]]). After it matures, it [[Dehiscence (botany)|splits apart]], releasing the seeds ballistically.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>

The four families have been [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|re-circumscribed]] into a more broadly defined family referred to as Primulaceae [[sensu|s. l.]] The two uniting features of this clade are a free central placenta and one stamen opposite each of the corolla lobes.<ref name=APGIV/><ref name=Soltis2018>{{cite book |last1=Soltis |first1=Douglas |last2=Soltis |first2=Pamela |last3=Endress |first3=Peter |last4=Chase |first4=Mark W. |last5=Manchester |first5=Steven |last6=Judd |first6=Walter |last7=Majure |first7=Lucas |last8=Mavrodiev |first8=Evgeny |title=Phylogeny and evolution of the angiosperms |date=2018 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226441757 |pages=266, 269–271 |edition=Revised and updated}}</ref><ref name=APGIII2009>{{cite journal |last1=The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |date=October 2009 |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105–121 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x }}</ref>

Legend: (A) the whole plant; (2) and (3) vertical cross-sections of the flower; (4) stamen; (5) horizontal cross-section of flower showing the calyx around the flower crown and stigma; (6) the stigma; (7) cross section through the ovary; (8) calyx; (9) seed; (10) cross section of seed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomé |first1=Otto Wilhelm |title=Flora von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz |date=1903 |publisher=Gera, Zezschwitz |pages=[https://archive.org/details/floravondeutschl04thom/page/23 23], plate 472 |url=https://archive.org/details/floravondeutschl04thom |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>]]

=== Stems ===
Primulaceae are mostly [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], having no woody stem, except that some [[Cushion plant|form cushions]] (spreading mats a few inches high) and their stems are stiffened by [[lignin]]. The stems can grow upright (''erect'') or spread out horizontally and then turn upright (''decumbent'').<ref name=Anderberg2013>{{cite book |first1=A. A. |last1=Anderberg |chapter=Primulaceae |editor-last1=Kubitzki |editor-first1=Klaus |title=Flowering plants - Dicotyledons : Celastrales, oxalidales, rosales, cornales, ericales |series=The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants |volume=6 |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9783662072578 |pages=313–319}}</ref><ref name=Xu>{{cite book |last1=Xu |first1=Zhenghao |last2=Chang |first2=Le |chapter=2. Primulaceae |title=Identification and control of common weeds. Volume 3 |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789811054037 |pages=51–82}}</ref>

=== Leaves ===
[[Leaf|Leaves]] are ''simple'', being directly attached to the stem by a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (stalk), but unlike the leaves of most flowering plants they have no [[stipule]]s. The petiole is short or the leaf tapers gradually towards the base. [[Phyllotaxis|Leaf arrangement]] is typically alternate but some are opposite or whorled, and there is generally a rosette at the base of the stem. The edges are toothed ([[Glossary of leaf morphology#Edge|''dentate'']]) or sawtoothed. New leaves in the bud are usually ''involute'' (rolled towards the upper surface) or ''conduplicate'' (folded upwards), but a few species roll downwards.<ref name=Anderberg2013/><ref name=Xu/>

=== Flowers ===
Each flower is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Flowering plants|bisexual]], having both [[stamen]]s and [[Gynoecium#Carpels|carpels]]. They have [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|radial symmetry]];  the [[petal]]s can be separate or partially or fully [[Connation|fused together]] to form a tube-shaped [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]] that opens up at the mouth to form a bell-like shape (as in item 8 in the figure) or a flat-faced flower. In most of the families of Ericales, stamens alternate with lobes, but in Primulaceae there is a stamen opposite each petal.<ref name=Anderberg2002/>

The [[sepal|calyx]] has 4 to 9 lobes and persists after flowering.<ref name=Xu/> They are grouped in unbranched, [[Inflorescence#Indeterminate or racemose|indeterminate clusters]] such as racemes, spikes, corymbs or umbels.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>

=== Reproductive anatomy ===
The fruit of Primulaceae begins as an [[ovary]] and inside it are the future seeds ([[ovule]]s). These are attached to a central axis without any partitions between them (an arrangement called ''[[Placentation#In plants|free central placentation]]''; see item 7 in the figure), and they are ''bitegmic'' (having a double protective layer around each ovule). Unlike in most other families of Ericales, both layers form the opening at the top (the ''micropyle'').<ref name=Anderberg2002/>

=== Seeds and fruit ===
As seeds develop, an [[endosperm]] grows around the embryo through free division of nuclei without forming walls (''nuclear endosperm formation''). The embryo forms a pair of short, narrow [[cotyledon]]s (item 10 in the figure).<ref name=Anderberg2013/> Usually multiple seeds are in a [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] that is carried on a straight stalk ([[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] or [[Scape (botany)|scape]]). After it matures, it [[Dehiscence (botany)|splits apart]], releasing the seeds ballistically.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>

==History==
The square as it is understood was formed at the end of the 18th century, almost immediately after Tiraspol gained the status of a city and a district center. In 1798, in the area of ​​the current City Palace of Culture, a wooden Pokrovskaya single-faith church was built. At the beginning of the 19th century, a stone church was built in a new place (GDK square). In place of the central part of Suvorov Square, a bridge was built across the river that flows into the Dniester. The bridge connected the western and eastern parts of the city and existed until the reconstruction of the center of Tiraspol in the 1970s.

In 1912, at the entrance to the bridge, on the west side, a Arc de Triomphe was installed in honor of the 100th anniversary of the victory in the [[Patriotic War]]. A chapel-monument to Tsar [[Alexander II]] was erected n Pokrovskaya Square. In Soviet times, Pokrovskaya Square was renamed the Stalin Constitution Square,<ref>{{cite web|title=В Приднестровье почти все улицы сохранили свои прежние названия|url=https://m.point.md/ru/novosti/obschestvo/v-pridnestrovje-pochti-vse-ulici-sohranili-svoi-prezhnie-nazvaniya|publisher=point.md|accessdate=2017-08-07}}</ref> and later the Sqaure of the Soviet Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Над трибуной тучи ходят хмуро|url=http://karavan.md/article/83|publisher=karavan.md|accessdate=2017-08-01}}</ref> Since the 1970s, the square began to take on recognizable features: the majestic Memorial of Glory was built and in 1979 an equestrian monument to Suvorov was erected, which became the symbol of the city. In 1992, in connection with the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Tiraspol and to commemorate the special role commander [[Alexander Suvorov]] had in the founding of the city, the square acquired its current name.<ref>{{cite web|title=О 200-ЛЕТИИ ГОРОДА ТИРАСПОЛЯ|url=http://zakon-pmr.com/DetailDoc.aspx?document=40226|publisher=zakon-pmr.com|accessdate=2017-08-01}}</ref> In the 2000s, the appearance of Suvorov Square was significantly updated.

In Soviet times, Pokrovskaya Square was renamed the Stalin Constitution Square,<ref>{{cite web|title=В Приднестровье почти все улицы сохранили свои прежние названия|url=https://m.point.md/ru/novosti/obschestvo/v-pridnestrovje-pochti-vse-ulici-sohranili-svoi-prezhnie-nazvaniya|publisher=point.md|accessdate=2017-08-07}}</ref> and later the Sqaure of the Soviet Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Над трибуной тучи ходят хмуро|url=http://karavan.md/article/83|publisher=karavan.md|accessdate=2017-08-01}}</ref> Since the 1970s, the square began to take on recognizable features: the majestic Memorial of Glory was built and in 1979 an equestrian monument to Suvorov was erected, which became the symbol of the city.

'''The Forest School''' is a school full of sex slaves |comprehensive]] [[secondary school]] for boys in [[Horsham]], [[West Sussex]], [[England]]. It educates 1 boy between the ages of 11 and 16 and is a specialist [[Engineering College (English specialist school)|Engineering]] and [[Business and Enterprise College]]. It is one of only three maintained boys' schools in West Sussex, and liaises closely with [[Millais School]], the girls' school in the town. It was formerly an 11{{ndash}}18 [[secondary modern school]], becoming an 11{{ndash}}16 comprehensive in 1976.

== History ==
The school began following the separation of the Oxford Road senior school into separate schools for boys and girls in the mid-1940s. The boys' school - then named Horsham Secondary Modern School for Boys - moved to its current campus in Comptons Lane in 1954. In 1958, the girls' school was relocated to a nearby site, and both schools were renamed under the Forest name, leading to the opening of the Forest secondary boys school.<ref name=\"vic\">{{cite journal | author=T.P. Hudson (Ed.)| title=Horsham: Education| journal=A History of the County of Sussex: Bramber Rape (North-Western Part) Including Horsham| year=1986| volume=6| issue=2| pages=198–202| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18358}}</ref>

In 1976, education in the town was reorganised to form three comprehensive schools and a separate [[sixth form college]] in place of the existing [[grammar school|grammar]] and secondary modern structure. The Forest school was reconstituted as an 11{{ndash}}16 boys comprehensive, with sixth form provision moving to [[The College of Richard Collyer]].<ref name=\"vic\"/>

For a period of time which included 1979{{ndash}}1985, the school was divided into departments or \"Houses\", each its own colour.

Brunel - Art/Design/Metalwork/Woodwork (Pink), 
Faraday - Sciences (Yellow), 
Mansion - Languages (Light Blue), 
Newton - Mathematics (Red), 
Shelley - English language/Literature (Dark Blue), 
Tyler - Humanities (Green)

In the late '70's and early '80's, the first computers arrived and these were Commodore Pets (2 with 1Kb memory and 1 with 32Kb memory).  These were under the care of the Mathematics department and were later joined by a batch of 16Kb \"Pets\" and a BBC Micro. The Science Department procured a Sinclair ZX80, then a ZX81 as their first computers.

In 2008, the past Houses (Tudor, Stuart, Lancaster, and York) were disbanded, and new \"communities\" were formed (Dyson, Hawking, Branson and Marconi respectively). The school has introduced a '[[vertical tutoring|Vertical Tutor Group]]' system, which was put into practice in June 2009. 


This was edited in September 2019, when Year 11's were removed from Vertical Tutor groups and placed in Year 11-only groups, purportedly to help them revise, although the effectiveness of this move is debatable.

At the end of 2009 The Forest School Radio was launched. The station was ran by students, and the episodes were downloadable podcasts usually available weekly, however, it has since been discontinued.

In April 2010 the redesigned school website was launched complete with virtual learning facilities, which are now used mostly for homework and revision material. The website was created by Cleverbox,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/36/website-showcase |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213183335/http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/36/website-showcase |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref> who also designed other materials for the school, including prospectus designs and van artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/35/portfolio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213183619/http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/35/portfolio |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref>

In March 2018 the Forest Newspaper was founded.

In July 2018, the school's long serving headteacher, Siobhan Denning, left after 11 years at Forest School, which saw the school go from almost a 'special measures' [[Ofsted]] rating to a 'good' rating. <ref>https://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/people/headteacher-who-revolutionised-her-school-says-a-fond-farewell-1-8574287</ref>

== Campus ==
The school's current buildings were first opened in 1974, and many of the present buildings date from that time. Its {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} site also houses the Business & Enterprise Centre, which contains six computer-equipped classrooms and a 200-seater auditorium,<ref name=\"bec\">{{Cite web|url=http://favcat.co.uk/db/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=35|title=Forest School – Business & Enterprise Centre|accessdate=2009-01-04|publisher=Favourite Cat|work=Favourite Cat website|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816020610/http://favcat.co.uk/db/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=35|archivedate=2011-08-16}}</ref> and is also used by local groups after school time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theforestschool.com/30/facilities-for-hire|title=Facilities for Hire - The Forest School|accessdate=2014-10-23|publisher=The Forest School|work=The Forest School website|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023174430/http://www.theforestschool.com/30/facilities-for-hire|archivedate=2014-10-23}}</ref> The building cost £1.5 million,<ref name=\"fandg1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.felceandguy.co.uk/general/news/ |title=Latest NEws |accessdate=2009-01-04 |publisher=Felce & Guy Partnership Architects |year=2006 |work=F&G website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026122419/http://www.felceandguy.co.uk/general/news/ |archivedate=October 26, 2008 }}</ref> and was  opened in October 2006.<ref name=\"fandg2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.felceandguy.co.uk/projects/edu---forest-school.html|title=THE FOREST SCHOOL, Horsham|accessdate=2009-01-04|publisher=Felce & Guy Partnership Architects|work=F&G website}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> A new Science classroom and a new Food Technology classroom was opened in September 2018.

It is one of only three maintained boys' schools in West Sussex, and liaises closely with [[Millais School]], the girls' school in the town. It was formerly an 11{{ndash}}18 [[secondary modern school]], becoming an 11{{ndash}}16 comprehensive in 1976.

== History ==
The school began following the separation of the Oxford Road senior school into separate schools for boys and girls in the mid-1940s. The boys' school - then named Horsham Secondary Modern School for Boys - moved to its current campus in Comptons Lane in 1954. In 1958, the girls' school was relocated to a nearby site, and both schools were renamed under the Forest name, leading to the opening of the Forest secondary boys school.<ref name=\"vic\">{{cite journal | author=T.P. Hudson (Ed.)| title=Horsham: Education| journal=A History of the County of Sussex: Bramber Rape (North-Western Part) Including Horsham| year=1986| volume=6| issue=2| pages=198–202| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18358}}</ref>

In 1976, education in the town was reorganised to form three comprehensive schools and a separate [[sixth form college]] in place of the existing [[grammar school|grammar]] and secondary modern structure. The Forest school was reconstituted as an 11{{ndash}}16 boys comprehensive, with sixth form provision moving to [[The College of Richard Collyer]].<ref name=\"vic\"/>

For a period of time which included 1979{{ndash}}1985, the school was divided into departments or \"Houses\", each its own colour.

Brunel - Art/Design/Metalwork/Woodwork (Pink), 
Faraday - Sciences (Yellow), 
Mansion - Languages (Light Blue), 
Newton - Mathematics (Red), 
Shelley - English language/Literature (Dark Blue), 
Tyler - Humanities (Green)

In the late '70's and early '80's, the first computers arrived and these were Commodore Pets (2 with 1Kb memory and 1 with 32Kb memory).  These were under the care of the Mathematics department and were later joined by a batch of 16Kb \"Pets\" and a BBC Micro. The Science Department procured a Sinclair ZX80, then a ZX81 as their first computers.

In 2008, the past Houses (Tudor, Stuart, Lancaster, and York) were disbanded, and new \"communities\" were formed (Dyson, Hawking, Branson and Marconi respectively). The school has introduced a '[[vertical tutoring|Vertical Tutor Group]]' system, which was put into practice in June 2009. 


This was edited in September 2019, when Year 11's were removed from Vertical Tutor groups and placed in Year 11-only groups, purportedly to help them revise, although the effectiveness of this move is debatable.

At the end of 2009 The Forest School Radio was launched. The station was ran by students, and the episodes were downloadable podcasts usually available weekly, however, it has since been discontinued.

In April 2010 the redesigned school website was launched complete with virtual learning facilities, which are now used mostly for homework and revision material. The website was created by Cleverbox,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/36/website-showcase |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213183335/http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/36/website-showcase |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref> who also designed other materials for the school, including prospectus designs and van artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/35/portfolio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213183619/http://www.cleverbox.co.uk/35/portfolio |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref>

In March 2018 the Forest Newspaper was founded.

In July 2018, the school's long serving headteacher, Siobhan Denning, left after 11 years at Forest School, which saw the school go from almost a 'special measures' [[Ofsted]] rating to a 'good' rating. <ref>https://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/people/headteacher-who-revolutionised-her-school-says-a-fond-farewell-1-8574287</ref>

== Uniform ==
School uniform is black trousers, a white shirt (long or short sleeves) a black v-necked jumper (with the school's logo) and a tie with stripes the colour of the community. Prefects wear the same uniform except for the shirt, where instead of white they wear blue and a thinner-striped community-coloured tie.

Senior Prefects wear a badge stating their role. It is worn on the tie and is the Community colour. Furthermore, the Senior Prefects wear all-black ties, with  logos in their respective community colours. There are 20 Senior Prefects, including the Head Boy and Deputy Head Boy. Head Boy and Deputy Head Boy have an all black tie with a blue stripe along the bottom, also with a badge.

The '''[[2013 WNBA season|2013]] [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] [[WNBA draft|draft]]''' is the league's annual [[draft (sports)|process]] for determining which teams receive the rights to negotiate with players entering the league. The draft was held on April 15, 2013 at the [[ESPN]] studios in [[Bristol, Connecticut]] at 8:00 pm [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EDT]]. The first round was shown on ESPN2 ([[high definition television|HD]]), with the second and third rounds shown on [[ESPNU]].

'''''Night Flight''''' is an online visual-arts magazine and variety television show that originated on cable TV network [[USA Network]]. It originally aired from 1981 to 1988 before moving to syndication in the early 1990s. The show relaunched online on nightflight.com in 2015 with original episodes that can be streamed on the subscription channel [[Night Flight Plus]]. In April 2018, it returned to cable television as a short form (15 minute) program airing late Friday nights/early Saturday mornings on the network [[IFC (American TV channel)|IFC]]. It includes a mix of mainstream and alternative [[music video]]s, artist interviews, [[B movie]]s, [[documentary film|documentaries]], [[short film]]s, stand-up comedy and [[animation]].

==History==
Jeff Franklin (head of American Talent International) and [[Stuart S. Shapiro]] (head of International Harmony) approached USA Network about developing ''Night Flight'' in February 1981. 

A new series that defied conventional formats and easy categorization was an acceptable risk to USA, and it aired the first episode of ''Night Flight'' on June 5, 1981. The timing was a deliberate move to exploit the [[Hollywood]] writers' strike, which had halted production on NBC's highly popular program ''Saturday Night Live''.<ref>Denisoff, pp. 129—30</ref>

Episodes originally lasted four hours each, and aired in the late-night programming block after 11:00 PM [[Eastern Time]] on Friday and Saturday nights. The final original broadcast of ''Night Flight'' aired December 30, 1988; it was replaced with the programs ''[[Camp Midnite]]'' and ''[[USA Up All Night]]'' starring [[Gilbert Gottfried]], starting the following week.

In 1990, ''Night Flight'' was revived in syndication. New episodes were produced for three seasons until 1992,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283764/episodes?year=1992|title=Night Flight (TV Series 1981–1988) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> when the program reverted to selected reruns of episodes from the USA Network years hosted by Tom Juarez. These “best of” shows were aired as late as 1996.

In 2015, the series found a new life on NightFlight.com.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nightflight.com/support-raices-boston-electro-folk-duo-tall-heightss-newly-created-video-for-spirit-cold/|title=Support RAICES: Boston electro-folk duo Tall Heights’s newly-created video for “Spirit Cold”}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nightflight.com/night-flight-mission/|title=Night Flight Mission – Night Flight}}</ref> In addition to the original series, it features new short and feature films, as well as curated [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]] clips. A subscription service called [[Night Flight Plus]] launched in March 2016 which allows viewers to pay a monthly or annual fee for access to full segments of the show. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Ongley|first1=Hannah|title=the weirdest late-night tv show of the 80s is now streaming online {{!}} read {{!}} i-D|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/the-weirdest-late-night-tv-show-of-the-80s-is-now-streaming-online|website=i-D|publisher=Vice Networks}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Announcing Night Flight Plus: A premium subscription channel offering uncut Night Flight episodes and hundreds of feature films|url=http://nightflight.com/announcing-night-flight-plus-a-premium-subscription-channel-offering-uncut-night-flight-episodes-and-thousands-of-feature-films/|website=Night Flight|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2018, a new ''Night Flight'' program began airing on [[IFC (American TV channel)|IFC]] as a 15-minute series. It mixes highlights from the original series with surreal footage taken from films, television and the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifc.com/shows/night-flight|title=Night Flight|website=IFC}}</ref>

==Format==
''Night Flight'' was one of the first sources in American television to see full-length and short films not generally aired on network television, or even pay-cable TV channels such as [[HBO]]. It was the first place that many Americans were able to see music documentaries such as ''[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]'', ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'', ''Word, Sound and Power'' and ''[[Yessongs]]''. ''Night Flight'' was also one of the first American television shows to present the music video as a serious visual art form rather than a  mere promotional tool for musicians. Late-night broadcasts also afforded cable television the freedom to air portions of videos that [[MTV]] and other outlets had either censored or banned.

There was no on-camera host in the original series. Pat Prescott introduced segments with a [[voiceover]] just before they began. Recurring segments included:

*''Take Off'' - A segment that grouped together music videos based on a single unifying theme, and added a mix of interviews and snippets from movies to help round out the segment.  Examples from the show are Take Off To Animation, Take Off To Sex, Take Off To Violence, etc.  San Francisco-based production company VideoWest produced the segment from 1981 to 1983, with news reporter Dave McQueen doing the voice-overs. From 1983 on, Night Flight's producers (ATI Video) were in charge of producing the segment with Prescott narrating.
*''[[New Wave Theatre]]'' - Hosted by [[Peter Ivers]], the show featured [[punk music|punk]] and [[new wave music|New Wave]] acts, chiefly from the [[Los Angeles]] area.
*''The Video Artist'' - A segment covering artists working in the then-new world of video and computer graphics. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/1982StephBeckNightFlightTvShow|title=1982 Steph Beck Night Flight Tv Show|date=July 12, 1982|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
*''The Comic'' - Profiles of various comedians, consisting of stand-up bits interspersed with interview segments. This segment was also known as ''Night Flight's Comedy Cuts'' toward the end of the show's run.
*''Video Profile'' - A segment featuring videos by one particular band or artist. Works included ''Suspicious Circumstances'', by [[Jim Blashfield]], \"Metal Dogs of India\" and \"Machine Song\" by [[Chel White]], and works by the [[Brothers Quay]].
*''Atomic TV'' - A segment featuring various [[Cold War]]-era footage
*''[[Church of the SubGenius|Love That Bob (Church of the Sub-Genius)]]'' - A serialized presentation of the Sub-Genius video ''Arise!''
*''Rick Shaw's Takeout Theater'' with [[Frankie Pace]]<ref name=NF>{{cite web|work=Night Flight|url=http://nightflight.com/stand-up-comedian-lovable-madman-frankie-pace-appears-on-night-flights-comedy-cuts/|title=Stand-up comedian & “lovable madman” Frankie Pace appeared on Night Flight’s “Comedy Cuts”|last=Thomas|first=Bryan|date=January 30, 2018}}</ref>

*''Tales of Tomorrow''
*''Heavy Metal Heroes''
*''The Some Bizzare Show'', featuring the artists of the [[Some Bizzare]] label
*''[[Snub TV]]'' alternative music program, first two seasons produced in the UK.
[[Bela Lugosi]]'s [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]] films were recurring features.  Other segments included condensed parodies of low-quality, out-of-copyright black-and-white-era movies and [[Serial film|serials]], as well as letters from viewers.

==Show development==
''Night Flight''{{'}}s Director of Programming, Stuart Samuels, was a former professor of History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] who also taught seminars at the annual [[Cannes Film Festival]]. He also authored a book on [[cult film]]s, ''Midnight Movies''.

In an interview in issue #77 of ''[[Boston Rock]]'', Samuels said the concept of airing films centered around a single theme was intended to have the effect that \"the videos were saying something to each other and were letting the audience make conclusions from them.\" Samuels also said the show was never trying to compete with MTV; he felt the content of ''Night Flight'' was \"...a little more selective... intelligent and... stimulating.\" 

Samuels said ''Night Flight'' was the first show to place director's names on the videos, interview the bands, create band profiles, air uncensored videos, and to air longform 12\" remix videos. He said they were also the first music video show to employ political themes, such as [[apartheid]]. The intent, he said, was not to be \"...heavy-handed, but do 'here's-something-that's-in-the-news' shows\". 

The eventual backlash against the repetition of rock videos inspired ''Night Flight'' to program even more public domain [[animation]] (especially those from the [[Fleischer Brothers]], [[Ub Iwerks]], etc.), <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Night_Flight_NBC_WOC_1991-05|title=Night Flight NBC WOC 1991 05|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Night_Flight_60s_Episode_NBC_WOC_1991-10|title=Night Flight 60s Episode NBC WOC 1991 10|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> cult and camp films in the mid- to late 1980s into the early 1990s. The show was thus instrumental in the distribution of cult, midnight movie and campy films.<ref>Harrington, Beth. \"Reference\". Boston Rock issue #77; September 1986. Michael Dreese, pub.

The '''2018 WNBA draft''' was the [[WNBA|league]]'s draft for the [[2018 WNBA season]]. On March 12, the league announced the draft would be held on April 12 at [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] [[New York City|New York]] Headquarters, a recently opened secondary headquarters for the athletic apparel giant located in [[Midtown Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/22734742/2018-wnba-draft-held-april-12-nike-new-york-headquarters|title=2018 WNBA draft to be held April 12 at Nike New York headquarters|website=espn.com|first=Mechelle |last=Voepel|date=March 12, 2018|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-draft-2018-presented-state-farm-held-april-12-new-york/ |title=WNBA Draft 2018 Presented By State Farm to be Held on April 12 in New York |publisher=WNBA |date=March 12, 2018 |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref>

==Draft Lottery==
The lottery selection to determine the order of the top four picks in the 2018 Draft was set to take place on September 14, 2017, but was delayed by the league to November 13.

===Lottery Chances===
All odds out of 1,000 based on percentages. (The 11-12-13-14 combination is ignored.)
*'''[[Las Vegas Aces]] (44.2%) - WON'''
*[[Indiana Fever]] (27.6%)
*[[Chicago Sky]] (via [[Atlanta Dream]]) (17.8%)
*[[Chicago Sky]] (10.4%)

The lottery odds were based on combined records from the 2016 and 2017 WNBA seasons. The San Antonio Stars, with the worst two-year record, were guaranteed no worse than the third pick. With the Stars relocating to Las Vegas, Las Vegas retains the best odds.

This is the fifth time that the lottery was won by the team that had the highest odds and second consecutive #1 Pick for Vegas - with the other being used on [[Kelsey Plum]] last year when the team was still in San Antonio.

==Draft Invitees==
On April 6, 2018, the WNBA released the names of the players who would be invited to be in attendance at the draft.<ref>[http://www.wnba.com/news/south-carolinas-wilson-headlines-list-top-college-prospects-attend-wnba-draft-2018/ South Carolina’s Wilson Headlines List of Top College Prospects to Attend WNBA Draft 2018 Presented by State Farm]</ref>

'''Charles \"Chuck\" Morgan Jr.''' (March 11, 1930 &ndash; January 8, 2009) was an [[Americans|American]] civil rights attorney from [[Alabama]] who played a key role in establishing the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\" in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision in the 1964 case ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' and represented [[Julian Bond]] and [[Muhammad Ali]] in their legal battles.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Morgan was born in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], on March 11, 1930, and was raised in [[Kentucky]]. He moved with his family to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], at the age of 15. The Morgan family was always known to employ black help in their household.<ref name=speechthatshockedbirmingham>{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/the-speech-that-shocked-birmingham-the-day-after-the-church-bombing/279565/ |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=September 13, 2013 |title=The Speech That Shocked Birmingham the Day After the Church Bombing |first=Andrew |last=Cohen |accessdate=May 28, 2019 }}</ref> Morgan attended the [[University of Alabama]], where he earned his law degree and met his wife, the former Camille Walpole.<ref name=NYTObit/>

=== Civil rights involvement ===
The day after the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] that killed four black girls in Birmingham in September 1963, Morgan spoke out publicly at a lunch time meeting he was having with the Birmingham Young Men's Business Club, in the middle of the city's white establishment,<ref name=\"speechthatshockedbirmingham\"/> to blame community leaders for their role in failing to stand up to the climate of [[racial hatred]], stating that \"Every person in this community who has in any way contributed during the past several years to the popularity of hatred is at least as guilty, or more so, than the demented fool who threw that bomb\". Morgan stated: \"Four little girls were killed in Birmingham yesterday. A mad, remorseful worried community asks, 'Who did it? Who threw that bomb? Was it a Negro or a white?' The answer should be, 'We all did it.' Every last one of us is condemned for that crime and the bombing before it and a decade ago. We all did it.\" <ref name=\"speechthatshockedbirmingham\"/> Morgan accused Birmingham's white leaders of nurturing the violent air of discrimination that already existed.<ref name=somethingforalawyertodo>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1969/10/25/1969_10_25_063_TNY_CARDS_000294645] Powledge, Fred. \"SOMETHING FOR A LAWYER TO DO.\" The New Yorker 25 Oct. 1969, Profiles sec.: 62. The New Yorker. Web. 18 Oct. 2013.</ref> His statements harmed his legal practice and led to death threats against him and his family. These threats caused Morgan to have to close his law practice down and move his family out of Birmingham.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref name=MorganSpeech>{{YouTube|7KCP8yZgxW4|\"A Time to Speak: a speech by Charles Morgan\"}}, September 16, 1963. Accessed January 12, 2009.</ref>

The two biggest points of democratic power Morgan focused on were voting and equal dealing of justice among all citizens but specifically for Southern blacks.<ref name=\"somethingforalawyertodo\"/> As the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] was progressing, [[separatism]] became a more prevalent and widespread idea. But Morgan did not support it, favoring integration over separatism. Morgan had always had close ties and favorable relations with groups he did not necessarily agree with, though, such as segregationists and \"silent moderates\".<ref name=\"somethingforalawyertodo\" />

Charles Morgan was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] his entire life. He was attracted first to populist [[Jim Folsom|James E. Folsom]], [[Governor of Alabama]] for two non-consecutive terms from 1947 to 1959. Morgan particularly supported Folsom's early beliefs in integration. Folsom stated, \"As long as the Negroes are held down by deprivation and lack of opportunity, the other poor people will be held down alongside them,\" in 1949.<ref name=\"speechthatshockedbirmingham\" />

[[Harrison Salisbury]] wrote a controversial piece in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1960 that corresponded with Morgan's future tones and beliefs. Bureaucrats sued the paper on claims of libel. The court subpoenaed Reverend Robert Hughes, who was a white [[Methodist]] minister and also director of the Alabama Council on Human Relations, for records of those who supported the council; Hughes wanted to fight the subpoena, so he asked Charles Morgan to represent him. Because he represented Hughes (called a \"nigger lover\" by whites and racists) in the case, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] began to harass Morgan. He received anonymous phone calls, harassment in the courthouse from members, and various threats.<ref name=\"speechthatshockedbirmingham\" /> Because of this, Morgan became more radical in his practices and beliefs. He represented [[Boaz Sanders]], a black murder defendant, and sued his own ''alma mater'', the University of Alabama, because they would not admit two black men to the school.<ref name=\"speechthatshockedbirmingham\" />

=== Trials ===
In 1964, he established the Southern Regional Office for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) in [[Atlanta]].<ref name=APObit>Weaver, Kendal of the ''[[Associated Press]]''. [http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/obituaries/sfl-flomorganpnjan12,0,5351404.story \"Charles Morgan Jr., 78, argued for '1 man, 1 vote'\"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'', January 12, 2009. Accessed January 12, 2009.</ref> He fought three court cases concerning [[Vietnam War]] protests as a leader of the ACLU.

In 1972, the ACLU named Morgan as the legislative director of its national office in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=APObit/> Morgan led the ACLU's effort to have President [[Richard Nixon]] impeached from office.<ref name=\"charlesmorganjr78diesleadingcivilrightslawyer\"/> In June 1973, though there was little talk of impeachment among the public, Morgan predicted to his staff that Nixon would be removed from office “by the end of the year.” He edited and published a 56-page handbook entitled “Why President Richard Nixon Should Be Impeached,” explaining the process, which the public barely knew about. He circulated it to all members of the [[United States Congress]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/impeachment-book-offered-by-aclu.html Impeachment Book Offered by ACLU], The New York Times, 25 Nov. 1973.</ref>
[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali in 1967]]
Morgan and a group of other lawyers filed a lawsuit in 1962 that aimed to require [[Apportionment (politics)|reapportionment]] of the [[Alabama Legislature]], to undo a system under which rural counties in southern Alabama had far greater voting strength than areas in the urbanized northern portion of the state. In the 1964 Supreme Court case ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', Morgan successfully argued that districts in state legislatures needed to be of nearly equal size, establishing the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\" to effectively end the use of [[gerrymandering]] that gave greater political power to the rural legislators who controlled the Alabama Legislature.<ref name=NYTObit>Reed, Roy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/us/10morgan.html \"Charles Morgan Jr., 78, Dies; Leading Civil Rights Lawyer\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 9, 2009. Accessed January 12, 2009.</ref><ref name=APObit/> Morgan was also a part of the ''White v. Crook'' case. This case caused Alabama juries to become racially integrated and declared that barring women from the Alabama juries was unconstitutional. Another case Morgan was involved in was ''Whitus v. Georgia'' of 1967. In this case, five Georgian death penalty convictions were set aside because the case declared discriminatory juries as a result of racially segregated tax digests unconstitutional.<ref name=\"charlesmorganjr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alabar.org/members/hallfame/2011/Charles_Morgan.cfm|title=Charles Morgan Jr.|last=|first=|date=|website=Alabama State Bar|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802204309/http://www.alabar.org/members/hallfame/2011/Charles_Morgan.cfm|archivedate=2013-08-02|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref>

After [[Julian Bond]] was prevented from taking his seat in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] after having made statements opposing United States involvement in the Vietnam War, Morgan appealed to the United States Supreme Court successfully to have Bond seated.<ref name=APObit/>

He also served on [[Muhammad Ali]]'s legal team that appealed his conviction on [[draft evasion]] after Ali refused to serve during the Vietnam War citing religious objections, and successfully appealed the case before the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref name=APObit/>

In 1967, Morgan represented [[Captain Howard Levy|Howard Levy]] who was [[court martial|court-martial]]ed in 1967 at [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], South Carolina, after Levy refused an order to teach dermatology to medical aidmen serving in the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] since he considered the Special Forces \"killers of peasants and murderers of women and children\".<ref name=NYTObit/> Morgan raised the [[Nuremberg Defense]] on behalf of Levy, arguing that U.S. troops were committing atrocities in Vietnam and that American soldiers can lawfully refuse to obey orders related to Vietnam service.<ref>Bigart, Homer. [https://www.nytimes.com/1967/05/21/archives/court-martial-levy-pleads-the-nuremberg-defense-complexion-changes.html \"Court Martial; Levy Pleads the 'Nuremberg Defense' Complexion Changes Defense Strategy Soldier's Rights\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 21, 1967. Accessed January 12, 2009.</ref> Levy was sentenced to three years in prison, and was released after serving more than two years.<ref name=NYTObit/>

At a party in Washington, D.C., an attendee from New York indicated that he would not vote for [[Jimmy Carter]] for president because of his [[Southern American English|Southern accent]], to which Morgan replied \"That's [[bigotry]], and that makes you a bigot.\" [[Aryeh Neier]], the ACLU's executive director, reprimanded Morgan, and criticized Morgan for taking a public position on a candidate for public office.<ref name=NYTObit/> Morgan resigned from his post in April 1976, citing efforts by the bureaucracy at the ACLU to restrict his public statements.<ref>Illson, Murray. [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/10/archives/washington-chief-of-aclu-resigns-charles-morgan-jr-charges.html \"WASHINGTON CHIEF OF A.C.L.U. RESIGNS; Charles Morgan Jr. Charges Superiors Tried to Restrict His Public Statements\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 10, 1976. Accessed January 12, 2009.</ref>

=== Private practice and later life ===
After leaving the ACLU, Morgan spent the remainder of his career in private practice. He represented the [[Tobacco Institute]] in its opposition to smoking bans and won a number of cases for [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] in which the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) had accused the company of racial and sexual discrimination due not to complaints from employees but rather due to EEOC analysis of data from Sears which was interpreted as evidence of discrimination. Sears won their case, in part, because the EEOC was unable to produce a single witness who alleged discriminatory hiring or promotion within Sears.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref>EEOC v.

During his lifetime, Charles Morgan wrote two books: ''A Time to Speak'' (describing his experiences prior to 1963) and ''One Man, One Vote'' (describing his experiences in the 1960s and 1970s). In ''A Time to Speak'', Morgan wrote: \"What's it like living in Birmingham? No one ever really has known and no one will until this city becomes part of the United States. Birmingham is not a dying city; it is dead.\"<ref name=\"speechthatshockedbirmingham\"/><ref name=\"charlesmorganjr\"/>

Morgan died at age 78 on January 8, 2009, at his home in [[Destin, Florida]], as a result of complications from [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name=APObit/>

In 1972, the ACLU named Morgan as the legislative director of its national office in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=APObit/> Morgan led the ACLU's effort to have President [[Richard Nixon]] impeached from office.<ref name=\"charlesmorganjr78diesleadingcivilrightslawyer\"/> In June 1973, though there was little talk of impeachment among the public, Morgan predicted to his staff that Nixon would be removed from office “by the end of the year.” He edited and published a 56-page handbook entitled “Why President Richard Nixon Should Be Impeached,” explaining the process, which the public barely knew about. He circulated it to all members of the [[United States Congress]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/impeachment-book-offered-by-aclu.html Impeachment Book Offered by ACLU], The New York Times, 25 Nov. 1973.</ref>

Morgan and a group of other lawyers filed a lawsuit in 1962 that aimed to require [[Apportionment (politics)|reapportionment]] of the [[Alabama Legislature]], to undo a system under which rural counties in southern Alabama had far greater voting strength than areas in the urbanized northern portion of the state. In the 1964 Supreme Court case ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', Morgan successfully argued that districts in state legislatures needed to be of nearly equal size, establishing the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\" to effectively end the use of [[gerrymandering]] that gave greater political power to the rural legislators who controlled the Alabama Legislature.<ref name=NYTObit>Reed, Roy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/us/10morgan.html \"Charles Morgan Jr., 78, Dies; Leading Civil Rights Lawyer\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 9, 2009. Accessed January 12, 2009.</ref><ref name=APObit/> Morgan was also a part of the ''White v. Crook'' case. This case caused Alabama juries to become racially integrated and declared that barring women from the Alabama juries was unconstitutional. Another case Morgan was involved in was ''Whitus v. Georgia'' of 1967. In this case, five Georgian death penalty convictions were set aside because the case declared discriminatory juries as a result of racially segregated tax digests unconstitutional.<ref name=charlesmorganjr>{{cite web|url=http://www.alabar.org/members/hallfame/2011/Charles_Morgan.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802204309/http://www.alabar.org/members/hallfame/2011/Charles_Morgan.cfm |archivedate=2013-08-02 }} Alabama State Bar. \"Charles Morgan, Jr.\" Alabama State Bar.

After [[Julian Bond]] was prevented from taking his seat in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] after having made statements opposing United States involvement in the Vietnam War, Morgan appealed to the United States Supreme Court successfully to have Bond seated.<ref name=APObit/>

He also served on [[Muhammad Ali]]'s legal team that appealed his conviction on [[draft evasion]] after Ali refused to serve during the Vietnam War citing religious objections, and successfully appealed the case before the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref name=APObit/>

In 1967, Morgan represented [[Captain Howard Levy|Howard Levy]] who was [[court martial|court-martial]]ed in 1967 at [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], South Carolina, after Levy refused an order to teach dermatology to medical aidmen serving in the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] since he considered the Special Forces \"killers of peasants and murderers of women and children\".<ref name=NYTObit/> Morgan raised the [[Nuremberg Defense]] on behalf of Levy, arguing that U.S. troops were committing atrocities in Vietnam and that American soldiers can lawfully refuse to obey orders related to Vietnam service.<ref>Bigart, Homer. [https://www.nytimes.com/1967/05/21/archives/court-martial-levy-pleads-the-nuremberg-defense-complexion-changes.html \"Court Martial; Levy Pleads the 'Nuremberg Defense' Complexion Changes Defense Strategy Soldier's Rights\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 21, 1967. Accessed January 12, 2009.</ref> Levy was sentenced to three years in prison, and was released after serving more than two years.<ref name=NYTObit/>

At a party in Washington, D.C., an attendee from New York indicated that he would not vote for [[Jimmy Carter]] for president because of his [[Southern American English|Southern accent]], to which Morgan replied \"That's [[bigotry]], and that makes you a bigot.\" [[Aryeh Neier]], the ACLU's executive director, reprimanded Morgan, and criticized Morgan for taking a public position on a candidate for public office.<ref name=NYTObit/> Morgan resigned from his post in April 1976, citing efforts by the bureaucracy at the ACLU to restrict his public statements.<ref>Illson, Murray. [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/10/archives/washington-chief-of-aclu-resigns-charles-morgan-jr-charges.html \"WASHINGTON CHIEF OF A.C.L.U.

=== Private practice and later life ===
After leaving the ACLU, Morgan spent the remainder of his career in private practice. He represented the [[Tobacco Institute]] in its opposition to smoking bans and won a number of cases for [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] in which the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) had accused the company of racial and sexual discrimination due not to complaints from employees but rather due to EEOC analysis of data from Sears which was interpreted as evidence of discrimination. Sears won their case, in part, because the EEOC was unable to produce a single witness who alleged discriminatory hiring or promotion within Sears.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref>EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 628 F. Supp. 1264 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (Sears II).</ref><ref>Possley, Maurice (1986).

During his lifetime, Charles Morgan wrote two books: ''A Time to Speak'' (describing his experiences prior to 1963) and ''One Man, One Vote'' (describing his experiences in the 1960s and 1970s). In ''A Time to Speak'', Morgan wrote: \"What's it like living in Birmingham? No one ever really has known and no one will until this city becomes part of the United States. Birmingham is not a dying city; it is dead.\"<ref name=\"speechthatshockedbirmingham\"/><ref name=\"charlesmorganjr\"/>

Morgan died at age 78 on January 8, 2009, at his home in [[Destin, Florida]], as a result of complications from [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name=APObit/>

The '''Sportsperson of the Year''' awards are a group of awards awarded to the most popular [[Luxembourg]]ish sportsperson of the preceding year. There are two main categories: one for men ({{lang-fr|Trophée du Meilleur Sportif}}), and one for women (''Trophée de la Meilleure Sportive''). Other awards are given for the best team (''Challenge de la Meilleure Equipe''), best young sportsperson (''Prix du Jeune Espoir''), most honorable sportsperson (''Prix d'Honneur''), and for fair play (''Prix du Fair play''). The current holders of the main awards are [[Bob Bertemes]] and [[Christine Majerus]], while the team award is held by [[F91 Dudelange]].

==List of winners==

[[File:Sandwich lemma.svg|thumb|300px|When a sequence lies between two other converging sequences with the same limit, it also converges to this limit.]]

In [[calculus]], the '''squeeze theorem''', also known as the '''pinching theorem''', the '''sandwich theorem''', the '''sandwich rule''', and sometimes the '''squeeze lemma''', is a [[theorem]] regarding the [[limit of a function]]. In Italy, the theorem is also known as '''theorem of Carabinieri'''.

The squeeze theorem is used in calculus and [[mathematical analysis]]. It is typically used to confirm the limit of a function via comparison with two other functions whose limits are known or easily computed. It was first used geometrically by the [[mathematician]]s [[Archimedes]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] in an effort to compute [[pi|{{pi}}]], and was formulated in modern terms by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

In many languages (e.g. French, German, Italian, Hungarian and Russian), the squeeze theorem is also known as the '''two policemen (and a drunk) theorem''', or some variation thereof.  The story is that if two policemen are escorting a drunk prisoner between them, and both officers go to a cell, then (regardless of the path taken, and the fact that the prisoner may be wobbling about between the policemen) the prisoner must also end up in the cell.

== Statement ==
The squeeze theorem is formally stated as follows.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sohrab|first1=Houshang H.|title=Basic Real Analysis|date=2003|publisher=[[Birkhäuser]]|isbn=978-1-4939-1840-9|page=104|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnpqBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA104}}</ref>
<blockquote>
Let ''I'' be an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] having the point ''a'' as a limit point.  Let ''g'', ''f'', and ''h'' be [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on ''I'', except possibly at ''a'' itself. Suppose that for every ''x'' in ''I'' not equal to ''a'', we have

: <math>g(x) \\leq f(x) \\leq h(x) </math>

and also suppose that

: <math>\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a} h(x) = L. </math>

Then <math>\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L.</math>
</blockquote>

* The functions <math display=\"inline\">g</math> and <math display=\"inline\">h</math> are said to be [[upper bound|lower and upper bounds]] (respectively) of <math display=\"inline\">f</math>.
* Here, <math display=\"inline\">a</math> is ''not'' required to lie in the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of <math display=\"inline\">I</math>. Indeed, if <math display=\"inline\">a</math> is an endpoint of <math display=\"inline\">I</math>, then the above limits are left- or right-hand limits.
* A similar statement holds for infinite intervals: for example, if <math display=\"inline\">I=(0, \\infty)</math>, then the conclusion holds, taking the limits as <math display=\"inline\">x \\rightarrow \\infty</math>.
This theorem is also valid for sequences. Let <math>(a_n), (c_n)</math> be two sequences converging to <math>\\ell</math>, and <math>(b_n)</math> a sequence. If <math>\\forall n\\geqslant N, N\\in\\mathbb{N}</math> we have <math>a_n\\leqslant b_n\\leqslant c_n</math>, then <math>(b_n)</math> also converges to <math>\\ell</math>.

===Proof===
From the above hypotheses we have, taking the [[limit inferior]] and superior:
:<math>L=\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)\\leq\\liminf_{x\\to a}f(x) \\leq  \\limsup_{x\\to a}f(x)\\leq \\lim_{x \\to a}h(x)=L,</math>
so all the inequalities are indeed equalities, and the thesis immediately follows.

A direct proof, using the <math>(\\epsilon, \\delta)</math>-definition of limit, would be to prove that for all real <math display=\"inline\">\\epsilon > 0</math> there exists a real <math>\\delta > 0</math> such that for all <math>x</math> with <math>|x - a| < \\delta</math>, we have <math>|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon</math>. Symbolically,

: <math> \\forall \\epsilon > 0, \\exists \\delta > 0 : \\forall x, (|x - a | < \\delta \\ \\Rightarrow  |f(x) - L |< \\epsilon).</math>

As

: <math>\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) = L </math>

means that

: <math> \\forall \\varepsilon > 0, \\exists \\ \\delta_1 > 0 : \\forall x\\ (|x - a| < \\delta_1 \\ \\Rightarrow \\ |g(x) - L |< \\varepsilon).\\qquad (1)</math>

and 
: <math>\\lim_{x \\to a} h(x) = L </math>

means that

: <math> \\forall \\varepsilon > 0, \\exists \\ \\delta_2 > 0 : \\forall x\\ (|x - a | < \\delta_2\\ \\Rightarrow \\ |h(x) - L |< \\varepsilon),\\qquad (2)</math>

then we have

: <math>g(x) \\leq f(x) \\leq h(x) </math>
: <math>g(x) - L\\leq f(x) - L\\leq h(x) - L</math>

We can choose <math>\\delta:=\\min\\left\\{\\delta_1,\\delta_2\\right\\}</math>. Then, if <math>|x - a|<\\delta</math>, combining (1) and (2), we have

: <math> - \\varepsilon < g(x) - L\\leq f(x) - L\\leq h(x) - L\\ < \\varepsilon, </math>
: <math> - \\varepsilon < f(x) - L < \\varepsilon </math>,

which completes the proof.  <math>\\blacksquare</math>

The proof for sequences is very similar, using the <math>\\epsilon</math>-definition of a limit of a sequence.

== Statement for series ==
There is also the squeeze theorem for series, which can be stated as follows:{{cn|date=March 2018}}
<blockquote>Let <math>\\sum_n a_n, \\sum_n c_n</math> be two convergent series. If <math>\\exists N\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>N, a_n\\leqslant b_n \\leqslant c_n </math>then <math>\\sum_n b_n </math> also converges.</blockquote>

=== Proof ===
Let <math>\\sum_n a_n, \\sum_n c_n</math> be two convergent series. Hence, the sequences <math>\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n a_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty}, \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n c_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty} </math> are Cauchy. That is, for fixed <math>\\epsilon>0 </math>,

<math>\\exists N_1\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>m>N_1, \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^na_n-\\sum_{k=1}^ma_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon<\\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n<\\epsilon </math> (1)

and similarly <math>\\exists N_2\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>m>N_2, \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^nc_n-\\sum_{k=1}^mc_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon<\\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n<\\epsilon </math> (2).

We know that <math>\\exists N_3\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>N_3, a_n\\leqslant b_n \\leqslant c_n </math>. Hence, <math>\\forall n>m>\\max\\{N_1,N_2,N_3\\} </math>, we have combining (1) and (2):

<math>a_n\\leqslant b_n\\leqslant c_n \\Longrightarrow \\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n \\leqslant \\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n \\leqslant \\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon< \\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n <\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^n b_n-\\sum_{k=1}^m b_n\\right|<\\epsilon </math>.

Therefore <math>\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n b_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty} </math>is a Cauchy sequence. So <math>\\sum_n b_n </math> converges. <math>\\blacksquare</math>

== Examples ==

=== First example ===

[[File:Inst_satsen.png|thumb|right|250px|''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;sin(1/''x'') being squeezed in the limit as x goes to 0]]

The limit

: <math>\\lim_{x \\to 0}x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math>

cannot be determined through the limit law

: <math>\\lim_{x \\to a}(f(x)\\cdot g(x)) = 
\\lim_{x \\to a}f(x)\\cdot \\lim_{x \\to a}g(x),</math>

because

: <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math>

does not exist.

However, by the definition of the [[sine function]],

: <math>-1 \\le \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x}) \\le 1. </math>

It follows that

: <math>-x^2 \\le x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x}) \\le x^2 </math>

Since <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^2 = \\lim_{x\\to 0}x^2 = 0</math>, by the squeeze theorem, <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0} x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math> must also be 0.

=== Second example ===
[[File:Limit_sin_x_x.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Comparing areas:<br/><math>\\begin{align}&\\, A(\\triangle ADF) \\geq A(\\text{sector}\\, ADB) \\geq A(\\triangle ADB)\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\, \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\tan(x)\\cdot 1 \\geq \\frac{x}{2\\pi}\\cdot \\pi \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\sin(x)\\cdot 1\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\, \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)} \\geq x \\geq \\sin(x)\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\, \\frac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)} \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)} \\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\, \\cos(x) \\leq \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\leq 1 \\end{align} </math>]]
Probably the best-known examples of finding a limit by squeezing are the proofs of the equalities

: <math>
\\begin{align}
& \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} =1, \\\\[10pt]
& \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{1 - \\cos(x)}{x} = 0.
\\end{align}
</math>

The first limit follows by means of the squeeze theorem from the fact that

: <math> \\cos x \\leq \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\leq 1 </math><ref>Selim G. Krejn, V.N. Uschakowa: ''Vorstufe zur höheren Mathematik''. Springer, 2013, {{ISBN|9783322986283}}, pp.
 [https://books.google.de/books?id=-yXMBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA80 80-81] (German). See also [[Sal Khan]]: [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/limits-from-equations-ab/squeeze-theorem-ab/v/proof-lim-sin-x-x ''Proof: limit of (sin x)/x at x=0''] (video, [[Khan Academy]])</ref>

for ''x'' close enough to 0. The correctness of which for positive x can be seen by simple geometric reasoning (see drawing) that can be extended to negative x as well. The second limit follows from the squeeze theorem and the fact that

: <math> 0 \\leq  \\frac{1 - \\cos(x)}{x}  \\leq  x </math>
for ''x'' close enough to 0. This can be derived by replacing <math>\\sin(x)</math> in the earlier fact by <math>\\sqrt{1-\\cos(x)^2}</math> and squaring the resulting inequality.

These two limits are used in proofs of the fact that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function.  That fact is relied on in other proofs of derivatives of trigonometric functions.

=== Third example ===

It is possible to show that

: <math> \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\tan\\theta = \\sec^2\\theta </math>

by squeezing, as follows.

[[File:Tangent.squeeze.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right]]

In the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is

: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2}, </math>

since the radius is sec&nbsp;''&theta;'' and the arc on the [[unit circle]] has length&nbsp;Δ''&theta;''.  Similarly, the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is

: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta)\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2}. </math>

What is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots.  The length of the base of the triangle is&nbsp;tan(''&theta;''&nbsp;+&nbsp;Δ''&theta;'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;tan(''&theta;''), and the height is&nbsp;1.  The area of the triangle is therefore

: <math> \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{2}. </math>

From the inequalities

: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2} \\le \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{2} \\le \\frac{\\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta)\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2} </math>

we deduce that

: <math> \\sec^2\\theta \\le \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{\\Delta\\theta} \\le \\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta),</math>

provided&nbsp;Δ''&theta;''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, and the inequalities are reversed if&nbsp;Δ''&theta;''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.  Since the first and third expressions approach sec<sup>2</sup>''&theta;'' as Δ''&theta;''&nbsp;→&nbsp;0, and the middle expression approaches (''d''/''d&theta;'')&nbsp;tan&nbsp;''&theta;'', the desired result follows.

=== Fourth example ===

The squeeze theorem can still be used in multivariable calculus but the lower (and upper functions) must be below (and above) the target function not just along a path but around the entire neighborhood of the point of interest and it only works if the function really does have a limit there. It can, therefore, be used to prove that a function has a limit at a point, but it can never be used to prove that a function does not have a limit at a point.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 15.2 Limits and Continuity|pages=909–910|title=Multivariable Calculus|year=2008|last1=Stewart|first1=James|authorlink1=James_Stewart_(mathematician)|edition=6th|isbn=0495011630}}</ref>

: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}</math>

cannot be found by taking any number of limits along paths that pass through the point, but since

: <math>0 \\leq \\frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2} \\leq 1</math>
: <math>-\\left | y \\right \\vert \\leq y \\leq \\left | y \\right \\vert </math>
: <math>-\\left | y \\right \\vert \\leq \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} \\leq \\left | y \\right \\vert </math>
: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} -\\left | y \\right \\vert = 0</math>
: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\left |y \\right \\vert = 0</math>
: <math>0  \\leq  \\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}  \\leq  0</math>

therefore, by the squeeze theorem,

: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} = 0</math>

[[File:Sandwich lemma.svg|thumb|300px|When a sequence lies between two other converging sequences with the same limit, it also converges to this limit.]]

The proof for sequences is very similar, using the <math>\\epsilon</math>-definition of a limit of a sequence.

== Statement for series ==
There is also the squeeze theorem for series, which can be stated as follows:{{cn|date=March 2018}}
<blockquote>Let <math>\\sum_n a_n, \\sum_n c_n</math> be two convergent series. If <math>\\exists N\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>N, a_n\\leqslant b_n \\leqslant c_n </math>then <math>\\sum_n b_n </math> also converges.</blockquote>

=== Proof ===
Let <math>\\sum_n a_n, \\sum_n c_n</math> be two convergent series. Hence, the sequences <math>\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n a_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty}, \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n c_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty} </math> are Cauchy. That is, for fixed <math>\\epsilon>0 </math>,

<math>\\exists N_1\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>m>N_1, \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^na_n-\\sum_{k=1}^ma_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon<\\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n<\\epsilon </math> (1)

and similarly <math>\\exists N_2\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>m>N_2, \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^nc_n-\\sum_{k=1}^mc_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon<\\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n<\\epsilon </math> (2).

We know that <math>\\exists N_3\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>N_3, a_n\\leqslant b_n \\leqslant c_n </math>. Hence, <math>\\forall n>m>\\max\\{N_1,N_2,N_3\\} </math>, we have combining (1) and (2):

<math>a_n\\leqslant b_n\\leqslant c_n \\Longrightarrow \\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n \\leqslant \\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n \\leqslant \\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon< \\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n <\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^n b_n-\\sum_{k=1}^m b_n\\right|<\\epsilon </math>.

Therefore <math>\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n b_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty} </math>is a Cauchy sequence. So <math>\\sum_n b_n </math> converges. <math>\\blacksquare</math>

== Examples ==

=== First example ===

[[File:Inst_satsen.png|thumb|right|250px|''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;sin(1/''x'') being squeezed in the limit as x goes to 0]]

The limit

: <math>\\lim_{x \\to 0}x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math>

cannot be determined through the limit law

: <math>\\lim_{x \\to a}(f(x)\\cdot g(x)) = 
\\lim_{x \\to a}f(x)\\cdot \\lim_{x \\to a}g(x),</math>

because

: <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math>

does not exist.

However, by the definition of the [[sine function]],

: <math>-1 \\le \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x}) \\le 1. </math>

It follows that

: <math>-x^2 \\le x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x}) \\le x^2 </math>

Since <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^2 = \\lim_{x\\to 0}x^2 = 0</math>, by the squeeze theorem, <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0} x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math> must also be 0.

=== Second example ===

& \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{1 - \\cos(x)}{x} = 0.

The first limit follows by means of the squeeze theorem from the fact that

 [https://books.google.de/books?id=-yXMBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA80 80-81] (German). See also [[Sal Khan]]: [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/limits-from-equations-ab/squeeze-theorem-ab/v/proof-lim-sin-x-x ''Proof: limit of (sin x)/x at x=0''] (video, [[Khan Academy]])</ref>

for ''x'' close enough to 0. The correctness of which for positive x can be seen by simple geometric reasoning (see drawing) that can be extended to negative x as well. The second limit follows from the squeeze theorem and the fact that

: <math> 0 \\leq  \\frac{1 - \\cos(x)}{x}  \\leq  x </math>
for ''x'' close enough to 0. This can be derived by replacing <math>\\sin(x)</math> in the earlier fact by <math>\\sqrt{1-\\cos(x)^2}</math> and squaring the resulting inequality.

These two limits are used in proofs of the fact that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function.  That fact is relied on in other proofs of derivatives of trigonometric functions.

=== Third example ===

It is possible to show that

: <math> \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\tan\\theta = \\sec^2\\theta </math>

by squeezing, as follows.

[[File:Tangent.squeeze.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right]]

In the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is

: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2}, </math>

since the radius is sec&nbsp;''&theta;'' and the arc on the [[unit circle]] has length&nbsp;Δ''&theta;''.  Similarly, the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is

: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta)\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2}. </math>

What is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots.  The length of the base of the triangle is&nbsp;tan(''&theta;''&nbsp;+&nbsp;Δ''&theta;'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;tan(''&theta;''), and the height is&nbsp;1.  The area of the triangle is therefore

: <math> \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{2}. </math>

From the inequalities

: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2} \\le \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{2} \\le \\frac{\\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta)\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2} </math>

we deduce that

: <math> \\sec^2\\theta \\le \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{\\Delta\\theta} \\le \\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta),</math>

provided&nbsp;Δ''&theta;''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, and the inequalities are reversed if&nbsp;Δ''&theta;''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.  Since the first and third expressions approach sec<sup>2</sup>''&theta;'' as Δ''&theta;''&nbsp;→&nbsp;0, and the middle expression approaches (''d''/''d&theta;'')&nbsp;tan&nbsp;''&theta;'', the desired result follows.

=== Fourth example ===

The squeeze theorem can still be used in multivariable calculus but the lower (and upper functions) must be below (and above) the target function not just along a path but around the entire neighborhood of the point of interest and it only works if the function really does have a limit there. It can, therefore, be used to prove that a function has a limit at a point, but it can never be used to prove that a function does not have a limit at a point.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 15.2 Limits and Continuity|pages=909–910|title=Multivariable Calculus|year=2008|last1=Stewart|first1=James|authorlink1=James_Stewart_(mathematician)|edition=6th|isbn=0495011630}}</ref>

: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}</math>

cannot be found by taking any number of limits along paths that pass through the point, but since

: <math>0 \\leq \\frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2} \\leq 1</math>
: <math>-\\left | y \\right \\vert \\leq y \\leq \\left | y \\right \\vert </math>
: <math>-\\left | y \\right \\vert \\leq \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} \\leq \\left | y \\right \\vert </math>
: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} -\\left | y \\right \\vert = 0</math>
: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\left |y \\right \\vert = 0</math>
: <math>0  \\leq  \\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}  \\leq  0</math>

therefore, by the squeeze theorem,

: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} = 0</math>

'''Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln III''' (April 4, 1853 – July 15, 1871) was the fourth and youngest son of [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham]] and [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. The nickname \"Tad\" was given to him by his father, who observed that he had a large head and was \"as wiggly as a tadpole\" when he was a baby. Lincoln was known to be impulsive and unrestrained, and he did not attend school during his father's lifetime. He had free run of the [[White House]], and there are stories of him interrupting presidential meetings, collecting animals, and charging visitors to see his father. He died at the age of 18 on July 15, 1871, in [[Chicago]].

==Early life and education==
Lincoln was born on April 4, 1853,<ref>Manning (2016), page 75</ref> the fourth son of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]]. His three elder brothers were [[Robert Todd Lincoln|Robert]] (1843–1926), [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Edward]] (1846–1850), and [[William Wallace Lincoln|William]] (1850–1862).{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Named after his paternal grandfather [[Thomas Lincoln]] and uncle Thomas Lincoln, Jr., the fourth boy was soon nicknamed \"Tad\" by his father, for his small body and large head, and because he wiggled like a [[tadpole]] as an infant.<ref name=\"wead8990\">Wead (2003), pp. 89–90.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCSNCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Father Lincoln: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and His Boys--Robert, Eddy, Willie, and Tad|last=Manning|first=Alan|date=2016-05-01|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781493018246|language=en}}</ref> Lincoln's first name has occasionally been erroneously recorded as Thaddeus.<ref>Bayne (2001), p. 13</ref>

Lincoln was born with a form of [[cleft lip and palate]], causing him speech problems throughout his life.

Lincoln and his brother Willie were considered \"notorious hellions\" during the period they lived in Springfield. They were recorded by their father's law partner [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] as having turned their law office upside down, pulling the books off the shelves, while their father appeared oblivious to their behavior.<ref name=\"wead90\">Wead (2003), p. 90.</ref>

==White House years==
[[File:A&TLincoln.jpg|thumb|Tad Lincoln with his father looking at a photo album]]
Upon their father's election as President, both Tad and Willie moved into the White House and it became their new playground and home. At the request of Mrs. Lincoln, [[Julia Taft Bayne|Julia Taft]] brought her younger brothers, 14-year-old \"Bud\" (Horatio Nelson Taft Jr., 1847–1915) and 12-year-old \"Holly\" (Halsey Cook Taft, 1849–1897), to the White House, and they became playmates of the two young Lincolns.<ref name=\"wead91\">Wead (2003), p. 91.</ref><ref name=\"Bayne1-3\">Bayne (2001), pp. 1–3.</ref>

In February 1862, both Lincoln boys contracted [[typhoid fever]] and both boys were bedridden. Willie died on February 20, while Tad recovered. However he cried for a month, not only for his brother's death, but for the loss of his other two playmates Bud and Holly, for his mother sent them away after Willie's death, because they reminded her too much of him. After Willie's death, Tad's parents became even more lenient toward Tad's behavior, and Tad spent nearly all his time with his father.<ref name=\"wead9192\">Wead (2003), pp. 91–92.</ref>

During the time his father was alive, Tad was impulsive, unrestrained, and did not attend school. [[John Hay]] wrote that the boy's numerous tutors in the White House usually quit in frustration. Tad had free run of the White House, and there are stories of him interrupting presidential meetings, collecting animals, charging visitors to see his father, and more.<ref>{{cite web |author=R. J.

On April 14, 1865, Tad went to [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Grover's Theatre]] to see the play ''Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp'' while his parents attended the performance of ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Ford's Theatre]]. That night, his father was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|fatally shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]]. When news of the assassination spread to Grover's Theatre, the manager made an announcement to the entire audience. Tad began running and screaming, \"They killed Papa! They killed Papa!\" He was escorted back to the White House while his mother pleaded to have him brought to his father's deathbed at the [[Petersen House]]. \"Bring Tad—he will speak to Tad—he loves him so.\" Late that night, an inconsolable Tad was put to bed by a White House doorman.<ref name=\"wead93\">Wead (2003), p. 93.</ref> President Lincoln died the next morning, on Saturday, April 15, at 7:22 am.<ref name = \"Heritage\">{{cite journal|title=How Did Lincoln Die?|journal=American Heritage|date=February–March 1995|volume=46|issue=1|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/how-did-lincoln-die?page=show|author=Richard A. R. Fraser, MD}}</ref> About the death of his father, Tad said:

<blockquote>
Pa is dead. I can hardly believe that I shall never see him again. I must learn to take care of myself now. Yes, Pa is dead, and I am only Tad Lincoln now, little Tad, like other little boys. I am not a president's son now. I won't have many presents anymore. Well, I will try and be a good boy, and will hope to go someday to Pa and brother Willie, in Heaven.<ref name=\"wead9394\">Wead (2003), pp. 93–94.</ref>
</blockquote>

==Later life==
After the assassination, Mary, Robert, and Tad Lincoln lived together in Chicago.  Robert moved out after a short time, and Tad began attending school. In 1868, they left Chicago and lived in Europe for almost three years, in Germany and later in England.<ref name=\"Emerson\">{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=Jason|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Lincoln suffered from what one modern commentator has called a \"complex speech and language disorder\" related to some form of a cleft lip or palate. This caused some problems when Lincoln was in school in Chicago.  While at the [[Elizabeth Street School (Chicago)|Elizabeth Street School]], his schoolmates sometimes called him \"Stuttering Tad\" because of the speech impediment,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=John M.|title=What Was Tad Lincoln's Speech Problem?|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|date=Winter 2009|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jala;view=text;rgn=main;idno=2629860.0030.105|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref> which he was able to overcome as a teenager.<ref name = \"Emerson\"/>

Funeral services were held for Lincoln in his brother Robert's home in Chicago. His body was transported to Springfield and buried in the [[Lincoln Tomb]] at [[Oak Ridge Cemetery]], alongside his father and two of his brothers. Robert accompanied the casket on the train, but Mary was too distraught to make the trip.<ref>Davenport, pages 153 –154</ref>

==Later life==
After the assassination, Mary, Robert, and Tad Lincoln lived together in Chicago.  Robert moved out after a short time, and Tad began attending school. In 1868, they left Chicago and lived in Europe for almost three years, in Germany and later in England.<ref name=\"Emerson\">{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=Jason|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Lincoln suffered from what one modern commentator has called a \"complex speech and language disorder\" related to some form of a cleft lip or palate. This caused some problems when Lincoln was in school in Chicago.  While at the [[Elizabeth Street School (Chicago)|Elizabeth Street School]], his schoolmates sometimes called him \"Stuttering Tad\" because of the speech impediment,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=John M.|title=What Was Tad Lincoln's Speech Problem?|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|date=Winter 2009|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jala;view=text;rgn=main;idno=2629860.0030.105|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref> which he was able to overcome as a teenager.<ref name = \"Emerson\"/>

{{Campaignbox Burma}}

The '''Northern Combat Area Command''' or '''NCAC''' was a subcommand of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[South East Asia Command]] (SEAC) during [[World War II]]. It controlled Allied ground operations in northern [[Burma]]. For most of its existence NCAC was commanded by [[United States Army|US Army]] General [[Joseph Stilwell|Joseph \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell]] (who concurrently held more senior command positions). In 1945 after Stilwell was recalled, his deputy, Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan|Daniel Sultan]], was promoted to and assumed command.

[[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese National Army]] personnel constituted most of the combat units within NCAC.

While it was initially intended that NCAC would operate as an integral part of the [[British 11th Army Group]], Stilwell refused to work under General [[George Giffard]] and was made subordinate to the Supreme Commander of SEAC, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]].

==Composition==
In 1942, Northern Combat Area Command was formed at [[Ramgarh Cantonment]], in India, from [[X Force]]:  units (including the [[Chinese 22nd Division|22nd]] and [[Chinese 38th Division|38th]] Divisions), which had [[Japanese capture of Burma|retreated out of Burma]]. After its arrival in India, X Force was reinforced – eventually becoming the [[New 1st Army]] – a [[corps|corps-level]] formation. It was re-equipped at [[United Kingdom|British]] expense and re-trained by US Army instructors.

For the [[Burma Campaign 1944|campaigning season of early 1944]], NCAC was augmented with [[Merrill's Marauders]] – a brigade-sized formation created by the US Army for commando-type operations in Burma. During 1944, NCAC forced the [[Japanese 18th Division]] to retreat out of northern Burma and US Army engineering battalions, assisted by [[India]]n laborers built the [[Ledo Road]] – which joined the northern end of the [[Burma Road]] and reestablished [[line of communications|communications]] between India and China. Towards the end of 1944, NCAC was reinforced by the [[British 36th Infantry Division]].

In 1945, under Sultan's command, NCAC – which now included the Chinese [[New 6th Army]] – aided in the drive to retake the rest of Burma.

==Campaigns==
The main combat power of NCAC, at least in terms of numbers were its Chinese divisions. When British and Chinese forces had been bundled out of Burma at the start of 1942, some Chinese forces had been obliged to retreat to [[India]], rather than to [[China]]. It was from these formations that the genesis of NCAC came.

Many times during World War II, British and American commanders in India were frustrated by their Chinese allies. A combination of fickleness and over-centralisation by the Chinese [[generalissimo]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the limited training of the Chinese forces meant that they often failed to live up to their potential. However, the Chinese forces in NCAC were considerably better than their contemporaries in China itself. Greater access to American equipment and training and less influence from the Chinese leadership meant the four Chinese divisions in NCAC could be trusted a great deal more in combat.

However, it was not only from NCAC's divisions that trouble sprang. Its first commander was an extremely controversial character. Stilwell had first been posted to China as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek. However, as the campaign in Burma developed, he also took on a role there. The [[United States Army|US Army]] established the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] (CBI Theater), and placed Stilwell in command. The CBI Theater was not supposed to be an operational headquarters. It was merely supposed to be in charge of the administration of the American military formations in China, Burma and India. However, Stilwell often broke the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and communicated directly with the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] on operational matters, when all such communications were supposed to go to Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] the [[South East Asia Command|Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia]] and also on taking operational control of NCAC through General [[George Giffard]] commander of [[British 11th Army Group|11th Army Group]].

The initial idea was that as General Stilwell would be commanding several Chinese divisions which would attack out of India from the West and with the large but amorphous Yunnan armies attacking out of China from the East, he would be commanding a large army. So his command should be placed under 11th Army Group at the same level as the [[British Fourteenth Army|Fourteenth]] which was under the command of General [[William Slim]]. The attacks could then be co-ordinated at Army Group level.

{{quote|Stilwell, however bitterly resisted [being under Giffard's command]. To watch Stilwell, when hard pressed, shift his opposition from one of the several strong-points he held by virtue of his numerous Allied, American and Chinese offices, to another was a lesson in mobile offensive-defence.|William Slim.{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=205}} }}

At a meeting to sort out the operational chain of command for the three fronts in Burma, Stilwell astonished everyone by saying \"I am prepared to come under General  Slim's operational control until I get to [[Kamaing]]\".{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=207}} Rather than sack him, Mountbatten reluctantly agreed to this, but it was a dangerous compromise. It created a complicated chain of command where Slim theoretically had to report to two different commanders. Giffard for Fourteenth Army actions and Mountbatten for Stilwell's formations. Under a general less gifted than Slim this could have caused serious problems, if Slim had not been able to command Stilwell at an operational level without disagreement (which given Stilwell's proven track record was more than likely). But at an operational level Slim was able to work with Stilwell and \"this illogical command set-up worked surprisingly well\".{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=207}}

The reason why it was essential that there was one operational commander for the three fronts, North, Central and Southern, was so that the intended attacks in late 1944 could be co-ordinated to prevent the Japanese concentrating large numbers of reserves for a counterattack on any one front.

Stilwell thus had four different jobs to perform, which required him to be in different places at once. For example, as Chief of Staff to Chiang, he was often needed in [[Chungking]], the Chinese capital, and as Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was needed at HQ South East Asia Command at [[Kandy]] in [[Ceylon]] and as NCAC commander he was required to be relatively near the frontline in Burma. His personality also caused problems. Stilwell clashed frequently with the commander of the 11th Army Group, General Giffard, and would not accept being under his command, instead insisting that NCAC came directly under the Supreme Commander. As Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was Giffard's superior but as operational commander of NCAC Giffard was his superior, as the two men did not get on this inevitablely lead to conflict and confusion.

NCAC's first months were frustrating, as the time was for all Allied formations in the theater. Its first real success did not come until the 1943-44 campaigning season. The [[Chindits]] had been dropped behind enemy lines after the end of the 1943 monsoon to cause havoc by cutting communications. This they did, but the original operational plan failed for a number of reasons. In the end, they were sent northwards into NCAC's area of operations.

At the time, NCAC's main job was to capture the town of [[Myitkyina]], as a prelude to connecting the [[Ledo Road]] to the [[Burma Road]] and reestablishing land communications to China.  During the offensive, NCAC intelligence staff serving under General Stilwell repeatedly underestimated Japanese troop strength in Burma.{{sfn|George|1981|p=492}}{{sfn|Tuchman|2001|p=450}}  A thrust from the northwest by NCAC was meeting with some success, but Stilwell also needed to use the Chindits in his plan. However, he not only used them, but misused them. The Chindits were designed as a light raiding force, not as conventional infantry. They had negligible artillery support, and were much smaller in number than equivalent conventional formations. However, Stilwell insisted on using them as conventional infantry. He assigned them the task of [[Battle of Mogaung|capturing Mogaung]] south of Myitkyina, which was strongly held by the Japanese. The Chindits succeeded in their task, but had horrendous casualties. Even then Stilwell was not finished. He demanded still further miracles from the Chindits and their commander Brigadier [[Walter David Alexander Lentaigne|Lentaigne]]. Reduced to the equivalent of less than a battalion, the Chindits assisted in the final assault on Myitkyina before finally bein flown out to India as a completely broken force, almost to a man. The American equivalent of the Chindits, [[Merrill's Marauders]] also suffered from the same treatment during the campaign, consistently being asked to perform missions that were beyond their power without superhuman effort.

After the fall of Myitkyina, only a small area of Japanese territory separated NCAC from the Chinese forces. As the 1944 monsoon ended, NCAC opened an offensive. It had been reinforced with the [[British 36th Infantry Division]], which gave it a considerably increased punch. However, the [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|Japanese 33rd Army]] under General [[Masaki Honda]] performed a very creditable delaying action against the forces attacking them. The Japanese were outnumbered several times, but still managed to hold the Chinese forces at bay for several months. In the end, it was events on the main front further south that forced them to withdraw, as they were in danger of being cut off from their supply lines. 36th Division was used to support the left wing of the [[British Fourteenth Army|Fourteenth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[William Slim]].

In October 1944, due to personal disagreements with Chiang, Stilwell was recalled to the [[United States]] by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]. His former role was split as was the CBI Theater:
*  Lieutenant General [[Raymond Albert Wheeler|Raymond Wheeler]] became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia.
*  Major General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer|Albert Wedemeyer]] became Chief of Staff to ''Chiang Kai-shek'' and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT).
* Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan]] was promoted from deputy commander of CBI to become commander of the U.S. Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC.

His replacements were not only less abrasive characters, but as they each concentrated on one area there was less institutional conflict and confusion.

NCAC's main role in the last few months of the war was to support the British main offensive further south, and to further improve the Burma Road to allow more supplies to get into China.

After the war, NCAC was quickly disbanded. It had achieved its objectives, but the route to those objectives was strewn with command problems and missed opportunities.

At a meeting to sort out the operational chain of command for the three fronts in Burma, Stilwell astonished everyone by saying \"I am prepared to come under General  Slim's operational control until I get to [[Kamaing]]\".{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=207}} Rather than sack him, Mountbatten reluctantly agreed to this, but it was a dangerous compromise. It created a complicated chain of command where Slim theoretically had to report to two different commanders. Giffard for Fourteenth Army actions and Mountbatten for Stilwell's formations. Under a general less gifted than Slim this could have caused serious problems, if Slim had not been able to command Stilwell at an operational level without disagreement (which given Stilwell's proven track record was more than likely). But at an operational level Slim was able to work with Stilwell and \"this illogical command set-up worked surprisingly well\".{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=207}}

The reason why it was essential that there was one operational commander for the three fronts, North, Central and Southern, was so that the intended attacks in late 1944 could be co-ordinated to prevent the Japanese concentrating large numbers of reserves for a counterattack on any one front.

Stilwell thus had four different jobs to perform, which required him to be in different places at once. For example, as Chief of Staff to Chiang, he was often needed in [[Chungking]], the Chinese capital, and as Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was needed at HQ South East Asia Command at [[Kandy]] in [[Ceylon]] and as NCAC commander he was required to be relatively near the frontline in Burma. His personality also caused problems. Stilwell clashed frequently with the commander of the 11th Army Group, General Giffard, and would not accept being under his command, instead insisting that NCAC came directly under the Supreme Commander. As Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was Giffard's superior but as operational commander of NCAC Giffard was his superior, as the two men did not get on this inevitablely lead to conflict and confusion.

NCAC's first months were frustrating, as the time was for all Allied formations in the theater. Its first real success did not come until the 1943-44 campaigning season. The [[Chindits]] had been dropped behind enemy lines after the end of the 1943 monsoon to cause havoc by cutting communications. This they did, but the original operational plan failed for a number of reasons. In the end, they were sent northwards into NCAC's area of operations.

At the time, NCAC's main job was to capture the town of [[Myitkyina]], as a prelude to connecting the [[Ledo Road]] to the [[Burma Road]] and reestablishing land communications to China.  During the offensive, NCAC intelligence staff serving under General Stilwell repeatedly underestimated Japanese troop strength in Burma.{{sfn|George|1981|p=492}}{{sfn|Tuchman|2001|p=450}}  A thrust from the northwest by NCAC was meeting with some success, but Stilwell also needed to use the Chindits in his plan. However, he not only used them, but misused them. The Chindits were designed as a light raiding force, not as conventional infantry. They had negligible artillery support, and were much smaller in number than equivalent conventional formations. However, Stilwell insisted on using them as conventional infantry. He assigned them the task of capturing [[Mogaung]] south of Myitkyina, which was strongly held by the Japanese. The Chindits succeeded in their task, but had horrendous casualties. Even then Stilwell was not finished. He demanded still further miracles from the Chindits and their commander Brigadier [[Walter David Alexander Lentaigne|Lentaigne]]. Reduced to the equivalent of less than a battalion, the Chindits assisted in the final assault on Myitkyina before finally bein flown out to India as a completely broken force, almost to a man. The American equivalent of the Chindits, [[Merrill's Marauders]] also suffered from the same treatment during the campaign, consistently being asked to perform missions that were beyond their power without superhuman effort.

After the fall of Myitkyina, only a small area of Japanese territory separated NCAC from the Chinese forces. As the 1944 monsoon ended, NCAC opened an offensive. It had been reinforced with the [[British 36th Infantry Division]], which gave it a considerably increased punch. However, the [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|Japanese 33rd Army]] under General [[Masaki Honda]] performed a very creditable delaying action against the forces attacking them. The Japanese were outnumbered several times, but still managed to hold the Chinese forces at bay for several months. In the end, it was events on the main front further south that forced them to withdraw, as they were in danger of being cut off from their supply lines. 36th Division was used to support the left wing of the [[British Fourteenth Army|Fourteenth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[William Slim]].

In October 1944, due to personal disagreements with Chiang, Stilwell was recalled to the [[United States]] by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]. His former role was split as was the CBI Theater:
*  Lieutenant General [[Raymond Albert Wheeler|Raymond Wheeler]] became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia.
*  Major General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer|Albert Wedemeyer]] became Chief of Staff to ''Chiang Kai-shek'' and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT).
* Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan]] was promoted from deputy commander of CBI to become commander of the U.S. Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC.

His replacements were not only less abrasive characters, but as they each concentrated on one area there was less institutional conflict and confusion.

NCAC's main role in the last few months of the war was to support the British main offensive further south, and to further improve the Burma Road to allow more supplies to get into China.

After the war, NCAC was quickly disbanded. It had achieved its objectives, but the route to those objectives was strewn with command problems and missed opportunities.

[[File:SKMBT C22013120717220.jpg|thumb|Dead prisoners]]
The '''Gardelegen  massacre''' was a [[massacre]] perpetrated by the German local population from [[Volkssturm]], [[Hitlerjugend]] and local firefighters with minor direction from the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] during [[World War II]]. On April 13, 1945, on the Isenschnibbe estate near the [[North Germany|northern German]] town of [[Gardelegen]], the troops forced 1,016 slave laborers who were part of a transport evacuated from the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] Concentration Camp and from the Hannover-Stöcken Concentration Camp into a large barn which was then set on fire.
1016 prisoners, of which the largest group were Poles, were burned alive or shot trying to escape. The crime was discovered two days later by F Company, 2nd Battalion, 405th Regiment, [[U.S. 102nd Infantry Division]], when the U.S. Army occupied the area. Eleven prisoners were found alive – 7 Poles, 3 Russians and 1 Frenchman. The testimonies of survivors were collected and published by Melchior Wańkowicz in 1969, in the book ''From Stołpców to Cairo''. Gardelegen became a part of the newly established [[German Democratic Republic]] in 1947 and is now in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Germany.

[[File:Gardelegen crosses 83828.jpg|thumb|Under the direction of an American soldier, German civilians from Gardelegen carry wooden crosses to the site where they were ordered to bury the bodies of concentration camp prisoners killed by the SS in a barn just outside the town]]

The discovery of the massacre seems to have been by chance.  The consensus account is that American [[Lieutenant]] Emerson Hunt, a liaison officer <!--(____unit____)--> between Ozark HQ and the 701st Tank Battalion, was captured by German forces on April 14, 1945, that he bluffed the German forces defending the town of Gardelegen into believing that American tanks were approaching the city, and that this induced the German commander to surrender to the American forces.  The Americans arrived at the site before the Germans had time to bury all of the bodies.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/with102dinfantry00unit/with102dinfantry00unit_djvu.txt</ref>

On April 3–4, following the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s crossing of the [[Rhine River]] and push into [[Germany]], the [[SS]] camp administration at [[Dora-Mittelbau]] had ordered the evacuation of prisoners from the main camp and a number of its affiliated subcamps. The goal was to transport the inmates by train or by foot to the other north German concentration camps: [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], or [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]].

Within days, some 4,000 prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora, its satellite camps, and from the Neuengamme subcamp Hannover-Stöcken arrived in the Gardelegen area, where they had to deboard from the freight cars because the trains could not advance any further due to air raid damage to the rail lines. Greatly outnumbered by the prisoners, the SS guards began recruiting auxiliary forces from the local fire department, the air force, the aged [[Volkssturm|home guard]], the [[Hitler Youth]], and other organizations to watch over the inmates.

On April 13, more than a thousand prisoners, many of them sick and too weak to march any further, were taken from the town of Gardelegen to a large barn on the [[Isenschnibbe]] estate and forced inside the building. The assembled guards then barricaded the doors and set fire to gasoline-soaked straw. Prisoners who escaped the conflagration by digging under the barn's walls were killed by the guards. The next day, the SS and local auxiliaries returned to dispose of the evidence of their crime. They planned to incinerate what remained of the bodies and the barn, and kill any survivors of the blaze. The swift advance of the [[102nd Infantry Division (United States)]], however, prevented the SS and its accomplices from completely carrying out this plan.

On April 14, the 102nd entered Gardelegen and, the following day, discovered the atrocity. They found the corpses of 1,016 prisoners in the still-smoldering barn and nearby trenches, where the SS had had the charred remains dumped. They also interviewed several of the prisoners who had managed to escape the fire and the shootings. [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] photographers soon arrived to document the Nazi crime and by April 19, 1945, the story of the Gardelegen massacre began appearing in the Western press. On that day, both the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran stories on the massacre, quoting one American soldier who stated:
<blockquote>

I never was so sure before of exactly what I was fighting for. Before this you would have said those stories were [[propaganda]], but now you know they weren't. There are the bodies and all those guys are dead.
</blockquote>

Eleven prisoners survived the burning of the barn and were found alive by U.S. soldiers – seven Poles, three Russians and one severely wounded Frenchman.

On April 21, 1945, the local commander of the 102nd ordered between 200 and 300 men from the town of Gardelegen to give the murdered prisoners a proper burial. Over the next few days, the German civilians exhumed 586 bodies from the trenches and recovered 430 bodies from the barn, placing each in an individual grave. On April 25, the 102nd carried out a ceremony to honor the dead and erected a memorial tablet to the victims, which stated that the townspeople of Gardelegen are charged with the responsibility that the “graves are forever kept as green as the memory of these unfortunates will be kept in the hearts of freedom-loving men everywhere.” Also on April 25, Colonel George Lynch addressed German civilians at Gardelegen with the following statement:

<blockquote>
The German people have been told that stories of German atrocities were Allied propaganda. Here, you can see for yourself. Some will say that the Nazis were responsible for this crime. Others will point to the Gestapo. The responsibility rests with neither — it is the responsibility of the German people....Your so-called Master Race has demonstrated that it is master only of crime, cruelty and sadism. You have lost the respect of the civilized world.

===Memorial barn Isenschnibbe Gardelegen===
The memorial is located at the historic scene of the massacre of Gardelegen. It is a reminder of the 1016 concentration camp prisoners from many European countries who were murdered there on 13 April 1945 in a field barn near the Hanseatic city of Gardelegen. The site also includes the Memorial Cemetery, where the victims of the massacre are buried.

A visitor and documentation center with a permanent exhibition is being built on the site in 2018.<ref>https://gedenkstaette-gardelegen.sachsen-anhalt.de/fileadmin/Bibliothek/STGS/Isenschnibbe_Gardelegen/Flyer_Gardelegen_en.pdf</ref>

The sign at the remaining wall of the barn, applied by officials of the German Democratic Republic, reads:

{{quote|
You stand in front of the ruins of a barn, where one of the most cruel crimes of fascism was taking place. In the night of their liberation, a few hours before Allied forces approach, 1016 international fighters of resistance against facism were brutally and inhumanely burned alive. Whenever you feel apathy or weakness in fighting against facism and imperialistic threat of war, get new power from our unforgettable dead.

===Memorial barn Isenschnibbe Gardelegen===
The memorial is located at the historic scene of the massacre of Gardelegen. It is a reminder of the 1016 concentration camp prisoners from many European countries who were murdered there on 13 April 1945 in a field barn near the Hanseatic city of Gardelegen. The site also includes the Memorial Cemetery, where the victims of the massacre are buried.

A visitor and documentation center with a permanent exhibition is being built on the site in 2018.<ref>https://gedenkstaette-gardelegen.sachsen-anhalt.de/fileadmin/Bibliothek/STGS/Isenschnibbe_Gardelegen/Flyer_Gardelegen_en.pdf</ref>

On October 13, 2019 the first ever “Gritty anti-runners 5K” took place.

In November 2019 during a fan meet-and-greet between Gritty and Flyers [[season ticket]] holders, a fan reported that the Flyers employee portraying Gritty punched their 13 year old son in the back. After an internal investigation by the Flyers led to no other witnesses of such abuse, the fan reported the incident to the [[Philadelphia Police Department]], which has led to its own investigation. On February 3, 2020, the Flyers employee portraying Gritty was officially cleared of any wrongdoing and charges were declined to be filed following an investigation conducted by the South Detectives Division of the Philadelphia Police Department.<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/business/comcast/flyers-gritty-assault-boy-philadelphia-police-investigation-20200122.html</ref><ref>https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/01/22/gritty-flyers-mascot-philadelphia-police-investigating-claim-physically-assaulted-teen-boy-during-photo-shoot/</ref><ref>https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2020/1/23/21078804/everyone-is-talking-about-gritty-philadelphia-flyers-mascot-lawsuit</ref>

On October 13, 2019 the first ever “Gritty anti-runners 5K” took place.

In November 2019 during a fan meet-and-greet between Gritty and Flyers [[season ticket]] holders, a fan reported that the Flyers employee portraying Gritty punched their 13 year old son in the back. After an internal investigation by the Flyers led to no other witnesses of such abuse, the fan reported the incident to the [[Philadelphia Police Department]], which has led to its own investigation. On February 3, 2020, the Flyers employee portraying Gritty was officially cleared of any wrongdoing and charges were declined to be filed following an investigation conducted by the South Detectives Division of the Philadelphia Police Department.<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/business/comcast/flyers-gritty-assault-boy-philadelphia-police-investigation-20200122.html</ref><ref>https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/01/22/gritty-flyers-mascot-philadelphia-police-investigating-claim-physically-assaulted-teen-boy-during-photo-shoot/</ref><ref>https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2020/1/23/21078804/everyone-is-talking-about-gritty-philadelphia-flyers-mascot-lawsuit</ref>

'''Soil''' – often typeset as '''SOiL''' – is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band that was formed in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Soil/+wiki|title=Soil biography|website=Last.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref> After some independent releases, the band was the first rock group signed to [[J Records]] and achieved mainstream success with their major label debut, ''[[Scars (Soil album)|Scars]]'', in 2001. The J Records second album ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]'' was released in 2004 and the band embarked upon a worldwide tour to follow. In late 2004 frontman [[Ryan McCombs]] left the group. He would go on to become the new vocalist of [[Drowning Pool]] the following year.

The band recruited ex- Diesel Machine vocalist [[A Cavalier|AJ Cavalier]] as its new singer and released two more studio albums (True Self, Picture Perfect) through independent labels in 2006 and 2009 respectively. SOiL continued to tour worldwide and met with strong independent success. The band had brief line-up changes until in fall 2011, Soil reunited with Ryan McCombs for a tour commemorating the tenth anniversary of their landmark album, ''Scars''. The line-up is currently completed with fellow original members Tim King (Bass) and Adam Zadel (Guitar), who are the only two members to have stayed with the band from inception until present. The band has sold over two million records worldwide and released its sixth studio album, entitled ''Whole'', on August 20, 2013 (August 16 UK/Europe).
The band released a greatest hits album, titled Scream: The Essentials on September 15, 2017

==History==
Soil was originally formed in 1997 by three of four members of [[death metal]] act [[Oppressor]], joined by guitarist of another death metal act [[Broken Hope]] – as a side project to their other bands. Ryan McCombs was later recruited for vocal duties.

The original line-up of the band was Ryan McCombs (vocals), Shaun Glass (Broken Hope), Tom Schofield, Tim King, and Adam Zadel (all three ex-Oppressor). The band got its name from the Entombed song \"Rotten Soil\" by opting to simply drop the \"Rotten\" part and stick with \"Soil\".

Soil's first three releases, ''[[SOiL (EP)|Soil]]'' ([[Extended play|EP]]), ''[[El Chupacabra (album)|El Chupacabra]]'' (EP) and their debut album ''[[Throttle Junkies]]'', failed to break the band into the mainstream. It was around this time that all the members of Soil left their other bands to focus on Soil as their main project.

With the song \"Halo\" gaining major radio attention, labels began a bidding war for a deal with Soil. The band would ultimately be signed to J Records by music industry legend [[Clive Davis]], responsible for signing such acts as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], who stated that \"you're gonna be my only rock band for now. You're going to be a priority, and I want to break this band.\"<ref name=\"OMH\">{{cite web|url = http://www.musicomh.com/interviews/soil.htm|title = Interview: Soil|publisher = musicOMH|last = Bansal|first = Vik|date = January 2005|accessdate = 26 February 2012}}</ref> Soil finally experienced mainstream success with the [[major label]] debut, ''[[Scars (Soil album)|Scars]]'', released September 11, 2001.<ref name=OMH/> This achievement was aided by the popular singles \"Halo\" and \"Unreal\" which gained the band exposure on [[MTV]]. The success resulted in the band winning [[Metal Edge]] magazine's 2001 Readers' Choice Award for \"Next Big Thing\".<ref>Metal Edge, June 2002</ref>

In 2004, the band released their second major label album, ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]''. The group toured for a year in support of the album and returned home to begin writing follow up material and finish various live dates.  Shortly after, vocalist [[Ryan McCombs]] announced his departure from the group to be with his family,<ref name=OMH/> forcing the band to cancel scheduled shows. [[New York City|New York]]-based vocalist [[AJ Cavalier]], previously of World In Pain and Diesel Machine, was introduced on November 15, 2004 as McCombs' replacement. On July 20, 2005, McCombs was confirmed to be the new singer for Drowning Pool.

On September 21, 2005, Soil signed with New York-based [[independent label]] [[DRT Entertainment]]. Their album ''[[True Self]]'' was released on May 2, 2006. The album leaked onto [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] sites on March 4, almost two months before its official release. SOiL embarked upon a very heavy worldwide touring schedule to promote the release. In November 2007, Shaun Glass parted ways with the band, citing personal and musical differences.

On October 20, 2009 the album ''[[Picture Perfect (Soil album)|Picture Perfect]]'' was released via Bieler Bros Records worldwide, except in Europe, where it was released by AFM Records. ''Picture Perfect'' was produced by Johnny K (Disturbed, Staind), Ulrich Wild (Deftones, Incubus) and Soil, with Dave Fortman (Mudvayne, Evanescence) handling mixing duties. It was promoted with the lead single, \"Like It Is.\" In January 2010, \"The Lesser Man\" was announced as a second single.

On July 23, 2010, vocalist A.J. Cavalier, and drummer Tom Schofield announced their departure from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728013007/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143229|title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET – SOIL Singer On 'Indefinite Hiatus' From Band; Drummer Seeking 'New Musical Opportunities'|date=28 July 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref> Vocalist Jordan Lee and drummer Mike Tignino were announced as fill-ins for scheduled live dates.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143442 It's Official: SOIL Recruits 'Fill-In' Singer, Drummer For Upcoming Shows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728051402/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143442 |date=2010-07-28 }}</ref>

The band reunited with original vocalist Ryan McCombs for a 12-date co-headlining UK tour with [[Puddle of Mudd]] in October 2011 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of ''Scars''. Former [[Staind]] drummer Jon Wysocki also joined Soil for the 2011 UK Tour.

Sony Music UK announced in 2011 that ''Scars'' has been certified silver in the UK with sales in excess of over 60,000 units.

Soil added several US tour dates throughout 2012. The trek will be the band's first in the US since original frontman Ryan McCombs rejoined the group.<ref>[http://rockaccess.net/2011/12/19/soil-announce-u-s-tour-dates/ SOiL Announce U.S. Tour Dates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108072650/http://rockaccess.net/2011/12/19/soil-announce-u-s-tour-dates/ |date=2012-01-08 }}</ref>

SOiL's first ever DVD entitled \"Re-LIVE-ing The Scars\" was released May 8, 2012. The DVD/CD combo was recorded live in London, England during the bands sold out 2011 UK tour and features the first live show with vocalist Ryan McCombs in 7 years.  The DVD also includes bonus footage and photo gallery.

SOiL's 6th studio album ''[[Whole (Soil album)|Whole]]'' was released Aug 16, 2013 (worldwide) and Aug 20, 2013 (North America). The album was funded through [[Kickstarter]]. The band released music video and single for \"Shine On\" on June 25, 2013. The second single \"The Hate Song\" was released in 2014. The third single \"Way Gone\" was released in 2015.

SOiL released the compilation album \"SCREAM: The Essentials\" on September 15, 2017 via Pavement/AFM Records. This compilation album features the band's hits along with alternate versions and unreleased material, and includes a cover of \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\" by The Spencer Davis Group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/soil-to-release-scream-the-essentials-in-september/|title=SOIL To Release 'Scream: The Essentials' In September|date=10 July 2017|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref>

The J Records second album ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]'' was released in 2004 and the band embarked upon a worldwide tour to follow. In late 2004 frontman [[Ryan McCombs]] left the group. He would go on to become the new vocalist of [[Drowning Pool]] the following year.

The band recruited ex- Diesel Machine vocalist [[A Cavalier|AJ Cavalier]] as its new singer and released two more studio albums (True Self, Picture Perfect) through independent labels in 2006 and 2009 respectively. SOiL continued to tour worldwide and met with strong independent success. The band had brief line-up changes until in fall 2011, Soil reunited with Ryan McCombs for a tour commemorating the tenth anniversary of their landmark album, ''Scars''. The line-up is currently completed with fellow original members Tim King (Bass) and Adam Zadel (Guitar), who are the only two members to have stayed with the band from inception until present. The band has sold over two million records worldwide and released its sixth studio album, entitled ''Whole'', on August 20, 2013 (August 16 UK/Europe).
The band released a greatest hits album, titled Scream: The Essentials on September 15, 2017

==History==
Soil was originally formed in 1997 by three of four members of [[death metal]] act [[Oppressor]], joined by guitarist of another death metal act [[Broken Hope]] – as a side project to their other bands. Ryan McCombs was later recruited for vocal duties.

The original line-up of the band was Ryan McCombs (vocals), Shaun Glass (Broken Hope), Tom Schofield, Tim King, and Adam Zadel (all three ex-Oppressor). The band got its name from the Entombed song \"Rotten Soil\" by opting to simply drop the \"Rotten\" part and stick with \"Soil\".

Soil's first three releases, ''[[SOiL (EP)|Soil]]'' ([[Extended play|EP]]), ''[[El Chupacabra (album)|El Chupacabra]]'' (EP) and their debut album ''[[Throttle Junkies]]'', failed to break the band into the mainstream. It was around this time that all the members of Soil left their other bands to focus on Soil as their main project.

With the song \"Halo\" gaining major radio attention, labels began a bidding war for a deal with Soil. The band would ultimately be signed to J Records by music industry legend [[Clive Davis]], responsible for signing such acts as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], who stated that \"you're gonna be my only rock band for now. You're going to be a priority, and I want to break this band.\"<ref name=\"OMH\">{{cite web|url = http://www.musicomh.com/interviews/soil.htm|title = Interview: Soil|publisher = musicOMH|last = Bansal|first = Vik|date = January 2005|accessdate = 26 February 2012}}</ref> Soil finally experienced mainstream success with the [[major label]] debut, ''[[Scars (Soil album)|Scars]]'', released September 11, 2001.<ref name=OMH/> This achievement was aided by the popular singles \"Halo\" and \"Unreal\" which gained the band exposure on [[MTV]]. The success resulted in the band winning [[Metal Edge]] magazine's 2001 Readers' Choice Award for \"Next Big Thing\".<ref>Metal Edge, June 2002</ref>

In 2004, the band released their second major label album, ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]''. The group toured for a year in support of the album and returned home to begin writing follow up material and finish various live dates.  Shortly after, vocalist [[Ryan McCombs]] announced his departure from the group to be with his family,<ref name=OMH/> forcing the band to cancel scheduled shows. [[New York City|New York]]-based vocalist [[AJ Cavalier]], previously of World In Pain and Diesel Machine, was introduced on November 15, 2004 as McCombs' replacement. On July 20, 2005, McCombs was confirmed to be the new singer for Drowning Pool.

On September 21, 2005, Soil signed with New York-based [[independent label]] [[DRT Entertainment]]. Their album ''[[True Self]]'' was released on May 2, 2006. The album leaked onto [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] sites on March 4, almost two months before its official release. SOiL embarked upon a very heavy worldwide touring schedule to promote the release. In November 2007, Shaun Glass parted ways with the band, citing personal and musical differences.

On October 20, 2009 the album ''[[Picture Perfect (Soil album)|Picture Perfect]]'' was released via Bieler Bros Records worldwide, except in Europe, where it was released by AFM Records. ''Picture Perfect'' was produced by Johnny K (Disturbed, Staind), Ulrich Wild (Deftones, Incubus) and Soil, with Dave Fortman (Mudvayne, Evanescence) handling mixing duties. It was promoted with the lead single, \"Like It Is.\" In January 2010, \"The Lesser Man\" was announced as a second single.

On July 23, 2010, vocalist A.J. Cavalier, and drummer Tom Schofield announced their departure from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728013007/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143229|title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET – SOIL Singer On 'Indefinite Hiatus' From Band; Drummer Seeking 'New Musical Opportunities'|date=28 July 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref> Vocalist Jordan Lee and drummer Mike Tignino were announced as fill-ins for scheduled live dates.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143442 It's Official: SOIL Recruits 'Fill-In' Singer, Drummer For Upcoming Shows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728051402/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143442 |date=2010-07-28 }}</ref>

The band reunited with original vocalist Ryan McCombs for a 12-date co-headlining UK tour with [[Puddle of Mudd]] in October 2011 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of ''Scars''. Former [[Staind]] drummer Jon Wysocki also joined Soil for the 2011 UK Tour.

Sony Music UK announced in 2011 that ''Scars'' has been certified silver in the UK with sales in excess of over 60,000 units.

Soil added several US tour dates throughout 2012. The trek will be the band's first in the US since original frontman Ryan McCombs rejoined the group.<ref>[http://rockaccess.net/2011/12/19/soil-announce-u-s-tour-dates/ SOiL Announce U.S. Tour Dates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108072650/http://rockaccess.net/2011/12/19/soil-announce-u-s-tour-dates/ |date=2012-01-08 }}</ref>

SOiL's first ever DVD entitled \"Re-LIVE-ing The Scars\" was released May 8, 2012. The DVD/CD combo was recorded live in London, England during the bands sold out 2011 UK tour and features the first live show with vocalist Ryan McCombs in 7 years.  The DVD also includes bonus footage and photo gallery.

SOiL's 6th studio album ''[[Whole (Soil album)|Whole]]'' was released Aug 16, 2013 (worldwide) and Aug 20, 2013 (North America). The album was funded through [[Kickstarter]]. The band released music video and single for \"Shine On\" on June 25, 2013. The second single \"The Hate Song\" was released in 2014. The third single \"Way Gone\" was released in 2015.

SOiL released the compilation album \"SCREAM: The Essentials\" on September 15, 2017 via Pavement/AFM Records. This compilation album features the band's hits along with alternate versions and unreleased material, and includes a cover of \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\" by The Spencer Davis Group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/soil-to-release-scream-the-essentials-in-september/|title=SOIL To Release 'Scream: The Essentials' In September|date=10 July 2017|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref>

[[Image:The Catch.png|thumb|[[Willie Mays]] catches [[Vic Wertz]]'s deep [[Batted ball|fly ball]] on the [[warning track]] in the [[1954 World Series]].]]
'''The Catch''' was a [[baseball]] play made by [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] center fielder [[Willie Mays]] on September 29, 1954, during Game 1 of the [[1954 World Series]] at the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[Upper Manhattan|Upper Manhattan, New York City]]. During the eighth [[inning]] with the score tied 2–2, [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] batter [[Vic Wertz]] hit a deep [[Batted ball|fly ball]] to [[Center fielder|center field]] that was poised to score the [[Base running|runners on base]]. However, Mays made an over-the-shoulder [[Catch (baseball)|catch]] while on the run to record the [[Out (baseball)|out]], and his throw back to the [[Infield#Baseball|infield]] prevented the runners from advancing. The Giants won the game 5–2 in [[extra innings]], and eventually the World Series. The Catch is regarded as one of the greatest plays in baseball history.

==The play==
In the top of the 8th inning with the score tied 2–2,<ref>{{cite news|last=Bahr|first=Chris|title=Flashback: Willie Mays makes 'The Catch' in 1954 World Series|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/willie-mays-catch-1954-world-series-new-york-giants-san-francisco-hall-of-famer-vic-wertz-092915|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=September 29, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref> Giants starting [[pitcher]] [[Sal Maglie]] [[base on balls|walked]] Indians lead off hitter [[Larry Doby]].

Wertz worked the count to two balls and one strike before hitting Liddle's fourth pitch approximately {{convert|420|feet|m}} to deep center field. In many stadiums the ball would have been a [[home run]], which would have given the Indians a 5–2 lead. However, the Polo Grounds center field was larger than average, and Mays, who was playing in shallow center field, made an on-the-run, over-the-shoulder catch at the [[warning track]] for the out. Having caught the ball, he immediately spun and threw the ball. Doby, the runner on second, might have been able to score the go-ahead run had he tagged at the moment the ball was caught; as it was, he ran when the ball was hit, then had to scramble back to tag. Mays' throw went to second base, holding Cleveland to runners at second and third with one out.<ref name=retrosheet/>

Right-hander [[Marv Grissom]] then relieved Liddle,<ref name=retrosheet/> who supposedly remarked to [[coach (baseball)|coach]] [[Freddie Fitzsimmons]], \"Well, I got ''my'' man.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcwv4OxWTgIC&lpg=PA99&ots=3rRzP-XHch&pg=PA99#v=onepage&q&f=false |first=Bill |last=Deane |title=Baseball Myths: Debating, Debunking, and Disproving Tales from the Diamond |page=99 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |date=2012 |isbn=9780810885462 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}</ref> Grissom walked [[pinch hitter]] [[Dale Mitchell (baseball)|Dale Mitchell]] to load the bases, then struck out pinch hitter [[Dave Pope]], and got catcher [[Jim Hegan]] to fly out, ending the inning with no runs scored.<ref name=retrosheet/>

[[Jack Brickhouse]], calling the game on television for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]], along with [[Russ Hodges]], described Mays' catch to viewers. The audio has been published on [[compact disc|CD]] with the book ''And the Fans Roared'',<ref name=FansRoared>{{cite book |first=Joe |last=Garner |author-link=Joe Garner (author) |others=[[Bob Costas]] (narrator), [[George Foreman]] (foreword) |title=And the Fans Roared: The Sports Broadcasts That Kept Us on the Edge of Our Seats |publisher=[[Sourcebooks]] |location=[[Naperville, Illinois]] |date=2000 |isbn=1570715823 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Fans-Roared-Sports-Broadcasts-Seats/dp/1570715823/}}</ref> and also as accompaniment to the World Series film.

There is some question of the depth of straight-away center field. Sometimes there was a 475{{efn|{{convert|475|feet|m}}}} sign in center field, sometimes 483{{efn|{{convert|483|feet|m}}}} (as was the case in 1954).<ref name=lowry/> The ballpark was demolished in 1964, and it is unclear what was being measured when.

==Aftermath and response==
[[Image:MAYS THE CATCH.JPG|thumb|right|The baseball glove that Willie Mays used in \"the catch\" on display at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2008.]]
The play prevented the Indians from taking the lead and, in the bottom of the 10th, the Giants won the game on their way to sweeping the Series. The Catch is often considered to be one of the best and most memorable plays in the history of baseball because of the difficulty of the play and the importance of the game itself.<ref>{{cite news|last=Axisa|first=Mike|title=Happy 60th Anniversary: Willie Mays makes 'The Catch'|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/happy-60th-anniversary-willie-mays-makes-the-catch/|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=September 29, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref>

[[Image:The Catch.png|thumb|[[Willie Mays]] catches [[Vic Wertz]]'s deep [[Batted ball|fly ball]] on the [[warning track]] in the [[1954 World Series]].]]
'''The Catch''' was a [[baseball]] play made by [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] center fielder [[Willie Mays]] on September 29, 1954, during Game 1 of the [[1954 World Series]] at the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[Upper Manhattan|Upper Manhattan, New York City]]. During the eighth [[inning]] with the score tied 2–2, [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] batter [[Vic Wertz]] hit a deep [[Batted ball|fly ball]] to [[Center fielder|center field]] that was poised to score the [[Base running|runners on base]]. However, Mays made an over-the-shoulder [[Catch (baseball)|catch]] while on the run to record the [[Out (baseball)|out]], and his throw back to the [[Infield#Baseball|infield]] prevented the runners from advancing. The Giants won the game 5–2 in [[extra innings]], and eventually the World Series. The Catch is regarded as one of the greatest plays in baseball history.

==The play==
In the top of the 8th inning with the score tied 2–2,<ref>{{cite news|last=Bahr|first=Chris|title=Flashback: Willie Mays makes 'The Catch' in 1954 World Series|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/willie-mays-catch-1954-world-series-new-york-giants-san-francisco-hall-of-famer-vic-wertz-092915|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=September 29, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref> Giants starting [[pitcher]] [[Sal Maglie]] [[base on balls|walked]] Indians lead off hitter [[Larry Doby]].

Wertz worked the count to two balls and one strike before hitting Liddle's fourth pitch approximately {{convert|420|feet|m}} to deep center field. In many stadiums the ball would have been a [[home run]], which would have given the Indians a 5–2 lead. However, the Polo Grounds center field was larger than average, and Mays, who was playing in shallow center field, made an on-the-run, over-the-shoulder catch at the [[warning track]] for the out. Having caught the ball, he immediately spun and threw the ball. Doby, the runner on second, might have been able to score the go-ahead run had he tagged at the moment the ball was caught; as it was, he ran when the ball was hit, then had to scramble back to tag. Mays' throw went to second base, holding Cleveland to runners at second and third with one out.<ref name=retrosheet/>

Right-hander [[Marv Grissom]] then relieved Liddle,<ref name=retrosheet/> who supposedly remarked to [[coach (baseball)|coach]] [[Freddie Fitzsimmons]], \"Well, I got ''my'' man.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcwv4OxWTgIC&lpg=PA99&ots=3rRzP-XHch&pg=PA99#v=onepage&q&f=false |first=Bill |last=Deane |title=Baseball Myths: Debating, Debunking, and Disproving Tales from the Diamond |page=99 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |date=2012 |isbn=9780810885462 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}</ref> Grissom walked [[pinch hitter]] [[Dale Mitchell (baseball)|Dale Mitchell]] to load the bases, then struck out pinch hitter [[Dave Pope]], and got catcher [[Jim Hegan]] to fly out, ending the inning with no runs scored.<ref name=retrosheet/>

[[Jack Brickhouse]], calling the game on television for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]], along with [[Russ Hodges]], described Mays' catch to viewers.

There is some question of the depth of straight-away center field. Sometimes there was a 475{{efn|{{convert|475|feet|m}}}} sign in center field, sometimes 483{{efn|{{convert|483|feet|m}}}} (as was the case in 1954).<ref name=lowry/> The ballpark was demolished in 1964, and it is unclear what was being measured when.

==Aftermath and response==
[[Image:MAYS THE CATCH.JPG|thumb|right|The baseball glove that Willie Mays used in \"the catch\" on display at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2008.]]
The play prevented the Indians from taking the lead and, in the bottom of the 10th, the Giants won the game on their way to sweeping the Series. The Catch is often considered to be one of the best and most memorable plays in the history of baseball because of the difficulty of the play and the importance of the game itself.<ref>{{cite news|last=Axisa|first=Mike|title=Happy 60th Anniversary: Willie Mays makes 'The Catch'|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/happy-60th-anniversary-willie-mays-makes-the-catch/|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=September 29, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref>

The '''European Foundation for Democracy''' (EFD) is a policy centre and a [[Lobby register#European Union|registered]] [[European Union lobbying|EU lobbyist organization]] based in Brussels, Belgium.<ref name=\"EU\"/> Its activities focus on counter-radicalisation, security and the promotion of the [[European values]] of democracy and individual freedoms. Its experts produce analyses and publications concerning the various threats coming from extremist ideologies, recommending measures and policies to counter these phenomena.

EFD also organises public events,<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/> policy briefings<ref>{{Cite web|title = Social media platforms have ‘crucial role to play in combating extremist rhetoric’|url = https://www.eureporter.co/politics/2015/07/02/social-media-platforms-have-crucial-role-to-play-in-combating-extremist-rhetoric/|website = EU Reporter|access-date = 2016-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Leading author calls for ‘attack on all fronts’ against Islamic fundamentalism|url = https://www.eureporter.co/frontpage/2015/03/26/22686/|website = EU Reporter|access-date = 2016-01-19}}</ref> and roundtable discussions where relevant experts debate specific challenges posed by extremist forces, in order to stimulate the debate and provide the policy community with recommendations on how to tackle such threats.
== History ==
EFD was founded in November 2005.<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|37}} Documents registering EFD at [[Federal Public Service Justice]] date 24 May 2006.<ref name=\"Massoumi, Mills and Miller\"/>{{rp|193}} Its co-founders were Roberta Bonazzi, Nicola Dell’Arciprete and  Miguel Papi Boucher. Dell’Arciprete previously worked on staff of an Italian [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] from far-right [[Lega Nord]], during which he participated in a tour hosted by [[Ateret Cohanim]].<ref name=\"Massoumi, Mills and Miller\"/>{{rp|191}} On 15 September 2011, the organization was officially registered as an organization that works to influence the lawmaking process of the EU institutions.<ref name=\"EU\"/>

== Activities and political stance ==
Scholar [[Farid Hafez]] maintains that the EFD hails from a politically [[conservative]] milieu, and its \"fellows are located in the corridors of power\", adding that \"[t]heir experts produce knowledge for highly subsidized state institutions\".<ref name=\"Hafez\"/>{{rp|130}} Georgetown University's Bridge Initiative profile of EFD, states that the organization has a \"privileged access to financial resources and political decision making\".<ref name=\"Georgetown\"/> 

The EFD has campaigned on issues that echo policies advocated by the establishment in [[Israel]], and it has been described as a pro-Israel group.<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|38}} The EFD's president denies allegations of being pro-Israel, saying \"We try to not get involved in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine issue]].... We don't feel able to add anything. We don't think we can do it well.\"<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|37}}  

EFD is an advocate of adding [[Hezbollah]] of Lebanon to the [[List of organisations designated as terrorist organisations by the European Union|European Union's list of terrorist organizations]],<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|37}} and has proposed a ban on television networks [[Al-Manar]] and [[Al-Aqsa TV]] by the EU.<ref name=\"Massoumi, Mills and Miller\"/>{{rp|191}} It has hosted events calling for a tougher action against [[Iran]] for its [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear programme]].<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|38}} 

=== Allegations of Islamophobia ===
Multiple scholars have wrote that the EFD is an [[Islamophobic]] organization,<ref name=\"Georgetown\"/> including David Cronin, Sarah Marusek and [[David Miller (political theorist)|David Miller]], who state that the organization is \"closely associated with a transatlantic network of neoconservative and Islamophobic activists\";<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|37}} Narzanin Massoumi, Tom Mills and Miller who comment that the organization is \"promoting a range of issues that include Islamophobia\",<ref name=\"Massoumi, Mills and Miller\"/>{{rp|190}} and [[Farid Hafez]]. Hafez has conducted a [[case study]] on activities of the EFD in [[Austria]]<ref name=\"Hafez\"/>{{rp|125–128}} and [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"Hafez\"/>{{rp|128–130}} in particular works published by the organization to put Austrian Muslim Youth (''Muslimische Jugend Österreich'') and [[Sveriges Unga Muslimer|Young Muslims of Sweden]] (''Sveriges Unga Muslimer'') under government pressure by falsely linking them to [[Muslim Brotherhood]] of Egypt. He concludes that EFD systematically produces works that follows a strategy of [[defamation]] and [[delegitimization]] of actors of the [[civil society]] of Muslims in Europe, by identifying them as [[Radical politics|radical]] and [[Islamist]].<ref name=\"Hafez\"/>{{rp|130–132}}

== Funding ==
EFD is described as a \"capital darling\", i.e. a NGO which is is based on [[Financial capital|capital]],<ref>{{citation|first=Armine|last=Ishkanian|title=Democracy Building and Civil Society in Post-Soviet Armenia|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9781134076765|page=27}}</ref> as well as an organization that enjoys support from several wealthy donors.<ref name=\"Hafez\">{{citation|first=Farid|last=Hafez|editor-first1=John L.|editor-last1=Esposito|editor-first2=Derya|editor-last2=Iner|chapter=Muslim Civil Society Under Attack: The European Foundation for Democracy’s Role in Defaming and Delegitimizing Muslim Civil Society|title=Islamophobia and Radicalization: Breeding Intolerance and Violence|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=978-3-319-95237-6|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-95237-6_7}}</ref>{{rp|130}}

The '''European Foundation for Democracy''' (EFD) is a policy centre and a [[Lobby register#European Union|registered]] [[European Union lobbying|EU lobbyist organization]] based in Brussels, Belgium.<ref name=\"EU\"/> Its activities focus on counter-radicalisation, security and the promotion of the [[European values]] of democracy and individual freedoms. Its experts produce analyses and publications concerning the various threats coming from extremist ideologies, recommending measures and policies to counter these phenomena.

EFD also organises public events,<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/> policy briefings<ref>{{Cite web|title = Social media platforms have ‘crucial role to play in combating extremist rhetoric’|url = https://www.eureporter.co/politics/2015/07/02/social-media-platforms-have-crucial-role-to-play-in-combating-extremist-rhetoric/|website = EU Reporter|access-date = 2016-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Leading author calls for ‘attack on all fronts’ against Islamic fundamentalism|url = https://www.eureporter.co/frontpage/2015/03/26/22686/|website = EU Reporter|access-date = 2016-01-19}}</ref> and roundtable discussions where relevant experts debate specific challenges posed by extremist forces, in order to stimulate the debate and provide the policy community with recommendations on how to tackle such threats.
== History ==
EFD was founded in November 2005.<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|37}} Documents registering EFD at [[Federal Public Service Justice]] date 24 May 2006.<ref name=\"Massoumi, Mills and Miller\"/>{{rp|193}} Its co-founders were Roberta Bonazzi, Nicola Dell’Arciprete and  Miguel Papi Boucher. Dell’Arciprete previously worked on staff of an Italian [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] from far-right [[Lega Nord]], during which he participated in a tour hosted by [[Ateret Cohanim]].<ref name=\"Massoumi, Mills and Miller\"/>{{rp|191}} On 15 September 2011, the organization was officially registered as an organizations that works to influence the lawmaking process of the EU institutions.<ref name=\"EU\"/>
== Activities and political stance ==
Scholar [[Farid Hafez]] maintains that the EFD hails from a politically [[conservative]] milieu, and its \"fellows are located in the corridors of power\", adding that \"[t]heir experts produce knowledge for highly subsidized state institutions\".<ref name=\"Hafez\"/>{{rp|130}} Georgetown University's Bridge Initiative profile of EFD, states that the organization has a \"privileged access to financial resources and political decision making\".<ref name=\"Georgetown\"/> 

The EFD has campaigned on issues that echo policies advocated by the establishment in [[Israel]], and it has been described as a pro-Israel group.<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|38}} The EFD's president denies allegations of being pro-Israel, saying \"We try to not get involved in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine issue]].... We don't feel able to add anything. We don't think we can do it well.\"<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|37}}  

EFD is an advocate of adding [[Hezbollah]] of Lebanon to the [[List of organisations designated as terrorist organisations by the European Union|European Union's list of terrorist organizations]],<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|37}} and has proposed a ban on television networks [[Al-Manar]] and [[Al-Aqsa TV]] by the EU.<ref name=\"Massoumi, Mills and Miller\"/>{{rp|191}} It has hosted events calling for a tougher action against [[Iran]] for its [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear programme]].<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|38}} 

=== Allegations of Islamophobia ===
Multiple scholars have wrote that the EFD is an [[Islamophobic]] organization,<ref name=\"Georgetown\"/> including David Cronin, Sarah Marusek and [[David Miller (political theorist)|David Miller]], who state that the organization is \"closely associated with a transatlantic network of neoconservative and Islamophobic activists\";<ref name=\"Cronin, Marusek and Miller\"/>{{rp|37}} Narzanin Massoumi, Tom Mills and Miller who comment that the organization is \"promoting a range of issues that include Islamophobia\",<ref name=\"Massoumi, Mills and Miller\"/>{{rp|190}} and [[Farid Hafez]]. Hafez has conducted a [[case study]] on activities of the EFD in [[Austria]]<ref name=\"Hafez\"/>{{rp|125–128}} and [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"Hafez\"/>{{rp|128–130}} in particular works published by the organization to put Austrian Muslim Youth (''Muslimische Jugend Österreich'') and [[Sveriges Unga Muslimer|Young Muslims of Sweden]] (''Sveriges Unga Muslimer'') under government pressure by falsely linking them to [[Muslim Brotherhood]] of Egypt. He concludes that EFD systematically produces works that follows a strategy of [[defamation]] and [[delegitimization]] of actors of the [[civil society]] of Muslims in Europe, by identifying them as [[Radical politics|radical]] and [[Islamist]].<ref name=\"Hafez\"/>{{rp|130–132}}
