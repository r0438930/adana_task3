The film is loosely based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\".\n\nThe film tells the story of a construction worker who suddenly finds himself embroiled in espionage on [[Mars]] and unable to determine if the experiences are real or the result of memory implants. It was written by [[Ronald Shusett]], [[Dan O'Bannon]], [[Jon Povill]], and [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]], and won a [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for its [[visual effects]]. The [[Film score|original score]], composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], won the [[BMI Awards|BMI Film Music Award]].\n\nWith a budget of $50\u201360 million, ''Total Recall'' was [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films made]] at the time of its release,<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite book|last=Keesey|first=Douglas|year=2005|title=Paul Verhoeven|pages=119, 123|isbn=3-8228-3101-8}}</ref> although estimates of its production budget vary and whether it ever actually held the record is not certain.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2084, construction worker Douglas Quaid is having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there. His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting a rebellion. At Rekall, a company that provides memory implants of vacations, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent. However, something goes wrong during the procedure, and Quaid starts revealing suppressed memories of actually being a secret agent. The Rekall employees sedate him, wipe his memory of the visit, and send him home. On the way, Quaid is attacked by his friend Harry and other men, and is forced to kill them. He is then ambushed in his apartment by Lori, who states that she isn't his wife; their marriage is a false memory implant, and \"The Agency\" sent her to monitor Quaid. Quaid knocks Lori out and runs off, pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband.\n\nAfter evading his attackers, Quaid is left a suitcase containing money, gadgets, fake IDs, and a video recording. The video is of Quaid himself, who identifies himself as Hauser and explains that he used to work for Cohaagen, but switched sides after learning about an alien artifact on Mars and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself. Hauser instructs Quaid to remove a tracking device located inside his skull before ordering him to go to Mars. On arrival, Quaid finds a note from Hauser directing him to Venusville, populated by people mutated as a result of poor radiation shielding. He meets Benny, a taxi driver, and Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that he is still working for Cohaagen.\n\nQuaid later encounters Rekall's Dr. Edgemar and Lori. Edgemar states that he is from Rekall and was implanted in Quaid, asserting that he suffered a \"schizoid embolism\" and is trapped in a fantasy from the implanted memories. His solution is to take an offered pill to wake up, or he will otherwise be lobotomized. Seeing sweat on Edgemar's face and realizing he isn't an implant, Quaid refuses the pill and shoots him, just as Richter's men burst into the room. Led by Lori, the men capture Quaid. Melina arrives to aid Quaid, recognizing Quaid to be truthful, and in their escape Quaid kills Lori. \n\nThey flee to Venusville with Benny, and are ushered into a secret tunnel. Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation, slowly asphyxiating its citizens. Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to the mutant Kuato, conjoined to his brother George. Kuato reads Quaid's mind recalling a discussion with Cohaagen and Richter about the Martian artifact and its unknown purpose. Cohaagen's forces burst in and kill most of the resistance. Quaid, George/Kuato, Melina & Benny escape to an airlock. Benny kills George and reveals that he works for Cohaagen. Kuato implores Quaid to activate the reactor before being shot by Richter.\n\nQuaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who explains that the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and expose Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina re-programmed as Hauser's obedient \"babe\", but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located. Benny attacks them in an excavation machine, but Quaid kills him. Quaid and Melina then outwit and kill Richter and his men lying in ambush for them.\n\nQuaid reaches the reactor control room, where Cohaagen is waiting with a bomb, claiming starting the reactor will destroy them all. Melina arrives and shoots Cohaagen, but he starts the bomb timer. Quaid throws the bomb down the tunnel, blowing the door open and causing an [[explosive decompression]]. Quaid pushes Cohaagen aside, and Cohaagen is blown out onto the surface, where he suffocates and dies. Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor rods deploy, [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] the turbinium glacier underneath and releasing gas, which bursts from a mountain and forms a breathable planetary atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina, Venusville, and the rest of Mars' population. As the Mars humans and mutants stand on an outcropping looking at the newly blue sky, Quaid momentarily pauses to wonder whether he is dreaming or not, before turning to kiss Melina.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who discovers that he is actually a secret agent formerly named Carl Hauser, and travels to Mars to uncover his true identity and why his memory was erased.\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Melina, a beautiful woman seen as the partner in Quaid's Rekall memory program who turns out to be a resistance fighter seeking to overthrow Cohaagen.\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Lori Quaid, Quaid's seemingly loving wife who is later also revealed to be an agent sent by Cohaagen to monitor Quaid.

They had bought the rights to [[Philip K. Dick]]'s short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\" while Dick was still alive. Unable to find a backer for the project, it drifted into [[development hell]], passing from studio to studio for several years, during which time approximately forty drafts of the script were written.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Will|date=July 1990|title=Man Without Memory|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-156/page/n49?q=total+recall|journal=[[Starlog]]|volume=|issue=156|pages=50-55, 79|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] took on the project with [[Richard Dreyfuss]] attached to star.<ref name=\"WiredPKD\">{{cite magazine| last = Rose| first = Frank| title = The Second Coming of Philip K.

This version of the film was never made.<ref name=\"stratton2\">David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Pan MacMillan, 1990 p285-286</ref>\n\n[[David Cronenberg]] was given the script by De Laurentiis, which in his opinion had a great start, but as it went on he felt that O'Bannon and Shusett did not know what to do with the story. Cronenberg described his work on the project as constantly fighting and eventually falling out with Shusett: \"I worked on it for a year and did about 12 drafts. Eventually, we got to a point where Ron Shusett said, 'You know what you've done? You've done the Philip K. Dick version.' I said, 'Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing?' He said, 'No, no, we want to do ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]] Go to Mars''.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cronenberg intended to cast [[William Hurt]] in the role and envisioned the film as \"''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'' goes to Mars\". Shusett claimed that another reason why Cronenberg quit the film was because around the time Dreyfuss was involved, the director wanted to go on a different approach and in Shusett's words, was \"suddenly against his own ideas\" after some disagreements.<ref>{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Tales from Development Hell: Hollywood Film-making the Hard Way|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=9780857687234}}</ref> Although he went uncredited in the final version of the film, Cronenberg originated the idea of mutants on Mars, including the character of Kuato (spelled Quato in his screenplay).<ref>Robb, Brian J.

In addition, the novel had a subplot wherein the aliens planted a fail-safe device within their Mars technology, so that if it were misused or destroyed, the local star would go [[supernova|nova]] and therefore prevent the species from entering the galactic community. It coincided with a comment earlier in the novel that astronomers were noticing an abnormal number of recent supernovae, giving an indication that the aliens seeded their tech as part of a galactic experiment in technological maturity. Instead of mentioning that he dreamt of her earlier in the film, Melina mentions she was once a model, explaining how Quaid could have seen her on the screen at Rekall.\n\n===Video game===\nA ''[[Total Recall (video game)|Total Recall]]'' video game based on the film was developed and released by [[Ocean Software]] in 1990, featuring 2D [[Action game|action]], [[Platform game|platformer]] scenes and top-down racing scenes; a version for popular 8-bit home computers ([[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]) and popular 16-bit home computers ([[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]) was also released the following year.\n\n===Television series===\nA television series called ''[[Total Recall 2070]]'' went into production in 1999. The series was meant to be a sequel; however, it had far more similarities with the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' film (also inspired by a Philip K. Dick story) than Verhoeven's film.<ref>{{citation|author=Platt, John|date=1999-03-01|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue98/screen.html|title=A Total Recall spin-off that's an awful lot like Blade Runner|journal=Science Fiction Weekly|pages=Issue 98 Vol.5 No.9|accessdate=2008-02-06|nopp=true |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080115153719/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue98/screen.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-15}}</ref> The two-hour series pilot, released on VHS and DVD for the North American market, borrowed footage from the film, such as the space cruiser arriving on Mars.\n\n===Comic books===\n* [[DC Comics]]: ''Total Recall'' (1990)<ref>{{gcdb issue|id=48915|title=DC Comics: ''Total Recall''}}</ref><ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=30406|title=DC Comics: ''Total Recall''}}</ref>\n* In 2011, a four-issue comic book adaptation was released by [[Dynamite Entertainment]], continuing the story from the film.<ref>{{cite news |title=Total Recall #1 |work=dynamiteentertainment.com |url=http://www.dynamiteentertainment.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C725130167316 |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312104221/http://www.dynamiteentertainment.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C725130167316 |archivedate=March 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Sequel===\nDue to the film's success, a [[sequel]] was written with the script title ''Total Recall 2'', and with Schwarzenegger's character still Douglas Quaid, now working as a reformed law enforcer.

The film is loosely based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\".\n\nThe film tells the story of a construction worker who suddenly finds himself embroiled in espionage on [[Mars]] and unable to determine if the experiences are real or the result of memory implants. It was written by [[Ronald Shusett]], [[Dan O'Bannon]], [[Jon Povill]], and [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]], and won a [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for its [[visual effects]]. The [[Film score|original score]], composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], won the [[BMI Awards|BMI Film Music Award]].\n\nWith a budget of $50\u201365 million, ''Total Recall'' was [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films made]] at the time of its release,<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite book|last=Keesey|first=Douglas|year=2005|title=Paul Verhoeven|pages=119, 123|isbn=3-8228-3101-8}}</ref> although estimates of its production budget vary and whether it ever actually held the record is not certain.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2084, construction worker Douglas Quaid is having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there. His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting a rebellion. At Rekall, a company that provides memory implants of vacations, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent. However, something goes wrong during the procedure, and Quaid starts revealing suppressed memories of actually being a secret agent. The Rekall employees sedate him, wipe his memory of the visit, and send him home. On the way, Quaid is attacked by his friend Harry and other men, and is forced to kill them. He is then ambushed in his apartment by Lori, who states that she isn't his wife; their marriage is a false memory implant, and \"The Agency\" sent her to monitor Quaid. Quaid knocks Lori out and runs off, pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband.\n\nAfter evading his attackers, Quaid is left a suitcase containing money, gadgets, fake IDs, and a video recording. The video is of Quaid himself, who identifies himself as Hauser and explains that he used to work for Cohaagen, but switched sides after learning about an alien artifact on Mars and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself. Hauser instructs Quaid to remove a tracking device located inside his skull before ordering him to go to Mars. On arrival, Quaid finds a note from Hauser directing him to Venusville, populated by people mutated as a result of poor radiation shielding. He meets Benny, a taxi driver, and Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that he is still working for Cohaagen.\n\nQuaid later encounters Rekall's Dr. Edgemar and Lori. Edgemar states that he is from Rekall and was implanted in Quaid, asserting that he suffered a \"schizoid embolism\" and is trapped in a fantasy from the implanted memories. His solution is to take an offered pill to wake up, or he will otherwise be lobotomized. Seeing sweat on Edgemar's face and realizing he isn't an implant, Quaid refuses the pill and shoots him, just as Richter's men burst into the room. Led by Lori, the men capture Quaid. Melina arrives to aid Quaid, recognizing Quaid to be truthful, and in their escape Quaid kills Lori. \n\nThey flee to Venusville with Benny, and are ushered into a secret tunnel. Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation, slowly asphyxiating its citizens. Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to the mutant Kuato, conjoined to his brother George. Kuato reads Quaid's mind recalling a discussion with Cohaagen and Richter about the Martian artifact and its unknown purpose. Cohaagen's forces burst in and kill most of the resistance. Quaid, George/Kuato, Melina & Benny escape to an airlock. Benny kills George and reveals that he works for Cohaagen. Kuato implores Quaid to activate the reactor before being shot by Richter.\n\nQuaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who explains that the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and expose Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina re-programmed as Hauser's obedient \"babe\", but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located. Benny attacks them in an excavation machine, but Quaid kills him. Quaid and Melina then outwit and kill Richter and his men lying in ambush for them.\n\nQuaid reaches the reactor control room, where Cohaagen is waiting with a bomb, claiming starting the reactor will destroy them all. Melina arrives and shoots Cohaagen, but he starts the bomb timer. Quaid throws the bomb down the tunnel, blowing the door open and causing an [[explosive decompression]]. Quaid pushes Cohaagen aside, and Cohaagen is blown out onto the surface, where he suffocates and dies. Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor rods deploy, [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] the turbinium glacier underneath and releasing gas, which bursts from a mountain and forms a breathable planetary atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina, Venusville, and the rest of Mars' population. As the Mars humans and mutants stand on an outcropping looking at the newly blue sky, Quaid momentarily pauses to wonder whether he is dreaming or not, before turning to kiss Melina.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who discovers that he is actually a secret agent formerly named Carl Hauser, and travels to Mars to uncover his true identity and why his memory was erased.\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Melina, a beautiful woman seen as the partner in Quaid's Rekall memory program who turns out to be a resistance fighter seeking to overthrow Cohaagen.\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Lori Quaid, Quaid's seemingly loving wife who is later also revealed to be an agent sent by Cohaagen to monitor Quaid.
