Its [[call sign]] was the {{nihongo|'''Peace Division'''|\u5b89\u5175\u56e3|Yasushi Heidan}}. It was formed on 16 September 1941 at [[Kyoto]] and initially assigned to [[Central District Army]]. The nucleus for the division formation was the headquarters of the [[16th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|16th division]]. The men of the ''53rd Division'' were drafted from [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]] and [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]] prefectures, belonging to [[:ja:\u4eac\u90fd\u5e2b\u7ba1\u533a|Kyoto mobilization district]].\n\nThe ''53rd Division'' was initially assigned as the reserve of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] in November 1943.

The main body of the division took part in several battles against the [[Chindits]], a large British and Indian long-range penetration force which was operating north of [[Indaw]]. In late May, they defeated a Chindit brigade to clear the lines of communication to the [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th division]], but at the end of June the division was [[Battle of Mogaung|driven from Mogaung]], with 1600 casualties.<ref>Allen (1984), p.375 fn</ref>\n\nFrom January 1945, the division was used as a reserve force in the [[Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay]], with the main body of the ''53rd division'' staying south of [[Mandalay]]. The 119th infantry regiment was attached to the 18th division for its attacks on Meiktila. After the attacks on Meiktila were broken off, the remnants of the division attempted to hold a position near [[Pyawbwe Township|Pyawbwe]] but were overrun by allied tanks.<ref>Allen (1984), p.463</ref>\n\nFinally, after retreating south, the division suffered further heavy casualties to artillery fire and airstrikes in the [[Battle of the Sittang Bend]] in July\u2013August 1945.
