Despite this information being corrected to consider them \"upcoming\" features, the flood of criticism prompted [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] to pull the game from sale on Steam and offer refunds, stating that the game was accidentally made available for purchase prematurely. In an interview with [[PC Gamer]], executive producer Sergey Titov (who was also listed as a producer for ''[[Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing]]'') claimed that its servers were temporarily capped at 50 due to player feedback, and that its marketing team had misinterpreted information about the current state of the game. Due to its similar themes, gameplay, and title, some also felt that ''The War Z'' was a clone of the popular ''[[ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead]]'' mod ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'' (of which a [[DayZ (video game)|standalone version]] was in development); on June 20, 2013, Hammerpoint announced that the game would be renamed ''Infestation: Survivor Stories'', \"primarily as a result of some confusion and trademark issues with a similarly titled property\" (a statement which also factored in a conflict with the film ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'').<ref name=\"gamespy-warzclaims\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1226980p1.html|title=A Shocking Interview With The War Z Developer On False Steam Store Claims|last=Stapleton|first=Dan|date=December 18, 2012|work=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcgamer-warzinterview\">{{cite magazine|title=The War Z interview: Sergey Titov responds to backlash, sale removal from Steam|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/20/the-war-z-interview-sergey-titov-backlash|magazine=PC Gamer|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"eurog - 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-19-the-war-z-dev-apologises-to-gamers-who-misread-steam-page-hits-out-at-dayz-fanboys|title=The War Z dev apologises to gamers who \"misread\" Steam page, hits out at \"extreme DayZ fanboys\"|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=December 19, 2012|website=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcgamer-warzrenamed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/06/20/the-war-z-renamed-as-infestation-survivor-stories-is-still-rubbish/|title=The War Z renamed as Infestation: Survivor Stories \u2013 is still rubbish|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== ''SimCity'' (2013) ===\n''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'', developed by [[Maxis]] and [[Electronic Arts]] (EA), was aimed to augment the normally single-player [[city-building game]] with online features that would allow players' cities to interact with one other, building a software platform rather than a single game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/5/20/11722342/simcity-launch-ea-maxis-ocean-quigley |title=SimCity 2013's creative director explains what went right and what went so, so wrong |first=Samit |last=Sarkar |date=May 20, 2016 |accessdate=July 5, 2017 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> The game was released in March 2013, but there was no offline mode, and the servers for online connectivity were over capacity, requiring players to wait upwards of thirty minutes to play for several weeks following launch.

Despite this information being corrected to consider them \"upcoming\" features, the flood of criticism prompted [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] to pull the game from sale on Steam and offer refunds, stating that the game was accidentally made available for purchase prematurely. In an interview with [[PC Gamer]], executive producer Sergey Titov (who was also listed as a producer for ''[[Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing]]'') claimed that its servers were temporarily capped at 50 due to player feedback, and that its marketing team had misinterpreted information about the current state of the game. Due to its similar themes, gameplay, and title, some also felt that ''The War Z'' was a clone of the popular ''[[ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead]]'' mod ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'' (of which a [[DayZ (video game)|standalone version]] was in development); on June 20, 2013, Hammerpoint announced that the game would be renamed ''Infestation: Survivor Stories'', \"primarily as a result of some confusion and trademark issues with a similarly titled property\" (a statement which also factored in a conflict with the film ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'').<ref name=\"gamespy-warzclaims\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1226980p1.html|title=A Shocking Interview With The War Z Developer On False Steam Store Claims|last=Stapleton|first=Dan|date=December 18, 2012|work=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcgamer-warzinterview\">{{cite magazine|title=The War Z interview: Sergey Titov responds to backlash, sale removal from Steam|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/20/the-war-z-interview-sergey-titov-backlash|magazine=PC Gamer|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"eurog - 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-19-the-war-z-dev-apologises-to-gamers-who-misread-steam-page-hits-out-at-dayz-fanboys|title=The War Z dev apologises to gamers who \"misread\" Steam page, hits out at \"extreme DayZ fanboys\"|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=December 19, 2012|website=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcgamer-warzrenamed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/06/20/the-war-z-renamed-as-infestation-survivor-stories-is-still-rubbish/|title=The War Z renamed as Infestation: Survivor Stories \u2013 is still rubbish|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== ''SimCity'' (2013) ===\n''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'', developed by [[Maxis]] and [[Electronic Arts]] (EA), was aimed to augment the normally single-player [[city-building game]] with online features that would allow players' cities to interact with one other, building a software platform rather than a single game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/5/20/11722342/simcity-launch-ea-maxis-ocean-quigley |title=SimCity 2013's creative director explains what went right and what went so, so wrong |first=Samit |last=Sarkar |date=May 20, 2016 |accessdate=July 5, 2017 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> The game was released in March 2013, but there was no offline mode, and the servers for online connectivity were over capacity, requiring players to wait upwards of thirty minutes to play for several weeks following launch.

Coupled with the tiered distribution of items from Star Crates, many journalists and players expressed concern over how the game was treating consumers due to these loot box mechanics; other games released in 2017 had raised similar issues, but ''Battlefront II'' became a large focus due to the highly visible nature of the ''Star Wars'' branding.<ref name=\"eg pegi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-11-are-loot-boxes-gambling|title=Are loot boxes gambling?|last=Hood|first=Vic|date=October 12, 2017|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"cbc\">{{cite web | url =  http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/video-games-loot-boxes-1.4373079 |title = Loot box brouhaha: Are video games becoming too much like gambling?  |first = Jonathan | last = Ore | date = October 29, 2017 | accessdate = October 30, 2017 | work = [[CBC News|CBC]] }}</ref> One official response on [[Reddit]] to a player's complaint about the cost of acquiring Darth Vader ended up with more than 683,000 downvotes, subsequently noted by the [[Guinness World Records]] in their 2020 edition as the most downvoted comment on Reddit to that point.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/eas-infamous-defense-of-lootboxes-wins-a-guinness-world-record-for-most-downvoted-comment-on-reddit/ | title = EA's infamous defense of Battlefront 2's awful grind wins a Guinness World Record | first = Steven | last = Messner | date = September 6, 2019 | accessdate = September 6, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nEA made a number of revisions to the Star Crate approach prior to launch, such as reducing the cost of the special characters by 75%, but a large portion of the players still were critical of the overall \"pay-to-win\" nature.
