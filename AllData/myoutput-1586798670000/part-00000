Stafford|Thomas Stafford]], from [[Ellington Air Force Base]] to [[Lambert Field]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, for two weeks of space rendezvous simulator training.<ref name=\"losingtm\" /> The prime crew flew in one jet and the backup crew in another. See was the pilot of their [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] trainer jet. The weather at Lambert Field was poor and required an [[instrument approach]]. Both jets overshot the initial landing attempt; See continued with a [[visual circling approach]] and Stafford elected to follow the standard procedure for a [[missed approach]]. On his second attempt, See undershot the runway, hit the afterburners and turned to the right.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2003|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe jet crashed into McDonnell Aircraft Building 101, where the Gemini spacecraft was built. See was found in a parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat. Both astronauts died instantly from trauma sustained in the accident. They died within {{convert|500|ft}} of their spacecraft. See and Bassett were buried near each other in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], and the graves are about 100 yards from [[Theodore Freeman]], another astronaut who died in a T-38 crash three years prior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33458404/the_daily_sentinel/|title=Astronauts See, Bassett Paid Arlington Tributes|newspaper=The Daily Sentinel|location=Grand Junction, Colorado|date=March 4, 1966|page=14|agency=Associated Press|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\"losingtm\">{{cite magazine |first=W.

They rushed over and made excuses for their early surprise visit. After Young arrived to break the news, the three hugged her for comfort. Marilyn Lovell then went to the school to pick up Marilyn See's children, to make sure they did not find out from the press.{{sfn|Koppel|2013|pp=120\u2013122}}\n\nA NASA investigative panel later concluded that [[pilot error]], caused by bad weather, was the principal cause of the accident.
