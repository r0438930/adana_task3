In his former career, he was a [[striker (football)|centre-forward]] from 1978 until 1995, most notably in an eight-year spell at [[Wimbledon F.C.]] in which he won the [[FA Cup]] in 1988 and scored over 100 goals in all competitions.\n\nHe also played for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Miramar Rangers]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He scored 134 league goals in a career lasting 17 years. He was also capped twice at senior level by [[England national football team|England]], but failed to score on either occasion.\n\nFollowing his football career he went on to co-host British television show ''[[Gladiators (UK TV series)|Gladiators]]'' in the 1990s, and between 2003 and 2004 he managed his own Sunday league football side ''[[Fash FC]]'' on [[Bravo (UK TV Channel)|Bravo]].\n\n==Early life==\nFashanu was born in [[Kensington]], London, the son of Pearl Gopal, a nurse from [[British Guyana]] and Patrick Fashanu, a Nigerian [[barrister]] living in the UK. When his parents split up he was sent, together with his older brother [[Justin Fashanu|Justin]] to a [[Barnardo's]] home. When he was five, he and his brother were fostered by Alf and Betty Jackson and were brought up in [[Shropham]] near [[Attleborough]], [[Norfolk]].\n\n==Football career==\n\n===Early career===\nFashanu's footballing career began at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1979, and he turned professional two years later \u2013 just as his brother Justin was transferred to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] from the relegated [[Carrow Road]] club.\n\nNorwich were promoted straight back to the First Division in [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], but Fashanu managed just five league appearances and scored once. He managed two appearances in the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383]] First Division campaign \u2013 which would be his last for the club.\n\nHe had brief loan spell with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and also played in the English off-season in New Zealand with [[Miramar Rangers]], with whom he played in the final of the local equivalent of the FA Cup, the [[1982 Chatham Cup|Chatham Cup]] (he remains the only player to have played in the final of both the English and New Zealand major cup competitions). He joined [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] on a free transfer on 23 September 1983, when they were in the Third Division. He scored seven goals from 26 league games that season, and managed four from 10 league games the following campaign before his \u00a355,000 transfer to Third Division promotion challengers [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 30 November 1984. In his first season at [[The Den]] Fashanu scored four goals in 25 games helping the Lions reach the FA Cup quarter-finals (where they lost at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in a game marred by fans who invaded the pitch) and secure promotion to the Second Division. He managed eight goals from 25 games in [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]], before leaving to join [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].\n\n===Wimbledon===\nFashanu made a \u00a3125,000 move to Second Division promotion contenders [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in March 1986, when they were pushing for a third promotion in four seasons as they looked to complete a rapid rise from the Fourth Division to the First.

Fashanu was Wimbledon's top scorer with 11 league goals, and would be a regular goalscorer in the top flight for the Dons for a further seven seasons.\n\nIn 1988, Fashanu helped Wimbledon win the [[FA Cup]], beating Liverpool in a final that was billed as a \"rags versus riches\" affair, although the two clubs were separated by just six places in the First Division - as Liverpool had been the dominant side in English football for some 15 years whereas Wimbledon had played just two seasons in the First Division and only 11 as a Football League club. He performed well in the league, scoring 14 goals.\n\nHe also scored Wimbledon's goal as Liverpool defeated them 2\u20131 in that year's Charity Shield. Fashanu claimed two [[England national football team|England]] [[cap (sport)|cap]]s \u2013 against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in a friendly tournament in May 1989.\n\nDuring his time at Wimbledon, Fashanu scored 126 goals. His best season was [[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391]], when he was the First Division's second highest scorer with 20 goals as his side finished seventh.\n\nHe received criticism during the ([[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]]) when a clash with [[Gary Mabbutt]], then Spurs captain, in an aerial challenge left the Spurs defender with a broken skull and eye socket.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-mabbutts-skull-fractured-in-fashanu-clash-referee-asks-to-view-the-match-video-1506861.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Football: Mabbutt's skull fractured in Fashanu clash: Referee asks to view the match video | first=Clive | last=White | date=26 November 1993}}</ref> Fashanu had already established a reputation by that point of being an aggressive and physical striker, and this was seen as another example of that behaviour.

However, injury restricted him to just 13 games and 3 goals for a Villa side who narrowly avoided relegation that season. He managed a goal on his Villa debut when they drew 2\u20132 at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on the opening day of the Premier League season, his other two goals coming in successive games against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and then Nottingham Forest in January.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesv/villa95.html |title=Premiership Review 1994/95 Aston Villa |publisher=Rsssf.com |date=1995-06-26 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>\n\nFashanu's last game was on 4 February 1995 away at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a Premiership game that they lost 1\u20130.

At the time, he was the club's record signing.<ref>[http://historicaldons.com/1980.htm#1985-86 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930110421/http://historicaldons.com/1980.htm#1985-86 |date=30 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nFashanu's four goals from the remaining nine league games helped Wimbledon seal the final promotion place and they were a First Division side a mere nine years after being elected to the [[Football League]] - only the second club in [[Football League]] history to be promoted three divisions in four seasons.\n\nFashanu and his colleagues settled well into the First Division, surprising all the observers by finishing sixth in the league (briefly topping the table in early September) and finishing above traditional big clubs including [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Fashanu was Wimbledon's top scorer with 11 league goals, and would be a regular goalscorer in the top flight for the Dons for a further seven seasons.\n\nIn 1988, Fashanu helped Wimbledon win the [[FA Cup]], beating Liverpool in a final that was billed as a \"rags versus riches\" affair, although the two clubs were separated by just six places in the First Division - as Liverpool had been the dominant side in English football for some 15 years whereas Wimbledon had played just two seasons in the First Division and only 11 as a Football League club. He performed well in the league, scoring 14 goals.\n\nHe also scored Wimbledon's goal as Liverpool defeated them 2\u20131 in that year's Charity Shield. Fashanu claimed two [[England national football team|England]] [[cap (sport)|cap]]s \u2013 against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in a friendly tournament in May 1989.\n\nDuring his time at Wimbledon, Fashanu scored 126 goals. His best season was [[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391]], when he was the First Division's second highest scorer with 20 goals as his side finished seventh.\n\nHe received criticism during the ([[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]]) when a clash with [[Gary Mabbutt]], then Spurs captain, in an aerial challenge left the Spurs defender with a broken skull and eye socket.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-mabbutts-skull-fractured-in-fashanu-clash-referee-asks-to-view-the-match-video-1506861.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Football: Mabbutt's skull fractured in Fashanu clash: Referee asks to view the match video | first=Clive | last=White | date=26 November 1993}}</ref> Fashanu had already established a reputation by that point of being an aggressive and physical striker, and this was seen as another example of that behaviour.

However, injury restricted him to just 13 games and 3 goals for a Villa side who narrowly avoided relegation that season. He managed a goal on his Villa debut when they drew 2\u20132 at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on the opening day of the Premier League season, his other two goals coming in successive games against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and then Nottingham Forest in January.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesv/villa95.html |title=Premiership Review 1994/95 Aston Villa |publisher=Rsssf.com |date=1995-06-26 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>\n\nFashanu's last game was on 4 February 1995 away at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a Premiership game that they lost 1\u20130.
