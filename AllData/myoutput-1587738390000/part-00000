In 1933, the Board of Education changed Cal Poly San Luis Obispo into a two-year technical and [[vocational]] school. The institution began to offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1940, with the first baccalaureate exercises held in 1942. The school was renamed the California State Polytechnic College in 1947 to better reflect its higher education offerings, and in 1949, a [[Master of Arts]] degree in education was added. In 1960, control of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and all other state colleges was transferred from the State Board of Education to an independent Board of Trustees, which later became the [[California State University]] system.<ref name=\"Cal Poly Timeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.calpoly.edu/~centen/time/timeline7.htm |title=Cal Poly Historical Timeline}}</ref>\n\nThe college was authorized to offer Master of Science degrees in 1967, and from then to 1970, the school's curriculum was reorganized into different units, such as the School of Science and Math, the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and the School of Architecture. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio station, [[KCPR]],  began as a senior project in 1968. The state legislature changed the school's official name again in 1971 to California Polytechnic State University, and since the 1970s the university has seen steady enrollment growth and building construction.\n\nCal Poly San Luis Obispo celebrated its centennial in 2001 and kicked off a $225 million fundraising campaign, the largest fund-raising effort undertaken in CSU history. The Centennial Campaign raised over $264 million from over 81,000 donors, more than tripling the university's [[Financial endowment|endowment]] from $43 million to over $140 million.\n\nOn May 3, 2017, Cal Poly received one of the largest gifts towards public education to be received in California from Cal Poly alumnus William L. and Linda Frost in the amount of $110 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://magazine.calpoly.edu/news/cal-poly-receives-historic-110-million-gift-alumnus-william-l-frost/ |title=Cal Poly Receives Historic $110 Million Gift from Alumnus William L.

Located about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from the Voorhis campus, the two became known as Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis. Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis broke off from Cal Poly in 1966, becoming the fully independent university, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona).

The polytechnic school held its first classes on October 1, 1903 to 20 students, offering secondary level courses of study, which took three years to complete.<ref name=\"University Archive\">{{cite web |url=http://lib.calpoly.edu/universityarchives/history/timeline/ |title=Highlights in the History of Cal Poly |work=Cal Poly San Luis Obispo |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}</ref> The school continued to grow steadily, except during a period from the mid 1910s to the early 1920s when [[World War I]] led to drops in enrollment and drastic budget cuts forced fewer class offerings.\n\nIn 1924, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo was placed under the control of the California State Board of Education. In 1933, the Board of Education changed Cal Poly San Luis Obispo into a two-year technical and [[vocational]] school. The institution began to offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1940, with the first baccalaureate exercises held in 1942. The school was renamed the California State Polytechnic College in 1947 to better reflect its higher education offerings, and in 1949, a [[Master of Arts]] degree in education was added. In 1960, control of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and all other state colleges was transferred from the State Board of Education to an independent Board of Trustees, which later became the [[California State University]] system.<ref name=\"Cal Poly Timeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.calpoly.edu/~centen/time/timeline7.htm |title=Cal Poly Historical Timeline}}</ref>\n\nThe college was authorized to offer Master of Science degrees in 1967, and from then to 1970, the school's curriculum was reorganized into different units, such as the School of Science and Math, the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and the School of Architecture. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio station, [[KCPR]],  began as a senior project in 1968. The state legislature changed the school's official name again in 1971 to California Polytechnic State University, and since the 1970s the university has seen steady enrollment growth and building construction.\n\nCal Poly San Luis Obispo celebrated its centennial in 2001 and kicked off a $225 million fundraising campaign, the largest fund-raising effort undertaken in CSU history. The Centennial Campaign raised over $264 million from over 81,000 donors, more than tripling the university's [[Financial endowment|endowment]] from $43 million to over $140 million.\n\nOn May 3, 2017, Cal Poly received one of the largest gifts towards public education to be received in California from Cal Poly alumnus William L. and Linda Frost in the amount of $110 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://magazine.calpoly.edu/news/cal-poly-receives-historic-110-million-gift-alumnus-william-l-frost/ |title=Cal Poly Receives Historic $110 Million Gift from Alumnus William L.

The [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]] then donated an {{convert|812|acre|ha|adj=on}} horse ranch in [[Pomona, California]] to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1949.  Located about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from the Voorhis campus, the two became known as Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis. Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis broke off from Cal Poly in 1966, becoming the fully independent university, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona).
