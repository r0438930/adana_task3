The first was on the night of 7{{ndash}}8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on [[Easter Tuesday]], 15 April 1941. Two hundred [[bombers]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on [[London]], this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref name=bbrem>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm|title=The Belfast blitz is remembered|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2001|publisher=BBC News|quote=On 16 April 1941 Belfast was devastated as it bore the worst air raid of any city outside London [\u2026] It was one of the largest German strike forces used to date in the war and the ''Luftwaffe'' was heading for a city later described as the most poorly defended in the United Kingdom.}}</ref><ref name=membb>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a7713966.shtml|title=Memories of the Belfast Blitz|accessdate=19 January 2015|author= [[Belfast Central Library]]|work= WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|quote=No city, save London, suffered more loss of life in one night\u2019s raid on the United Kingdom.}}</ref>\n\nThe third raid on Belfast took place over the evening and morning of 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941; 150 were killed. Incendiary bombs predominated in this raid. The fourth and final Belfast raid took place on the following night, 5{{ndash}}6 May. In total over 1,300 houses were demolished, some 5,000 badly damaged, nearly 30,000 slightly damaged while 20,000 required \"first aid repairs\".<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' (2015) p. 397.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAs the UK was preparing for the conflict, the [[Factory|factories]] and [[shipyard]]s of Belfast were gearing up. Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the ''Luftwaffe''. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK.  Under the leadership of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], it had declared its [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations: the German Legation in [[Dublin]] remained open throughout the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keogh|first=Dermot|title=Eamon de Valera and Hitler: An Analysis of International Reaction to the Visit to the German Minister, May 1945|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/Article.pdf|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69\u201392|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Government===\nThe [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig, Lord Craigavon]], had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. [[Richard Dawson Bates]] was the Home Affairs Minister. [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]], the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to Britain in her time of need.<ref name=\"bardon\">{{cite web|title=Extracts from an article, \"The Belfast Blitz, 1941\"|author=Jonathan Bardon|url=http://www.joeoloughlin.co.uk/?p=65|work=BELFAST BLITZ|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John Clarke MacDermott]], the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the \"Hiram Plan\" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible.<ref name=Hiram>{{cite web|title=Historical Topics Series 2 The Belfast Blitz |url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/historical_topics_series_-_02_-_the_belfast_blitz.pdf |work=BELFAST BLITZ |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> It was MacDermott who sent a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] to de Valera seeking assistance.

He was succeeded by [[John Miller Andrews]], then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He was replaced by 54-year-old [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]] on 1 May.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/02/archives/northern-ireland-gets-new-premier-sir-basil-brooke-54-named-to.html |title=NORTHERN IRELAND GETS NEW PREMIER |accessdate=23 January 2015|date=2 May 1943|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=resigned after criticism from his own Unionist party with regard to the government's unemployment policy.}}</ref>\n\n===Manufacturing facilities===\n* [[Harland and Wolff]] was one of the largest shipbuilding yards in the world.

They are best known for the [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] and the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]] long-range [[heavy bomber]]. Up to 20,000 people were employed. The factory was re-equipping as early as 1936 for the manufacture of 189 [[Handley Page Hereford]] [[bomber]]s\n* [[Mackie International|James Mackie & Sons]] were re-equipped in 1938. They were the primary supplier of [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] anti-aircraft shells.\n* Harland's Engineering works built [[tank]]s. They designed the [[Churchill tank|Churchill]].\n* Aero [[linen]] for covering aircraft, such as the [[Hawker Hurricane]], and [[military glider]] frames was manufactured by a number of Belfast [[flax]] spinning mills, such as The York Street Flax Spinning Co.; Brookfield Spinning Co.; Wm. Ewart's Rosebank Weaving Co.; and the Linen Thread Co.\n* Other Belfast factories manufactured gun mountings, [[Artillery|ordnance]] pieces, aircraft parts and [[ammunition]].\n\nWar materials and food were sent by sea from Belfast to Britain, some under the protection of the [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]. The M.V. ''Munster'', for example, operated by the [[Belfast Steamship Company]], plied between Belfast and [[Liverpool]] under the tricolour, until she hit a [[Naval mine|mine]] and was sunk outside Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|title=Munster|url=http://lugnad.ie/remember-munster/|work=Commemorative Brochure|publisher=[[Maritime Institute of Ireland]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James Craig, Viscount Craigavon, <br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland until his death in 1940. ''[[HMSO]] image'']]\n\n====Government preparation====\nThere was little preparation for the conflict with Germany.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years|last=Barton|first=Brian|year=1989|publisher=Blackstaff Press |location=Belfast|isbn=978-0-85640-426-9 |page=27|quote=Preparing for war ... ... Progress in Northern Ireland was minimal}}</ref> However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: \"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be.\" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: \"if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours'&nbsp;\". His reply was: \"We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|Empire]] to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the [[Ulster]] people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.\"\n\nDawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \"a very definite German objective\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' 2015, p. 41-2.</ref>\n\n====Air-raid shelters====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nBelfast, the city with the highest population density per area in Britain at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \"Belfast Blitz\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were [[Air raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]], constructed of sheets of [[corrugated galvanised iron]] covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. \n\nNo searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some [[barrage balloon]]s positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti-aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and sixteen heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational.\n\n====Children====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nFew children had been successfully evacuated. The \"Hiram Plan\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.\n\n====German preparation====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nFrom papers recovered after the war, we know of a ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:\n* [[Harland and Wolff]]\n* ''Die Tankstelle'' Conns Water\n* Short and Harland aircraft factory\n* The power station of Belfast\n* Rank & Co mill\n* Belfast waterworks\n* [[Victoria Barracks, Belfast|Victoria Barracks]]\n\n[[File:Johnmillerandrews.jpg|thumb|left|John Miller Andrews<br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1940\u201343. ''HMSO image'']]\n\n===Earlier raids===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThere had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]] or the cities of the [[North West England|northwest of England]].\nOn 24 March 1941, [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John MacDermott]], Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\" MacDermott would be proved right.\n\nThe first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, from ''Kampfgruppe 26'', flying at {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, dropped [[Incendiary bomb|incendiaries]], high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. Thirteen lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} factory floor for manufacturing the [[fuselage]]s of [[Short Stirling]] bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over [[Downpatrick]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' crews returned to their base in Northern [[France]] and reported that Belfast's defences were, \"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences.\n\n==Easter Tuesday Blitz==\n[[William Joyce]] (known as \"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \"Easter eggs for Belfast\". {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Junkers Ju88.jpg|right|thumb|Junkers Ju-88]]\nOn [[Easter]] Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match at [[Windsor Park]] noticed a lone [[Luftwaffe#World War I|Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz//personal_peter.shtml|title=The most unprotected city in the UK|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=Peter Hughes|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nThat evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] and headed for [[Belfast]]. There were [[Heinkel He 111]]s, [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dorniers]]. At 10:40&nbsp;pm the [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens sounded]]. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.\n\nPublic buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, the LMS railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the [[Antrim Road]]; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt).\n\nStreets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed.<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\"/>\n\nThere was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the [[anti-aircraft]] batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5{{nbsp}}am.\n\nFifty-five thousand houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref>Wills, (2007). ''That Neutral Island'', page 213.</ref> A stray bomber attacked [[Derry]], killing 15. Another attacked [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15{{nbsp}}am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary ''\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\"''. Since 1:45{{nbsp}}am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the [[Rail transport|railway]] telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35{{nbsp}}am,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} asking the Irish [[Taoiseach]], \u00c9amon de Valera for assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0413/646678-radio-documentary-ww2-hidden-heroes-belfast-blitz-republic-firemen|title=Hidden Heroes of the Belfast Blitz|date=16 April 2011|website=rte.ie|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Human cost==\nOver 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. Fifty-thousand houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. Eleven churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other [[primary source]]s, such as:-<br>\nJimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz;<br>\nEmma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the [[World War I|Great War]]), who kept a [[diary]]; <br> \nand Major Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of [[Queen's University, Belfast]], has written most on this topic.<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713203032/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}</ref>\n\n===Instructions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThere were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes.\n\nMajor O'Sullivan reported that \"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\"\n\nThat night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant [[Shankill Road, Belfast|Shankill area]], took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.\n\n===Mortuary===\nThe mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. Two hundred and fifty-five corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/46 Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 46.]</ref> Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the [[Milltown Cemetery|Milltown]] and [[Belfast City Cemetery|Belfast City Cemeteries]].\n\n===Nurse Emma Duffin===\nNurse Emma Duffin, who had served in [[World War I]], contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:{{quote|(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.}}\n\n==Major Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nMajor Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the [[Mater Infirmorum Hospital|Mater Hospital]] at 2&nbsp;pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, ([[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor [[Errol Flynn]]), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\" O'Sullivan reported: \"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead&nbsp;\u2013 heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\". His report concluded with: \"a second Belfast <!-- word(s) missing? --> would be too horrible to contemplate\".<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\"/>\n\n===Refugees===\nTwo hundred and twenty thousand people fled from the city. Many \"arrived in [[Fermanagh]] having nothing with them only night shirts\". Ten thousand \"officially\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of [[Dromara]] saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In [[Newtownards]], Bangor, Larne, [[Carrickfergus]], Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nMajor O'Sullivan reported on a:{{quote|continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference.\n\nTrain after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.}}\n\nMoya Woodside<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 20750128|title = Woman in Wartime: The Mass-Observation Diary of Moya Woodside|journal = The Irish Review (1986\u2013)|issue = 42|pages = 58\u201371|last1 = Muldowney|first1 = Mary|year = 2010}}</ref> noted in her diary: \"Evacuation is taking on panic proportions.

A ''Luftwaffe'' pilot gave this description \"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]] or [[Glasgow]].\" [[William Joyce]] \"Lord Haw-Haw\" announced that \"The F\u00fchrer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from [[Joseph Goebbels]] were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that [[Adolf Hitler]], in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and [[Irish American]] politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[Eduard Hempel]], the German Minister to Ireland, visited the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Ministry for External Affairs]] to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\" He stated that \"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\".\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThe government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. [[Tommy Henderson]], an Independent Unionist MP in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\"\n\n[[File:Belfast-Lough-2.png|thumb|left|A map showing the location of Belfast Lough]]\nUS journalist [[Ben Robertson (journalist)|Ben Robertson]] reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.<ref name=\"ingersoll1940\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n213/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=194}}</ref> One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In ''The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years'', Brian Barton wrote: \"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \"too far north\" to use radio guidance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOther writers, such as Tony Gray in ''The Lost Years'' state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of [[Belfast Lough]], would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\", \"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the [[IRA Army Council]] to [[IRA Abwehr World War II|support Germany]]. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However on 20 October 1941 the Garda captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and Sydenham aerodrome, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p397</ref><ref>Report by the Garda 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722</ref>\n\n===Firemen return south===\nAfter three days, sometime after 6{{nbsp}}pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in [[Banbridge]]; others were entertained in the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] hall in [[Newry]]. In 1995. on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. an invitation was received by the [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] for any survivors of that time to attend a function at [[Hillsborough Castle]] and meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Only four were known still to be alive; one, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Second major raid===\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H9464.jpg|thumb|Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid]]\nThere was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1{{nbsp}}am, ''Luftwaffe'' bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\"<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\">''Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941'', Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011)</ref> were dropped.

St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire.

The first was on the night of 7{{ndash}}8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on [[Easter Tuesday]], 15 April 1941. Two hundred [[bombers]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid.

Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the ''Luftwaffe''. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK.  Under the leadership of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], it had declared its [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations: the German Legation in [[Dublin]] remained open throughout the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keogh|first=Dermot|title=Eamon de Valera and Hitler: An Analysis of International Reaction to the Visit to the German Minister, May 1945|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/Article.pdf|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69\u201392|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Government===\nThe [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came.

His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. [[Richard Dawson Bates]] was the Home Affairs Minister. [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]], the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister.

He was succeeded by [[John Miller Andrews]], then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor.

The factory was re-equipping as early as 1936 for the manufacture of 189 [[Handley Page Hereford]] [[bomber]]s\n* [[Mackie International|James Mackie & Sons]] were re-equipped in 1938. They were the primary supplier of [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] anti-aircraft shells.\n* Harland's Engineering works built [[tank]]s.

The M.V. ''Munster'', for example, operated by the [[Belfast Steamship Company]], plied between Belfast and [[Liverpool]] under the tricolour, until she hit a [[Naval mine|mine]] and was sunk outside Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|title=Munster|url=http://lugnad.ie/remember-munster/|work=Commemorative Brochure|publisher=[[Maritime Institute of Ireland]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James Craig, Viscount Craigavon, <br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland until his death in 1940.

Progress in Northern Ireland was minimal}}</ref> However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: \"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be.\" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: \"if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours'&nbsp;\". His reply was: \"We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|Empire]] to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the [[Ulster]] people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.\"\n\nDawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \"a very definite German objective\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' 2015, p. 41-2.</ref>\n\n====Air-raid shelters====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nBelfast, the city with the highest population density per area in Britain at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \"Belfast Blitz\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were [[Air raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]], constructed of sheets of [[corrugated galvanised iron]] covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. \n\nNo searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some [[barrage balloon]]s positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti-aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and sixteen heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational.\n\n====Children====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nFew children had been successfully evacuated. The \"Hiram Plan\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.\n\n====German preparation====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nFrom papers recovered after the war, we know of a ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:\n* [[Harland and Wolff]]\n* ''Die Tankstelle'' Conns Water\n* Short and Harland aircraft factory\n* The power station of Belfast\n* Rank & Co mill\n* Belfast waterworks\n* [[Victoria Barracks, Belfast|Victoria Barracks]]\n\n[[File:Johnmillerandrews.jpg|thumb|left|John Miller Andrews<br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1940\u201343. ''HMSO image'']]\n\n===Earlier raids===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThere had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]] or the cities of the [[North West England|northwest of England]].\nOn 24 March 1941, [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John MacDermott]], Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\" MacDermott would be proved right.\n\nThe first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, from ''Kampfgruppe 26'', flying at {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, dropped [[Incendiary bomb|incendiaries]], high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. Thirteen lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} factory floor for manufacturing the [[fuselage]]s of [[Short Stirling]] bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over [[Downpatrick]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' crews returned to their base in Northern [[France]] and reported that Belfast's defences were, \"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences.\n\n==Easter Tuesday Blitz==\n[[William Joyce]] (known as \"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \"Easter eggs for Belfast\". {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Junkers Ju88.jpg|right|thumb|Junkers Ju-88]]\nOn [[Easter]] Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match at [[Windsor Park]] noticed a lone [[Luftwaffe#World War I|Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz//personal_peter.shtml|title=The most unprotected city in the UK|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=Peter Hughes|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nThat evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] and headed for [[Belfast]]. There were [[Heinkel He 111]]s, [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dorniers]]. At 10:40&nbsp;pm the [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens sounded]]. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.\n\nPublic buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, the LMS railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the [[Antrim Road]]; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt).\n\nStreets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed.<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\"/>\n\nThere was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the [[anti-aircraft]] batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5{{nbsp}}am.\n\nFifty-five thousand houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref>Wills, (2007). ''That Neutral Island'', page 213.</ref> A stray bomber attacked [[Derry]], killing 15. Another attacked [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15{{nbsp}}am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary ''\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\"''. Since 1:45{{nbsp}}am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the [[Rail transport|railway]] telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35{{nbsp}}am,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} asking the Irish [[Taoiseach]], \u00c9amon de Valera for assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0413/646678-radio-documentary-ww2-hidden-heroes-belfast-blitz-republic-firemen|title=Hidden Heroes of the Belfast Blitz|date=16 April 2011|website=rte.ie|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Human cost==\nOver 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. Fifty-thousand houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. Eleven churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other [[primary source]]s, such as:-<br>\nJimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz;<br>\nEmma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the [[World War I|Great War]]), who kept a [[diary]]; <br> \nand Major Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of [[Queen's University, Belfast]], has written most on this topic.<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713203032/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}</ref>\n\n===Instructions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThere were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes.\n\nMajor O'Sullivan reported that \"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\"\n\nThat night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant [[Shankill Road, Belfast|Shankill area]], took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.\n\n===Mortuary===\nThe mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. Two hundred and fifty-five corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/46 Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 46.]</ref> Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the [[Milltown Cemetery|Milltown]] and [[Belfast City Cemetery|Belfast City Cemeteries]].\n\n===Nurse Emma Duffin===\nNurse Emma Duffin, who had served in [[World War I]], contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:{{quote|(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.}}\n\n==Major Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nMajor Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the [[Mater Infirmorum Hospital|Mater Hospital]] at 2&nbsp;pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, ([[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor [[Errol Flynn]]), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\" O'Sullivan reported: \"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead&nbsp;\u2013 heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\". His report concluded with: \"a second Belfast <!-- word(s) missing? --> would be too horrible to contemplate\".<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\"/>\n\n===Refugees===\nTwo hundred and twenty thousand people fled from the city. Many \"arrived in [[Fermanagh]] having nothing with them only night shirts\". Ten thousand \"officially\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of [[Dromara]] saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In [[Newtownards]], Bangor, Larne, [[Carrickfergus]], Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nMajor O'Sullivan reported on a:{{quote|continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference.\n\nTrain after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.}}\n\nMoya Woodside<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 20750128|title = Woman in Wartime: The Mass-Observation Diary of Moya Woodside|journal = The Irish Review (1986\u2013)|issue = 42|pages = 58\u201371|last1 = Muldowney|first1 = Mary|year = 2010}}</ref> noted in her diary: \"Evacuation is taking on panic proportions. Roads out of town are still one stream of cars, with mattresses and bedding tied on top. Everything on wheels is being pressed into service. People are leaving from all parts of town and not only from the bombed areas. Where they are going, what they will find to eat when they get there, nobody knows.\"\n\nDawson Bates informed the Cabinet of rack-renting of barns, and over thirty people per house in some areas.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/49 <!-- quote=rack. --> Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 49.]</ref>\n\n===Newspaper reaction===\n''[[The Irish Times]]'' editorial on 17 April:\n{{quote|Humanity knows no borders, no politics, no differences of religious belief. Yesterday for once the people of Ireland were united under the shadow of a national blow. Has it taken bursting bombs to remind the people of this little country that they have common tradition, a common genius and a common home? Yesterday the hand of good-fellowship was reached across the Border. Men from the South worked with men from the North in the universal cause of the relief of suffering.}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Southern reaction===\nBy 6{{nbsp}}am, within two hours of the request for assistance, 71 [[Firefighter|firemen]] with 13 [[Fire apparatus|fire tenders]] from [[Dundalk]], [[Drogheda]], Dublin, and [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived.\n\n[[Taoiseach]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] formally protested to Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |title=The Dublin Bombing |work=D\u00e1il Debates, Volume 83 |publisher=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann |date=5 June 1941 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922035553/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}</ref> He followed up with his \"they are our people\" speech, made in [[Castlebar]], County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the ''Dundalk Democrat'' dated Saturday 26 April 1941):\n{{quote|In the past, and probably in the present, too, a number of them did not see eye to eye with us politically, but they are our people{{spaced ndash}}we are one and the same people{{spaced ndash}}and their sorrows in the present instance are also our sorrows; and I want to say to them that any help we can give to them in the present time we will give to them whole-heartedly, believing that were the circumstances reversed they would also give us their help whole-heartedly ...}}\n[[Frank Aiken]], the [[Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures|Irish Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures]] was in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] at the time. He gave an interview saying: \"the people of Belfast are Irish people too\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tom Geraghty|author2=Trevor Whitehead|title=The Dublin Fire Brigade|date=2004|publisher=Dublin City Council|location=Dublin|isbn=978-0946841714|page=229}}<!--|accessdate=15 April 2015--></ref>\n\n===German response===\nInitial German radio broadcasts celebrated the raid. A ''Luftwaffe'' pilot gave this description \"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]] or [[Glasgow]].\" [[William Joyce]] \"Lord Haw-Haw\" announced that \"The F\u00fchrer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from [[Joseph Goebbels]] were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that [[Adolf Hitler]], in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and [[Irish American]] politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[Eduard Hempel]], the German Minister to Ireland, visited the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Ministry for External Affairs]] to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\" He stated that \"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\".\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThe government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. [[Tommy Henderson]], an Independent Unionist MP in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\"\n\n[[File:Belfast-Lough-2.png|thumb|left|A map showing the location of Belfast Lough]]\nUS journalist [[Ben Robertson (journalist)|Ben Robertson]] reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.<ref name=\"ingersoll1940\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n213/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=194}}</ref> One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In ''The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years'', Brian Barton wrote: \"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \"too far north\" to use radio guidance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOther writers, such as Tony Gray in ''The Lost Years'' state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of [[Belfast Lough]], would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\", \"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the [[IRA Army Council]] to [[IRA Abwehr World War II|support Germany]]. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However on 20 October 1941 the Garda captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and Sydenham aerodrome, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p397</ref><ref>Report by the Garda 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722</ref>\n\n===Firemen return south===\nAfter three days, sometime after 6{{nbsp}}pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in [[Banbridge]]; others were entertained in the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] hall in [[Newry]]. In 1995 on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War an invitation was received by the [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] for any survivors of that time to attend a function at [[Hillsborough Castle]] and meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Only four were known still to be alive; one, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Second major raid===\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H9464.jpg|thumb|Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid]]\nThere was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1{{nbsp}}am, ''Luftwaffe'' bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\"<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\">''Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941'', Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011)</ref> were dropped. Over 150 people lost their lives in what became known as the 'Fire Blitz'.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nCasualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45{{nbsp}}pm while the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked more cautiously from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Media depictions==\nThe 2017 film ''[[Zoo (2017 film)|Zoo]]'' depicts an air raid during the Belfast Blitz.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Blitz]]\n* [[Aerial bombing of cities]]\n* [[Harland and Wolff]]\n* [[Belfast]]\n* [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]\n* [[Bombing of Dublin in World War II]]\n* [[Ulster Defence Volunteers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Brian Barton (2015).
