The [[superfactorial|product of the first 3 factorials]], twelve is a [[superior highly composite number]], divisible by [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], and [[6 (number)|6]].\n\nIt is approximately the number of full [[new moon|lunations of the moon]] in a year, and the number of years for a [[Jupiter#Pre-telescopic_research|full cycle of Jupiter]], which was historically considered the brightest \"wandering star\". It is central to many systems of timekeeping, including the [[Gregorian calendar|Western calendar]] and [[time|units of time of day]], and frequently appears in the world\u2019s major religions.\n\n{{anchor|Etymology}}\n\n==Name==\nTwelve is the largest number with a [[monosyllable|single-syllable]] name in [[English language|English]]. Early [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] numbers have been theorized to have been non-[[decimal]]: evidence includes the unusual phrasing of [[11 (number)|eleven]] and twelve, the [[long hundred|former use of \"hundred\"]] to refer to groups of [[120 (number)|120]], and the presence of glosses such as \"tentywise\" or \"ten-count\" in medieval texts showing that writers could not presume their readers would normally understand them that way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gordon |first = E.

Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (''sixteen'', ''twenty-seven'', ''fifteen thousand'', but ''372'' or ''15,001'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/writing_numbers.html|title=Numbers: Writing Numbers // Purdue Writing Lab|first=|date=|website=Purdue Writing Lab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2020}}</ref>\nIn [[German orthography]], there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve  (''zw\u00f6lf'').

Twelve is also a [[highly composite number]], the next one being [[24 (number)|twenty-four]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002182|title=Sloane's A002182 : Highly composite numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>\n\nTwelve is the smallest [[abundant number]], since it is the smallest integer for which the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16) is greater than itself. Twelve is a [[sublime number]], a number that has a [[perfect number]] of divisors, and the sum of its divisors is also a perfect number.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://oeis.org/A081357|title=Sloane's A081357 : Sublime numbers |website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |publisher=OEIS Foundation |access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref> Since there is a subset of 12's proper divisors that add up to 12 (all of them but with 4 excluded), 12 is a [[semiperfect number]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://oeis.org/A005835 |title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers |website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>\n\nIf an odd [[perfect number]] is of the form 12''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, it has at least twelve distinct prime factors.\n\nA twelve-sided [[polygon]] is a [[dodecagon]]. A twelve-[[face (geometry)|faced]] [[polyhedron]] is a [[dodecahedron]]. Regular [[cube]]s and [[octahedron]]s both have 12 edges, while regular [[icosahedron]]s have 12 vertices. Twelve is a [[pentagonal number]]. The densest three-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] [[sphere packing]] has each sphere touching 12 others, and this is almost certainly true for ''any'' arrangement of spheres  (the [[Kepler conjecture]]). Twelve is also the [[kissing number]] in three dimensions.\n\nTwelve is the smallest weight for which a [[cusp form]] exists. This cusp form is the discriminant \u0394(''q'') whose Fourier coefficients are given by the [[Ramanujan]] {{mvar|&tau;}}-function and which is (up to a constant multiplier) the 24th power of the [[Dedekind eta function]]. This fact is related to a constellation of interesting appearances of the number twelve in mathematics ranging from the value of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at \u22121 i.e. \u03b6(\u22121)&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|12}}, the fact that the abelianization of [[SL(2,Z)]] has twelve elements, and even the properties of lattice polygons.\n\nThere are twelve [[Jacobian elliptic function]]s and twelve cubic [[distance-transitive graph]]s.\n\nThere are 12 [[Latin square]]s of size 3 \u00d7 3.\n\nThe [[duodecimal]] system (12<sub>10</sub> [twelve] =&nbsp;10<sub>12</sub>), which is the use of 12 as a division factor for many [[ancient weights and measures|ancient]] and [[medieval weights and measures]], including [[hour]]s, probably originates from [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn [[base thirteen]] and higher bases (such as [[hexadecimal]]), twelve is represented as C.

The [[superfactorial|product of the first 3 factorials]], twelve is a [[superior highly composite number]], divisible by [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], and [[6 (number)|6]].\n\nIt is approximately the number of full [[new moon|lunations of the moon]] in a year, and the number of years for a [[Jupiter#Pre-telescopic_research|full cycle of Jupiter]], which was historically considered the brightest \"wandering star\".

Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (''sixteen'', ''twenty-seven'', ''fifteen thousand'', but ''372'' or ''15,001'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/writing_numbers.html|title=Numbers: Writing Numbers // Purdue Writing Lab|first=|date=|website=Purdue Writing Lab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2020}}</ref>\nIn [[German orthography]], there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve  (''zw\u00f6lf'').

A twelve-[[face (geometry)|faced]] [[polyhedron]] is a [[dodecahedron]]. Regular [[cube]]s and [[octahedron]]s both have 12 edges, while regular [[icosahedron]]s have 12 vertices. Twelve is a [[pentagonal number]]. The densest three-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] [[sphere packing]] has each sphere touching 12 others, and this is almost certainly true for ''any'' arrangement of spheres  (the [[Kepler conjecture]]). Twelve is also the [[kissing number]] in three dimensions.\n\nTwelve is the smallest weight for which a [[cusp form]] exists.
