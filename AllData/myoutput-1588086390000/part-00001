Wong Won was a co-founder and original member of controversial rap group [[2 Live Crew]], appearing on all of the group's albums from 1985 to 1998. \n\nWong Won was born and spent his early childhood in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], before emigrating to the [[United States of America|United States]] and settling in [[Brooklyn, New York]] with his family when he was 12. In his early twenties, Wong Won received recognition as a rapper while enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] and stationed in [[California]], with fellow [[Airman#United States Air Force|Airmen]] Amazing Vee (Yuri Vielot) and [[Mr. Mixx]] (David Hobbs), with whom he co-founded [[2 Live Crew]].\n\nEarly 2 Live Crew singles gained traction in [[Florida]], so much so that [[Miami]]-based [[Tour promoter|concert promoter]], [[Luther Campbell]], invited them to perform in Florida. After achieving a level of success performing in Florida, Wong Won and Hobbs relocated there. By 1986, the group released the single \"Throw The \u2018D\u2019\", with Wong Won solely writing and performing the rap. It is now considered the blueprint of [[Miami bass]]. Later that year, 2 Live Crew released their [[Music recording certification|Gold]] debut [[studio album]], ''[[The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are]]'' with rapper [[Brother Marquis]] (Mark D. Ross) and Campbell as the group's producer and [[hype man]]. The album established the group's signature style of comical [[sexually explicit]] lyrics. 2 Live Crew's third studio album ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]'' (1989), went [[Platinum record|Platinum]], and was met with considerable controversy which helped turn the group into a major rap act. A [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|U.S. District Court in Florida]] ruled the album legally obscene, with all band members, charged and criminally prosecuted, but all later acquitted. 2 Live Crew would release five subsequent studio albums, at varying degrees of success, with different line-ups, but Wong Won would appear in all incarnations of the group.\n\nWong Won was the first prominent [[Asian hip hop|Asian]] and [[Asian American hip hop|Asian American]] rapper, releasing his first [[solo album]], ''[[The Chinaman (rap album)|The Chinaman]]'' in 1992. In the early 2000s, he released three additional solo studio albums and is credited with discovering rapper [[Flo Rida]]. During 2006-07, he and [[Brother Marquis|Ross]] reformed 2 Live Crew. The duo began to tour, release singles and made announcements of two new albums which remained unreleased. During this time, he published his [[autobiography]] ''My Rise 2 Fame'' (2015). The following year, he left group. In 2017, he released his final project ''Breaking Glass Ceilings Volume 1.,''  and died in Miami, Florida of [[cirrhosis of the liver]] on July 13.\n\n==Early life==\nWong Won was born in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] on May 29, 1964.  Wong Won's family is of [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Trinidadian Chinese]] ancestry, with his Asian heritage originating primarily in [[Hong Kong]].  Both of his grandmothers were of [[African diaspora|African ancestry]].\n\nIn 1976, at the age of 12, Wong Won and his family [[emigrated]] from Trinidad and Tobago to the United States, settling in [[Brooklyn, New York]].\n\nIn 1982, Wong Won graduated from [[Samuel J. Tilden High School]] in Brooklyn, and the following summer, enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.largeup.com/2014/10/10/2-live-crews-fresh-kid-ice/|title=Chatting with The Chinaman: 2 Live Crew's Fresh Kid Ice On Being Trini + Miami Bass|last=Serwer|first=Jesse|publisher=www.largeup.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408035320/http://www.largeup.com/2014/10/10/2-live-crews-fresh-kid-ice/|archive-date=2019-04-07|url-status=}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===1984: Military service, founding 2 Live Crew and Asian Hip hop pioneer===\n{{main|Asian American hip hop}}\n\nIn 1984, while stationed at [[March Air Force Base]] near [[Riverside, California]], Wong Won met fellow musicians and [[Airman#United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force Airmen]] Yuri Vielot (Amazing Vee) and David Hobbs ([[Mr. Mixx]]).

In his early twenties, Wong Won received recognition as a rapper while enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] and stationed in [[California]], with fellow [[Airman#United States Air Force|Airmen]] Amazing Vee (Yuri Vielot) and [[Mr. Mixx]] (David Hobbs), with whom he co-founded [[2 Live Crew]].\n\nEarly 2 Live Crew singles gained traction in [[Florida]], so much so that [[Miami]]-based [[Tour promoter|concert promoter]], [[Luther Campbell]], invited them to perform in Florida. After achieving a level of success performing in Florida, Wong Won and Hobbs relocated there. By 1986, the group released the single \"Throw The \u2018D\u2019\", with Wong Won solely writing and performing the rap. It is now considered the blueprint of [[Miami bass]]. Later that year, 2 Live Crew released their [[Music recording certification|Gold]] debut [[studio album]], ''[[The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are]]'' with rapper [[Brother Marquis]] (Mark D. Ross) and Campbell as the group's producer and [[hype man]]. The album established the group's signature style of comical [[sexually explicit]] lyrics. 2 Live Crew's third studio album ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]'' (1989), went [[Platinum record|Platinum]], and was met with considerable controversy which helped turn the group into a major rap act. A [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|U.S. District Court in Florida]] ruled the album legally obscene, with all band members, charged and criminally prosecuted, but all later acquitted. 2 Live Crew would release five subsequent studio albums, at varying degrees of success, with different line-ups, but Wong Won would appear in all incarnations of the group.\n\nWong Won was the first prominent [[Asian hip hop|Asian]] and [[Asian American hip hop|Asian American]] rapper, releasing his first [[solo album]], ''[[The Chinaman (rap album)|The Chinaman]]'' in 1992. In the early 2000s, he released three additional solo studio albums and is credited with discovering rapper [[Flo Rida]]. During 2006-07, he and [[Brother Marquis|Ross]] reformed 2 Live Crew. The duo began to tour, release singles and made announcements of two new albums which remained unreleased. During this time, he published his [[autobiography]] ''My Rise 2 Fame'' (2015). The following year, he left group. In 2017, he released his final project ''Breaking Glass Ceilings Volume 1.,''  and died in Miami, Florida of [[cirrhosis of the liver]] on July 13.\n\n==Early life==\nWong Won was born in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] on May 29, 1964.  Wong Won's family is of [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Trinidadian Chinese]] ancestry, with his Asian heritage originating primarily in [[Hong Kong]].  Both of his grandmothers were of [[African diaspora|African ancestry]].\n\nIn 1976, at the age of 12, Wong Won and his family [[emigrated]] from Trinidad and Tobago to the United States, settling in [[Brooklyn, New York]].\n\nIn 1982, Wong Won graduated from [[Samuel J. Tilden High School]] in Brooklyn, and the following summer, enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.largeup.com/2014/10/10/2-live-crews-fresh-kid-ice/|title=Chatting with The Chinaman: 2 Live Crew's Fresh Kid Ice On Being Trini + Miami Bass|last=Serwer|first=Jesse|publisher=www.largeup.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408035320/http://www.largeup.com/2014/10/10/2-live-crews-fresh-kid-ice/|archive-date=2019-04-07|url-status=}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===1984: Military service, founding 2 Live Crew and Asian Hip hop pioneer===\n{{main|Asian American hip hop}}\n\nIn 1984, while stationed at [[March Air Force Base]] near [[Riverside, California]], Wong Won met fellow musicians and [[Airman#United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force Airmen]] Yuri Vielot (Amazing Vee) and David Hobbs ([[Mr. Mixx]]).
