The production of Iberian pig is deeply rooted to the Mediterranean ecosystem.

The Iberian breed is currently one of the few examples of a domesticated breed which has adapted to a pastoral setting where the land is particularly rich in natural resources, in this case [[Acorn|acorns]] from the [[holm oak]], [[Portuguese Oak|gall oak]] and [[cork oak]].<ref>Lopez-Bote, C J [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0309-1740(98)90036-5 Sustained utilization of the Iberian pig breed] Available online 18 October 2003; Departamento de Producci\u00f3n Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, [[Universidad Complutense]], [[Madrid]], Spain</ref>\n\nThe numbers of the Iberian breed have been drastically reduced since 1960 due to several factors such as the outbreak of [[African swine fever]] and the lowered value of [[animal fat]]s. In the past few years, however, the production of pigs of the Iberian type has increased to satisfy a renewed demand for top-quality meat and cured products. At the same time, breed specialisation has led to the disappearance of some ancestral varieties.<ref>E Fabuel, E; Barrag\u00e1n, C; Sili\u00f3, L; Rodr\u00edguez, L C and Toro, M A [http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v93/n1/full/6800488a.html Analysis of genetic diversity and conservation priorities in Iberian pigs based on microsatellite markers] [[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]] (2004) 93, 104\u2013113, advance online publication 19 May 2004</ref>\n\nThis traditional breed exhibits a good appetite and propensity to obesity, including a great capacity to accumulate intramuscular and epidermal fat. The high intramuscular fat is what produces the typical marbling; this, together with traditional feeding based on acorns, is what makes its [[ham]] taste so special. The production of meat products from Iberian pigs is quite distinct from other meat products obtained from selected pigs raised under intensive conditions on industrial farms, and it is a good example of a high-quality and highly prized meat product. Iberian pigs are interesting from a human biomedical perspective because they present high feed intake and propensity to obesity, compatible with high values of serum leptin.<ref>Fernandez-Figares I et al 2007:  Serum profile of metabolites and hormones in obese (Iberian) and lean (Landrace) growing gilts fed balanced or lysine deficient diets. Livest Sci, 110:73-81.</ref>\n\nThe Iberian pig can be either red or dark in colour, if black ranging from dark to grey, with little or no hair and a lean body, thus giving rise to the familiar name ''pata negra'', or \"black hoof\".  In traditional management, animals ranged freely in sparse oak forest (''[[dehesa]]'' in Spain, ''montado'' in Portugal), they are constantly moving around and therefore burn more calories than confined pigs. This, in turn, produces the fine bones typical of this kind of ''[[jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico]]''. At least a hectare of healthy ''dehesa'' is needed to raise a single pig, and since the trees may be several hundred years old, the prospects for reforesting lost ''dehesa'' are slim at best.  True ''dehesa'' is a richly diverse habitat with four different types of oak that are crucial in the production of prime-quality ham. The bulk of the acorn harvest comes from the holm oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]'') from November to February, but the season would be too short without the earlier harvests of [[Pyrenean oak]] (''Quercus pyrenaica'') and Portuguese or [[gall oak]] (''Quercus lusitanica''), and the late [[cork oak]] (''Quercus suber'') season, which between them extend the acorn-production period from September almost to April.<ref>Eveleigh, Mark [http://www.geographical.co.uk/Features/Iberian_pigs_Dec_07.html Free little pigs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521040421/http://www.geographical.co.uk/Features/Iberian_pigs_Dec_07.html |date=May 21, 2008 }} December 2007</ref><ref>Harris, Don [http://www.tienda.com/reference/updates.html?update=7079 The Wild West of Spain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322214905/http://www.tienda.com/reference/updates.html?update=7079 |date=2008-03-22 }} October 2005</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Presunto]]\n* [[List of pig breeds]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black Iberian Pig}}\n[[Category:Pig breeds originating in Spain]]\n[[Category:Pig breeds originating in Portugal]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Breed of pig}}\n{{expand Spanish|topic=|otherarticle=Cerdo ib\u00e9rico|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox pig breed\n| name          = Iberian pig\n| image         = BlackPig004.JPG\n| image_alt     = Black Iberian pig\n| image_caption = Black pig being raised in the countryside near [[\u00c9vora]], [[Alentejo]], [[Portugal]]\n| country       = [[Iberian Peninsula]]\n}}\n[[File:Cerdos ibericos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Iberian pigs in [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]]]]\n[[File:Jamon Bellota 2007 BEHER Bernardo Hernandez Guijuelo Salamanca..JPG|thumb|right|150px|''[[Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico]]'', [[BEHER (ham)|BEHER]] \"Bellota Oro\", was selected as \"best ham in the world\" in [[IFFA Delicat]] 2007, 2010 and 2013.]]\nThe '''Iberian pig''' is a traditional [[breed]] of the [[domestic pig]] (''Sus scrofa domesticus'') that is native to the [[Iberian Peninsula]].
