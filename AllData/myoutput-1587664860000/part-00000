It was during one of these stints that Brad met future Blind Melon rhythm guitarist Christopher Thorn.<ref name=\"Prato 2008\"/>  Rogers called Glen Graham to come out to Los Angeles to be the band's drummer.  After auditioning many singers the band met fellow member [[Shannon Hoon]] at a party through a mutual friend.  During his audition, he played his song \"Change\" on acoustic guitar, and the band immediately picked him.<ref name=\"Prato 2008\"/>\n\nWith the band's lineup and name set, the band was signed to Capitol Records in 1991.  Capitol Records released their self-titled debut album, [[Blind Melon (album)|Blind Melon]], in September 1992.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\">{{cite web|title=Blind Melon Official Myspace|url=http://www.myspace.com/blindmelon|publisher=Myspace.com/blendmelon|accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref>  The track \"[[No Rain]]\" became a smash hit, and brought Blind Melon into the spotlight, and causing their debut album to eventually go platinum four times over.  Blind Melon spent 1993 on tour, opening for acts such as [[Neil Young]] and [[Lenny Kravitz]], and starting in 1994, they began headlining their own tour.  Around this time, Blind Melon was nominated Grammys for Best New Artist and Best Rock Performance.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>\n\nDuring the touring, Hoon's drug use began to escalate.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  His girlfriend, Lisa Sinha, gave birth to their first daughter, Nico Blue Hoon, in early 1995, and their second album, [[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]], was released in August 1995.  At the encouragement of the rest of the band, he checked himself into rehab.  Despite concern of Hoon going back to his dangerous ways, the band went on tour in support of Soup, with a drug counselor accompanying Hoon.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  The counselor could not keep Hoon from going back to his drug use, and left the tour after only a month and a half.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  Hoon was found dead at the age of 28 on the band's tour bus the night after a concert from an accidental drug overdose on October 21, 1995.
