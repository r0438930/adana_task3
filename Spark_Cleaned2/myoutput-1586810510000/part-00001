At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.\n\n==Name==\nThough there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nThe district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|Conservative\n|18\n|-\n|Liberal Democrat\n|14\n|-\n|Labour\n|2\n|}\n\n[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].\n\n==Naval and military==\nUntil the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.\n\nSeveral sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].\n\nThere has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.\n\n====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850\u201351====\nIn November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-\u0131 Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].\n\n====Preparations for the D Day Landings====\n[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]\nIn the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Gallery of historic buildings====\n\n=====Naval=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Naval Hospital Haslar - geograph.org.uk - 593470.jpg|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar\nFile:St Vincent's College - geograph.org.uk - 1327446.jpg|Forton Barracks (Royal Marine Light Infantry; later [[HMS St Vincent (Gosport shore establishment)|HMS ''St Vincent'']])\nFile:Haslar Road - geograph.org.uk - 877388.jpg|[[Haslar]] Gunboat Yard and Admiralty Experimental Works (perimeter wall)\nFile:Gate to Clarence Yard - geograph.org.uk - 510.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence [[Victualling Yard]]\nFile:St Clarence Yard Gate Maintenance.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence Victualling Yards under Maintenance, 2019.\nFile:Priddy's Hard Building 2019.jpg|Offices & Storehouse, [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Military=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Fort Blockhouse 03.jpg|[[Fort Blockhouse]]\nFile:Moat around Fort Brockhurst (1) - geograph.org.uk - 1038063.jpg|[[Fort Brockhurst]], moat\nFile:Fort Grange-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704885.jpg|[[Fort Grange]]\nFile:Fort Rowner-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704877.jpg|[[Fort Rowner]], entrance\nFile:St.Georges Barracks - Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 814259.jpg|St George Barracks (Infantry)\nFile:Gosport Barracks geograph-4115962-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|St George Barracks, guardhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.\n\nSouth of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.\n\nWest, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.\n\nIn the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.\n\nThere are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.\n\nGosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.\n\nAn extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.\n\nThe trackbed of the former Gosport \u2013 Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>\n\nBeing a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.\n\nThe station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route.

At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.\n\n==Name==\nThough there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools.

Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|Conservative\n|18\n|-\n|Liberal Democrat\n|14\n|-\n|Labour\n|2\n|}\n\n[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].\n\n==Naval and military==\nUntil the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.\n\nSeveral sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].\n\nThere has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.\n\n====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850\u201351====\nIn November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-\u0131 Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].\n\n====Preparations for the D Day Landings====\n[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]\nIn the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Gallery of historic buildings====\n\n=====Naval=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Naval Hospital Haslar - geograph.org.uk - 593470.jpg|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar\nFile:St Vincent's College - geograph.org.uk - 1327446.jpg|Forton Barracks (Royal Marine Light Infantry; later [[HMS St Vincent (Gosport shore establishment)|HMS ''St Vincent'']])\nFile:Haslar Road - geograph.org.uk - 877388.jpg|[[Haslar]] Gunboat Yard and Admiralty Experimental Works (perimeter wall)\nFile:Gate to Clarence Yard - geograph.org.uk - 510.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence [[Victualling Yard]]\nFile:St Clarence Yard Gate Maintenance.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence Victualling Yards under Maintenance, 2019.\nFile:Priddy's Hard Building 2019.jpg|Offices & Storehouse, [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Military=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Fort Blockhouse 03.jpg|[[Fort Blockhouse]]\nFile:Moat around Fort Brockhurst (1) - geograph.org.uk - 1038063.jpg|[[Fort Brockhurst]], moat\nFile:Fort Grange-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704885.jpg|[[Fort Grange]]\nFile:Fort Rowner-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704877.jpg|[[Fort Rowner]], entrance\nFile:St.Georges Barracks - Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 814259.jpg|St George Barracks (Infantry)\nFile:Gosport Barracks geograph-4115962-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|St George Barracks, guardhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.\n\nSouth of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.\n\nWest, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.\n\nIn the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.\n\nThere are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.\n\nGosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.\n\nAn extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.\n\nThe trackbed of the former Gosport \u2013 Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>\n\nBeing a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.\n\nThe station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route. However, due to Government refusal to fund the scheme, it was formally abandoned in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |title=Tram scheme to be formally abandoned |publisher=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112031656/http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |archivedate=12 January 2007 }}</ref> During 2010, construction started on the same route to provide a rapid bus route between the Holbrook area of Gosport and the town of Fareham. Now completed, regular service buses between Gosport and Fareham divert onto the new route avoiding lengthy queues on the A32 and speeding up commuting time between the towns for bus passengers.\n\n==Present day==\n[[File:Forton Bridge 2019.jpg|thumb|Forton Lake Millennium Bridge 2019]]\n\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] recorded 54,854 people in Gosport of working age between the ages of 16 and 74.
