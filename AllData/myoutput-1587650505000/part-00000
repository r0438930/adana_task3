Tobacco products such as cigars and cigarettes were the only manufactured products among Cuba's leading exports, and even these were produced by a preindustrial process.

To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]] and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.\n\nGovernment efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, \"The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn\u2019t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270631&area=/insight/insight__international%252|title=Wayback Machine|date=13 June 2015|accessdate=23 August 2018}}{{dead link|date=January 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> [[Living conditions]] in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.\n\n===Recovery===\n[[File:GDP-Caribbean.png|thumb|350px|right|Historical evolution of [[GDP per capita]] of Cuba and some other Caribbean countries, based on [http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/Historical_Statistics/horizontal-file_02-2010.xls Maddison] and current [http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/08informacion/panorama2010/Panorama2010.pdf Cuban statistics] ]]\n\nDue to the continued growth of tourism, growth began in 1999 with a 6.2% increase in GDP.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NGjxCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=Due+to+the+continued+growth+of+tourism,+growth+began+in+1999+with+a+6.2%25+increase+in+GDP#v=onepage|title=Cuba Investment, Trade Laws and Regulations Handbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Basic Laws|last=Inc|first=IBP|date=2015-01-26|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781433075698|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} Growth then picked up, with a growth in GDP of 11.8% in 2005 according to government figures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez | first1 = Jorge F | year = 2006 | title = The Cuban Economy in 2005\u20132006: The End of the Special Period?. | url = | journal = Cuba in Transition | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 1\u201313 }}</ref> In 2007 the Cuban economy grew by 7.5%, higher than the Latin American average.

This led to speculation of the emergence of a two-tier economy<ref>[http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |date=2010-07-25 }}</ref> and the fostering of a state of [[tourist segregation|tourist apartheid]]. This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods \u2013 and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]] \u2013 could be had at dollar-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at a disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably. This widened the gap between Cubans' material standards of living, in conflict with the Cuban Government's long term socialist policies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |title=Lessons From Cuba |date=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628061024/http://www.traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |archivedate=28 June 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2017}} Travel Outward</ref>\n\n====Retail====\nCuba has a small retail sector. A few large shopping centers operated in Havana  as of September 2012 but charged US prices. Pre-Revolutionary commercial districts were largely shut down. The majority of stores are small dollar stores, bodegas, agro-mercados (farmers' markets) and street stands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Cuba.html|title=Cuba|website=Nationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Finance===\nThe financial sector remains heavily regulated and access to credit for entrepreneurial activity is seriously impeded by the shallowness of the financial market.\n\n===Foreign investment and trade===\nThe Netherlands receives the largest share of Cuban exports (24%), 70 to 80% of which go through Indiana Finance BV, a company owned by the [[Van 't Wout]] family, who have close personal ties with Fidel Castro. Currently, this trend can be seen in other colonial Caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy. Cuba's primary import partner is Venezuela. The second largest trade partner is Canada, with a 22% share of the Cuban export market.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cuba/canada-cuba-trade.html FAQs on Canada-Cuba trade] CBC</ref>\n\nCuba began courting foreign investment in the Special Period. Foreign investors must form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that 332 [[joint venture]]s had begun. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies. Investors are constrained by the [[Helms\u2013Burton Act|U.S.-Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act]] that provides sanctions for those who traffic in property expropriated from U.S. citizens.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/cuba/35715.htm|title=Cuba (11/03)|newspaper=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nCuba's average tariff rate is 10 percent. As of 2014, the country's planned economy deterred foreign trade and investment.

One is sometimes called the \"national currency\" (or CUP) the other is the [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible peso]] (or CUC, often called \"dollar\" in the spoken language). There are currently 25 CUP per CUC.\n\nIn 1994 the possession and use of US dollars was legalised, and by 2004 the US dollar was in widespread use in the country. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] \u2013 estimated at $500\u2013800 million annually \u2013 the government set up state-run \"dollar stores\" throughout Cuba that sold \"luxury\" food, household and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which could be bought using national pesos. As such, the standard of living diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.\n\nHowever, in response to stricter [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]] and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove US dollars from circulation. In its place, the convertible peso was created, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to the US dollar 1:1. A 10% surcharge is levied for cash conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso, which does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies such as [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba. An increasing number of tourist zones accept Euros.\n\n===Private businesses===\n\nOwners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') originally could seat no more than 12 people<ref name=\"O'Rourke2007\">{{cite book|author=P.

Set monthly fees must be paid regardless of income earned and frequent inspections yield stiff fines when any of the many self-employment regulations are violated.\n\nAs of 2012, more than 150,000 farmers had signed up to lease land from the government for bonus crops. Before, home-owners were only allowed to swap;  once buying and selling were allowed, prices rose.<ref name=BBC2012SimonReeve/>\n\nIn cities, \"[[urban agriculture]]\" farms small parcels. Growing [[organop\u00f3nicos]] (organic gardens) in the private sector has been attractive to city-dwelling small producers who sell their products where they produce them, avoiding taxes and enjoying a measure of government help from the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) in the form of seed houses and advisers.\n\n==Wages, Development, and Pensions==\nTypical wages range from 400 non-convertible Cuban pesos a month, for a factory worker, to 700 per month for a doctor, or a range of around 17\u201330 US dollars per month.

Its overall score was 0.2 point higher than last year, with deteriorations in trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom. Cuba ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America\nregion and its overall score was significantly lower than the regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cuba's economic freedom remained stagnant near the bottom of the \u201crepressed\u201d category. Its overall score improvement was less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom.\n\nDespite some progress in restructuring the state sector since 2010, the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. [[The Heritage Foundation]] states that open-market policies were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment and the lack of competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion. A watered-down reform package endorsed by the Party trimmed the number of state workers and expanded the list of approved professions, but many details of the reform remained obscure.<ref name=\"2014 Index of Economic Freedom\">{{cite web|title=Cuba 2014 |work= [[Index of Economic Freedom]]|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/cuba|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Taxes and revenues ==\nAs of 2009, Cuba had $47.08 billion in revenues and $50.34 billion in expenditures with 34.6% of GDP in public debt, an account balance of $513 million and $4.647 billion in reserves of foreign exchange and gold.<ref name=\"The World Factbook\" /> Government spending is around 67 percent of GDP and public debt is around 35 percent of the domestic economy.

To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]] and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.\n\nGovernment efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, \"The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn\u2019t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible.

This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods \u2013 and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]] \u2013 could be had at dollar-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at a disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably.

Currently, this trend can be seen in other colonial Caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy. Cuba's primary import partner is Venezuela.

Foreign investors must form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that 332 [[joint venture]]s had begun. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies.

One is sometimes called the \"national currency\" (or CUP) the other is the [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible peso]] (or CUC, often called \"dollar\" in the spoken language). There are currently 25 CUP per CUC.\n\nIn 1994 the possession and use of US dollars was legalised, and by 2004 the US dollar was in widespread use in the country. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] \u2013 estimated at $500\u2013800 million annually \u2013 the government set up state-run \"dollar stores\" throughout Cuba that sold \"luxury\" food, household and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which could be bought using national pesos. As such, the standard of living diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.\n\nHowever, in response to stricter [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]] and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove US dollars from circulation. In its place, the convertible peso was created, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to the US dollar 1:1. A 10% surcharge is levied for cash conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso, which does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies such as [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba.

Its overall score was 0.2 point higher than last year, with deteriorations in trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom. Cuba ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America\nregion and its overall score was significantly lower than the regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cuba's economic freedom remained stagnant near the bottom of the \u201crepressed\u201d category. Its overall score improvement was less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom.\n\nDespite some progress in restructuring the state sector since 2010, the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. [[The Heritage Foundation]] states that open-market policies were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment and the lack of competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion. A watered-down reform package endorsed by the Party trimmed the number of state workers and expanded the list of approved professions, but many details of the reform remained obscure.<ref name=\"2014 Index of Economic Freedom\">{{cite web|title=Cuba 2014 |work= [[Index of Economic Freedom]]|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/cuba|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Taxes and revenues ==\nAs of 2009, Cuba had $47.08 billion in revenues and $50.34 billion in expenditures with 34.6% of GDP in public debt, an account balance of $513 million and $4.647 billion in reserves of foreign exchange and gold.<ref name=\"The World Factbook\" /> Government spending is around 67 percent of GDP and public debt is around 35 percent of the domestic economy.
