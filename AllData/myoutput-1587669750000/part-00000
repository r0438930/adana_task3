[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] lay in the hands of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], who were appointed by the British government. Ireland sent 105 members of parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], and [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish]] [[representative peer]]s elected 28 of their own number to sit for life in the [[House of Lords]]. Between 1832 and 1859, 70% of Irish representatives were landowners or the sons of landowners.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\nIn the 40 years that followed the union, successive British governments grappled with the problems of governing a country which had, as [[Benjamin Disraeli]] put it in 1844, \"a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, an alien [[Church of Ireland|established Protestant church]], and in addition the weakest executive in the world\".{{sfn|Blake|1967|p=179}} One historian calculated that, between 1801 and 1845, there had been 114 commissions and 61 special committees enquiring into the state of Ireland, and that \"without exception their findings prophesied disaster; Ireland was on the verge of starvation, her population rapidly increasing, three-quarters of her labourers unemployed, housing conditions appalling and the standard of living unbelievably low\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 36}}\n\nLectures printed in 1847 by [[John Hughes (archbishop of New York)|John Hughes]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Bishop of New York]], are a contemporary exploration into the antecedent causes, particularly the political climate, in which the Irish famine occurred.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160706011946/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SADLIER/IRISH/Hughues.htm \"A Lecture on the Antecedent Causes of the Irish Famine in 1847\"]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ie/books?id=SH4JQiJ5knAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ireland+cause+of+the+famine#v=onepage&q=ireland%20cause%20of%20the%20famine A Lecture on the Antecedent Causes of the Irish Famine in 1847: Delivered By John Hughes]</ref>\n\n===Landlords and tenants===\nDuring the 18th century, the \"middleman system\" for managing landed property was introduced. Rent collection was left in the hands of the landlords' agents, or middlemen. This assured the landlord of a regular income, and relieved them of direct responsibility, while leaving tenants open to exploitation by the middlemen.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=22}}\n\nCatholics, the bulk of whom lived in conditions of [[poverty]] and insecurity despite [[Catholic emancipation]] in 1829, made up 80% of the population. At the top of the \"social pyramid\" was the \"[[Protestant Ascendancy|ascendancy class]]\", the English and [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] families who owned most of the land and held more or less unchecked power over their tenants. Some of their estates were vast; for example, the [[Earl of Lucan]] owned more than {{convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}. Many of these [[absentee landlord]]s lived in England. The rent revenue\u2014collected from \"impoverished tenants\" who were paid minimal wages to raise crops and livestock for export{{sfn|Laxton|1997|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\u2014was mostly sent to England.{{sfn|Litton|1994|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\nIn 1843, the British Government considered that the land question in Ireland was the root cause of disaffection in the country. They established a [[Royal Commission]], chaired by the [[William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], to enquire into the laws regarding the occupation of land. [[Daniel O'Connell]] described this commission as \"perfectly one-sided\", being composed of landlords, with no tenant representation.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 20\u201321}}\n\nIn February 1845, Devon reported:\n<blockquote>It would be impossible adequately to describe the privations which they [the Irish labourer and his family] habitually and silently endure&nbsp;... in many districts their only food is the potato, their only beverage water&nbsp;... their cabins are seldom a protection against the weather&nbsp;... a bed or a blanket is a rare luxury&nbsp;... and nearly in all their pig and a manure heap constitute their only property.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Commissioners concluded they could not \"forbear expressing our strong sense of the patient endurance which the labouring classes have exhibited under sufferings greater, we believe, than the people of any other country in Europe have to sustain\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24}} The Commission stated that bad relations between landlord and tenant were principally responsible. There was no hereditary loyalty, feudal tie, or mitigating tradition of paternalism as existed in England (Ireland was a conquered country). The [[John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare|Earl of Clare]] observed of landlords that \"confiscation is their common title\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 21}} According to the historian [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], landlords regarded the land as a source of income, from which as much as possible was to be extracted. With the Irish \"brooding over their discontent in sullen indignation\" (in the words of the Earl of Clare), the landlords largely viewed the countryside as a hostile place in which to live. Some landlords visited their property only once or twice in a lifetime, if ever.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=21}} The rents from Ireland were generally spent elsewhere; an estimated \u00a36,000,000 was remitted out of Ireland in 1842.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=21}}{{efn|About \u00a3{{inflation|UK|6|1842|fmt=c}} million at current prices.}}\n\nThe ability of middlemen was measured by the rent income they could contrive to extract from tenants.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22}} They were described in evidence before the Commission as \"land sharks\", \"bloodsuckers\", and \"the most oppressive species of tyrant that ever lent assistance to the destruction of a country\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22}} The middlemen leased large tracts of land from the landlords on long leases with fixed rents, which they sublet as they saw fit. They would split a holding into smaller and smaller parcels so as to increase the amount of rent they could obtain. Tenants could be evicted for reasons such as non-payment of rents (which were high), or a landlord's decision to raise sheep instead of [[Cereal|grain crops]]. A [[Cotter (farmer)|cottier]] paid his rent by working for the landlord.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAs any improvement made on a holding by a tenant became the property of the landlord when the lease expired or was terminated, the incentive to make improvements was limited. Most tenants had no security of tenure on the land; as tenants \"at will\", they could be turned out whenever the landlord chose. The only exception to this arrangement was in [[Ulster]] where, under a practice known as [[Custom of Ulster|\"tenant right\"]], a tenant was compensated for any improvement they made to their holding. According to Woodham-Smith, the commission stated that \"the superior prosperity and tranquility of Ulster, compared with the rest of Ireland, were due to tenant right\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=22}}\n\nLandlords in Ireland often used their powers without compunction, and tenants lived in dread of them. Woodham-Smith writes that, in these circumstances, \"industry and enterprise were extinguished and a peasantry created which was one of the most destitute in Europe\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=24}}\n\n===Tenants, subdivisions, and bankruptcy===\nIn 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4\u20132&nbsp;hectares (1\u20135&nbsp;acres) in size, while 40% were of 2\u20136&nbsp;hectares (5\u201315&nbsp;acres). Holdings were so small that no crop other than potatoes would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine, the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support the tenant families after rent was paid; the families survived only by earnings as seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland.{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=15}} Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.{{sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p=15}}\n\nThe 1841 census showed a population of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords in return for the patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into [[monoculture]], since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland could mean the difference between life and death in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Laxton|1997|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\n===Potato dependency===\n[[File:An Irish Peasant Family Discovering the Blight of their Store by Daniel MacDonald.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''An Irish Peasant Family Discovering the Blight of their Store'' by Cork artist Daniel MacDonald, ''c.'' 1847]]\nThe potato was introduced to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. The potato was not popular at first;  however, after an unusual promotion campaign that was supported by landowners and members of royalty, who wanted their tenants to plant and eat the crop, it rose in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutbiodiversity.org/agbdx/eireblight.html|title=The Irish potato famine|accessdate=26 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319153837/http://aboutbiodiversity.org/agbdx/eireblight.html|archivedate=19 March 2012}}</ref> By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food; the main diet was still based on butter, milk, and grain products. By 1800 to 1820, the potato became a staple of the poor, especially in winter.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 19\u201320}} Furthermore, a disproportionate share of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the [[Irish Lumper]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Evan D.

For the labourer, \"a potato wage\" shaped the expanding agrarian economy.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 20}}\n\n{{quote|The Celtic grazing lands of ...

In 1830 and 1831, [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and [[County Galway|Galway]] suffered likewise. In 1832, 1833, 1834, and 1836, dry rot and curl caused serious losses, and in 1835 the potato failed in Ulster. Widespread failures throughout Ireland occurred in 1836, 1837, 1839, 1841, and 1844.

By mid-August 1845, it had reached much of northern and central Europe; Belgium, The Netherlands, northern France, and southern England had all already been affected.{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p=42}}\n\nOn 16 August 1845, ''[[The Gardeners' Chronicle]] and Horticultural Gazette'' reported \"a blight of unusual character\" on the [[Isle of Wight]]. A week later, on 23 August, it reported that \"A fearful malady has broken out among the potato crop&nbsp;... In Belgium the fields are said to be completely desolated.

Only when the crop was lifted (harvested) in October, did the scale of destruction become apparent.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=40\u201341, 43}} Prime Minister [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] wrote to [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]] in mid-October that he found the reports \"very alarming\", but reminded him that there was, according to Woodham-Smith, \"always a tendency to exaggeration in Irish news\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nCrop loss in 1845 has been estimated at anywhere from one third{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2006|p=7}} to as high as one half of cultivated acreage.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=32}} The Mansion House Committee in [[Dublin]], to which hundreds of letters were directed from all over Ireland, claimed on 19 November 1845 to have ascertained beyond the shadow of doubt that \"considerably more than one-third of the entire of the potato crop ... has been already destroyed\".{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p=42}}\n\nIn 1846, three-quarters of the harvest was lost to blight.{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=69}} By December, a third of a million destitute people were employed in public works.{{sfn|Ross|2002|p=311}} According to [[Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da]], the first attack of potato blight caused considerable hardship in rural Ireland, from the autumn of 1846, when the first deaths from starvation were recorded.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2006|p=9}} Seed potatoes were scarce in 1847. Few had been sown, so, despite average yields, hunger continued. 1848 yields were only two-thirds of normal. Since over three million Irish people were totally dependent on potatoes for food, hunger and famine were inevitable.{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=69}}\n\n==Reaction in Ireland==\n[[File:John Mitchel (Young Ireland).JPG|thumb|right|[[John Mitchel]]]]\nThe [[Corporation of Dublin]] sent a memorial to the Queen, \"praying her\" to call Parliament together early (Parliament was at this time [[Legislative session|prorogued]]), and to recommend the requisition of some public money for public works, especially railways in Ireland. The Town Council of [[Belfast]] met and made similar suggestions, but neither body asked for charity, according to [[John Mitchel]], one of the leading Repealers.\n<blockquote>\"They demanded that, if Ireland was indeed an Integral part of the realm, the common exchequer of both islands should be used\u2014not to give alms, but to provide employment on public works of general utility ... if Yorkshire and Lancashire had sustained a like calamity in England, there is no doubt such measures as these would have been taken, promptly and liberally\", Mitchel declared.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|pp=94\u201396}}</blockquote>\n\nIn early November 1845, a deputation from the citizens of Dublin, including the [[Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster|Duke of Leinster]], [[Valentine Lawless, 2nd Baron Cloncurry|Lord Cloncurry]], Daniel O'Connell and the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]], went to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, [[William \u00e0 Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury|Lord Heytesbury]], to offer suggestions, such as opening the ports to foreign corn, stopping distillation from grain, prohibiting the export of foodstuffs, and providing employment through public works.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=48\u201349}} Lord Heytesbury urged them not to be alarmed, that they \"were premature\", that scientists were enquiring into all those matters,{{refn|[[Lyon Playfair]] and [[John Lindley]] were sent from England to investigate with the local assistance of [[Robert Kane (chemist)|Robert Kane]].{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=44\u201345}}|group = fn}} and that the Inspectors of Constabulary and Stipendiary Magistrates were charged with making constant reports from their districts; and there was no \"immediate pressure on the market\".{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|pp=94\u201396}}\n\nOn 8 December 1845, Daniel O'Connell, head of the [[Repeal Association]], proposed several remedies to the pending disaster. One of the first things he suggested was the introduction of \"[[Tenant-Right]]\" as practised in Ulster, giving the landlord a fair rent for his land, but giving the tenant compensation for any money he might have laid out on the land in permanent improvements.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|p=96}} O'Connell noted actions taken by the Belgian legislature during the same season, as they had been hit by blight, too: shutting their ports against the export of provisions, and opening them to imports. He suggested that, if Ireland had a domestic Parliament, the ports would be thrown open and the abundant crops raised in Ireland would be kept for the people of Ireland, as the Dublin parliament had done during the food shortages of the 1780s. O'Connell maintained that only an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]] would provide both food and employment for the people. He said that repeal of the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] was a necessity and Ireland's only hope.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|p=96}}\n\nJohn Mitchel raised the issue of the \"Potato Disease\" in Ireland as early as 1844 in ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'', noting how powerful an agent hunger had been in certain revolutions.<ref>{{citation|work=The Nation Newspaper|title=Hunger|date=1 November 1844}}</ref> On 14 February 1846, he wrote about \"the wretched way in which the famine was being trifled with\", and asked whether the Government still did not have any conception that there might be soon \"millions of human beings in Ireland having nothing to eat\".{{sfn|O'Sullivan|1945}}\n\n[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|left|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine]]\n\nMitchel later wrote one of the first widely circulated tracts on the famine, ''The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)'', published in 1861. It established the widespread view that British actions during the famine and their treatment of the Irish was a deliberate effort to murder the Irish. It contained a sentence that has since become famous: \"The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2007|p=312}} Mitchel was charged with [[sedition]] because of his writings, but this charge was dropped. He was convicted by a packed jury under the newly enacted [[Treason Felony Act 1848|Treason Felony Act]] and sentenced to 14 years [[Penal transportation|transportation]] to [[Bermuda]].{{sfn|Duffy|2007|p = 323}}\n\nAccording to [[Charles Gavan Duffy]], ''The Nation'' insisted that the one remedy was that which the rest of Europe had adopted, which even the parliaments of [[the Pale]] had adopted in periods of distress. That was to retain in the country the food raised by her people until the people were fed.{{sfn|Duffy|1888|pp = 277\u2013278}}\n\nContemporaneously, as found in letters from the period and in particular later oral memory, the name for the event is in {{lang-ga|An Drochshaol}}, though with the earlier [[Irish language#Orthography|spelling standard of the era]], which was [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]], it is found written as in Dro\u010b-\u1e60ao\u0121al.<ref>[https://www.duchas.ie/en/tpc/cbes/4427742?con=GA Letters on the great famine, An Drochshaol.

S. L. Lyons]] characterised the initial response of the British government to the early, less severe phase of the famine as \"prompt and relatively successful\".{{sfn|Lyons|1973|p=30}} Confronted by widespread crop failure in November 1845, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, purchased \u00a3100,000 worth of maize and [[cornmeal]] secretly from America{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=54\u201356}} with [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] initially acting as his agents. The government hoped that they would not \"stifle private enterprise\" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to poor weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=47}} The initial shipments were of unground dried kernels, but the few Irish mills in operation were not equipped for milling maize and a long and complicated milling process had to be adopted before the meal could be distributed.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=64\u201365}} In addition, before the cornmeal could be consumed, it had to be \"very much\" cooked again, or eating it could result in severe bowel complaints.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=47}} Due to its yellow colour, and initial unpopularity, it became known as \"Peel's brimstone\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=73}}\n\nIn October 1845, Peel moved to repeal the [[Corn Laws]]\u2014[[tariff]]s on grain which kept the price of bread high\u2014but the issue split his party and he had insufficient support from his own colleagues to push the measure through. He resigned the premiership in December, but the opposition was unable to form a government and he was re-appointed.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=51\u201352}} In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland,{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=78}} but the famine situation worsened during 1846, and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel's ministry.{{sfn|Blake|1967|pp=221\u2013241}} On 25 June, the [[second reading]] of the government's [[Protection of Person and Property Act 1881#Coercion legislation in Ireland|Irish Coercion Bill]] was defeated by 73 votes in the House of Commons by a combination of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]], Irish Repealers, and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] Conservatives. Peel was forced to resign as prime minister on 29 June, and the Whig leader, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], became prime minister.{{sfn|Doheny|1951|p=98}}\n\n===Whig government===\nThe measures undertaken by Peel's successor, Russell, proved inadequate as the crisis deepened. The new Whig administration, influenced by the doctrine of [[laissez-faire]],{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 410\u2013411}} believed that the market would provide the food needed. They refused to interfere with the movement of food to England, then halted the previous government's food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without access to work, money, or food.{{sfn|Ross|2002|pp = 224, 311}} Russell's ministry introduced a new programme of public works that by the end of December 1846 employed some half million but proved impossible to administer.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\n[[File:Doolough.jpg|thumb|left|A memorial to the victims of the [[Doolough Tragedy]] (30 March 1849). To continue receiving relief, hundreds were instructed to travel many miles in bad weather. A large number died on the journey.]]\n\n[[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], who was in charge of the administration of government relief, limited the Government's food aid programme because of a firm belief in laissez-faire.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=87, 106\u2013108}}\n\nIn January 1847, the government abandoned this policy, realising that it had failed, and turned to a mixture of \"indoor\" and \"outdoor\" direct relief; the former administered in [[workhouse]]s through the [[Irish Poor Laws]], the latter through [[soup kitchen]]s. The costs of the Poor Law fell primarily on the local landlords, some of whom in turn attempted to reduce their liability by evicting their tenants.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\nIn June 1847 the Poor Law Amendment Act was passed which embodied the principle, popular in Britain, that Irish property must support Irish poverty. The landed proprietors in Ireland were held in Britain to have created the conditions that led to the famine.{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}}{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=296\u2013297}} However, it was asserted that the British parliament since the Act of Union of 1800 was partly to blame.{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}} This point was raised in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' on 13 February 1847: \"There was no law it would not pass at their request, and no abuse it would not defend for them.\" On 24 March, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Britain had permitted in Ireland \"a mass of poverty, disaffection, and degradation without a parallel in the world. It allowed proprietors to suck the very life-blood of that wretched race\".{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}}\n\nThe \"Gregory clause\" of the Poor Law, named after [[William Henry Gregory|William H. Gregory]], M.P.{{refn|William H. Gregory became the husband of [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]]. He was heir to a substantial Galway estate in 1847, which he dissipated by gambling debts on the turf in the late 1840s and early 1850s.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=159}}|group = fn}}, prohibited anyone who held at least {{frac|1|4}} of an acre (0.1 ha) from receiving relief.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}} In practice, this meant that, if a farmer, having sold all his produce to pay rent and taxes, should be reduced, as many thousands of them were, to applying for public outdoor relief, he would not get it until he had first delivered up all his land to the landlord. Of this Law, Mitchel wrote that \"it is the [[able-bodied]] idler only who is to be fed\u2014if he attempted to till but one [[Rood (unit)|rood]] of ground, he dies\". This simple method of ejectment was called \"passing paupers through the workhouse\"\u2014a man went in, a pauper came out.{{sfn|Mitchel|1996|p = 16}} These factors combined to drive thousands of people off the land: 90,000 in 1849, and 104,000 in 1850.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\nIn 1849 the [[Encumbered Estates' Court|Encumbered Estates Act]] allowed landlord estates to be auctioned off upon the petition of creditors. Estates with debts were then auctioned off at low prices. Wealthy British speculators purchased the lands and \"took a harsh view\" of the tenant farmers who continued renting. The rents were raised and tenants evicted to create large cattle grazing pastures. Between 1849 and 1854, some 50,000 families were evicted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170107041845/http://www.historicalballinrobe.com/page_id__166.aspx  Ballinrobe Local History: The Encumbered Estates Acts, 1848 and 1849]</ref><ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/240915  Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives (review) David W.

(''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).]]\n\nRecords show that Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782\u201383, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=11}} No such export ban happened in the 1840s.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=354}}\n\nThroughout the entire period of the Famine, Ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food. In the magazine ''[[History Ireland]]'' (1997, issue 5, pp.&nbsp;32\u201336), [[Christine Kinealy]], a Great Hunger scholar, lecturer, and [[Drew University]] professor, relates her findings: Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women, and children died of starvation and related diseases. She also writes that Irish exports of calves, livestock (except pigs), bacon, and ham actually increased during the Famine. This food was shipped from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland: Ballina, Ballyshannon, Bantry, Dingle, Killala, Kilrush, Limerick, Sligo, Tralee, and Westport. A wide variety of commodities left Ireland during 1847, including peas, beans, onions, rabbits, salmon, oysters, herring, lard, honey, tongues, animal skins, rags, shoes, soap, glue, and seed.\n\nOne of the most shocking export figures concern butter. Butter was shipped in firkins, each one holding {{convert|1|firkin|impgal l|0|disp=out|abbr=off}}. In the first nine months of 1847, {{convert|56557|firkin|impgal l|abbr=off}} were exported from Ireland to Bristol, and {{convert|34852|firkin|impgal l|abbr=off}} were shipped to Liverpool, which correlates with {{convert|822681|impgal|l|abbr=off}} of butter exported to England from Ireland during nine months of the worst year of the Famine.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=10}} The problem in Ireland was not lack of food, which was plentiful, but the price of it, which was beyond the reach of the poor.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=165}}\n\nWriting in 1849, English poet and social reformer [[Ebenezer Jones]] wrote that \"In the year A.D. 1846, there were exported from Ireland, 3,266,193 quarters of wheat, barley and oats, besides flour, beans, peas, and rye; 186,483 cattle, 6,363 calves, 259,257 sheep, 180,827 swine; (food, that is, in the shape of meat and bread, for about one half of the Irish population), and yet this very year of A.D. 1846 was pre-eminently, owing to a land monopoly, the famine year for the Irish people.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Ebenezer |title=The Land Monopoly: The Suffering and Demoralization Caused by It, and the Justice & Expediency of Its Abolition |date=1849 |publisher=Chas.

Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over \u00a34 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, there had been some clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=95}} According to [[James S. Donnelly, Jr.]], it is impossible to be sure how many people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=155}}\n\nDonnelly considered this to be an underestimate, and if the figures were to include the number pressured into \"voluntary\" surrenders during the whole period (1846\u20131854), the figure would almost certainly exceed half a million persons.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 156}} While Helen Litton says there were also thousands of \"voluntary\" surrenders, she notes also that there was \"precious little voluntary about them\". In some cases, tenants were persuaded to accept a small sum of money to leave their homes, \"cheated into believing the workhouse would take them in\".{{sfn|Litton|2006|p = 95}}\n\nWest Clare was one of the worst areas for evictions, where landlords turned thousands of families out and demolished their derisory cabins. Captain Kennedy in April 1848 estimated that 1,000 houses, with an average of six people to each, had been levelled since November.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=96}} The Mahon family of Strokestown House evicted 3,000 people in 1847, and were still able to dine on lobster soup.{{sfn|Gibney|2008|p=55}}\n\nAfter Clare, the worst area for evictions was County Mayo, accounting for 10% of all evictions between 1849 and 1854. [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan]], who owned over {{convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}, was among the worst evicting landlords. He was quoted as saying that \"he would not breed paupers to pay priests\". Having turned out in the parish of Ballinrobe over 2,000 tenants alone, he then used the cleared land as grazing farms.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p = 98}} In 1848, the Marquis of Sligo owed \u00a31,650 to Westport Union; he was also an evicting landlord, though he claimed to be selective, saying that he was only getting rid of the idle and dishonest. Altogether, he cleared about 25% of his tenants.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=95\u201398}}\n\nIn 1847, [[Bishop of Meath]], [[Thomas Nulty]], described his personal recollection of the evictions in a pastoral letter to his clergy:\n\n{{quote|Seven hundred human beings were driven from their homes in one day and set adrift on the world, to gratify the caprice of one who, before God and man, probably deserved less consideration than the last and least of them ...

The landed proprietors in a circle all around\u2014and for many miles in every direction\u2014warned their tenantry, with threats of their direct vengeance, against the humanity of extending to any of them the hospitality of a single night's shelter ... and in little more than three years, nearly a fourth of them lay quietly in their graves.<ref name=\"Falc'her-Poyroux\">{{cite journal|last=Falc'her-Poyroux|first=Erick|title=The Great Irish Famine in Songs|journal=Revue Fran\u00e7aise de Civilisation Britannique [Online]|volume=XIX|issue=2|pages=157\u2013172|date=2014|issn=2429-4373|doi=10.4000/rfcb.277|doi-access=free}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Litton, evictions might have taken place earlier but for fear of the secret societies. However, they were now greatly weakened by the Famine. Revenge still occasionally took place, with seven landlords being shot, six fatally, during the autumn and winter of 1847. Ten other occupiers of land, though without tenants, were also murdered, she says.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=99}}\n\nOne such landlord reprisal occurred in West [[Roscommon]]. The \"notorious\" landlord Maj Denis Mahon enforced thousands of his tenants into eviction before the end of 1847, with an estimated 60 percent decline in population in some [[parish]]es. He was shot dead in that year.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/pioneering-study-charts-population-fall-since-famine-1.588108 Pioneering study charts population fall since Famine]</ref> In East Roscommon, \"where conditions were more benign\", the estimated decline in population was under 10 percent.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>\n\n[[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], alarmed at the number of landlords being shot and that this might mean rebellion, asked for special powers. Lord John Russell was not sympathetic to this appeal. Lord Clarendon believed that the landlords themselves were mostly responsible for the tragedy in the first place, saying that \"It is quite true that landlords in England would not like to be shot like hares and partridges ... but neither does any landlord in England turn out fifty persons at once and burn their houses over their heads, giving them no provision for the future.\" The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847|Crime and Outrage Act]] was passed in December 1847 as a compromise, and additional troops were sent to Ireland.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nThe \"Gregory clause\", described by Donnelly as a \"vicious amendment to the Irish poor law\", had been a successful Tory amendment to the Whig poor-relief bill which became law in early June 1847, where its potential as an estate-clearing device was widely recognised in parliament, although not in advance.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=159}} At first, the poor law commissioners and inspectors viewed the clause as a valuable instrument for a more cost-effective administration of public relief, but the drawbacks soon became apparent, even from an administrative perspective. They would soon view them as little more than murderous from a humanitarian perspective. According to Donnelly, it became obvious that the quarter-acre clause was \"indirectly a death-dealing instrument\".{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p=110}}\n\n==Emigration==\n{{main|Irish diaspora|Typhus epidemic of 1847}}\n[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''The Emigrants' Farewell'', engraving by [[Henry Doyle]] (1827\u20131893), from [[Mary Frances Cusack]]'s ''Illustrated History of Ireland'', 1868]]\n\nWhile the famine was responsible for a significant increase in emigration from Ireland, of anywhere from 45% to nearly 85% depending on the year and the county, it was not the sole cause. The beginning of mass emigration from Ireland can be traced to the mid-18th century, when some 250,000 people left Ireland over a period of 50 years to settle in the [[New World]]. Irish economist Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da estimates that between 1 million and 1.5 million people emigrated during the 30 years between 1815 (when [[Napoleon]] was defeated in [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]) and 1845 (when the Great Famine began).{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1975|p = }} However, during the worst of the famine, emigration reached somewhere around 250,000 in one year alone, with western Ireland seeing the most emigrants.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2007}}\n\nFamilies did not migrate ''en masse'', but younger members of families did, so much so that emigration almost became a [[rite of passage]], as evidenced by the data that show that, unlike similar emigrations throughout world history, women emigrated just as often, just as early, and in the same numbers as men. The emigrants would send remittances (reaching a total of \u00a31,404,000 by 1851) back to family in Ireland, which, in turn, allowed another member of their family to leave.{{sfn|Foster|1988|p = 371}}\n\nEmigration during the famine years of 1845\u20131850 was primarily to England, Scotland, South Wales, North America, and Australia; one city that experienced a particularly strong influx of Irish immigrants was [[Liverpool]], with at least one quarter of the city's population being Irish-born by 1851.{{sfn|Foster|1988|p = 268}} Many of those fleeing to the Americas used the well-established [[McCorkell Line]].{{sfn|McCorkell|2010|p = }}\n\n[[File:Population of Ireland and Europe 1750 to 2005.svg|thumb|left|A graph of the populations of Ireland [left axis] and Europe [right axis]{{dubious|date=October 2018}} indexed against date.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Excluding the [[Demography of Scotland|population of Scotland]] and [[Demography of Wales|Wales]] between the 1841 and 1851 censuses the [[Demography of England|population of England]], grew at a similar rate as the decades previous, from 14.8 to 16.7 million.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10061325/cube/TOT_POP Vision of Britain a population through time England], Retrieved 9 August 2013</ref>]]\n\nOf the more than 100,000 Irish that sailed to [[Canada]] in 1847, an estimated one out of five died from disease and malnutrition, including over 5,000 at [[Grosse Isle, Quebec]], an island in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] used to quarantine ships near [[Quebec City]].{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=238}} Overcrowded, poorly maintained, and badly provisioned vessels known as [[coffin ship]]s sailed from small, unregulated harbours in the West of Ireland in contravention of British safety requirements, and mortality rates were high.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=216\u2013217}} The 1851 census reported that more than half the inhabitants of [[Toronto]] were Irish, and, in 1847 alone, 38,000 Irish flooded a city with fewer than 20,000 citizens. Other Canadian cities such as Quebec City, [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] also received large numbers.

However, fearing nationalist insurgencies, the British government placed harsh restrictions on Irish immigration to Canada after 1847, resulting in larger influxes to the United States.\n\nIn America, most Irish became city-dwellers; with little money, many had to settle in the cities that the ships they came on landed in.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=267}} By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the population in [[Boston]], New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. In addition, Irish populations became prevalent in some American mining communities.\n\nThe famine marked the beginning of the depopulation of Ireland in the 19th century. Population had increased by 13\u201314% in the first three decades of the 19th century; between 1831 and 1841, population grew by 5%. Application of [[Thomas Malthus]]'s idea of population expanding geometrically while resources increase arithmetically was popular during the famines of 1817 and 1822.

They recorded 21,770 total deaths from starvation in the previous decade, and 400,720 deaths from disease. Listed diseases were fever, [[diphtheria]], [[dysentery]], [[cholera]], [[smallpox]], and [[influenza]], with the first two being the main killers (222,021 and 93,232).

The diseases that badly affected the population fell into two categories:{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}} famine-induced diseases and diseases of [[Illnesses related to poor nutrition|nutritional deficiency]]. Of the nutritional deficiency diseases, the most commonly experienced were starvation and [[marasmus]], as well as a condition at the time called dropsy. Dropsy ([[oedema]]) was a popular name given for the symptoms of several diseases, one of which, [[kwashiorkor]], is associated with starvation.{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}}\n\nHowever, the greatest mortality was not from nutritional deficiency diseases, but from famine-induced ailments.{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}}{{sfn|Livi-Bacci|1991|p=38}} The malnourished are very vulnerable to [[infection]]s; therefore, these were more severe when they occurred. [[Measles]], [[diphteria]], [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], [[tuberculosis]], most [[respiratory infection]]s, [[Pertussis|whooping cough]], many [[intestinal parasite]]s, and cholera were all strongly conditioned by nutritional status. Potentially lethal diseases, such as smallpox and influenza, were so virulent that their spread was independent of nutrition. The best example of this phenomenon was fever, which exacted the greatest death toll. In the popular mind, as well as medical opinion, fever and famine were closely related.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=196}} Social dislocation\u2014the congregation of the hungry at soup kitchens, food depots, and overcrowded work houses\u2014created conditions that were ideal for spreading infectious diseases such as [[typhus]], [[typhoid]], and [[relapsing fever]].{{sfn|Livi-Bacci|1991|p=38}} {{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}}\n\nDiarrhoeal diseases were the result of poor hygiene, bad sanitation, and dietary changes. The concluding attack on a population incapacitated by famine was delivered by Asiatic cholera, which had visited Ireland briefly in the 1830s. In the following decade, it spread uncontrollably across Asia, through Europe, and into Britain, finally reaching Ireland in 1849.{{sfn|Kennedy|Ell|Crawford|Clarkson|1999|p=104}} Some scholars estimate that the population of Ireland was reduced by 20\u201325%.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Legacy of the Great Irish Famine}}\n\nIreland's mean age of marriage in 1830 was 23.8 for women and 27.5 for men, where they had once been 21 for women and 25 for men, and those who never married numbered about 10% of the population;<ref>Lee, Joseph J. 2008.

Also, large areas of the country became uninhabited and the folk song collectors of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries did not collect the songs they heard in the Irish language, as the language of the peasantry was often regarded as dead, or \"not delicate enough for educated ears\". Of the songs that have survived probably the best known is [[Skibbereen (song)|Skibbereen]]. Emigration has been an important sources of inspiration for songs of the Irish during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Falc'her-Poyroux\"/> Since the 1970s a number of songs about the famine have been written and recorded, such as \"[[The Fields of Athenry]]\" by [[Pete St. John]], \"[[Famine]]\" by [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and \"Thousands are Sailing\" by [[the Pogues]].\n\n==Analysis of the government's role==\n===Contemporary===\nContemporary opinion was sharply critical of the Russell government's response to and management of the crisis. From the start, there were accusations that the government failed to grasp the magnitude of the disaster. Sir James Graham, who had served as [[Home Secretary]] in Sir Robert Peel's late government, wrote to Peel that, in his opinion, \"the real extent and magnitude of the Irish difficulty are underestimated by the Government, and cannot be met by measures within the strict rule of economical science\".{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=80}}\n\nThis criticism was not confined to outside critics. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Clarendon, wrote a letter to Russell on 26 April 1849, urging that the government propose additional relief measures: \"I don't think there is another legislature in Europe that would disregard such suffering as now exists in the west of Ireland, or coldly persist in a policy of extermination.\"{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=381}} Also in 1849, the Chief Poor Law Commissioner, Edward Twisleton, resigned in protest over the Rate-in-Aid Act, which provided additional funds for the Poor Law through a 6p in the pound levy on all rateable properties in Ireland.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|pp = 254\u2013260}} Twisleton testified that \"comparatively trifling sums were required for Britain to spare itself the deep disgrace of permitting its miserable fellow subjects to die of starvation\". According to [[Peter Gray (historian)|Peter Gray]] in his book ''The Irish Famine'', the government spent \u00a37 million for relief in Ireland between 1845 and 1850, \"representing less than half of one percent of the British [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] over five years. Contemporaries noted the sharp contrast with the \u00a320 million compensation given to [[Caribbean|West Indian]] slave-owners in the 1830s.\"{{sfn|Gray|1995|p = }}\n\nOther critics maintained that, even after the government recognised the scope of the crisis, it failed to take sufficient steps to address it. John Mitchel, one of the leaders of the Young Ireland Movement, wrote in 1860:\n\n<blockquote>I have called it an artificial famine: that is to say, it was a famine which desolated a rich and fertile island that produced every year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her people and many more. The English, indeed, call the famine a \"dispensation of Providence\"; and ascribe it entirely to the blight on potatoes. But potatoes failed in like manner all over Europe; yet there was no famine save in Ireland. The British account of the matter, then, is first, a fraud; second, a blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the famine.{{sfn|Gallagher|1987|p = }}</blockquote>\n\nStill other critics saw reflected in the government's response its attitude to the so-called \"[[Irish Question]]\". [[Nassau Senior]], an economics professor at [[Oxford University]], wrote that the Famine \"would not kill more than one million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do any good\".{{sfn|Gallagher|1987|p = }} In 1848, Denis Shine Lawlor suggested that Russell was a student of the Elizabethan poet [[Edmund Spenser]], who had calculated \"how far English colonisation and English policy might be most effectively carried out by Irish starvation\".{{sfn|Donnelly|1995|p = }} Charles Trevelyan, the civil servant with most direct responsibility for the government's handling of the famine, described it in 1848 as \"a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence\", which laid bare \"the deep and inveterate root of social evil\"; he affirmed that the Famine was \"the sharp but effectual remedy by which the cure is likely to be effected. God grant that the generation to which this opportunity has been offered may rightly perform its part...\"{{sfn|Trevelyan|1848|p = }}\n\n===Historical===\nChristine Kinealy has written that \"the major tragedy of the Irish Famine of 1845\u201352 marked a watershed in modern Irish history. Its occurrence, however, was neither inevitable nor unavoidable.\"{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p = xv}} The underlying factors which combined to cause the famine were aggravated by an inadequate government response. As Kinealy notes:\n\n{{quote|[T]he government had to do something to help alleviate the suffering, the particular nature of the actual response, especially following 1846, suggests a more covert agenda and motivation. As the Famine progressed, it became apparent that the government was using its information not merely to help it formulate its relief policies, but also as an opportunity to facilitate various long-desired changes within Ireland. These included population control and the consolidation of property through various means, including emigration ... Despite the overwhelming evidence of prolonged distress caused by successive years of potato blight, the underlying philosophy of the relief efforts was that they should be kept to a minimalist level; in fact they actually decreased as the Famine progressed.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=353}}}}\n\nSeveral writers single out the decision of the government to permit the continued export of food from Ireland as suggestive of the policy-makers' attitudes. [[Leon Uris]] suggested that \"there was ample food within Ireland\", while all the Irish-bred cattle were being shipped off to England.{{sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p=16}} The following exchange appeared in Act IV of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Man and Superman]]'':\n\n{{poemquote|MALONE. He will get over it all right enough. Men thrive better on disappointments in love than on disappointments in money. I daresay you think that sordid; but I know what I'm talking about.

When a country is full of food, and exporting it, there can be no famine. My father was starved dead; and I was starved out to America in my mother's arms.

I want no middle class properties and no middle class women for Hector. That's straightforward isn't it, like yourself?{{sfn|Shaw|1903|p = }}}}\n\nSome also pointed to the structure of the British Empire as a contributing factor. [[James Anthony Froude]] wrote that \"England governed Ireland for what she deemed her own interest, making her calculations on the gross balance of her trade ledgers, and leaving moral obligations aside, as if right and wrong had been blotted out of the statute book of the Universe.\"{{sfn|MacManus|1921|p=492}} Dennis Clark, an [[Irish American|Irish-American]] historian and critic of empire, claimed the famine was \"the culmination of generations of neglect, misrule and repression. It was an epic of English colonial cruelty and inadequacy. For the landless cabin dwellers it meant emigration or extinction...\"{{sfn|Clark|1982|p = }}\n\n===Genocide question{{anchor|Genocide}}===\n{{see also|Genocides in history#British Empire}}\n[[File:An gorta Mor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|''Ireland's Holocaust'' mural on the Ballymurphy Road, [[Belfast]]. \"An Gorta M\u00f3r, Britain's genocide by starvation, Ireland's holocaust 1845\u20131849, over 1,500,000 deaths\".]]\nThe famine remains a controversial event in Irish history. Debate and discussion on the British government's response to the failure of the potato crop in Ireland, the exportation of food crops and livestock, the subsequent large-scale starvation, and whether or not this constituted [[genocide]], remains a historically and politically charged issue.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. state of [[New Jersey]] included the famine in the \"Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum\" for its [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary]] schools.{{refn|Approved by the New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education on 10 September 1996, for inclusion in the Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum at the secondary level.

Following criticism of the curriculum, the New Jersey Holocaust Commission requested statements from two academics that the Irish famine was genocide, which was eventually provided by law professors [[Charles E.

Boyle]], who had not been previously known for studying Irish history.{{sfn|Kennedy|2016|pp=100\u2013101}} They concluded that the British government deliberately pursued a race- and ethnicity-based policy aimed at destroying the Irish people and that the policy of mass starvation amounted to genocide per the [[Genocide Convention|Hague Convention of 1948]].{{refn|\"Clearly, during the years 1845 to 1850, the British government pursued a policy of mass starvation in Ireland with intent to destroy in substantial part the national, ethnic and racial group commonly known as the Irish People ... Therefore, during the years 1845 to 1850 the British government knowingly pursued a policy of mass starvation in Ireland that constituted acts of genocide against the Irish people within the meaning of Article II (c) of the 1948 [Hague] [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|Genocide Convention]].\"{{sfn|Ritschel|1996}}|group=fn}}\n\nJournalist Peter Duffy writes that \"The government's crime, which deserves to blacken its name forever\", was rooted \"in the effort to regenerate Ireland\" through \"landlord-engineered replacement of tillage plots with grazing lands\" that \"took precedence over the obligation to provide food ... for its starving citizens. It is little wonder that the policy looked to many people like genocide.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2007|pp=297\u2013298}} James S. Donnelly, Jr., a historian at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], wrote in his book, ''Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland'':\n\n<blockquote>I would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed in a major way to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority ... And it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during and as a result of the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish.{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p = }}</blockquote>\n\nCormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da disagreed that the famine was genocide. He argues that \"genocide includes murderous intent, and it must be said that not even the most bigoted and racist commentators of the day sought the extermination of the Irish\", and also that most people in [[Whitehall]] \"hoped for better times for Ireland\". Additionally, he states that the claim of genocide overlooks \"the enormous challenge facing relief agencies, both central and local, public and private\".{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2000|p=10}} \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da thinks that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than that of genocide.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2000|p=10}} Edward Lengel claims that views of the Irish as racially inferior, and for this reason significantly responsible for their circumstances, gained purchase in Great Britain during and immediately after the famine, especially through influential publications such as ''The Medical Times'' and ''The Times''.{{sfn|Lengel|2002|pp=12, 48, 104}}\n\nThe Great Famine in Ireland has been compared to the ''[[Holodomor]]'' (\"hunger plague\") that took place in the [[Ukraine]] under [[Stalin]] in 1932,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthempress.com/holodomor-and-gorta-mor|title=Holodomor and Gorta M\u00f3r|publisher=Anthem Press|accessdate=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120152317/http://www.anthempress.com/holodomor-and-gorta-mor|archive-date=20 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> which has been the subject of [[Holodomor genocide question|similar controversy and debate]].\n\nAccording to [[Liam Kennedy (historian)|Liam Kennedy]], \"virtually all historians of Ireland\" reject the genocide allegations.

[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] lay in the hands of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], who were appointed by the British government. Ireland sent 105 members of parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], and [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish]] [[representative peer]]s elected 28 of their own number to sit for life in the [[House of Lords]]. Between 1832 and 1859, 70% of Irish representatives were landowners or the sons of landowners.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\nIn the 40 years that followed the union, successive British governments grappled with the problems of governing a country which had, as [[Benjamin Disraeli]] put it in 1844, \"a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, an alien [[Church of Ireland|established Protestant church]], and in addition the weakest executive in the world\".{{sfn|Blake|1967|p=179}} One historian calculated that, between 1801 and 1845, there had been 114 commissions and 61 special committees enquiring into the state of Ireland, and that \"without exception their findings prophesied disaster; Ireland was on the verge of starvation, her population rapidly increasing, three-quarters of her labourers unemployed, housing conditions appalling and the standard of living unbelievably low\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 36}}\n\nLectures printed in 1847 by [[John Hughes (archbishop of New York)|John Hughes]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Bishop of New York]], are a contemporary exploration into the antecedent causes, particularly the political climate, in which the Irish famine occurred.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160706011946/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SADLIER/IRISH/Hughues.htm \"A Lecture on the Antecedent Causes of the Irish Famine in 1847\"]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ie/books?id=SH4JQiJ5knAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ireland+cause+of+the+famine#v=onepage&q=ireland%20cause%20of%20the%20famine A Lecture on the Antecedent Causes of the Irish Famine in 1847: Delivered By John Hughes]</ref>\n\n===Landlords and tenants===\nDuring the 18th century, the \"middleman system\" for managing landed property was introduced. Rent collection was left in the hands of the landlords' agents, or middlemen. This assured the landlord of a regular income, and relieved them of direct responsibility, while leaving tenants open to exploitation by the middlemen.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=22}}\n\nCatholics, the bulk of whom lived in conditions of [[poverty]] and insecurity despite [[Catholic emancipation]] in 1829, made up 80% of the population. At the top of the \"social pyramid\" was the \"[[Protestant Ascendancy|ascendancy class]]\", the English and [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] families who owned most of the land and held more or less unchecked power over their tenants. Some of their estates were vast; for example, the [[Earl of Lucan]] owned more than {{convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}. Many of these [[absentee landlord]]s lived in England. The rent revenue\u2014collected from \"impoverished tenants\" who were paid minimal wages to raise crops and livestock for export{{sfn|Laxton|1997|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\u2014was mostly sent to England.{{sfn|Litton|1994|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\nIn 1843, the British Government considered that the land question in Ireland was the root cause of disaffection in the country. They established a [[Royal Commission]], chaired by the [[William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], to enquire into the laws regarding the occupation of land. [[Daniel O'Connell]] described this commission as \"perfectly one-sided\", being composed of landlords, with no tenant representation.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 20\u201321}}\n\nIn February 1845, Devon reported:\n<blockquote>It would be impossible adequately to describe the privations which they [the Irish labourer and his family] habitually and silently endure&nbsp;... in many districts their only food is the potato, their only beverage water&nbsp;... their cabins are seldom a protection against the weather&nbsp;... a bed or a blanket is a rare luxury&nbsp;... and nearly in all their pig and a manure heap constitute their only property.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Commissioners concluded they could not \"forbear expressing our strong sense of the patient endurance which the labouring classes have exhibited under sufferings greater, we believe, than the people of any other country in Europe have to sustain\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24}} The Commission stated that bad relations between landlord and tenant were principally responsible. There was no hereditary loyalty, feudal tie, or mitigating tradition of paternalism as existed in England (Ireland was a conquered country). The [[John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare|Earl of Clare]] observed of landlords that \"confiscation is their common title\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 21}} According to the historian [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], landlords regarded the land as a source of income, from which as much as possible was to be extracted. With the Irish \"brooding over their discontent in sullen indignation\" (in the words of the Earl of Clare), the landlords largely viewed the countryside as a hostile place in which to live. Some landlords visited their property only once or twice in a lifetime, if ever.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=21}} The rents from Ireland were generally spent elsewhere; an estimated \u00a36,000,000 was remitted out of Ireland in 1842.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=21}}{{efn|About \u00a3{{inflation|UK|6|1842|fmt=c}} million at current prices.}}\n\nThe ability of middlemen was measured by the rent income they could contrive to extract from tenants.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22}} They were described in evidence before the Commission as \"land sharks\", \"bloodsuckers\", and \"the most oppressive species of tyrant that ever lent assistance to the destruction of a country\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22}} The middlemen leased large tracts of land from the landlords on long leases with fixed rents, which they sublet as they saw fit. They would split a holding into smaller and smaller parcels so as to increase the amount of rent they could obtain. Tenants could be evicted for reasons such as non-payment of rents (which were high), or a landlord's decision to raise sheep instead of [[Cereal|grain crops]]. A [[Cotter (farmer)|cottier]] paid his rent by working for the landlord.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAs any improvement made on a holding by a tenant became the property of the landlord when the lease expired or was terminated, the incentive to make improvements was limited. Most tenants had no security of tenure on the land; as tenants \"at will\", they could be turned out whenever the landlord chose. The only exception to this arrangement was in [[Ulster]] where, under a practice known as [[Custom of Ulster|\"tenant right\"]], a tenant was compensated for any improvement they made to their holding. According to Woodham-Smith, the commission stated that \"the superior prosperity and tranquility of Ulster, compared with the rest of Ireland, were due to tenant right\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=22}}\n\nLandlords in Ireland often used their powers without compunction, and tenants lived in dread of them. Woodham-Smith writes that, in these circumstances, \"industry and enterprise were extinguished and a peasantry created which was one of the most destitute in Europe\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=24}}\n\n===Tenants, subdivisions, and bankruptcy===\nIn 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4\u20132&nbsp;hectares (1\u20135&nbsp;acres) in size, while 40% were of 2\u20136&nbsp;hectares (5\u201315&nbsp;acres). Holdings were so small that no crop other than potatoes would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine, the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support the tenant families after rent was paid; the families survived only by earnings as seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland.{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=15}} Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.{{sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p=15}}\n\nThe 1841 census showed a population of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords in return for the patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into [[monoculture]], since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland could mean the difference between life and death in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Laxton|1997|p = {{page needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\n===Potato dependency===\n[[File:An Irish Peasant Family Discovering the Blight of their Store by Daniel MacDonald.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''An Irish Peasant Family Discovering the Blight of their Store'' by Cork artist Daniel MacDonald, ''c.'' 1847]]\nThe potato was introduced to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. The potato was not popular at first;  however, after an unusual promotion campaign that was supported by landowners and members of royalty, who wanted their tenants to plant and eat the crop, it rose in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutbiodiversity.org/agbdx/eireblight.html|title=The Irish potato famine|accessdate=26 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319153837/http://aboutbiodiversity.org/agbdx/eireblight.html|archivedate=19 March 2012}}</ref> By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food; the main diet was still based on butter, milk, and grain products. By 1800 to 1820, the potato became a staple of the poor, especially in winter.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 19\u201320}} Furthermore, a disproportionate share of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the [[Irish Lumper]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Evan D.

For the labourer, \"a potato wage\" shaped the expanding agrarian economy.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 20}}\n\n{{quote|The Celtic grazing lands of ...

In 1830 and 1831, [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and [[County Galway|Galway]] suffered likewise. In 1832, 1833, 1834, and 1836, dry rot and curl caused serious losses, and in 1835 the potato failed in Ulster. Widespread failures throughout Ireland occurred in 1836, 1837, 1839, 1841, and 1844.

The Town Council of [[Belfast]] met and made similar suggestions, but neither body asked for charity, according to [[John Mitchel]], one of the leading Repealers.\n<blockquote>\"They demanded that, if Ireland was indeed an Integral part of the realm, the common exchequer of both islands should be used\u2014not to give alms, but to provide employment on public works of general utility ... if Yorkshire and Lancashire had sustained a like calamity in England, there is no doubt such measures as these would have been taken, promptly and liberally\", Mitchel declared.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|pp=94\u201396}}</blockquote>\n\nIn early November 1845, a deputation from the citizens of Dublin, including the [[Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster|Duke of Leinster]], [[Valentine Lawless, 2nd Baron Cloncurry|Lord Cloncurry]], Daniel O'Connell and the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]], went to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, [[William \u00e0 Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury|Lord Heytesbury]], to offer suggestions, such as opening the ports to foreign corn, stopping distillation from grain, prohibiting the export of foodstuffs, and providing employment through public works.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=48\u201349}} Lord Heytesbury urged them not to be alarmed, that they \"were premature\", that scientists were enquiring into all those matters,{{refn|[[Lyon Playfair]] and [[John Lindley]] were sent from England to investigate with the local assistance of [[Robert Kane (chemist)|Robert Kane]].{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=44\u201345}}|group = fn}} and that the Inspectors of Constabulary and Stipendiary Magistrates were charged with making constant reports from their districts; and there was no \"immediate pressure on the market\".{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|pp=94\u201396}}\n\nOn 8 December 1845, Daniel O'Connell, head of the [[Repeal Association]], proposed several remedies to the pending disaster. One of the first things he suggested was the introduction of \"[[Tenant-Right]]\" as practised in Ulster, giving the landlord a fair rent for his land, but giving the tenant compensation for any money he might have laid out on the land in permanent improvements.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|p=96}} O'Connell noted actions taken by the Belgian legislature during the same season, as they had been hit by blight, too: shutting their ports against the export of provisions, and opening them to imports. He suggested that, if Ireland had a domestic Parliament, the ports would be thrown open and the abundant crops raised in Ireland would be kept for the people of Ireland, as the Dublin parliament had done during the food shortages of the 1780s. O'Connell maintained that only an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]] would provide both food and employment for the people. He said that repeal of the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] was a necessity and Ireland's only hope.{{sfn|Mitchel|2005|p=96}}\n\nJohn Mitchel raised the issue of the \"Potato Disease\" in Ireland as early as 1844 in ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'', noting how powerful an agent hunger had been in certain revolutions.<ref>{{citation|work=The Nation Newspaper|title=Hunger|date=1 November 1844}}</ref> On 14 February 1846, he wrote about \"the wretched way in which the famine was being trifled with\", and asked whether the Government still did not have any conception that there might be soon \"millions of human beings in Ireland having nothing to eat\".{{sfn|O'Sullivan|1945}}\n\n[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|left|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine]]\n\nMitchel later wrote one of the first widely circulated tracts on the famine, ''The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)'', published in 1861. It established the widespread view that British actions during the famine and their treatment of the Irish was a deliberate effort to murder the Irish. It contained a sentence that has since become famous: \"The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2007|p=312}} Mitchel was charged with [[sedition]] because of his writings, but this charge was dropped.

S. L. Lyons]] characterised the initial response of the British government to the early, less severe phase of the famine as \"prompt and relatively successful\".{{sfn|Lyons|1973|p=30}} Confronted by widespread crop failure in November 1845, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, purchased \u00a3100,000 worth of maize and [[cornmeal]] secretly from America{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=54\u201356}} with [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] initially acting as his agents. The government hoped that they would not \"stifle private enterprise\" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to poor weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=47}} The initial shipments were of unground dried kernels, but the few Irish mills in operation were not equipped for milling maize and a long and complicated milling process had to be adopted before the meal could be distributed.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=64\u201365}} In addition, before the cornmeal could be consumed, it had to be \"very much\" cooked again, or eating it could result in severe bowel complaints.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=47}} Due to its yellow colour, and initial unpopularity, it became known as \"Peel's brimstone\".{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=73}}\n\nIn October 1845, Peel moved to repeal the [[Corn Laws]]\u2014[[tariff]]s on grain which kept the price of bread high\u2014but the issue split his party and he had insufficient support from his own colleagues to push the measure through. He resigned the premiership in December, but the opposition was unable to form a government and he was re-appointed.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=51\u201352}} In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland,{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=78}} but the famine situation worsened during 1846, and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel's ministry.{{sfn|Blake|1967|pp=221\u2013241}} On 25 June, the [[second reading]] of the government's [[Protection of Person and Property Act 1881#Coercion legislation in Ireland|Irish Coercion Bill]] was defeated by 73 votes in the House of Commons by a combination of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]], Irish Repealers, and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] Conservatives. Peel was forced to resign as prime minister on 29 June, and the Whig leader, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], became prime minister.{{sfn|Doheny|1951|p=98}}\n\n===Whig government===\nThe measures undertaken by Peel's successor, Russell, proved inadequate as the crisis deepened. The new Whig administration, influenced by the doctrine of [[laissez-faire]],{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 410\u2013411}} believed that the market would provide the food needed. They refused to interfere with the movement of food to England, then halted the previous government's food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without access to work, money, or food.{{sfn|Ross|2002|pp = 224, 311}} Russell's ministry introduced a new programme of public works that by the end of December 1846 employed some half million but proved impossible to administer.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\n[[File:Doolough.jpg|thumb|left|A memorial to the victims of the [[Doolough Tragedy]] (30 March 1849).

The costs of the Poor Law fell primarily on the local landlords, some of whom in turn attempted to reduce their liability by evicting their tenants.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\nIn June 1847 the Poor Law Amendment Act was passed which embodied the principle, popular in Britain, that Irish property must support Irish poverty. The landed proprietors in Ireland were held in Britain to have created the conditions that led to the famine.{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}}{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=296\u2013297}} However, it was asserted that the British parliament since the Act of Union of 1800 was partly to blame.{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}} This point was raised in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' on 13 February 1847: \"There was no law it would not pass at their request, and no abuse it would not defend for them.\" On 24 March, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Britain had permitted in Ireland \"a mass of poverty, disaffection, and degradation without a parallel in the world. It allowed proprietors to suck the very life-blood of that wretched race\".{{sfn|Ranelagh|2000|p=60}}\n\nThe \"Gregory clause\" of the Poor Law, named after [[William Henry Gregory|William H.

Of this Law, Mitchel wrote that \"it is the [[able-bodied]] idler only who is to be fed\u2014if he attempted to till but one [[Rood (unit)|rood]] of ground, he dies\". This simple method of ejectment was called \"passing paupers through the workhouse\"\u2014a man went in, a pauper came out.{{sfn|Mitchel|1996|p = 16}} These factors combined to drive thousands of people off the land: 90,000 in 1849, and 104,000 in 1850.{{sfn|Lyons|1973|pp=30\u201334}}\n\nIn 1849 the [[Encumbered Estates' Court|Encumbered Estates Act]] allowed landlord estates to be auctioned off upon the petition of creditors. Estates with debts were then auctioned off at low prices. Wealthy British speculators purchased the lands and \"took a harsh view\" of the tenant farmers who continued renting. The rents were raised and tenants evicted to create large cattle grazing pastures. Between 1849 and 1854, some 50,000 families were evicted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170107041845/http://www.historicalballinrobe.com/page_id__166.aspx  Ballinrobe Local History: The Encumbered Estates Acts, 1848 and 1849]</ref><ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/240915  Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives (review) David W.

(''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).]]\n\nRecords show that Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782\u201383, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=11}} No such export ban happened in the 1840s.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=354}}\n\nThroughout the entire period of the Famine, Ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food. In the magazine ''[[History Ireland]]'' (1997, issue 5, pp.&nbsp;32\u201336), [[Christine Kinealy]], a Great Hunger scholar, lecturer, and [[Drew University]] professor, relates her findings: Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women, and children died of starvation and related diseases. She also writes that Irish exports of calves, livestock (except pigs), bacon, and ham actually increased during the Famine. This food was shipped from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland: Ballina, Ballyshannon, Bantry, Dingle, Killala, Kilrush, Limerick, Sligo, Tralee, and Westport. A wide variety of commodities left Ireland during 1847, including peas, beans, onions, rabbits, salmon, oysters, herring, lard, honey, tongues, animal skins, rags, shoes, soap, glue, and seed.\n\nOne of the most shocking export figures concern butter. Butter was shipped in firkins, each one holding {{convert|1|firkin|impgal l|0|disp=out|abbr=off}}. In the first nine months of 1847, {{convert|56557|firkin|impgal l|abbr=off}} were exported from Ireland to Bristol, and {{convert|34852|firkin|impgal l|abbr=off}} were shipped to Liverpool, which correlates with {{convert|822681|impgal|l|abbr=off}} of butter exported to England from Ireland during nine months of the worst year of the Famine.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=10}} The problem in Ireland was not lack of food, which was plentiful, but the price of it, which was beyond the reach of the poor.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=165}}\n\nWriting in 1849, English poet and social reformer [[Ebenezer Jones]] wrote that \"In the year A.D. 1846, there were exported from Ireland, 3,266,193 quarters of wheat, barley and oats, besides flour, beans, peas, and rye; 186,483 cattle, 6,363 calves, 259,257 sheep, 180,827 swine; (food, that is, in the shape of meat and bread, for about one half of the Irish population), and yet this very year of A.D. 1846 was pre-eminently, owing to a land monopoly, the famine year for the Irish people.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Ebenezer |title=The Land Monopoly: The Suffering and Demoralization Caused by It, and the Justice & Expediency of Its Abolition |date=1849 |publisher=Chas.

Only by selling food, some of which would inevitably be exported, could a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|\"virtuous circle\"]] be created whereby the rents and rates would be paid, and the workhouses funded.

He suggested that it has been carefully inculcated by the British Press \"that the moment Ireland fell into distress, she became an abject beggar at England's gate, and that she even craved alms from all mankind\". He affirmed that in Ireland no one ever asked alms or favours of any kind from England or any other nation, but that it was England herself that begged for Ireland.

Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over \u00a34 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, there had been some clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=95}} According to [[James S. Donnelly, Jr.]], it is impossible to be sure how many people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=155}}\n\nDonnelly considered this to be an underestimate, and if the figures were to include the number pressured into \"voluntary\" surrenders during the whole period (1846\u20131854), the figure would almost certainly exceed half a million persons.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p = 156}} While Helen Litton says there were also thousands of \"voluntary\" surrenders, she notes also that there was \"precious little voluntary about them\". In some cases, tenants were persuaded to accept a small sum of money to leave their homes, \"cheated into believing the workhouse would take them in\".{{sfn|Litton|2006|p = 95}}\n\nWest Clare was one of the worst areas for evictions, where landlords turned thousands of families out and demolished their derisory cabins. Captain Kennedy in April 1848 estimated that 1,000 houses, with an average of six people to each, had been levelled since November.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=96}} The Mahon family of Strokestown House evicted 3,000 people in 1847, and were still able to dine on lobster soup.{{sfn|Gibney|2008|p=55}}\n\nAfter Clare, the worst area for evictions was County Mayo, accounting for 10% of all evictions between 1849 and 1854. [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan]], who owned over {{convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}, was among the worst evicting landlords. He was quoted as saying that \"he would not breed paupers to pay priests\". Having turned out in the parish of Ballinrobe over 2,000 tenants alone, he then used the cleared land as grazing farms.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p = 98}} In 1848, the Marquis of Sligo owed \u00a31,650 to Westport Union; he was also an evicting landlord, though he claimed to be selective, saying that he was only getting rid of the idle and dishonest. Altogether, he cleared about 25% of his tenants.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=95\u201398}}\n\nIn 1847, [[Bishop of Meath]], [[Thomas Nulty]], described his personal recollection of the evictions in a pastoral letter to his clergy:\n\n{{quote|Seven hundred human beings were driven from their homes in one day and set adrift on the world, to gratify the caprice of one who, before God and man, probably deserved less consideration than the last and least of them ...

The landed proprietors in a circle all around\u2014and for many miles in every direction\u2014warned their tenantry, with threats of their direct vengeance, against the humanity of extending to any of them the hospitality of a single night's shelter ... and in little more than three years, nearly a fourth of them lay quietly in their graves.<ref name=\"Falc'her-Poyroux\">{{cite journal|last=Falc'her-Poyroux|first=Erick|title=The Great Irish Famine in Songs|journal=Revue Fran\u00e7aise de Civilisation Britannique [Online]|volume=XIX|issue=2|pages=157\u2013172|date=2014|issn=2429-4373|doi=10.4000/rfcb.277|doi-access=free}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Litton, evictions might have taken place earlier but for fear of the secret societies. However, they were now greatly weakened by the Famine. Revenge still occasionally took place, with seven landlords being shot, six fatally, during the autumn and winter of 1847. Ten other occupiers of land, though without tenants, were also murdered, she says.{{sfn|Litton|2006|p=99}}\n\nOne such landlord reprisal occurred in West [[Roscommon]]. The \"notorious\" landlord Maj Denis Mahon enforced thousands of his tenants into eviction before the end of 1847, with an estimated 60 percent decline in population in some [[parish]]es. He was shot dead in that year.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/pioneering-study-charts-population-fall-since-famine-1.588108 Pioneering study charts population fall since Famine]</ref> In East Roscommon, \"where conditions were more benign\", the estimated decline in population was under 10 percent.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>\n\n[[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], alarmed at the number of landlords being shot and that this might mean rebellion, asked for special powers. Lord John Russell was not sympathetic to this appeal. Lord Clarendon believed that the landlords themselves were mostly responsible for the tragedy in the first place, saying that \"It is quite true that landlords in England would not like to be shot like hares and partridges ... but neither does any landlord in England turn out fifty persons at once and burn their houses over their heads, giving them no provision for the future.\" The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847|Crime and Outrage Act]] was passed in December 1847 as a compromise, and additional troops were sent to Ireland.{{sfn|Litton|2006|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nThe \"Gregory clause\", described by Donnelly as a \"vicious amendment to the Irish poor law\", had been a successful Tory amendment to the Whig poor-relief bill which became law in early June 1847, where its potential as an estate-clearing device was widely recognised in parliament, although not in advance.{{sfn|P\u00f3irt\u00e9ir|1995|p=159}} At first, the poor law commissioners and inspectors viewed the clause as a valuable instrument for a more cost-effective administration of public relief, but the drawbacks soon became apparent, even from an administrative perspective. They would soon view them as little more than murderous from a humanitarian perspective. According to Donnelly, it became obvious that the quarter-acre clause was \"indirectly a death-dealing instrument\".{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p=110}}\n\n==Emigration==\n{{main|Irish diaspora|Typhus epidemic of 1847}}\n[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''The Emigrants' Farewell'', engraving by [[Henry Doyle]] (1827\u20131893), from [[Mary Frances Cusack]]'s ''Illustrated History of Ireland'', 1868]]\n\nWhile the famine was responsible for a significant increase in emigration from Ireland, of anywhere from 45% to nearly 85% depending on the year and the county, it was not the sole cause. The beginning of mass emigration from Ireland can be traced to the mid-18th century, when some 250,000 people left Ireland over a period of 50 years to settle in the [[New World]]. Irish economist Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da estimates that between 1 million and 1.5 million people emigrated during the 30 years between 1815 (when [[Napoleon]] was defeated in [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]) and 1845 (when the Great Famine began).{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1975|p = }} However, during the worst of the famine, emigration reached somewhere around 250,000 in one year alone, with western Ireland seeing the most emigrants.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2007}}\n\nFamilies did not migrate ''en masse'', but younger members of families did, so much so that emigration almost became a [[rite of passage]], as evidenced by the data that show that, unlike similar emigrations throughout world history, women emigrated just as often, just as early, and in the same numbers as men. The emigrants would send remittances (reaching a total of \u00a31,404,000 by 1851) back to family in Ireland, which, in turn, allowed another member of their family to leave.{{sfn|Foster|1988|p = 371}}\n\nEmigration during the famine years of 1845\u20131850 was primarily to England, Scotland, South Wales, North America, and Australia; one city that experienced a particularly strong influx of Irish immigrants was [[Liverpool]], with at least one quarter of the city's population being Irish-born by 1851.{{sfn|Foster|1988|p = 268}} Many of those fleeing to the Americas used the well-established [[McCorkell Line]].{{sfn|McCorkell|2010|p = }}\n\n[[File:Population of Ireland and Europe 1750 to 2005.svg|thumb|left|A graph of the populations of Ireland [left axis] and Europe [right axis]{{dubious|date=October 2018}} indexed against date.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Excluding the [[Demography of Scotland|population of Scotland]] and [[Demography of Wales|Wales]] between the 1841 and 1851 censuses the [[Demography of England|population of England]], grew at a similar rate as the decades previous, from 14.8 to 16.7 million.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10061325/cube/TOT_POP Vision of Britain a population through time England], Retrieved 9 August 2013</ref>]]\n\nOf the more than 100,000 Irish that sailed to [[Canada]] in 1847, an estimated one out of five died from disease and malnutrition, including over 5,000 at [[Grosse Isle, Quebec]], an island in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] used to quarantine ships near [[Quebec City]].{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=238}} Overcrowded, poorly maintained, and badly provisioned vessels known as [[coffin ship]]s sailed from small, unregulated harbours in the West of Ireland in contravention of British safety requirements, and mortality rates were high.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp=216\u2013217}} The 1851 census reported that more than half the inhabitants of [[Toronto]] were Irish, and, in 1847 alone, 38,000 Irish flooded a city with fewer than 20,000 citizens. Other Canadian cities such as Quebec City, [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] also received large numbers.

However, fearing nationalist insurgencies, the British government placed harsh restrictions on Irish immigration to Canada after 1847, resulting in larger influxes to the United States.\n\nIn America, most Irish became city-dwellers; with little money, many had to settle in the cities that the ships they came on landed in.{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=267}} By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the population in [[Boston]], New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. In addition, Irish populations became prevalent in some American mining communities.\n\nThe famine marked the beginning of the depopulation of Ireland in the 19th century. Population had increased by 13\u201314% in the first three decades of the 19th century; between 1831 and 1841, population grew by 5%. Application of [[Thomas Malthus]]'s idea of population expanding geometrically while resources increase arithmetically was popular during the famines of 1817 and 1822. By the 1830s, they were seen as overly simplistic, and Ireland's problems were seen \"less as an excess of population than as a lack of [[capital investment]]\".{{sfn|Gray|1995|p = }} The population of Ireland was increasing no faster than that of England, which suffered no equivalent catastrophe.

They recorded 21,770 total deaths from starvation in the previous decade, and 400,720 deaths from disease. Listed diseases were fever, [[diphtheria]], [[dysentery]], [[cholera]], [[smallpox]], and [[influenza]], with the first two being the main killers (222,021 and 93,232). The commissioners acknowledged that their figures were incomplete and that the true number of deaths was probably higher:\n\n<blockquote>The greater the amount of destitution of mortality&nbsp;... the less will be the amount of recorded deaths derived through any household form;\u2014for not only were whole families swept away by disease&nbsp;... but whole villages were effaced from off the land.</blockquote>\n\nLater historians agree that the 1851 death tables \"were flawed and probably under-estimated the level of mortality\".{{sfn|Killen|1995|pp = 250\u2013252}}{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=167}} The combination of institutional and figures provided by individuals gives \"an incomplete and biased count\" of fatalities during the famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2006|p=3}}\n\nCormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da, referencing the work of W.

Of the nutritional deficiency diseases, the most commonly experienced were starvation and [[marasmus]], as well as a condition at the time called dropsy.

The policy, however, would soon be [[Plan of Campaign|suppressed]].

With the reduction in the rate of [[homelessness]] and the increased physical and political networks eroding the [[landlordism]] system, the severity of [[Irish Famine (1879)|the following shorter famine]] would be limited.<ref name=\"muse.jhu.edu\"/><ref name=historyplace/><ref name=bitesize/>\n\nAccording to the linguist Erick Falc'her-Poyroux, surprisingly, for a country renowned for its rich musical heritage, only a small number of folk songs can be traced back to the demographic and cultural catastrophe brought about by the Great Famine, and he infers from this that the subject was generally avoided for decades among poorer people as it brought back too many sorrowful memories. Also, large areas of the country became uninhabited and the folk song collectors of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries did not collect the songs they heard in the Irish language, as the language of the peasantry was often regarded as dead, or \"not delicate enough for educated ears\". Of the songs that have survived probably the best known is [[Skibbereen (song)|Skibbereen]]. Emigration has been an important sources of inspiration for songs of the Irish during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Falc'her-Poyroux\"/> Since the 1970s a number of songs about the famine have been written and recorded, such as \"[[The Fields of Athenry]]\" by [[Pete St. John]], \"[[Famine]]\" by [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and \"Thousands are Sailing\" by [[the Pogues]].\n\n==Analysis of the government's role==\n===Contemporary===\nContemporary opinion was sharply critical of the Russell government's response to and management of the crisis. From the start, there were accusations that the government failed to grasp the magnitude of the disaster. Sir James Graham, who had served as [[Home Secretary]] in Sir Robert Peel's late government, wrote to Peel that, in his opinion, \"the real extent and magnitude of the Irish difficulty are underestimated by the Government, and cannot be met by measures within the strict rule of economical science\".{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=80}}\n\nThis criticism was not confined to outside critics. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Clarendon, wrote a letter to Russell on 26 April 1849, urging that the government propose additional relief measures: \"I don't think there is another legislature in Europe that would disregard such suffering as now exists in the west of Ireland, or coldly persist in a policy of extermination.\"{{sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p=381}} Also in 1849, the Chief Poor Law Commissioner, Edward Twisleton, resigned in protest over the Rate-in-Aid Act, which provided additional funds for the Poor Law through a 6p in the pound levy on all rateable properties in Ireland.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|pp = 254\u2013260}} Twisleton testified that \"comparatively trifling sums were required for Britain to spare itself the deep disgrace of permitting its miserable fellow subjects to die of starvation\". According to [[Peter Gray (historian)|Peter Gray]] in his book ''The Irish Famine'', the government spent \u00a37 million for relief in Ireland between 1845 and 1850, \"representing less than half of one percent of the British [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] over five years. Contemporaries noted the sharp contrast with the \u00a320 million compensation given to [[Caribbean|West Indian]] slave-owners in the 1830s.\"{{sfn|Gray|1995|p = }}\n\nOther critics maintained that, even after the government recognised the scope of the crisis, it failed to take sufficient steps to address it. John Mitchel, one of the leaders of the Young Ireland Movement, wrote in 1860:\n\n<blockquote>I have called it an artificial famine: that is to say, it was a famine which desolated a rich and fertile island that produced every year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her people and many more. The English, indeed, call the famine a \"dispensation of Providence\"; and ascribe it entirely to the blight on potatoes. But potatoes failed in like manner all over Europe; yet there was no famine save in Ireland. The British account of the matter, then, is first, a fraud; second, a blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the famine.{{sfn|Gallagher|1987|p = }}</blockquote>\n\nStill other critics saw reflected in the government's response its attitude to the so-called \"[[Irish Question]]\". [[Nassau Senior]], an economics professor at [[Oxford University]], wrote that the Famine \"would not kill more than one million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do any good\".{{sfn|Gallagher|1987|p = }} In 1848, Denis Shine Lawlor suggested that Russell was a student of the Elizabethan poet [[Edmund Spenser]], who had calculated \"how far English colonisation and English policy might be most effectively carried out by Irish starvation\".{{sfn|Donnelly|1995|p = }} Charles Trevelyan, the civil servant with most direct responsibility for the government's handling of the famine, described it in 1848 as \"a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence\", which laid bare \"the deep and inveterate root of social evil\"; he affirmed that the Famine was \"the sharp but effectual remedy by which the cure is likely to be effected. God grant that the generation to which this opportunity has been offered may rightly perform its part...\"{{sfn|Trevelyan|1848|p = }}\n\n===Historical===\nChristine Kinealy has written that \"the major tragedy of the Irish Famine of 1845\u201352 marked a watershed in modern Irish history. Its occurrence, however, was neither inevitable nor unavoidable.\"{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p = xv}} The underlying factors which combined to cause the famine were aggravated by an inadequate government response. As Kinealy notes:\n\n{{quote|[T]he government had to do something to help alleviate the suffering, the particular nature of the actual response, especially following 1846, suggests a more covert agenda and motivation. As the Famine progressed, it became apparent that the government was using its information not merely to help it formulate its relief policies, but also as an opportunity to facilitate various long-desired changes within Ireland. These included population control and the consolidation of property through various means, including emigration ... Despite the overwhelming evidence of prolonged distress caused by successive years of potato blight, the underlying philosophy of the relief efforts was that they should be kept to a minimalist level; in fact they actually decreased as the Famine progressed.{{sfn|Kinealy|1994|p=353}}}}\n\nSeveral writers single out the decision of the government to permit the continued export of food from Ireland as suggestive of the policy-makers' attitudes. [[Leon Uris]] suggested that \"there was ample food within Ireland\", while all the Irish-bred cattle were being shipped off to England.{{sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p=16}} The following exchange appeared in Act IV of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Man and Superman]]'':\n\n{{poemquote|MALONE. He will get over it all right enough. Men thrive better on disappointments in love than on disappointments in money. I daresay you think that sordid; but I know what I'm talking about. My father died of starvation in Ireland in the black 47, Maybe you've heard of it.\nVIOLET. The Famine?\nMALONE. [with smouldering passion] No, the starvation. When a country is full of food, and exporting it, there can be no famine. My father was starved dead; and I was starved out to America in my mother's arms. English rule drove me and mine out of Ireland. Well, you can keep Ireland. I and my like are coming back to buy England; and we'll buy the best of it. I want no middle class properties and no middle class women for Hector. That's straightforward isn't it, like yourself?{{sfn|Shaw|1903|p = }}}}\n\nSome also pointed to the structure of the British Empire as a contributing factor. [[James Anthony Froude]] wrote that \"England governed Ireland for what she deemed her own interest, making her calculations on the gross balance of her trade ledgers, and leaving moral obligations aside, as if right and wrong had been blotted out of the statute book of the Universe.\"{{sfn|MacManus|1921|p=492}} Dennis Clark, an [[Irish American|Irish-American]] historian and critic of empire, claimed the famine was \"the culmination of generations of neglect, misrule and repression. It was an epic of English colonial cruelty and inadequacy. For the landless cabin dwellers it meant emigration or extinction...\"{{sfn|Clark|1982|p = }}\n\n===Genocide question{{anchor|Genocide}}===\n{{see also|Genocides in history#British Empire}}\n[[File:An gorta Mor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|''Ireland's Holocaust'' mural on the Ballymurphy Road, [[Belfast]]. \"An Gorta M\u00f3r, Britain's genocide by starvation, Ireland's holocaust 1845\u20131849, over 1,500,000 deaths\".]]\nThe famine remains a controversial event in Irish history. Debate and discussion on the British government's response to the failure of the potato crop in Ireland, the exportation of food crops and livestock, the subsequent large-scale starvation, and whether or not this constituted [[genocide]], remains a historically and politically charged issue.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. state of [[New Jersey]] included the famine in the \"Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum\" for its [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary]] schools.{{refn|Approved by the New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education on 10 September 1996, for inclusion in the Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum at the secondary level. Revision submitted 11/26/98.{{sfn|Irish Famine Curriculum Committee|1998|p=1}}|group=fn}} The curriculum was pushed by various Irish\nAmerican political groups and drafted by the librarian James Mullin. Following criticism of the curriculum, the New Jersey Holocaust Commission requested statements from two academics that the Irish famine was genocide, which was eventually provided by law professors [[Charles E. Rice]] and [[Francis A. Boyle]], who had not been previously known for studying Irish history.{{sfn|Kennedy|2016|pp=100\u2013101}} They concluded that the British government deliberately pursued a race- and ethnicity-based policy aimed at destroying the Irish people and that the policy of mass starvation amounted to genocide per the [[Genocide Convention|Hague Convention of 1948]].{{refn|\"Clearly, during the years 1845 to 1850, the British government pursued a policy of mass starvation in Ireland with intent to destroy in substantial part the national, ethnic and racial group commonly known as the Irish People ... Therefore, during the years 1845 to 1850 the British government knowingly pursued a policy of mass starvation in Ireland that constituted acts of genocide against the Irish people within the meaning of Article II (c) of the 1948 [Hague] [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|Genocide Convention]].\"{{sfn|Ritschel|1996}}|group=fn}}\n\nJournalist Peter Duffy writes that \"The government's crime, which deserves to blacken its name forever\", was rooted \"in the effort to regenerate Ireland\" through \"landlord-engineered replacement of tillage plots with grazing lands\" that \"took precedence over the obligation to provide food ... for its starving citizens. It is little wonder that the policy looked to many people like genocide.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2007|pp=297\u2013298}} James S. Donnelly, Jr., a historian at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], wrote in his book, ''Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland'':\n\n<blockquote>I would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed in a major way to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority ... And it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during and as a result of the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish.{{sfn|Donnelly|2005|p = }}</blockquote>\n\nCormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da disagreed that the famine was genocide. He argues that \"genocide includes murderous intent, and it must be said that not even the most bigoted and racist commentators of the day sought the extermination of the Irish\", and also that most people in [[Whitehall]] \"hoped for better times for Ireland\". Additionally, he states that the claim of genocide overlooks \"the enormous challenge facing relief agencies, both central and local, public and private\".{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2000|p=10}} \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da thinks that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than that of genocide.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2000|p=10}} Edward Lengel claims that views of the Irish as racially inferior, and for this reason significantly responsible for their circumstances, gained purchase in Great Britain during and immediately after the famine, especially through influential publications such as ''The Medical Times'' and ''The Times''.{{sfn|Lengel|2002|pp=12, 48, 104}}\n\nThe Great Famine in Ireland has been compared to the ''[[Holodomor]]'' (\"hunger plague\") that took place in the [[Ukraine]] under [[Stalin]] in 1932,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthempress.com/holodomor-and-gorta-mor|title=Holodomor and Gorta M\u00f3r|publisher=Anthem Press|accessdate=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120152317/http://www.anthempress.com/holodomor-and-gorta-mor|archive-date=20 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> which has been the subject of [[Holodomor genocide question|similar controversy and debate]].\n\nAccording to [[Liam Kennedy (historian)|Liam Kennedy]], \"virtually all historians of Ireland\" reject the genocide allegations.
