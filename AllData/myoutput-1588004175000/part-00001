Here, he plays the straight-man to Carol Burnett's character in the role of [[Ed Higgins]] in the show's recurring sketch \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]].\"]]\n\nThe Oldest Man appears in a variety of situations, performing a new type of role in each sketch. Some of the most notable including a slave in a galley ship, a fireman, a clock-maker, a butcher, and a shoe store clerk. Most often, the character plays opposite [[Straight man (stock character)|straight man]] Harvey Korman, who reacts with frustration and anger to the Oldest Man's lingering pace and unhelpful charades.\n\nThe Oldest Man is a strong example of slapstick comedy and [[Clown|<nowiki/>clown acting]], as the character typically performs exaggerated physical stunts and often injures himself comically in the process. For example, playing the grandfather character to Marion, Conway takes a drastically slow tumble down the stairs in one \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\" sketch, aired Oct. 20, 1976, or in \u201cThe Oldest Torturer\u201d sketch, aired Dec. 6, 1975, he slowly burns himself with a hot iron.\n\n== Origins ==\nConway remarks that the idea for the Oldest Man character began with memories from earlier in life: \u201cI broke my back in high school,\u201d Conway says, \u201cand walking to and from school that was my speed. That was the way I walked. So that got a lot of laughs.\u201d Later, when working on The Carol Burnett Show, Conway claims the idea for the shuffling walk arrived spontaneously during one sketch. \u201cCarol (Burnett) opened the door and I was supposed to walk to the couch and then I was going to talk to her but I was supposed to be this old man.  I started walking that way and as I was walking across the room I said to myself, \u2018You know, if they don\u2019t stop this the sketch is going to be about three days long.\u2019  But nobody stopped me, we kept going, and that started that character.\u201d\n\nConway says the spontaneity of the Oldest Man\u2019s creation served as a way to make fellow actor Korman laugh. \u201cA lot of the characters were created on air... Harvey would fall apart because the first time they saw the old man and the way I walked as the old man was when we were actually taping the show. So, when I started walking from the door and shuffling across the room as the rug was gathering in front of me (laughs), that was the first time that anybody had seen it.\u201d<ref name=\"Tim Conway:
