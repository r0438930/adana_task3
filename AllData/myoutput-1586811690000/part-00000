She authored and co-authored 50 articles in international journals, professional volumes, and major reports.

To date, she has participated in 12 deep water dives in the deep-ocean submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''.  She researched the volcano-tectonic processes responsible for creating new oceanic crust at [[Mid-ocean ridge|seafloor spreading centers]].  In 1968, she co-authored a research paper featuring groundbreaking work into the faulted nature of spreading centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Menard |first1=H.W. |last2=Atwater |first2= T.M. | year=1968 |title=Changes in direction of sea floor spreading| journal=Nature| volume=219|issue=5153 | pages=463\u2013467|bibcode=1968Natur.219..463M|doi=10.1038/219463a0}}</ref> With [[Jack Corliss]], [[Fred Spiess]], and [[Kenneth C. Macdonald|Kenneth Macdonald]], she played key roles in expeditions that uncovered the distinct biology of ocean floor warm springs, which led to the discovery during the [[RISE project]] of the high temperature black smokers, undersea [[hydrothermal vent]]s.\n\nIn Atwater's research on [[Propagating Rifts]] near the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Galapagos Islands]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atwater |first=Tanya | year=1981 |title=Propagating rifts in seafloor spreading patterns| journal=Nature| volume=290|issue=5803 | pages=185\u2013186|bibcode=1981Natur.290..185A|doi=10.1038/290185a0}}</ref> she discovered that propagating rifts were created when spreading centers along the seafloor were disturbed by tectonic movement or [[magma]] and therefore had to change direction to realign. This helped to explain the complex pattern of the seafloor.\n\nAtwater is perhaps best known for her work on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.  She wrote two major research papers outlining the history of plate tectonic evolution of North America and tectonic problems of the [[San Andreas Fault]], which assisted in documenting the history of the [[San Andreas Fault Line]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter | year=1973 |title=Relative motion of the Pacific and North American plates deduced from sea-floor spreading in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific Oceans| publisher=R.

In her work, she explains that approximately 40 million years ago, the [[Farallon Plate]] was subducting underneath the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]].  The lower half of the Farallon plate was entirely subducted under Southern California and the upper half did not sink, which eventually became known as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]].Since the southern section of Farallon completely disappeared, the boundary of southern California was now between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The [[San Andreas Fault]] is unique because it acts as a major fault line as well as a border between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\"/> She updated this work in 1989.<ref>Atwater, T.
