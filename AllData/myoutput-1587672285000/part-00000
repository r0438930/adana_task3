The baby becomes dependent on the drug along with the mother. If the mother continues to use the drugs within the week or so before delivery, the baby will be dependent on the drug at birth. Because the baby is no longer getting the drug after birth, withdrawal symptoms may occur as the drug is slowly cleared from the baby's system.<ref name = uslib/> Nicotine, medications and alcohol have side effects related to unsafe higher dosages, but neonates may respond differently.
