An installment in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, it follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s quest to stop his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior ''Sonic'' games, with players collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies; the camera perspective occasionally switches from [[Third-person view|third-person]] to [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspectives. The game also introduces [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, [[power-ups]] the player can use to increase attack power and reach new areas.\n\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.\n\n''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies. The Wisp power-ups introduced in ''Sonic Colors'' became a staple of the ''Sonic'' series.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Premise and setting===\n[[File:Sonic_Colors_gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Sonic Colors'', showing Sonic in one of the game's levels]]\n''Sonic Colors'' is a 2D [[platform game]] set in [[outer space]].

The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.\n\nSonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.\n\nHowever, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box|quote= From a general game design perspective, in recent years we've been able to introduce Sonic to new fans, a lot of the Nintendo/''Mario'' fans, and because of that, we've made changes to the design, and we've designed things in ''Sonic Colors'' that we think will really appeal to people who are unfamiliar with the Sonic brand and the Sonic gameplay.|source=Takashi Iizuka, on why ''Sonic Colors'' was designed to appeal to a wider demographic.<ref name=\"vg\"/> |width=30em|quoted=1}}\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''Sonic Unleashed''.<ref name=\"Q&A\">{{cite web|last1=Earwaker|first1=Kiran|title=Sonic Colours \u2013 Q&A Feature|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|website=Total Video Games|accessdate=July 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606165905/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|archivedate=June 6, 2015|date=August 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> While they kept most of ''Unleashed''{{'}}s core gameplay elements,<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\">{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Jason|title=E3 2010 Q&A: Takashi Iizuka on Sonic Colors|url=https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|website=Sonic Stadium|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002057/https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> developers [[Sonic Team]] and [[Dimps]] decided to create an equal balance between speed and platforming similar to that of the games released for the Sega Genesis, in comparison to the straightforward gameplay of ''Unleashed''.<ref name=\"spong interview\">{{cite web|last1=Joscelyne|first1=Svend|title=Interviews// Sonic Colours Producer, Takashi Iizuka|url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|website=SPOnG|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68WAmiXNY?url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|archivedate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> Following requests by fans, the team also made the decision to make Sonic the only playable character, and to omit \"gimmick\" themes such as the [[swordplay]] mechanic used in the 2009 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]''.<ref name=\"canvas\"/> The team chose to develop ''Sonic Colors'' on [[Nintendo]]'s Wii and DS consoles, hoping to expand upon the audience attracted by the successful ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] games.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/>\n\nOne of the first ideas was the setting should be an amusement park; Sonic Team then realized that \"any sort of terrestrial amusement park would be too small to contain Sonic's adventures.\" From this came the idea of an interplanetary park, which would allow for more creativity and variance in the game.<ref name=\"canvas\">{{Cite journal|title=Fresh Canvas|journal=[[Nintendo Power]]|last=Thomason|first=Steve|date=July 2010|issue=256|pages=50\u201357}}</ref> The developers used [[Disneyland]] as visual inspiration for the levels.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/> Sonic Team also desired something that would diversify the gameplay, but did not slow it down.

An installment in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, it follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s quest to stop his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior ''Sonic'' games, with players collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies; the camera perspective occasionally switches from [[Third-person view|third-person]] to [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspectives. The game also introduces [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, [[power-ups]] the player can use to increase attack power and reach new areas.\n\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.\n\n''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies.

The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.\n\nSonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.\n\nHowever, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box|quote= From a general game design perspective, in recent years we've been able to introduce Sonic to new fans, a lot of the Nintendo/''Mario'' fans, and because of that, we've made changes to the design, and we've designed things in ''Sonic Colors'' that we think will really appeal to people who are unfamiliar with the Sonic brand and the Sonic gameplay.|source=Takashi Iizuka, on why ''Sonic Colors'' was designed to appeal to a wider demographic.<ref name=\"vg\"/> |width=30em|quoted=1}}\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''Sonic Unleashed''.<ref name=\"Q&A\">{{cite web|last1=Earwaker|first1=Kiran|title=Sonic Colours \u2013 Q&A Feature|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|website=Total Video Games|accessdate=July 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606165905/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|archivedate=June 6, 2015|date=August 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> While they kept most of ''Unleashed''{{'}}s core gameplay elements,<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\">{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Jason|title=E3 2010 Q&A: Takashi Iizuka on Sonic Colors|url=https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|website=Sonic Stadium|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002057/https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> developers [[Sonic Team]] and [[Dimps]] decided to create an equal balance between speed and platforming similar to that of the games released for the Sega Genesis, in comparison to the straightforward gameplay of ''Unleashed''.<ref name=\"spong interview\">{{cite web|last1=Joscelyne|first1=Svend|title=Interviews// Sonic Colours Producer, Takashi Iizuka|url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|website=SPOnG|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68WAmiXNY?url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|archivedate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> Following requests by fans, the team also made the decision to make Sonic the only playable character, and to omit \"gimmick\" themes such as the [[swordplay]] mechanic used in the 2009 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]''.<ref name=\"canvas\"/> The team chose to develop ''Sonic Colors'' on [[Nintendo]]'s Wii and DS consoles, hoping to expand upon the audience attracted by the successful ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] games.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/>\n\nOne of the first ideas was the setting should be an amusement park; Sonic Team then realized that \"any sort of terrestrial amusement park would be too small to contain Sonic's adventures.\" From this came the idea of an interplanetary park, which would allow for more creativity and variance in the game.<ref name=\"canvas\">{{Cite journal|title=Fresh Canvas|journal=[[Nintendo Power]]|last=Thomason|first=Steve|date=July 2010|issue=256|pages=50\u201357}}</ref> The developers used [[Disneyland]] as visual inspiration for the levels.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/> Sonic Team also desired something that would diversify the gameplay, but did not slow it down.
