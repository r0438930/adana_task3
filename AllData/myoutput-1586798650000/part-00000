I had a short stint in college football and when that was over I really felt something missing in my life. Being a competitor was all I had ever known. So I started driving from Bowling Green to Toledo and started boxing. I continued that through the last couple years of college. Then, it just seemed like I kept meeting people and training with them that were involved in different aspects of MMA. Even though I had no intentions or aspirations of ever fighting. \n\nThen one day, I met an MMA guy when I moved back to Defiance, Ohio, [and] started training with him for fun and after a few months, someone needed a last minute fill in and I said yes. I won that fight pretty easily but I still didn't really see myself as a fighter. After that first fight, I just kept getting more offers and kept winning.<ref name=\"MMATVInterview\" />}}\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n\nIn the first combat bout of his career, Zachrich faced off against fellow fighting newcomer Ben Kelley at Mega Fighting Championship's premiere event on January 14, 2006.

During his [[freshman]] year, Zachrich was a varsity football player at [[Bowling Green University]] in [[Bowling Green, Ohio]]. After sustaining an injury in one of the last scheduled games of the season, he chose to discontinue his upstart career in football and find a different profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2008/04/site-news-tuf-cast-member-luke-zachrich-joins-mmajunkie-com|title=Site News: \"TUF\" cast member Luke Zachrich joins MMAjunkie.com|publisher=MMAJunkie.com|date=April 10, 2008}}</ref> \n\nIn the last couple of years in college, Zachrich was a part-time [[lacrosse]] player and then graduated with [[bachelor's degree]] in 2005. Around the same time, he stumbled upon mixed martial arts and began training with UFC legend and [[UFC Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Dan Severn]] at his gym, The Beast Academy, in [[Coldwater, Michigan]] and also trained with renowned Jujitsu practitioner Dave Morris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dietandexerciseguru.com/?p=26|title=Luke Zachrich > MMA > Brazilian Jujitsu > sports training|publisher=dietandexerciseguru.com|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> An upstart, Zachrich trained for two years under the tutelage of Severn and [[Jorge Gurgel]]'s team, before accepting a last-minute offer to compete in an amateur bout in early 2006.\n\nDuring an interview with MMA.TV, he was asked about how he made the transition to mixed martial arts.\n\n{{cquote|Honestly, it was by chance. I had a short stint in college football and when that was over I really felt something missing in my life. Being a competitor was all I had ever known. So I started driving from Bowling Green to Toledo and started boxing. I continued that through the last couple years of college. Then, it just seemed like I kept meeting people and training with them that were involved in different aspects of MMA. Even though I had no intentions or aspirations of ever fighting. \n\nThen one day, I met an MMA guy when I moved back to Defiance, Ohio, [and] started training with him for fun and after a few months, someone needed a last minute fill in and I said yes. I won that fight pretty easily but I still didn't really see myself as a fighter. After that first fight, I just kept getting more offers and kept winning.<ref name=\"MMATVInterview\" />}}\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n\nIn the first combat bout of his career, Zachrich faced off against fellow fighting newcomer Ben Kelley at Mega Fighting Championship's premiere event on January 14, 2006. It was a showcase of heavy stand-up striking for a majority of the bout, with Zachrich coming out on top with a first round [[Knockout|technical knockout]] victory.
