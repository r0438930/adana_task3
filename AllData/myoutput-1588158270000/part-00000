In [[Russian Empire]] it belonged to the [[Northwestern Krai]] and approximately corresponded to its [[Vilna Governorate]] (as of 1843). During [[World War I]], following the German offensive of 1915, it was occupied by the [[Germany|German]] army. After the war, some parts of the area was ruled by local [[Poland|Polish]] self-government established after the German [[Ober-Ost]] army withdrew from the area.\n\nFollowing the start of the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] in 1919, it was occupied by the [[Red Army]], which was pushed back by the [[Polish Army]]. In 1920, it was again occupied by the Red Army, but Soviets officially recognized the sovereignty of [[Lithuania|Lithuanian Republic]] over the city immediately after defeat during [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. During their retreat, the Bolsheviks passed the sovereignty over the area to Lithuania. The Polish commander [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] ordered his subordinate general [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]] to \"rebel\" his Lithuanian-[[Belarus]]ian division and capture the city of [[Vilnius]], without declaring war on Lithuania. The area of the future Vilnius County was seized by the Polish forces without significant opposition from Lithuanian forces and Gen. \u017beligowski created a short-lived state called [[Republic of Central Lithuania]]. Following the elections held there in 1922 the state was incorporated into Poland (see [[Vilnius region]], [[Republic of Central Lithuania|Central Lithuania]]).\n\nIn the effect of the [[Nazi-Soviet Alliance]] and the [[Invasion of Poland|Polish Defensive War]] of 1939, the area was captured by the [[Soviet Union]], which transferred parts of present ''Vilnius County'' and [[Utena County]] to [[Lithuania]], only to annex it the following year. In 1941, it was conquered by the [[Nazism|Nazi Germany]]. During [[World War II]], the area saw formation of many resistance units, most notably the Polish [[Home Army]] and, after 1943, the [[Soviet partisans]]. After the war, Vilniaus Apskritis existed as a relic of the pre-war independent state in [[Lithuanian SSR]] between 1944 and 1950. In this period, significant part of its population moved to [[Poland]] during so-called [[repatriation]].\n\nAfter 1990 saw the emergence of independent Lithuania, Vilnius county was re-established differently in 1994.
