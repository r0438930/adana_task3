However, his first season stint was cut short due to [[appendicitis]], but still managed to score 13 points, grab 11 rebounds and block 10 shots in 55 minutes of action in 10 games.\n\nOn his sophomore year, he bounced back from a disappointing first season as he averaged 5.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 3.2 blocked shots per contest to help lead the Blue Eagles to a 10\u20134 finish in [[UAAP Season 68|2005]]. He scored in double digits on three occasions, while he just missed a double-double twice after posting nine points and a career-best 10 boards in Ateneo's season opener as well as 10 points and eight rebounds later in the year in a win over [[Far Eastern University]].

He recorded four points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals in his collegiate d\u00e9but against [[Kennesaw State Owls men's basketball|Kennesaw State]] on November 9, 2007. He then collected two points, five rebounds and a game-best three blocks on November 13 against Kentucky Wesleyan. He was injured in practice after the victory over [[Kentucky Wesleyan Panthers men's basketball|Kentucky Wesleyan]] and missed the rest of the year.\n\n==Return to the Philippines==\n\n===Powerade Team Pilipinas===\nAfter his stint with the Hilltoppers and NBA tryouts, Aguilar returned to the Philippines to join the Gilas program to represent the Philippines coached by then Rajko Toroman and Chot Reyes mentored that captured the silver medal in 2013 FIBA Asia Cup in Manila and earned the berth that represented the country in World Basketball in Spain, which brings back the glory days of Philippine basketball in International Scene.

for the [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel]] of the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA). He first played collegiate basketball for the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]] in the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] (UAAP), but after two seasons, he moved to the [[Western Kentucky University]] Hilltoppers in the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] in the United States.\n\nAguilar's father, Peter Aguilar, was a former professional basketball player in the PBA.\n\n==College career==\n\n===UAAP===\nJapeth Aguilar suited up as a college [[freshman]] for the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] [[Ateneo Blue Eagles|Blue Eagles]] in the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] in [[UAAP Season 67|2004]]. However, his first season stint was cut short due to [[appendicitis]], but still managed to score 13 points, grab 11 rebounds and block 10 shots in 55 minutes of action in 10 games.\n\nOn his sophomore year, he bounced back from a disappointing first season as he averaged 5.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 3.2 blocked shots per contest to help lead the Blue Eagles to a 10\u20134 finish in [[UAAP Season 68|2005]]. He scored in double digits on three occasions, while he just missed a double-double twice after posting nine points and a career-best 10 boards in Ateneo's season opener as well as 10 points and eight rebounds later in the year in a win over [[Far Eastern University]]. Aguilar shot a high 55.4 percent from the field for the season, and he was credited with multiple blocks in 12 of the Blue Eagles\u2019 16 games \u2014 that included a career high of seven as well as two other contest with five or more. He led the University Athletic Association of the Philippines in rejections during his sophomore season, with a total of 48 blocks in 16 games.\n\n===NCAA Division I===\nJapeth Aguilar later transferred to [[Western Kentucky University]], where he saw action with the Hilltoppers mostly as a reserve. He entered the NCAA as a junior in 2007. During the season, he posted eight points, eight rebounds, four blocked shots, three assists and two steals in just 32 minutes of action in the Hilltopper's first two contests. He recorded four points, three rebounds, two assists and two steals in his collegiate d\u00e9but against [[Kennesaw State Owls men's basketball|Kennesaw State]] on November 9, 2007. He then collected two points, five rebounds and a game-best three blocks on November 13 against Kentucky Wesleyan. He was injured in practice after the victory over [[Kentucky Wesleyan Panthers men's basketball|Kentucky Wesleyan]] and missed the rest of the year.\n\n==Return to the Philippines==\n\n===Powerade Team Pilipinas===\nAfter his stint with the Hilltoppers and NBA tryouts, Aguilar returned to the Philippines to join the Gilas program to represent the Philippines coached by then Rajko Toroman and Chot Reyes mentored that captured the silver medal in 2013 FIBA Asia Cup in Manila and earned the berth that represented the country in World Basketball in Spain, which brings back the glory days of Philippine basketball in International Scene.

The deal required him to play a few games with the Burger King Whoppers after which he would be traded to Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters (Pangilinan's PBA team), which in turn would release him to Smart Gilas. Alvarez also pointed out that the No. 18 uniform was ready even before Aguilar signed the contract. \n\nAguilar played his only professional game with the Whoppers against the [[Purefoods Star Hotshots|Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants]] in the PBA season opener, which ended in a 93\u201380 loss to the Giants.
