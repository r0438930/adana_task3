The black honeyeater exhibits [[sexual dimorphism]], with the male being black and white while the female is a speckled grey-brown; immature birds look like the female. The species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to Australia, and ranges widely across the [[arid]] areas of the continent, through open woodland and shrubland, particularly in areas where the [[Eremophila (plant)|emu bush]] and related species occur.\n\nA [[nectar]] feeder, the black honeyeater has a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers such as those of the emu bush. It also takes insects in the air, and regularly eats ash left behind at campfires. Cup-shaped nests are built in the forks of small trees or shrubs. The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest-building or incubating the clutch of two to three eggs. Both sexes feed and care for the young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread and hence is considered to be of [[least concern]] on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] of Endangered species.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Myzomela nigra Gould 1848 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|John and [[Elizabeth Gould (illustrator)|Elizabeth Gould]]'s illustration of a female and male drawn from nature|alt=Illustration of a brown female and black male on a plant]]\n\nThe black honeyeater was first described by English naturalist [[John Gould]] in 1838 as ''Myzomela nigra'',<ref name=\"AFD\"/> using as the specific epithet the [[Latin]] adjective ''niger'' 'black'.<ref name=fraser13/> The genus name was derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''myzo'' 'to suckle' and ''meli'' 'honey', and referred to the bird's [[Nectarivore|nectivorous]] habits.<ref name=\"Liddell 1980\">{{cite book | author = Liddell, Henry George | author-link = Henry George Liddell | author2 = Scott, Robert | author2-link = Robert Scott (philologist) | year = 1980 | origyear = 1871 | title = A Greek-English Lexicon (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford, United Kingdom | isbn = 978-0-19-910207-5 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/lexicon00lidd/page/272 272, 374] | title-link = A Greek-English Lexicon }}</ref> Italian ornithologist [[Tommaso Salvadori]] described it as ''Glyciphila nisoria'' in 1878,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Salvadori |first= Tommaso | year= 1878 | title= Descrizione di trentuna specie nuove di uccelli delle sottoregione papuana, e note intorno ad altre poco conosciute | journal= Annali del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale, Genova | volume= 12|pages= 317\u201347 [335] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30263909 | language=Italian}}</ref> though he incorrectly wrote that it originated in New Guinea.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Schodde |first=Richard | year= 1978 | title=The identity of five type-specimens of New Guinean birds | journal=Emu | volume= 78 |pages= 1\u20136| doi=10.1071/MU9780001}}</ref> In the 1913 ''Official Checklist of the Birds of Australia'', Australian amateur ornithologist [[Gregory Mathews]] placed the black honeyeater in the genus ''Cissomela'' with the banded honeyeater.<ref>{{cite book | title=A list of the birds of Australia : containing the names and synonyms connected with each genus, species, and subspecies of birds found in Australia, at present known to the author | year=1913 |  last=Mathews | first= Gregory M. | page=[https://archive.org/details/listofbirdsofaus00math/page/264 264] | url=https://archive.org/details/listofbirdsofaus00math | location=London, United Kingdom | publisher= Witherby }}</ref> He then placed it in its own genus, ''Sugomel'', in 1922,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Mathews | first= Gregory M. | year=1922 | title=Additions and corrections | journal =  Austral Avian Records | volume=5 |pages= 1\u20139 [7] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/35999594}}</ref> the name being derived from the Latin ''sugo'' 'I suck', and ''mel'' 'honey'.<ref name=fraser13/> In 1967 ornithologist [[Finn Salomonsen]] transferred the species from ''[[Myzomela]]'' to the [[genus]] ''[[Certhionyx]]'',<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Paynter | editor-first=Raymond A.

The black honeyeater exhibits [[sexual dimorphism]], with the male being black and white while the female is a speckled grey-brown; immature birds look like the female. The species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to Australia, and ranges widely across the [[arid]] areas of the continent, through open woodland and shrubland, particularly in areas where the [[Eremophila (plant)|emu bush]] and related species occur.\n\nA [[nectar]] feeder, the black honeyeater has a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers such as those of the emu bush. It also takes insects in the air, and regularly eats ash left behind at campfires. Cup-shaped nests are built in the forks of small trees or shrubs. The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest-building or incubating the clutch of two to three eggs. Both sexes feed and care for the young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread and hence is considered to be of [[least concern]] on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] of Endangered species.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Myzomela nigra Gould 1848 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|John and [[Elizabeth Gould (illustrator)|Elizabeth Gould]]'s illustration of a female and male drawn from nature|alt=Illustration of a brown female and black male on a plant]]\n\nThe black honeyeater was first described by English naturalist [[John Gould]] in 1838 as ''Myzomela nigra'',<ref name=\"AFD\"/> using as the species name the [[Latin]] adjective ''niger'' 'black'.<ref name=fraser13/> The genus name was derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''myzo'' 'to suckle' and ''meli'' 'honey', and referred to the bird's [[Nectarivore|nectivorous]] habits.<ref name=\"Liddell 1980\">{{cite book | author = Liddell, Henry George | author-link = Henry George Liddell | author2 = Scott, Robert | author2-link = Robert Scott (philologist) | year = 1980 | origyear = 1871 | title = A Greek-English Lexicon (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford, United Kingdom | isbn = 978-0-19-910207-5 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/lexicon00lidd/page/272 272, 374] | title-link = A Greek-English Lexicon }}</ref> Italian ornithologist [[Tommaso Salvadori]] described it as ''Glyciphila nisoria'' in 1878,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Salvadori |first= Tommaso | year= 1878 | title= Descrizione di trentuna specie nuove di uccelli delle sottoregione papuana, e note intorno ad altre poco conosciute | journal= Annali del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale, Genova | volume= 12|pages= 317\u201347 [335] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30263909 | language=Italian}}</ref> though he incorrectly wrote that it originated in New Guinea.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Schodde |first=Richard | year= 1978 | title=The identity of five type-specimens of New Guinean birds | journal=Emu | volume= 78 |pages= 1\u20136| doi=10.1071/MU9780001}}</ref> In the 1913 ''Official Checklist of the Birds of Australia'', Australian amateur ornithologist [[Gregory Mathews]] placed the black honeyeater in the genus ''Cissomela'' with the banded honeyeater.<ref>{{cite book | title=A list of the birds of Australia : containing the names and synonyms connected with each genus, species, and subspecies of birds found in Australia, at present known to the author | year=1913 |  last=Mathews | first= Gregory M. | page=[https://archive.org/details/listofbirdsofaus00math/page/264 264] | url=https://archive.org/details/listofbirdsofaus00math | location=London, United Kingdom | publisher= Witherby }}</ref> He then placed it in its own genus, ''Sugomel'', in 1922,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Mathews | first= Gregory M. | year=1922 | title=Additions and corrections | journal =  Austral Avian Records | volume=5 |pages= 1\u20139 [7] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/35999594}}</ref> the name being derived from the Latin ''sugo'' 'I suck', and ''mel'' 'honey'.<ref name=fraser13/> In 1967 ornithologist [[Finn Salomonsen]] transferred the species from ''[[Myzomela]]'' to the [[genus]] ''[[Certhionyx]]'',<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Paynter | editor-first=Raymond A.

It is mainly found in the crowns of eucalypts, at clumps of [[mistletoe]] or in shrubs, especially emu bushes (''[[Eremophila (plant)|Eremophila]]''). Observations over a twelve-month period in [[South Australia]] recorded black honeyeaters visiting the flowers of berrigan emu bush, twin-leaf emu bush (''[[Eremophila oppositifolia]]''), lerp mallee (''[[Eucalyptus incrassata]]''), and holly grevillea (''[[Grevillea ilicifolia]]'').

Runge and colleagues observed that the black honeyeaters' range across inland Australia contracted after years of low rainfall and showed a slow and incomplete recovery even after several years. They added that although nomadic species such as the black honeyeater may have a large distribution, they are often habitat specialists and hence may occupy only a small area within their range. Thus the risk of extinction of these species may be underestimated.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Geographic range size and extinction risk assessment in nomadic species | first=Claire A. | last= Runge | first2=Ayesha | last2=Tulloch | first3=Edd | last3=Hammill | first4=Hugh P. | last4=Possingham | first5=Richard A. | last5=Fuller | journal=Conservation Biology |volume =29|issue= 3 |year=2015 |pages =865\u201376 | doi=10.1111/cobi.12440 | pmid=25580637 | pmc=4681363}}</ref> The black honeyeater may be adversely affected by the loss of the emu bush due to [[grazing]] and [[weed control]] by farmers.<ref name=\"backyardbirds\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Sugomel nigrum}}\n{{Wikispecies|Sugomel nigrum}}\n* [http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/black-honeyeater-sugomel-nigrum Videos and photos] \u2013 Internet Bird Collection\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q282071}}\n\n[[Category:Birds described in 1838|black honeyeater]]\n[[Category:Endemic birds of Australia]]\n[[Category:Meliphagidae]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Gould]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n", "name_user": "Rogermccart", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTaxonomy:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_honeyeater"}
