Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called [[sapphire]]s. Ruby is one of the traditional [[cardinal gem]]s, together with [[amethyst]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], and [[diamond]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218182752/https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 |date=December 18, 2017 }}, Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> The word ''ruby'' comes from ''ruber'', [[Latin]] for red. The color of a ruby is due to the element [[chromium]].\n\nSome gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, such as the [[Black Prince's Ruby]] in the British [[Imperial State Crown]], are actually [[spinel]]s. These were once known as \"Balas rubies\".\n\nThe quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with [[carat (mass)|carat]] weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like [[rutile]] [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional [[birthstone]] for July and is usually [[pink]]er than [[garnet]], although some [[rhodolite]] garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most valuable ruby is the [[Sunrise Ruby]].\n\n==Historical and cultural references==\n[[File:Ruby Eye Pendant.jpg|thumb|right|The Ruby Eye Amulet from Mesopotamia, Adilnor Collection, Sweden.]]\n* An early recorded  transport and trading of rubies arises in the literature on the [[North Silk Road]] of China, wherein about 200 [[Before Christ|BC]] rubies were carried along this ancient [[trackway]] moving westward from China.<ref>C.

They were used to ornament armor, scabbards, and harnesses of noblemen in India and China. Rubies were laid beneath the foundation of buildings to secure good fortune to the structure.\n*Some other sources explain that the Indian culture worships rubies to be the \"gemstone of the sun\", leader of the nine planets. <ref name=\"smith\">{{cite book|last = Smith|first = Henry G.|title = Gems and Precious Stones|publisher = Charles Potter Government Printer, Australia|year = 1896|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/smith-gems-prec-stones/page_028|chapter = Chapter 2, Sapphires, Rubies|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090904/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/smith-gems-prec-stones/page_028|archivedate = September 29, 2007|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[Image:Corundum.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure of rubies]]\nRubies have a [[hardness]] of 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. Among the natural gems only [[moissanite]] and [[diamond]] are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling somewhere in between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are \u03b1-alumina, the most stable form of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminium [[ion]] to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminium ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.\n\n[[Image: Ruby model.jpg|thumb|left|Crystal structure of ruby showing the substitution of Al<sup>3+</sup> ions (blue) with Cr<sup>3+</sup> (red).  The substitution density of Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions in this model is approximately 2%, approximating the maximum doping normally encountered.<ref>[https://www.miramodus.com/images.shtml Images of molecular models from Miramodus]</ref>]]\n\nWhen a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminium atom, it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium<sup>3+</sup> ion to maintain the charge balance of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystal.  However, the Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions are larger and have [[Electron configuration#Ionization of the transition metals|electron orbitals]] in different directions than aluminium. The octahedral arrangement of the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions is distorted, and the energy levels of the different orbitals of those Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions are slightly altered because of the directions to the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions.<ref name=causes>{{cite web | url= http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | title= Ruby: causes of color | accessdate= 28 Mar 2016 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160321193313/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | archivedate= March 21, 2016 | df= mdy-all }}</ref> Those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet, violet, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum.\n\n[[Image:Ruby transmittance.svg |thumb|Transmittance of ruby in optical and near-IR spectra. Note the two broad violet and yellow-green absorption bands and one narrow absorption band at the wavelength of 694 nm, which is the wavelength of the ruby laser.]]\n\nIf one percent of the aluminium ions are replaced by chromium in ruby, the yellow-green absorption results in a red color for the gem.<ref name=causes/>  Additionally, absorption at any of the above wavelengths stimulates [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] emission of 694-nanometer-wavelength red light, which adds to its red color and perceived [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].\n\nAfter absorbing short-wavelength light, there is a short interval of time when the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted in-phase with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass  emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a [[ruby laser]] in this way produces a very high intensity of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] red light.\n\nAll natural rubies have imperfections in them, including color impurities and inclusions of [[rutile]] needles known as \"silk\". Gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics, simulants, or substitutes. Usually, the rough stone is heated before cutting. These days, almost all rubies are treated in some form, with heat treatment being the most common practice. Untreated rubies of high quality command a large premium.\n\nSome rubies show a three-point or six-point [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] or \"star\". These rubies are cut into [[cabochons]] to display the effect properly. Asterisms are best visible with a single-light source and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated. Such effects occur when light is reflected off the \"silk\" (the structurally oriented [[rutile]] needle inclusions) in a certain way. This is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone. Furthermore, rubies can show color changes\u2014though this occurs very rarely\u2014as well as [[chatoyancy]] or the \"cat's eye\" effect.\n\n===Ruby vs. pink sapphire===\nGenerally, gemstone-quality corundum in all shades of red, including pink, are called rubies.<ref name=\"matlins\">{{cite book|last=Matlins|first=Antoinette Leonard|title=Colored Gemstones|year=2010|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=0-943763-72-X|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502140108/https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|archivedate=May 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Peter|title=Gemmology|year=1991|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=0-7506-6449-5|page=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102012607/https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  However, in the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby; otherwise, the stone will be called a [[sapphire|pink sapphire]].<ref name=\"matlins\" />  Drawing a distinction between rubies and pink sapphires is relatively new, having arisen sometime in the 20th century.

Rubies are also evaluated on the basis of their geographic origin.\n\n'''Color:''' In the evaluation of colored gemstones, color is the most important factor. Color divides into three components: ''hue'', ''saturation'' and ''tone''. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the ''pure spectral hues'' of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.<ref name=wise>{{cite book|author=Wise, Richard W. |title=Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones |pages=18\u201322 |isbn=0-9728223-8-0 |year=2006|publisher=Brunswick House Press}}</ref> In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nImage:Ruby cristal.jpg|A naturally occurring ruby crystal\nImage:Ruby gem.JPG|Natural ruby with inclusions\nImage:Cut Ruby.jpg|A cut pink ruby\nImage:Rubis, calcite 14.jpg|Purple rubies\n</gallery>\n\n==Treatments and enhancements==\nImproving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices.\n\nImprovements used include color alteration, improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions, healing of fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.\n\nThe most common treatment is the application of heat. Most rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated to improve color, remove ''purple tinge'', blue patches, and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800&nbsp;\u00b0C (3300&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=\"ThemelisRubyHeat\">{{cite book|isbn=0940965100|title=The Heat Treatment of Ruby and Sapphire|publisher=Gemlab Inc.|place=Bangkok, Thailand|year=1992}}</ref> Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300&nbsp;\u00b0C (2400&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is partially broken, and the color is improved.\n\nAnother treatment, which has become more frequent in recent years, is <!-- to avoid false positives for 'is led/lead' typo-->[[lead glass]] filling. Filling the fractures inside the ruby with lead glass (or a similar material) dramatically improves the transparency of the stone, making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry.<ref>Vincent Pardieu [http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf Lead Glass Filled/Repaired Rubies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831062843/http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf |date=August 31, 2011 }}.

February 2005</ref> The process is done in four steps:\n\n# The rough stones are pre-polished to eradicate all surface impurities that may affect the process\n# The rough is cleaned with [[hydrogen fluoride]]\n# The first heating process during which no fillers are added. The heating process eradicates impurities inside the fractures. Although this can be done at temperatures up to 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C (2500&nbsp;\u00b0F) it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C (1600&nbsp;\u00b0F) since the rutile silk is still intact.\n# The second heating process in an electrical oven with different chemical additives. Different solutions and mixes have shown to be successful, however mostly lead-containing glass-powder is used at present. The ruby is dipped into oils, then covered with powder, embedded on a tile and placed in the oven where it is heated at around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C (1600&nbsp;\u00b0F) for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere. The orange colored powder transforms upon heating into a transparent to yellow-colored paste, which fills all fractures. After cooling the color of the paste is fully transparent and dramatically improves the overall transparency of the ruby.<ref>Richard W.

By this point Verneuil was already developing the process of [[Verneuil process|flame fusion]] that would later bear his name. Verneuil published details of his new method in 1902, at which point the industrial production of synthetic ruby could begin. By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.\n\nOther processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through Czochralski's [[Czochralski process|pulling process]], flux process, and the [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curved [[striae]] and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; unless there are no imperfections (i.e., a perfect ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. [[Dopant]]s are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need [[gemology|gemological]] testing to determine their origin.\n\nSynthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones. Rods of synthetic ruby are used to make [[ruby laser]]s and [[maser]]s. The first working laser was made by [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H.

Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called [[sapphire]]s. Ruby is one of the traditional [[cardinal gem]]s, together with [[amethyst]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], and [[diamond]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218182752/https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 |date=December 18, 2017 }}, Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> The word ''ruby'' comes from ''ruber'', [[Latin]] for red. The color of a ruby is due to the element [[chromium]].\n\nSome gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, such as the [[Black Prince's Ruby]] in the British [[Imperial State Crown]], are actually [[spinel]]s. These were once known as \"Balas rubies\".\n\nThe quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with [[carat (mass)|carat]] weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like [[rutile]] [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional [[birthstone]] for July and is usually [[pink]]er than [[garnet]], although some [[rhodolite]] garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most valuable ruby is the [[Sunrise Ruby]].\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[Image:Corundum.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure of rubies]]\nRubies have a [[hardness]] of 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. Among the natural gems only [[moissanite]] and [[diamond]] are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling somewhere in between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are \u03b1-alumina, the most stable form of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminium [[ion]] to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminium ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.\n\n[[Image: Ruby model.jpg|thumb|left|Crystal structure of ruby showing the substitution of Al<sup>3+</sup> ions (blue) with Cr<sup>3+</sup> (red).  The substitution density of Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions in this model is approximately 2%, approximating the maximum doping normally encountered.<ref>[https://www.miramodus.com/images.shtml Images of molecular models from Miramodus]</ref>]]\n\nWhen a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminium atom, it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium<sup>3+</sup> ion to maintain the charge balance of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystal.  However, the Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions are larger and have [[Electron configuration#Ionization of the transition metals|electron orbitals]] in different directions than aluminium. The octahedral arrangement of the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions is distorted, and the energy levels of the different orbitals of those Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions are slightly altered because of the directions to the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions.<ref name=causes>{{cite web | url= http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | title= Ruby: causes of color | accessdate= 28 Mar 2016 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160321193313/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | archivedate= March 21, 2016 | df= mdy-all }}</ref> Those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet, violet, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum.\n\n[[Image:Ruby transmittance.svg |thumb|Transmittance of ruby in optical and near-IR spectra. Note the two broad violet and yellow-green absorption bands and one narrow absorption band at the wavelength of 694 nm, which is the wavelength of the ruby laser.]]\n\nIf one percent of the aluminium ions are replaced by chromium in ruby, the yellow-green absorption results in a red color for the gem.<ref name=causes/>  Additionally, absorption at any of the above wavelengths stimulates [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] emission of 694-nanometer-wavelength red light, which adds to its red color and perceived [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].\n\nAfter absorbing short-wavelength light, there is a short interval of time when the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted in-phase with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass  emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a [[ruby laser]] in this way produces a very high intensity of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] red light.\n\nAll natural rubies have imperfections in them, including color impurities and inclusions of [[rutile]] needles known as \"silk\". Gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics, simulants, or substitutes. Usually, the rough stone is heated before cutting. These days, almost all rubies are treated in some form, with heat treatment being the most common practice. Untreated rubies of high quality command a large premium.\n\nSome rubies show a three-point or six-point [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] or \"star\". These rubies are cut into [[cabochons]] to display the effect properly. Asterisms are best visible with a single-light source and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated. Such effects occur when light is reflected off the \"silk\" (the structurally oriented [[rutile]] needle inclusions) in a certain way. This is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone. Furthermore, rubies can show color changes\u2014though this occurs very rarely\u2014as well as [[chatoyancy]] or the \"cat's eye\" effect.\n\n===Ruby vs. pink sapphire===\nGenerally, gemstone-quality corundum in all shades of red, including pink, are called rubies.<ref name=\"matlins\">{{cite book|last=Matlins|first=Antoinette Leonard|title=Colored Gemstones|year=2010|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=0-943763-72-X|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502140108/https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|archivedate=May 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Peter|title=Gemmology|year=1991|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=0-7506-6449-5|page=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102012607/https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  However, in the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby; otherwise, the stone will be called a [[sapphire|pink sapphire]].<ref name=\"matlins\" />  Drawing a distinction between rubies and pink sapphires is relatively new, having arisen sometime in the 20th century.

The most recently found ruby deposit in Myanmar is in Namya (Namyazeik) located in the northern state of [[Kachin State|Kachin]].\n\nRubies are also mined in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. In [[Azad Kashmir|Pakistani Kashmir]] there are vast proven reserves of millions of rubies, worth up to half a billion dollars.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rubies, the buried treasures of Pakistani Kashmir |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20171015-rubies-buried-treasures-pakistani-kashmir|publisher=[[France24]]}}</ref> However, as of 2017 there was only one mine (at Chitta Katha) due to lack of investment.<ref>{{cite news|author=Caroline Nelly Perrot|title=Rubies, the buried treasures of Pakistani Kashmir |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-10-rubies-treasures-pakistani-kashmir.html}}</ref> In Afghanistan, rubies are mined at Jegdalek.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The dangerous world of Pakistan\u2019s gem trade |url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/world/pakistans-blood-stones/|magazine=[[Maclean's]]}}</ref>\n\nIn Sri Lanka, lighter shades of rubies (often \"pink sapphires\") are more commonly found.\n\n==Factors affecting value==\nRubies, as with other gemstones, are graded using criteria known as the four Cs, namely color, cut, clarity and carat weight. Rubies are also evaluated on the basis of their geographic origin.\n\n'''Color:''' In the evaluation of colored gemstones, color is the most important factor. Color divides into three components: ''hue'', ''saturation'' and ''tone''. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the ''pure spectral hues'' of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.<ref name=wise>{{cite book|author=Wise, Richard W. |title=Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones |pages=18\u201322 |isbn=0-9728223-8-0 |year=2006|publisher=Brunswick House Press}}</ref> In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nImage:Ruby cristal.jpg|A naturally occurring ruby crystal\nImage:Ruby gem.JPG|Natural ruby with inclusions\nImage:Cut Ruby.jpg|A cut pink ruby\nImage:Rubis, calcite 14.jpg|Purple rubies\n</gallery>\n\n==Treatments and enhancements==\nImproving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices.\n\nImprovements used include color alteration, improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions, healing of fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.\n\nThe most common treatment is the application of heat. Most rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated to improve color, remove ''purple tinge'', blue patches, and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800&nbsp;\u00b0C (3300&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=\"ThemelisRubyHeat\">{{cite book|isbn=0940965100|title=The Heat Treatment of Ruby and Sapphire|publisher=Gemlab Inc.|place=Bangkok, Thailand|year=1992}}</ref> Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300&nbsp;\u00b0C (2400&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is partially broken, and the color is improved.\n\nAnother treatment, which has become more frequent in recent years, is <!-- to avoid false positives for 'is led/lead' typo-->[[lead glass]] filling. Filling the fractures inside the ruby with lead glass (or a similar material) dramatically improves the transparency of the stone, making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry.<ref>Vincent Pardieu [http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf Lead Glass Filled/Repaired Rubies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831062843/http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf |date=August 31, 2011 }}. Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences Gem Testing Laboratory. February 2005</ref> The process is done in four steps:\n\n# The rough stones are pre-polished to eradicate all surface impurities that may affect the process\n# The rough is cleaned with [[hydrogen fluoride]]\n# The first heating process during which no fillers are added. The heating process eradicates impurities inside the fractures. Although this can be done at temperatures up to 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C (2500&nbsp;\u00b0F) it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C (1600&nbsp;\u00b0F) since the rutile silk is still intact.\n# The second heating process in an electrical oven with different chemical additives. Different solutions and mixes have shown to be successful, however mostly lead-containing glass-powder is used at present. The ruby is dipped into oils, then covered with powder, embedded on a tile and placed in the oven where it is heated at around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C (1600&nbsp;\u00b0F) for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere. The orange colored powder transforms upon heating into a transparent to yellow-colored paste, which fills all fractures.

Red light is emitted}}\nIn 1837, Gaudin made the first synthetic rubies by fusing potash [[potassium alum|alum]] at a high temperature with a little chromium as a pigment. In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white sapphire by fusing [[alumina]] in boric acid. In 1877, Frenic and Freil made crystal [[corundum]] from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing BaF<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with a little chromium at [[Incandescence|red heat]]. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020704/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|archivedate = September 27, 2007|df = mdy-all}}</ref> By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.\n\n[[Edmond Fr\u00e9my]] would later improve the crystallisation of ruby from a solution to grow larger crystals: first alongside the industrial glass-maker Charles Feil, and latterly alongside his student [[Auguste Victor Louis Verneuil|Auguste Verneuil]]. By this point Verneuil was already developing the process of [[Verneuil process|flame fusion]] that would later bear his name. Verneuil published details of his new method in 1902, at which point the industrial production of synthetic ruby could begin. By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.\n\nOther processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through Czochralski's [[Czochralski process|pulling process]], flux process, and the [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curved [[striae]] and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; unless there are no imperfections (i.e., a perfect ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. [[Dopant]]s are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need [[gemology|gemological]] testing to determine their origin.\n\nSynthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones. Rods of synthetic ruby are used to make [[ruby laser]]s and [[maser]]s. The first working laser was made by [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] in 1960.<ref name=\"maiman\">{{cite journal |last=Maiman |first=T.H. |authorlink=Theodore Harold Maiman |year=1960 |title=Stimulated optical radiation in ruby |journal=Nature|volume=187 |issue=4736 |pages=493\u2013494 |doi=10.1038/187493a0 |bibcode=1960Natur.187..493M}}</ref> Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Ruby lasers are still in use. Rubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear-exposed locations in modern mechanical clockworks, or as scanning probe tips in a [[coordinate measuring machine]].\n\n[[Imitation]] rubies are also marketed. Red [[spinel]]s, red [[garnet]]s, and colored glass have been falsely claimed to be rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century techniques were developed to color foil red\u2014by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace\u2014which was then placed under the imitation stone.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|title = Thomas Nicols: A Lapidary or History of Gemstones|year = 1652|accessdate = 2007-08-19|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819165714/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|archivedate = August 19, 2007|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Trade terms such as [[balas ruby]] for red spinel and [[rubellite]] for red [[tourmaline]] can mislead unsuspecting buyers.
