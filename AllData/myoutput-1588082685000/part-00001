The University was established to meet the needs of people in the north of Thailand, and to commemorate the contributions of the king's mother, Princess Srinagarindra, known to her subjects as \"Mae Fah Luang.\" From its inaugural class of 64 students in 1998, MFU has become Thailand's fastest growing post-secondary institution with an enrollment of just under 10,000 students. After little over a decade of operation, MFU is already well known for its high-quality teaching, research, and service to the people of the north, as well as Thailand.\nMae Fah Luang University's campus consists of a large complex of modern, state-of-the-art buildings, spanning more than 800 hectares. The campus is located in a spectacular setting of mountains and trees, an environment conducive to teaching and learning in a clean, inviting setting. As both a regional and national university, MFU provides high-quality education services and resources for the neighboring countries of the Greater Mekhong Sub-region (GMS), and reaches out to all of Southeast Asia.\n\n==Partner Institution==\n===Malaysia===\n*[[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]]<ref name=\"UTARUniversityPartners\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.utar.edu.my/dcinternet/index.jsp?fcatid=7819|title=University Partners - Division of Community and International Networking|publisher=Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman(UTAR)|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n{{Commons category|Mae Fah Luang University}}\n\n{{Universities in Thailand}}\n\n{{coord|20|02|42|N|99|53|41|E|region:TH-57_type:edu|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1998]]\n[[Category:Universities in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Chiang Rai Province]]\n[[Category:Education in Chiang Rai Province]]\n[[Category:1998 establishments in Thailand]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox University \n|name           = Mae Fah Luang University\n|native_name    = \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07\n|image          = ALLMFU.jpg\n|image_size     = 270\n|established    = 1998 \n|type           = [[Public university|Public]] ([[National university|National]])\n|city           = [[Chiang Rai]]\n|country        = [[Thailand]]\n|mascot         = \n|affiliations   = [[Association of Southeast Asian Institutions of Higher Learning|ASAIHL]]\n|website        = {{URL|http://www.mfu.ac.th}}\n|colours = Red and Gold}}\n\n'''Mae Fah Luang University (MFU)''', situated in [[Chiang Rai Province]] in northern [[Thailand]], is named after the [[Srinagarindra|Princess Mother (Somdet Yah)]], Mae Fah Luang was the name given to her by the local people in Chiang Rai.\n\n[[File:Princess Mother Srinagarindra.jpg|thumb|Princess Srinagarindra]] \nIt is an autonomous public university that was established on 25 September 1998.
