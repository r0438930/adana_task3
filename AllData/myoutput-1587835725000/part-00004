This is regulated by reports sent in by the Parties, meant to increase transparency of actions taken by both developing nations and advanced ones. It also has measures to increase countries' ability to adapt to conditions of climate change. The means of change that a country can take are called \"nationally determined contributions\". '''NDC'''<nowiki/>'s are essentially the efforts that each country will take to reduce their emissions. The period of effect for this agreement began on 4 November 2016.

These are [[Annex I]], [[Annex II]], and [[Non-Annex I Parties|Non-Annex I]]. The organization of parties decides the level of participation of each country. It determines if the country is required to give financial aid to others, how often they must send reports, and the strictness of regulations in their country. The Annex I title refers to industrialized countries involved in either the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] ('''OECD''') in 1992 or countries in economic transition ('''EIT'''). Annex II refers to countries in OECD but not EIT. These parties are required to help less advanced countries financially. They are also expected to take extra measures to transition to climate friendly technologies in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Non-Annex countries are developing and particularly vulnerable to climate change due to location, economic situations, or other issues institutionalized into the country. Another title is \"least developed countries\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/items/2704.php|title=Parties & Observers|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> This indicates that the nation is limited in their ability to respond to climate change issues.

However, each year a different theme is chosen and focused on. The twenty-second session dealt mainly with water management and decarbonizing energy supplies.<ref name=\"cop22.org|title=COP22\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cop22.org|title=COP22 Marrakech Morocco - Sustainable Innovation Forum in partnership with United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{!}} COP22 Marrakech|website=www.cop22.org|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> COP22 took place on 14 and 15 November during the UNFCCC in Marrakech.<ref name=\"cop22.org|title=COP22\"/> The ways in which the [[Paris Agreement]] will be applied, as well as the agenda for negotiations, were on the agenda for COP22. [[Nik Gowing]], known as a British journalist, chaired the event.\n\n=== African Dimension to COP22 ===\nOn the margins of COP22, a summit involving \"around 30 African heads of state\" took place on 16 November 2016 in Marrakesh. This summit focused primarily on climate negotiations, in the backdrop of Africa being the part of the world that is the most threatened by global warming. On a more local note, the city of Marrakesh also took the opportunity to create for itself a greener image; for example, it has provided 300 bicycles for public use as part of a municipal [[Bicycle-sharing system|bicycle-sharing]] scheme.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://aujourdhui.ma/economie/cop22-300-velos-libre-service-a-marrakech|title=Cop22: 300 v\u00e9los libre-service \u00e0 Marrakech|newspaper=Aujourd'hui le Maroc|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Presentation of [[SuRe]] \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===\nOn 14 November, the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) presented the newly launched [[SuRe]] \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure at the Climate Summit for Local and Regional Leaders.<ref>http://www.gib-foundation.org/news/</ref>\nGIB participated in a dialogue on \"financing the sustainable transition of territories\" to contribute to the Marrakech Roadmap for Action definition.\n\n=== 14 November ===\n==== Water Management and Conservation Forum ====\nDetailed issues relating to water transportation, infrastructure in the context of water storage, [[sustainable distribution]], innovation for conservation, and accelerating efforts for new technologies.

The conference opened with a preparatory document on a future COP21 agreement in Paris and by adopting a 37-page text.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conference of the parties|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=Lima|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015: Paris (COP21) ====\nThe 195 countries participating in the conference adopted the first worldwide climate agreement, a binding treaty that aims to limit climate change to a temperature increase of under 2&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm|title=Paris Agreement - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n== Attendees ==\nThe convention's attendees can be sorted into one of three categories: parties, observers, or members of the press/media.\n\n=== Parties ===\nThere are three distinct groups that a nation can be placed in if they are considered a \"party\". These are [[Annex I]], [[Annex II]], and [[Non-Annex I Parties|Non-Annex I]]. The organization of parties decides the level of participation of each country. It determines if the country is required to give financial aid to others, how often they must send reports, and the strictness of regulations in their country. The Annex I title refers to industrialized countries involved in either the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] ('''OECD''') in 1992 or countries in economic transition ('''EIT'''). Annex II refers to countries in OECD but not EIT. These parties are required to help less advanced countries financially. They are also expected to take extra measures to transition to climate friendly technologies in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Non-Annex countries are developing and particularly vulnerable to climate change due to location, economic situations, or other issues institutionalized into the country. Another title is \"least developed countries\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/items/2704.php|title=Parties & Observers|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> This indicates that the nation is limited in their ability to respond to climate change issues.

However, each year a different theme is chosen and focused on. The twenty-second session dealt mainly with water management and decarbonizing energy supplies.<ref name=\"cop22.org|title=COP22\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cop22.org|title=COP22 Marrakech Morocco - Sustainable Innovation Forum in partnership with United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{!}} COP22 Marrakech|website=www.cop22.org|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> COP22 took place on 14 and 15 November during the UNFCCC in Marrakech.<ref name=\"cop22.org|title=COP22\"/> The ways in which the [[Paris Agreement]] will be applied, as well as the agenda for negotiations, were on the agenda for COP22.

This summit focused primarily on climate negotiations, in the backdrop of Africa being the part of the world that is the most threatened by global warming. On a more local note, the city of Marrakesh also took the opportunity to create for itself a greener image; for example, it has provided 300 bicycles for public use as part of a municipal [[Bicycle-sharing system|bicycle-sharing]] scheme.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://aujourdhui.ma/economie/cop22-300-velos-libre-service-a-marrakech|title=Cop22: 300 v\u00e9los libre-service \u00e0 Marrakech|newspaper=Aujourd'hui le Maroc|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Presentation of [[SuRe]] \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===\nOn 14 November, the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) presented the newly launched [[SuRe]] \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure at the Climate Summit for Local and Regional Leaders.<ref>http://www.gib-foundation.org/news/</ref>\nGIB participated in a dialogue on \"financing the sustainable transition of territories\" to contribute to the Marrakech Roadmap for Action definition.\n\n=== 14 November ===\n==== Water Management and Conservation Forum ====\nDetailed issues relating to water transportation, infrastructure in the context of water storage, sustainable distribution, innovation for conservation, and accelerating efforts for new technologies.
