History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly due to disease, starvation, epidemic or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]] declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].\n\n==Underpopulation==\nSometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system does not refer to [[carrying capacity]], and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population  can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. \"Underpopulation\" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Positive effects of a population decline==\nA long-term decline in birth rates has a positive effect on the labour market due a decreasing number of job applicants.

For instance a nation's population could have been increasing, but a one-off event could have resulted in a short-term decline; or vice versa. Nations can acquire territory or lose territory, and groups of people can acquire or lose citizenship, e.g. [[statelessness|stateless]] persons, indigenous people, and illegal immigrants or long-stay foreign residents. Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions. Further, a country's population could rise in summer and decline in winter as deaths increase in winter in cold regions; a long census interval could show a rise in population when the population has already tipped into decline.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[White nationalists]] use evidence of a declining birth rate in support of their extremist views and calls to violence.<ref name=\"BetuelE\">{{cite web |last1=Betuel |first1=Emma |title=CDC Data on Declining US Fertility Rate Is Being Used by White Nationalists |date=January 13, 2019 |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/52409-cdc-fertility-report-race-breakdown-white-nationalism |website=Inverse |language=en}}</ref> Lower fertility rates are generally associated with dramatic increases in population health and longevity.<ref name=\"ESHRE\">{{cite journal |author=ESHRE Capri Workshop Group |title=Noncontraceptive health benefits of combined oral contraception |journal=Human Reproduction Update |date=1 October 2005 |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=513\u2013525 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmi019 |pmid=16006440 |language=en |issn=1355-4786|doi-access=free }}</ref> Increasing populations are not necessary to maintain [[economic growth]] and [[Social determinants of health|social vitality]] because of advances in [[automation]] and workers living healthy lives much longer into old age.

History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly due to disease, starvation, epidemic or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]] declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].\n\n==Underpopulation==\nSometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system does not refer to [[carrying capacity]], and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population  can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. \"Underpopulation\" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Positive effects of a population decline==\nA long-term decline in birth rates has a positive effect on the labour market due a decreasing number of job applicants.

Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions.

Today, Sweden has extensive parental leave where parents are entitled to share 16 months' paid leave per child, the cost divided between both employer and State.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nMany nations that are currently witnessing depopulation with fertility rates below sub-placement (like the west) are recommending [[quantitative easing]] to combat deflation, while other economists, such as Paul Krugman, believe governments should prioritize [[fiscal policy]], such as bringing back [[Keynesian]] policies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Alternative concept relative to skills==\n{{main|Brain drain}}\nSometimes the concept of population decline is applied where there has been considerable emigration of skilled professionals. In such a case, the government may have ceased to reward or value certain skills (e.g. science, medicine and engineering), and sectors of the economy such as health care and technology may go into decline. Such characterizations have been made of [[Italy]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Russia]] in the period starting about 1990.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Biodiversity loss]]\n* [[Birth dearth]]\n* [[Societal collapse]]\n* [[Negative Population Growth]]\n* [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]]\n* [[Human population control]]\n* [[Political demography]]\n* [[Population cycle]]\n* [[Population growth]]\n* [[Rural flight]]\n* [[Sub-replacement fertility]]\n* [[Zero population growth]]\n* [[Church of Euthanasia]]\n* [[Antinatalism]]\n* [[List of cities whose population has fallen under a million]]\n\n'''Case studies:'''\n* [[Russian Cross]]\n* [[Aging of Europe]]\n* [[Aging in the American workforce]]\n* [[Aging of Japan]]\n* [[List of sovereign states and dependencies by total fertility rate]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.oilcrash.com/articles/populatn.htm|title=Human Population Numbers as a Function of Food Supply|work=Russell Hopfenberg (1 [[Duke University]], Durham, NC, USA;)* and [[David Pimentel (scientist)|David Pimentel]] (2 [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, NY, USA)}}\n{{Population}}\n{{Population country lists}}\n{{Human impact on the environment}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Population Decline}}\n[[Category:Aftermath of war]]\n[[Category:Ageing]]\n[[Category:Demographic economic problems]]\n", "name_user": "Joe Bfsplk", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline"}
