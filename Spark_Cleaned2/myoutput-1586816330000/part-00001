{"title_page": "Michigan Stove Company", "text_new": "\n\n'''Michigan Stove Company''', which was based in [[Detroit, Michigan]], manufactured cooking stoves, heaters, and furnaces in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The company was known for its use of up-to-date technology in [[foundry]] applications. The company was considered to be the world's largest producer of stoves and ranges, and had branch offices in many large U.S. cities, as well as global distribution arrangements.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Michigan Stove Company.png|thumb|Michigan Stove Company in Detroit showing Garland stove factory in 1891]]\n\nThe Michigan Stove Company was founded before the [[American Civil War]], when Americans cooked and heated their homes with an open [[hearth]]. This old technology was inefficient, costly, and dangerous. A few modern stoves for the elite and wealthy started to appear in Detroit in the 1830s. All stoves from the 1840s to the 1860s were made and shipped from [[New York City|New York]] via the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name=MIstoveBusiness/> [[Jeremiah Dwyer]] had apprenticed and worked for several years in New York to learn the stove business. In 1861, he and his  younger brother James bought out a failing Detroit [[reaper]] manufacturer that was trying to make stoves. They brought in [[Thomas W. Misner]] and their new firm became J. Dwyer & Company. There was a large demand for cooking and heating stoves at the time and the Dwyers became successful due to their stove-making skills. The Dwyer brothers were the first foundry operators in the [[midwestern United States]] to use modern engineering foundry techniques to make stoves.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}<ref name=WhenStovesWereHot>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= When stoves were the hot new thing|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |page=9  |location=Detroit, Michigan|date= January 24, 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Fuller|1899|page=254}} \n\n[[File:GarlandStoveAd.jpg|thumb|Garland stove advertisement, circa 1900|left]]\nThe first stoves made by the J.

Dwyer sold his ownership in the company to his brother and Edwin S Barbour, and went to live in the [[southern United States]].{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} He later returned to Detroit after his health recovered and again became active in the foundry business.

The company began manufacturing stoves, heaters, and furnaces on September 12, 1872. They first made \"Argand\" brand stove and paid a [[royalty payment|royalty]] to [[Perry & Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], for the rights to make their style and brand.{{sfn|Molders|1910|page=291}} Michigan Stove Company discontinued making \"Argand\" stoves and started making its own style of stoves, which were branded \"Garland\", in 1876.{{sfn|Depew|1895|page=359}} This name was chosen because Dwyer did not want to lose the customers who were loyal to the \"Argand\" brand stoves so chose a similar-sounding name for the company's new brand.{{sfn|Shaw|1907|page=622}}\n\nThere was a major fire at the Michigan Stove Company on January 8, 1907. It started in the evening and within a few hours had destroyed the manufacturing plant. The damage was estimated at $500,000, of which $400,000 was covered by insurance. The 2,200 men working at the factory became unemployed. The fire was first noticed at the coal-hopper in the engine room by the night watchman; within fifteen minutes it had spread to the center of the building. The fire department was notified but it was out of control by the time firefighters began hosing down the building. Thousands of Detroit residents soon arrived to watch the fire and had to be controlled by police. The [[World's Largest Stove|oversized replica stove]] being displayed adjacent to the factory was damaged as one of the plant\u2019s six-story walls fell on it.

It started in the evening and within a few hours had destroyed the manufacturing plant. The damage was estimated at $500,000, of which $400,000 was covered by insurance. The 2,200 men working at the factory became unemployed. The fire was first noticed at the coal-hopper in the engine room by the night watchman; within fifteen minutes it had spread to the center of the building. The fire department was notified but it was out of control by the time firefighters began hosing down the building. Thousands of Detroit residents soon arrived to watch the fire and had to be controlled by police. The [[World's Largest Stove|oversized replica stove]] being displayed adjacent to the factory was damaged as one of the plant\u2019s six-story walls fell on it.
