The player is put in charge of an American [[SSN (U.S. Navy)|SSN]] submarine in the [[Norwegian Sea]] Theater with the overall role of a [[Attack submarine|hunter killer]] performing various missions in the context of the global conflict described in the book representing a campaign. Its original [[Commodore 64]] version was co-designed and co-programmed by the famous game designer [[Sid Meier]].\n\n==Plot==\nAs with {{USS|Chicago|SSN-721|6}} in the book, the game concentrates on the [[Norwegian Sea]] theater, placing the player as captain of a single [[United States Navy]] [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] tasked to disrupt [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in the area between the [[Kola Peninsula]] and the Greenland-Iceland-UK barrier. Missions may include interdiction of [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] fleets, stopping amphibious landing forces, eliminating Soviet [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf pack]] submarines and many others. The background story remains true to the book's plot but the final mission is always to prevent the Soviets from launching nuclear missiles by locating and eliminating their [[ballistic missile submarine]]s.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe player may choose from four different timelines. Starting in the early 1980s limits the player to [[Thresher/Permit-class submarine|''Permit'']], {{sclass-|Sturgeon|submarine|5}} or early {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|5}}-class submarines, but the Soviets have weak [[sonar]], whereas starting in the late 1980s allows the player to use the improved ''Los Angeles'' class and even the newer {{sclass-|Seawolf|submarine|5}} subs. Weapons improve accordingly, with [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk missiles]] and improved [[Mark 48 torpedo]]es included in later timelines but the Soviets begin deploying [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[aircraft carrier]]s and much better [[anti-submarine warfare]] ships.\n\nThe goal of the game is always consistent: Inflicting as much damage as possible on the Soviets in the Norwegian Sea, thus allowing safe passage to supply [[convoy]]s coming from America and preventing amphibious forces from conquering Norway and Iceland. In order to make contact with enemy forces, the player must navigate the sub in a map of the North Sea, depending on his sub's sensors as well as allied aircraft, satellites and [[SOSUS]] arrays to detect the Soviet forces.\n\nSuccess or failure of the missions impacts the progress of the war depicted by shifts in the front line on a simple map of Europe. If the player fails in a mission then Soviet forces capture more territory, but if he succeeds then [[NATO]] is able to resist the Soviet attacks. In the course of the campaign the player can gain rank and possibly earn medals as well. In the end of the war, a final score is calculated and the player is awarded a post-war rank if NATO wins the war; this rank can vary from [[commander]] to [[admiral]] depending on how successful they have been in their missions. A poor performance in the game, particularly in the final mission, means that the Soviets win the war and the player ends up with the rank of [[Comrade#Russian usage|Tovarishch]] (comrade), becoming a political prisoner in a communist-ruled America.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Compute!]]'' called ''Red Storm Rising'' a \"must\" for fans of Tom Clancy or military simulations.<ref name=\"sheffield198902\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-02-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_105_1989_Feb#page/n75/mode/2up | title=Red Storm Rising | work=Compute! | date=February 1989 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Sheffield, Richard | pages=66}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1988 and 1992 gave the game four and a half stars out of five, commending it for balancing realism and gameplay while noting deviations from realism, such as the durability of the player's submarine.
