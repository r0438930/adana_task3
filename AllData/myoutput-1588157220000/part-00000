A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew |title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[United Media|NEA]] newspaper syndicate |authorlink=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer [[Sue Blane]] and musical director [[Richard Hartley (composer)|Richard Hartley]], although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director. [[Michael White (producer)|Michael White]] was also brought in to produce ''Rocky Horror''.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included [[Max Phipps]] - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); [[Graham Matters]] - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with [[Clive Hale]]: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling.

In his words:\n\n\"Guys, this sort of thing [being trans] is spreading because the parents do not hit their kids anymore. But if a father hits a LaverME [here, he makes a pun with Laverne Cox and the word \"worm\" in Portuguese], a fagot rights entity say that she is a woman trapped inside the body of a man. Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context. According to him, it was just a discussion about the casting of actress Laverne Cox for the main role of the musical.\n\n=== Central American productions ===\n\n==== 2013 Panamanian production ====\nIn 2013 the English community [[Theatre Guild of Ancon]] presented the show under the direction of [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1754099/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Melanie Gilpin] (Lee).

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew |title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[United Media|NEA]] newspaper syndicate |authorlink=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer [[Sue Blane]] and musical director [[Richard Hartley (composer)|Richard Hartley]], although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director. [[Michael White (producer)|Michael White]] was also brought in to produce ''Rocky Horror''.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions.

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included [[Max Phipps]] - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); [[Graham Matters]] - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with [[Clive Hale]]: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

In his words:\n\n\"Guys, this sort of thing [being trans] is spreading because the parents do not hit their kids anymore. But if a father hits a LaverME [here, he makes a pun with Laverne Cox and the word \"worm\" in Portuguese], a fagot rights entity say that she is a woman trapped inside the body of a man. Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context. According to him, it was just a discussion about the casting of actress Laverne Cox for the main role of the musical.\n\n=== Central American productions ===\n\n==== 2013 Panamanian production ====\nIn 2013 the English community [[Theatre Guild of Ancon]] presented the show under the direction of [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1754099/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Melanie Gilpin] (Lee).
