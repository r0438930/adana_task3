After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 to sign as a [[Free agent (NBA)|free agent]] with Miami. This move was announced in an [[ESPN]] special titled ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]'', and is one of the most controversial free agent decisions in American sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]] and [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]; in both of these years, he also earned league MVP and Finals MVP. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers.

In 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers to sign with the Lakers.\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated additional wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America's most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials.
