The first cycle happens inside the lamina propria cells and produces many small schizonts. The second generation of schizonts target epithelial cells in the cecum and colon. The second generation of schizonts undergo a sexual cycle (gametogony) which is also the time when clinical signs of the disease can be observed. The release of new oocysts destroys mucosal cells which can lead to loss of serum and blood. This can be observed as bloody diarrhea. The time from ingestion of the parasite to the first signs of disease (prepatent period) is 12\u201314 days. <ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book| author1= Bowman, D.B. |title=Parasitology for Veterinarians | edition=7th | publisher=W.B.
