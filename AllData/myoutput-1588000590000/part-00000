The first was the frigate ''[[Esmeralda (1791)|Esmeralda]]'' captured from the Spanish at [[Callao]], [[Peru]], by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Admiral Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane]] of the [[Chilean Navy]], in a bold incursion on the night of 5 November 1820. The second was the corvette ''[[Esmeralda (1855)|Esmeralda]]'' of the Chilean Navy which, set against superior forces, fought until sunk with colors flying on 21 May 1879 at the [[Battle of Iquique]]. These events mark important milestones for the Chilean Navy and the ship's name is said to evoke its values of courage and sacrifice.\n\nConstruction began in [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain, in 1946. She was intended to become Spain's national training ship. During her construction in 1947 the yard in which she was being built suffered catastrophic explosions, which damaged the ship and placed the yard on the brink of bankruptcy. Work on the ship was temporarily halted. In 1950 [[Chile]] and Spain entered into negotiations in which Spain offered to repay debts incurred to Chile as a result of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the form of manufactured products, including the not yet completed ''Esmeralda''. Chile accepted the offer and the ship was formally transferred to the ownership of Chile in 1951. Work then continued on the ship. She was finally launched on 12 May 1953 before an audience of 5,000 people. She was christened by Mrs. Raquel Vicu\u00f1a de Orrego using a bottle wrapped in the national colors of Spain and Chile. She was delivered as a four-masted topsail schooner to the Government of Chile on 15 June 1954, Captain Horacio Cornejo Tagle in command.\n\nHer sister ship is the training ship for the Spanish Navy, the four-masted topsail schooner {{ship|Spanish ship|Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano|1927|2}}. Sometime in the 1970s ''Esmeralda's'' rigging was changed to a four-masted barquentine by replacing the fore gaffsail (course sail) by two main staysails. The third (top) main staysail is still in place. She has now five staysails, three topsails, six jibbs, three course gaff sails, four square sails, 21 all in all.\n\n== Voyages ==\n[[Image:FragataEsmeralda-MDQ.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Close up view of ''Esmeralda'' at [[Mar del Plata]], February 2010]]\nHer first voyage was to the [[Canary Islands]] and then on to [[New Orleans]], where a distillation plant was installed. She then proceeded through the [[Panama Canal]] and arrived at  [[Valpara\u00edso]] on 1 September 1954 to much fanfare.\n\nSince her commissioning, ''Esmeralda'' has been a training ship for the Chilean Navy. She has visited more than 300 ports worldwide acting as a floating embassy for Chile. She participated in [[Operation Sail]] at [[New York City]] in 1964, 1976 and 1986, and the [[Osaka]] World Sail in 1983. She also participated in International Regattas of Sail in 1964, 1976, 1982 and 1990 winning the coveted [[Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race|Cutty Sark Trophy]] in the last two participations.\n\nIn 2016, Esmeralda visited New Zealand to participate in the 75th Anniversary Celebrations of the foundation of the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN)\n\nIn 2019, Esmeralda visited Singapore in light of the [[APEC Chile 2019]].\n\n== Torture centre ==\n{{see also|Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)}}\nReports from [[Amnesty International]], the [[US Senate]] and [[Rettig Report|Chilean Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]<ref>[http://www.usip.org/files/resources/collections/truth_commissions/Chile90-Report/Chile90-Report.pdf Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201141603/http://www.usip.org/files/resources/collections/truth_commissions/Chile90-Report/Chile90-Report.pdf |date=February 1, 2013 }} (English translation of the Rettig report, PDF file)</ref> describe the ship as a kind of a floating jail and [[torture chamber]] for political prisoners of the [[Augusto Pinochet]] regime from 1973 to 1980.
