He is an Olympic silver medalist in the [[Gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's artistic team all-around|team competition]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] and a two-time Olympian ([[United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], [[United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]). He also was a member of the silver-medal winning team at the [[2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2003 World Championships]]. Hamm was named to the [[United States at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympic team]], but withdrew from it due to injury.\n\n==Personal life==\nHamm is the son of Sandy and Cecily Hamm. His twin brother, [[Paul Hamm]], is also a gymnast and Olympic medalist. His older sister, Elizabeth (Betsy), is a former member of USA Gymnastics Senior National Team. She competed for the University of Florida, where she became the NCAA\u2019s national balance beam champion in 1998 and was a seven-time All-American. His father was an All-American springboard diver.\n\nIn 2010, Hamm enrolled at [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] to study [[pharmacology]]. In 2014, he successfully completed his studies and earned his [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] degree. He is currently a practicing Pharm.D.<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/pub/morgan-hamm/93/63/428]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHamm competed at the [[2000 Olympics]] in [[Sydney]] at age 17, and the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], alongside his twin brother [[Paul Hamm|Paul]]. At the 2004 Olympics, he won the silver medal with the U.S. team in the team competition. Morgan's contribution to this medal-winning performance was vital as he performed on four of the six apparatus and was the highest scorer for the team on vault and high bar. He also competed in floor and high bar finals, and only a tie-breaker kept him from winning the bronze medal on the latter event. Morgan was also a member of the U.S. team at the [[2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2003 World Championships]] that won a silver medal in the team competition.\n\nIn February 2007, Hamm announced that he would return to competitive gymnastics. He competed at the 2007 Visa National Championships, on floor and pommel horse. He competed at the 2008 National Championships and at the 2008 Olympic Trials.
