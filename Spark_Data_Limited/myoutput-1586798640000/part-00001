Her regular stays in hospital led to a delay in the beginning of her education, eventually starting school when she was six years old. Her family moved to [[Chester]], after a period living in [[Plymouth]], and within a few weeks she contracted [[polio]], causing her to miss another year of school and causing a disability that would remain with her permanently.
