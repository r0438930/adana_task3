The men's tournament was introduced at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] and was transferred permanently to the [[Winter Olympic Games]] program in 1924, in France. The women's tournament was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]].  However, the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref name=\"Benjamin, Daniel\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. Eventually, NHL players were admitted starting in 1998.<ref name=schantz>{{cite web|last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses\u2014from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comit\u00e9 International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=13 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505052232/http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |archive-date=5 May 2013}}</ref> However, the NHL again refused to release its players starting in 2018, citing financial reasons.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1988, the tournament started with a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. In 1992, the playoffs were introduced for the first time since [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]. In 1998, the format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams\u2014Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States\u2014followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.\n\nThe games of the tournament follow the [[Ice hockey rules|rules]] of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), which differ slightly from the [[National Hockey League rules|rules used in the NHL]].\n\nIn the men's tournament, [[Canada at the Winter Olympics|Canada]] was the most successful team of the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. [[Czechoslovakia at the Olympics|Czechoslovakia]], [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] and the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] were also competitive during this period and won multiple medals. Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also counted as the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] for that year. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] first participated in [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] and overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The United States won gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]] and in [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], which included their \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" upset of the Soviet Union. Canada went 50 years without a gold medal, before winning one in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], and following it with back-to-back wins in [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014]]. Other nations to win gold include [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], Sweden in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] and the [[Czech Republic at the Olympics|Czech Republic]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]]. Other medal-winning nations include [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]], [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]] and [[Russia at the Olympics|Russia]].\n\nIn July 1992, the IOC voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; it was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was hesitant to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian]] teams have dominated the event. The United States won the first tournament in 1998 and the most recent in 2018. Canada has won all of the other tournaments (2002\u20132014).\n\n==Inception as an Olympic sport==\n[[Image:Winnipegfalcons.jpg|thumb|left|251px|Representing Canada, the [[Winnipeg Falcons]] (''pictured en route to the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]'') were the first Olympic champions in ice hockey.]]\nThe first Olympic ice hockey tournament took place at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |title=Ice hockey |publisher=International Olympic Committee |access-date=1 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323022731/http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |archive-date=23 March 2009 |df= }}</ref> At the time, organized international ice hockey was still relatively new.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game|year=1899|last=Farrell|first=Arthur|publisher=C.R.

The first period finished tied at 2\u20132, and the Soviets lead 3\u20132 following the second. The U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead during the third and final period, winning the game 4\u20133.

In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]], it would no longer cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that \"In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that\u2019s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel or any of the other expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that \"in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes20160520\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/sports/hockey/olympics-and-nhl-face-off-over-who-pays-to-insure-players.html?_r=0 | title=Olympics and N.H.L.

As to reasons the Board of Governors might be interested in re-evaluating their strongly held views on the subject, the NHLPA \"confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the Clubs\", and that it would not schedule a break for the Olympics in the 2017\u201318 season.<ref name=\"sn-nonhl2018\">{{cite web|title=NHL will not participate in 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-will-not-participate-2018-pyeongchang-olympic-games/|website=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough in the following months the president of the IIHF Ren\u00e9 Fasel tried to convince NHL to change its decision,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/nhl-said-olympic-matter-is-closed-but-iihf-president-fasel-begs-to-differ |title=NHL said Olympic matter is closed, but IIHF president Fasel begs to differ |author=Jared Clinton |date=8 May 2017 |website=The Hockey News |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> in September he stated that there was no chance for participation of NHL players in the Pyeongchang olympic tournament. \"I can say that this is now gone.

The men's tournament was introduced at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] and was transferred permanently to the [[Winter Olympic Games]] program in 1924, in France. The women's tournament was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]].  However, the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref name=\"Benjamin, Daniel\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. Eventually, NHL players were admitted starting in 1998.<ref name=schantz>{{cite web|last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses\u2014from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comit\u00e9 International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=13 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505052232/http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |archive-date=5 May 2013}}</ref> However, the NHL again refused to release its players starting in 2018, citing financial reasons.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1988, the tournament started with a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. In 1992, the playoffs were introduced for the first time since [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]. In 1998, the format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams\u2014Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States\u2014followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.\n\nThe games of the tournament follow the [[Ice hockey rules|rules]] of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), which differ slightly from the [[National Hockey League rules|rules used in the NHL]].\n\nIn the men's tournament, [[Canada at the Winter Olympics|Canada]] was the most successful team of the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. [[Czechoslovakia at the Olympics|Czechoslovakia]], [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] and the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] were also competitive during this period and won multiple medals. Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also counted as the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] for that year. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] first participated in [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] and overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The United States won gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]] and in [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], which included their \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" upset of the Soviet Union. Canada went 50 years without a gold medal, before winning one in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], and following it with back-to-back wins in [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014]]. Other nations to win gold include [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], Sweden in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] and the [[Czech Republic at the Olympics|Czech Republic]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]]. Other medal-winning nations include [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]], [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]] and [[Russia at the Olympics|Russia]].\n\nIn July 1992, the IOC voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; it was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was hesitant to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian]] teams have dominated the event. The United States won the first tournament in 1998 and the most recent in 2018. Canada has won all of the other tournaments (2002\u20132014).\n\n==Inception as an Olympic sport==\n[[Image:Winnipegfalcons.jpg|thumb|left|251px|Representing Canada, the [[Winnipeg Falcons]] (''pictured en route to the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]'') were the first Olympic champions in ice hockey.]]\nThe first Olympic ice hockey tournament took place at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |title=Ice hockey |publisher=International Olympic Committee |access-date=1 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323022731/http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |archive-date=23 March 2009 |df= }}</ref> At the time, organized international ice hockey was still relatively new.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game|year=1899|last=Farrell|first=Arthur|publisher=C.R.

In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]], it would no longer cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that \"In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that\u2019s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel or any of the other expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that \"in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes20160520\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/sports/hockey/olympics-and-nhl-face-off-over-who-pays-to-insure-players.html?_r=0 | title=Olympics and N.H.L.

As to reasons the Board of Governors might be interested in re-evaluating their strongly held views on the subject, the NHLPA \"confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the Clubs\", and that it would not schedule a break for the Olympics in the 2017\u201318 season.<ref name=\"sn-nonhl2018\">{{cite web|title=NHL will not participate in 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-will-not-participate-2018-pyeongchang-olympic-games/|website=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough in the following months the president of the IIHF Ren\u00e9 Fasel tried to convince NHL to change its decision,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/nhl-said-olympic-matter-is-closed-but-iihf-president-fasel-begs-to-differ |title=NHL said Olympic matter is closed, but IIHF president Fasel begs to differ |author=Jared Clinton |date=8 May 2017 |website=The Hockey News |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> in September he stated that there was no chance for participation of NHL players in the Pyeongchang olympic tournament. \"I can say that this is now gone.
