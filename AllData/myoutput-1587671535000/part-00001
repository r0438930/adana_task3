He subsequently went to Germany to obtain a PhD from the [[University of Berlin|Frederick William University of Berlin]] in Economics. While in Germany, Husain was instrumental in bringing out the anthology of arguably the greatest [[Urdu]] poet Mirza Assadullah Khan \"[[Ghalib]]\" (1797\u20131868).<ref>Zakir Saheb by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Zakir Sahab Zatti Yadain, Edited by Dr. Abid Raza Bedar, [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library]], Patna, 1993, p. 165-168</ref>\n\nHe returned to India to head the Jamia Millia Islamia which was facing closure in 1927. He continued in that position for the next twenty-one years providing academic and managerial leadership to an institution that was intimately involved with India's struggle for freedom from the British Rule and experimented with value-based education on the lines advocated by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Hakim Ajmal Khan]].<ref>Zakir Sahab Aur Hakim Ajmal Khan by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Dr. Zakir Husain Khan \u2013 Hayat, Fikr Aur Aman, Edited by Professor Abdul Ghaffar Shakil & Dr. Khaliq Anjum, Karnataka Urdu Academy, Bangalore, 1999. p. 157-174</ref> During this period he continued to engage himself with movements for educational reforms in India and was particularly active in the affairs of his old ''alma mater'' the Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College (now the [[Aligarh Muslim University]]). During this period Hussain emerged as one of the most prominent educational thinkers and practitioners of modern India. His personal sacrifice and untiring efforts to keep the Jamia afloat in very adverse circumstances won him appreciation of even his arch political rivals like [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]].\n\nSoon after India attained independence, Husain agreed to be the Vice chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University which was facing trying times in post partition India because of active involvement of a section of its teachers and students in the movement for creation of [[Pakistan]]. Husain, again, provided leadership during a critical phase of the history of the University at Aligarh from 1948\u20131956. Soon after completing his term as Vice Chancellor he was nominated as a member of the Upper House of Indian Parliament in 1956, a position he vacated in 1957 to become Governor of the State of Bihar.\n\nAfter serving as the Governor of [[Bihar]] from 1957 to 1962, and as the [[List of Vice-Presidents of India|second]] Vice President of India from 1962 to 1967, Husain was elected [[President of India]] on 13 May 1967. In his inaugural speech, he said that the whole of India was his home and all its people were his family.<ref>Zakir Sahib ki Insan Dosti by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Dr. Zakir Husain Hayat wa Khidmat, [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library]], Patna, 2000, page 97-108</ref> During his last days, the issue of nationalization of banks was being hotly debated. The bill, in the end, received presidential consent from [[Mohammad Hidayatullah]], (acting president) on 9 August 1969.<ref>[[Shashi Tharoor]] ''The Great Indian Novel'', page 347</ref>\n\nDuring his presidential tenure, Husain led four state visits to [[Hungary]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[USSR]] and [[Nepal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DETAILS OF MEDIA PERSONS ACCOMPANYING THE PRESIDENT IN HIS/HER VISITS ABROAD SINCE 1947 TO 2012|url=http://rashtrapatisachivalaya.gov.in/media_abroad.pdf|publisher=The President's Secretariat|accessdate=5 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817094728/http://rashtrapatisachivalaya.gov.in/media_abroad.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nHusain died on 3 May 1969, the first Indian President to die in office.

He subsequently went to Germany to obtain a PhD from the [[University of Berlin|Frederick William University of Berlin]] in Economics. While in Germany, Husain was instrumental in bringing out the anthology of arguably the greatest [[Urdu]] poet Mirza Assadullah Khan \"[[Ghalib]]\" (1797\u20131868).<ref>Zakir Saheb by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Zakir Sahab Zatti Yadain, Edited by Dr. Abid Raza Bedar, [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library]], Patna, 1993, p. 165-168</ref>\n\nHe returned to India to head the Jamia Millia Islamia which was facing closure in 1927. He continued in that position for the next twenty-one years providing academic and managerial leadership to an institution that was intimately involved with India's struggle for freedom from the British Rule and experimented with value-based education on the lines advocated by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Hakim Ajmal Khan]].<ref>Zakir Sahab Aur Hakim Ajmal Khan by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Dr. Zakir Husain Khan \u2013 Hayat, Fikr Aur Aman, Edited by Professor Abdul Ghaffar Shakil & Dr. Khaliq Anjum, Karnataka Urdu Academy, Bangalore, 1999. p. 157-174</ref> During this period he continued to engage himself with movements for educational reforms in India and was particularly active in the affairs of his old ''alma mater'' the Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College (now the [[Aligarh Muslim University]]). During this period Hussain emerged as one of the most prominent educational thinkers and practitioners of modern India. His personal sacrifice and untiring efforts to keep the Jamia afloat in very adverse circumstances won him appreciation of even his arch political rivals like [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]].\n\nSoon after India attained independence, Husain agreed to be the Vice chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University which was facing trying times in post partition India because of active involvement of a section of its teachers and students in the movement for creation of [[Pakistan]]. Husain, again, provided leadership during a critical phase of the history of the University at Aligarh from 1948\u20131956. Soon after completing his term as Vice Chancellor he was nominated as a member of the Upper House of Indian Parliament in 1956, a position he vacated in 1957 to become Governor of the State of Bihar.\n\nAfter serving as the Governor of [[Bihar]] from 1957 to 1962, and as the [[List of Vice-Presidents of India|second]] Vice President of India from 1962 to 1967, Husain was elected [[President of India]] on 13 May 1967. In his inaugural speech, he said that the whole of India was his home and all its people were his family.<ref>Zakir Sahib ki Insan Dosti by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Dr. Zakir Husain Hayat wa Khidmat, [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library]], Patna, 2000, page 97-108</ref> During his last days, the issue of nationalization of banks was being hotly debated. The bill, in the end, received presidential consent from [[Mohammad Hidayatullah]], (acting president) on 9 August 1969.<ref>[[Shashi Tharoor]] ''The Great Indian Novel'', page 347</ref>\n\nDuring his presidential tenure, Husain led four state visits to [[Hungary]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[USSR]] and [[Nepal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DETAILS OF MEDIA PERSONS ACCOMPANYING THE PRESIDENT IN HIS/HER VISITS ABROAD SINCE 1947 TO 2012|url=http://rashtrapatisachivalaya.gov.in/media_abroad.pdf|publisher=The President's Secretariat|accessdate=5 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817094728/http://rashtrapatisachivalaya.gov.in/media_abroad.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nHusain died on 3 May 1969, the first Indian President to die in office. He is buried along with his wife (who died some years later) on the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi.\n\nWith the main objective of providing facility for higher education in Ilayangudi, a college was started in his honour in 1970.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.drzhcily.com/ | title=Dr. ZAKIR HUSAIN COLLEGE,Ilayangudi,Sivaganga,TamilNadu,India}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Zakir Husain College of Engineering and Technology|Engineering College]]  of [[Aligarh Muslim University]] is named after him.<ref>http://engg.amu.ac.in/about-zhcet.html</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"230px\" heights=\"280px\">\nFile:President Zakir Husain 1998 stamp of India.jpg|President Husain on a 1998 stamp of India\nFile:Building 18 jamia.JPG|Zakir Husain's Mausoleum in Jamia Millia Islamia.\nFile:Building 23 jamia.JPG|The grave of Zakir Husain Khan.\nFile:Building 19 jamia.JPG|Interior view of the Mausoleum of Zakir Husain and his wife, Shah Jahan Begum.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\u2191 Manjapra, Kris (2014).
