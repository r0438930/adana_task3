When the final choice comes down to Peter and another employee, Peter blacks out from the stress. After he awakens in the hospital, Dr. Hartman connects him with a \"[[yacht rock]]\" music collection to help him relax. When the guys get hooked on the music as well, they learn of an upcoming Yacht Rock Cruise and decide to all go along. While attempting to board, Brian finds himself in a dog crate and stored beneath deck. On board, the rest of the family and Peter's friends rub shoulders with numerous stars. But when the ship's captain gets distracted hanging out with Peter, he leaves the bridge unattended as a rogue wave capsizes the ship.

When the final choice comes down to Peter and another employee, Peter blacks out from the stress. After he awakens in the hospital, Dr. Hartman connects him with a \"[[yacht rock]]\" music collection to help him relax. When the guys get hooked on the music as well, they learn of an upcoming Yacht Rock Cruise and decide to all go along. While attempting to board, Brian finds himself in a dog crate and stored beneath deck. On board, the rest of the family and Peter's friends rub shoulders with numerous stars. But when the ship's captain gets distracted hanging out with Peter, he leaves the bridge unattended as a rogue wave capsizes the ship. Struggling to survive, everyone has to make their way towards the bottom of the ship where the hull is the thinnest. When they finally reach their goal and meet up with Brian in the process, they realize that they have no tools to cut through the hull.
