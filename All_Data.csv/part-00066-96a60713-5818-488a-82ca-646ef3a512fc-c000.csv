(1970). The Mat(t)hews family: an anthology of Mathews lineages. The University of Wisconsin&nbsp;— Madison</ref> Otey attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  Upon his graduation in 1820, he was appointed as a [[tutor]] in Greek and Latin at the school.  Following his marriage to Elizabeth Davis Pannill, daughter of William Pannill and Martha Mitchell of [[Petersburg, Virginia]] in 1821, he moved to [[Maury County, Tennessee]] and became principal of a boys' school.

On returning to [[North Carolina]] to head the academy at Warrenton, Otey was baptized and confirmed in [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]]. He became a [[deacon]] in 1825 and priest in 1827.  He then returned to Franklin and organized Tennessee's first Episcopal church there in the [[Freemasonry|Masonic Lodge]].  He established several other churches and on July 1, 1829, established the Episcopal [[Diocese]] of Tennessee at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

Otey was elected the first [[bishop]] in June 1833 and was consecrated at Christ Church, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], the following January.  Following his election, Otey also took charge of the Diocese of [[Mississippi]] and was missionary bishop for [[Arkansas]] and the [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]).  He traveled for months at a time across the extensive region, establishing new churches and preaching the [[Gospel]].

Otey was fervently interested in Christian education and helped organize schools at [[Ashwood, Tennessee|Ashwood]], [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]] and [[Columbia, Tennessee]].  His dreams for a \"Literary and Theological Seminary\" for the region were realized when the [[University of the South]] at [[Sewanee: The University of the South|Sewanee]] was established in 1857.

Otey lived at \"Mercer Hall\" in Columbia from 1835 to 1852, when he relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where in 1863 he died.<ref name=\"weeklystandardobit\">{{cite news |title=Death of Bishop Otey. |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112299562/?terms=%22James%2BHervey%2BOtey%22 |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |work=The Weekly Standard |date=May 20, 1863|location=Raleigh, North Carolina|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-access=registration }}</ref> After the Civil War, he was re-buried at [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Columbia, Tennessee)|St. John's Church]] at [[Ashwood, Tennessee|Ashwood]] in Maury County.

==History==
Mall construction began in 1976 and Sandusky Mall opened in 1977. Its original anchors included [[JCPenney]], [[Elder-Beerman]], [[The May Department Stores Company]] (simply the May Co.), and [[Montgomery Ward]] (later [[Sears]] in 1986). The outdoor section, [[Child World]] closed in 1992 and later converted to [[OfficeMax]] in 1994, then closed in 2005. It was converted to K&K Home Furnishings in 2006, then closed in 2014. It later converted to a Planet Fitness in 2015.

The May Co. rebranded their store at the Sandusky Mall as [[Kaufmann's]] in the mid-1990s. In 2006, the store was converted to [[Macy's]], when May Department Stores Company and Federated Department Stores merged into Macy's, Inc. [[Borders Group|Borders]] opened in 2005.  [[T. J. Maxx|TJ Maxx]] was added in 2009. Borders closed in 2011. A few months later, it was replaced by [[Books-A-Million|BAM!]].

==History==
Mall construction began in 1976 and Sandusky Mall opened in 1977. Its original anchors included [[JCPenney]], [[Elder-Beerman]], [[The May Department Stores Company]] (simply the May Co.), and [[Montgomery Ward]] (later [[Sears]] in 1986). The outdoor section, [[Child World]] closed in 1992 and later converted to [[OfficeMax]] in 1994, then closed in 2005. It was converted to K&K Home Furnishings in 2006, then closed in 2014. It later converted to a Planet Fitness in 2015.

The May Co. rebranded their store at the Sandusky Mall as [[Kaufmann's]] in the mid-1990s. In 2006, the store was converted to [[Macy's]], when May Department Stores Company and Federated Department Stores merged into Macy's, Inc. [[Borders Group|Borders]] opened in 2005.  [[T. J. Maxx|TJ Maxx]] was added in 2009. Borders closed in 2011. A few months later, it was replaced by [[Books-A-Million|BAM!]].

link,safe,Unoquha,"'''Sir William Keith of Delny''' (d. c. 1605) was a Scottish courtier and keeper of the Royal Wardrobe.

William Keith was a son of Andrew Keith, laird of [[Ravenscraig Castle, Aberdeenshire|Ravenscraig]], Aberdeenshire, and only distantly related to the Earls Marischal. In 1579 he was made a valet in the household of [[James VI of Scotland]].<ref>Miles Kerr-Peterson, [https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/inr.2016.0124 'Sir William Keith of Delny', ''Innes Review'' 67:2 (2016), pp. 138-158], at pp. 140, 142.</ref>

King James granted William Keith lands in [[Delny]] in Ross in 1586 for good service as Master of the Wardrobe.

In 1587 Delny was sent to England with [[Robert Melville, 1st Lord Melville|Sir Robert Melville]] of Murdocairny and the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Gray]] to intercede for the life of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Their speeches and manner of mediation was said to have been counter-productive.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), p. 564.</ref>

In July 1589 it was expected that Delny and the English courtier [[Roger Aston]] would lose their places at court because they had been supporters of the Master of Gray, who was now out of favour. Their opponents, the followers of the [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly|Earl of Huntly]] and [[John Seton, Lord Barns|Sir John Seton]] of [[Barnes Castle|Barnes]] called Aston, Keith, and the [[Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre|Lord Privy Seal]], \"Queen Elizabeth's pensioners\".<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915). p. 448-9, 452, 453: ''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (1936), pp. 127-9.</ref>

Delny was in the retinue which accompanied King [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] to [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] to collect his future Queen, [[Anne of Denmark]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 170-1.</ref> During the trip, the king sacked him as keeper of the wardrobe, allegedly for appearing in richer clothing than himself, and appointed [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar|Sir George Home]] in his stead.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 276, 478.</ref> In the days before Delny lost his place, a correspondent of [[Francis Walsingham]] wrote on 5 April 1590 that the Chancellor [[John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane|John Maitland of Thirlestane]] aimed to discredit the Earl Marischal and Delny, but Delny was \"wonderfully well beloved\" and had \"ever worn his sword on the right and true side\".<ref>''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 3 (London, 1889), p. 403.</ref>

The English ambassador [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] noted in July 1591 that Delny \"lay in bed\" once or twice at [[Morham|Morham Tower]] with the owner, the rebellious [[Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 551.</ref>

Delny regained royal favour in June 1592 apparently by the intervention of Anne of Denmark in the controversy between the Earl Marischal and the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Lord Chancellor]], [[John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane|John Maitland of Thirlestane]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 687.</ref>

Delny became an associate of [[Ludovick Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox]]. On 6 May 1593 the Duke and 15 friends subscribed to a frivolous legal document swearing to abstain from wearing gold and silver trimmings on their clothes for a year, and defaulters were to pay for a banquet for all of them at John Killoch's house in Edinburgh. This \"[[Passementerie|passement]] bond\" was in part inspired by cheap counterfeit gold and silver thread used in \"passements great or small, plain or ''à jour'', bissets, lilykins, cordons, and fringes\" which quickly discoloured. The signatories included; [[Alexander Home, 1st Lord Home|Lord Home]], the [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1558–1634)|Earl of Mar]], [[Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie|Lord Spynie]], the [[Thomas Lyon (of Auldbar)|Master of Glamis]], [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie|Sir Thomas Erskine]], [[Walter Stewart of Blantyre]], and [[George Home, Earl of Dunbar|Sir George Home]].<ref>''Historical Manuscripts Commission, Appendix 4th Report: Mrs. Erskine Murray'' (London, 1874), p. 527.</ref>

In 1594 Delny carried invitations to the [[Masque at the baptism of Prince Henry|baptism and tournament]] at [[Stirling Castle]] for [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] to the Dutch Republic. Sir [[James Melville of Halhill]] said he was not suited the role because he could not speak French, Latin, or Flemish.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill'' (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 411.</ref>

In April 1597 James VI asked Delny to correspond with Venice, to bolster support for his accession to the throne of England.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 507.</ref>

'''Blankenhain''' is a [[town]] in the [[Weimarer Land]] district, in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]]. It is {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=in}} south of [[Weimar]].

==History==
Until the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Blankenhain had been a part of the [[Saxe-Weimar|Duchy of Saxe-Weimar]]. After the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]]'s defeat at [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|Jena and Auerstedt]], [[Napoleon]] attached the Lordship of Blankenhain to the [[Principality of Erfurt]], directly subordinate to himself as an \"imperial state domain\" ({{lang-fr|domaine réservé à l'empereur}}), separate from the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] (nominally a French [[protectorate]] set up to replace the now-defunct Holy Roman Empire), which the surrounding [[Thuringia]]n states had joined.<ref name=\"Erfurt Chronik 1806–1814\">{{cite web |url=http://www.erfurt.de/ef/de/erleben/entdecken/geschichte/chronik/111885.html |title=1806–1814: Erfurt unter französischer Besetzung |trans-title=1806–1814: Erfurt under French occupation |publisher=Erfurt Stadtverwaltung [Erfurt city administration] |language=German |date= |accessdate=2 January 2016 }}</ref>

After the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Erfurt]] was restored to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] on 21 June 1815, becoming the capital of one of the three districts (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'') of the new [[Province of Saxony]], but some southern and eastern parts of Erfurter lands joined Blankenhain in being transferred to the newly promoted [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] the following September.<ref name=\"Erfurt Chronik 1814–1850\">{{cite web |url=http://www.erfurt.de/ef/de/erleben/entdecken/geschichte/chronik/111888.html |title=1814–1850: Erfurt im preußischen Staat |trans-title=1814–1850: Erfurt in the Prussian state |publisher=Erfurt Stadtverwaltung [Erfurt city administration] |language=German |date= |accessdate=3 January 2016 }}</ref>

Blankenhain remained within Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach through the era of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918) and into the [[Weimar Republic]] until it merged with 7 of the 8 other [[Saxon duchies]] to form the [[Thuringia|Free State of Thuringia]] ({{lang-de|Freistaat Thüringen}}). After being controlled briefly by the [[United States]], from July 1945, the state of Thuringia came under the [[Soviet occupation zone]], and was expanded to include parts of Prussian Saxony, including [[Erfurt]], which became the new capital of Thuringia. In 1952, [[East Germany]] dissolved its states, and created districts (''{{lang|de|[[Administrative divisions of East Germany|Bezirke]]}}'') instead, with Blankenhain sitting within the rural district {{lang|de|Kreis Weimar-Land}}, in {{lang|de|[[Bezirk Erfurt]]}}. The State of Thuringia was restored with slightly altered borders during [[German reunification]] in 1990.

After the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Erfurt]] was restored to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] on 21 June 1815, becoming the capital of one of the three districts (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'') of the new [[Province of Saxony]], but some southern and eastern parts of Erfurter lands joined Blankenhain in being transferred to the newly promoted [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] the following September.<ref name=\"Erfurt Chronik 1814–1850\">{{cite web |url=http://www.erfurt.de/ef/de/erleben/entdecken/geschichte/chronik/111888.html |title=1814–1850: Erfurt im preußischen Staat |trans-title=1814–1850: Erfurt in the Prussian state |publisher=Erfurt Stadtverwaltung [Erfurt city administration] |language=German |date= |accessdate=3 January 2016 }}</ref>

Blankenhain remained within Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach through the era of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918) and into the [[Weimar Republic]] until it merged with 7 of the 8 other [[Saxon duchies]] to form the [[Thuringia|Free State of Thuringia]] ({{lang-de|Freistaat Thüringen}}). After being controlled briefly by the [[United States]], from July 1945, the state of Thuringia came under the [[Soviet occupation zone]], and was expanded to include parts of Prussian Saxony, including [[Erfurt]], which became the new capital of Thuringia. In 1952, [[East Germany]] dissolved its states, and created districts (''{{lang|de|[[Administrative divisions of East Germany|Bezirke]]}}'') instead, with Blankenhain sitting within the rural district {{lang|de|Kreis Weimar-Land}}, in {{lang|de|[[Bezirk Erfurt]]}}. The State of Thuringia was restored with slightly altered borders during [[German reunification]] in 1990.

'''Radiation exposure''' is a measure of the ionization of [[air]] due to [[ionizing radiation]] from [[photon]]s; that is, [[gamma ray]]s and [[X-ray]]s.<ref> ''Knoll'', p. 56</ref> It is defined as the [[electric charge]] freed by such radiation in a specified volume of air divided by the [[mass]] of that air. 

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of exposure is the [[Coulomb (unit)|coulomb]] per [[kilogram]] (C/kg), which has largely replaced the [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] (R).<ref>''Holmes-Siedle and Adams'', p. 4</ref> One roentgen equals {{val|0.000258|u=C|up=kg}}; an exposure of one coulomb per kilogram is equivalent to 3876 roentgens.

As a measure of [[radiation damage]] '''exposure''' has been superseded by the concept of [[absorbed dose]] which takes into account the absorption characteristic of the target material. 

==Exposure conversion to absorbed dose==
{{main|Absorbed dose}}
Dose is the measure of energy per unit mass deposited by ionizing radiation. For a given radiation field, the absorbed dose will depend on the type of matter which absorbs the radiation. For instance, for an exposure of 1 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] by gamma rays with an energy of 1 [[MeV]], the dose in air will be 0.877 [[rad (unit)|rad]], the dose in [[water]] will be 0.975 rad, the dose in [[silicon]] will be 0.877 rad, and the dose in averaged [[tissue (biology)|human tissue]] will be 1 rad. A table giving the exposure to dose conversion for these four materials for a variety of gamma ray energies can be found in the reference.<ref>Carron, p. 141</ref>

==Exposure rate constant==
The gamma ray field can be characterized by the exposure rate (in units of, for instance, [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] per hour). For a point source, the exposure rate will be linearly proportional to the source's [[radioactivity]] and inversely proportional to the square of the distance,<ref>Knoll, p. 57</ref>

:F = Γ×α / r<sup>2</sup>

where ''F'' is the exposure rate, ''r'' is the distance, ''α'' is the source activity, and ''Γ'' is the exposure rate constant, which is dependent on the particular [[radionuclide]] used as the gamma ray source.

Below is a table of exposure rate constants for various radionuclides. They give the exposure rate in roentgens per hour for a given activity in [[curie (unit)|millicuries]] at a distance in [[centimeter]]s.<ref>[http://web.stanford.edu/dept/EHS/prod/researchlab/radlaser/RSDS.html Stanford University Environmental Health and Safety, radionuclide safety data sheets]</ref>

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of exposure is the [[Coulomb (unit)|coulomb]] per [[kilogram]] (C/kg), which has largely replaced the [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] (R).<ref>''Holmes-Siedle and Adams'', p. 4</ref> One roentgen equals {{val|0.000258|u=C|up=kg}}; an exposure of one coulomb per kilogram is equivalent to 3876 roentgens.

As a measure of [[radiation damage]] '''exposure''' has been superseded by the concept of [[absorbed dose]] which takes into account the absorption characteristic of the target material. 

==Exposure conversion to absorbed dose==
{{main|Absorbed dose}}
Dose is the measure of energy per unit mass deposited by ionizing radiation. For a given radiation field, the absorbed dose will depend on the type of matter which absorbs the radiation. For instance, for an exposure of 1 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] by gamma rays with an energy of 1 [[MeV]], the dose in air will be 0.877 [[rad (unit)|rad]], the dose in [[water]] will be 0.975 rad, the dose in [[silicon]] will be 0.877 rad, and the dose in averaged [[tissue (biology)|human tissue]] will be 1 rad. A table giving the exposure to dose conversion for these four materials for a variety of gamma ray energies can be found in the reference.<ref>Carron, p. 141</ref>

==Exposure rate constant==
The gamma ray field can be characterized by the exposure rate (in units of, for instance, [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] per hour). For a point source, the exposure rate will be linearly proportional to the source's [[radioactivity]] and inversely proportional to the square of the distance,<ref>Knoll, p. 57</ref>

:F = Γ×α / r<sup>2</sup>

where ''F'' is the exposure rate, ''r'' is the distance, ''α'' is the source activity, and ''Γ'' is the exposure rate constant, which is dependent on the particular [[radionuclide]] used as the gamma ray source.

Below is a table of exposure rate constants for various radionuclides. They give the exposure rate in roentgens per hour for a given activity in [[curie (unit)|millicuries]] at a distance in [[centimeter]]s.<ref>[http://web.stanford.edu/dept/EHS/prod/researchlab/radlaser/RSDS.html Stanford University Environmental Health and Safety, radionuclide safety data sheets]</ref>

'''Frank Clifford Last''' (13 December 1918 – 1991)<ref>https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?r=140467824:2202&d=bmd_1586250123</ref><ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8500049/bio?ref_=nm_dyk_trv_sm#trivia</ref> was an [[English people|English]] [[sculptor]], the son of [[Nella Last]], author of a [[World War II]] diary on which the TV film ''[[Housewife, 49]]'' was based.

== Early life ==
Clifford Last was the younger son of Nella and William Last, [[Shop fitting|shopfitter]] in [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[England]]. He had an older brother, Arthur. After war service in which he lost his closest companion and was injured himself, he trained in art and emigrated to [[Australia]] in 1947, becoming a noted sculptor. Some of his works are displayed in the National Gallery of Australia and the [[Ballarat Fine Art Gallery]] in the [[States and territories of Australia|State]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]

== Centre Five group ==
Last was a foundation member of Centre Five, a group formed in 1960 to promote contemporary abstract sculpture in Australia. The group, originally called Centre Four, was founded in 1953 by [[Hungary|Hungarian-born]] Julius Kane, featuring Last, [[Norma Redpath]] and [[Germany|German-born]] [[Inge King]]. Centre Five was a splinter group of the Victorian Sculptors' Society comprising members Clifford Last, [[Inge King]], Vincas Jomantas, [[Teisutis Zikaras]], Julius Kane and [[Lenton Parr]]. They shared common characteristics in their style and felt that exhibiting together would be to their advantage. Their aim was to foster the understanding of modern sculpture among Australian architects and the public.<ref>{{Cite news

The project was problematic in that they had resigned from the Victorian Sculptors' Society and in effect set themselves up as competition. The result was a severe split in the very small sculpture world of the time, the repercussions of which are still felt today. Due to the nature of the split, the Society – formed to promote the work of members – missed out on official consideration.<ref>{{Cite web

Materials with which Last worked included bronze, slate, wood and aluminium. Using wood as his favoured medium, Last furthered his studies at the [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]]. After he spent fourteen months back in England in 1950–1951, Last’s work took on a more geometrical form. He explored the use of shapes that he believed demonstrated the emotions existing in family groups and then explored subjects such as [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[Trinity]] through the manipulation of religious references and symbols.

Last preferred the work to speak for itself and, unless asked, opted not to go into detail.<ref>{{Cite web

He carved wood such as [[Eucalyptus marginata|Jarrah]], using, for example, the [[cruciform]] shape in relativistic relationships which left interpretation open. One such form could refer to animals, plants, icons, people or groups.

A fine example of his large-scale bronzes entitled \"Family\" was commissioned by the [[Government of Australia]], in 1971, as an official gift to the international organization, [[Asian Development Bank]], which displays it in its headquarters in [[Manila]].

==Personal life==
Last's mother Nella died in 1968 and his father less than one year later in 1969. Last remained in Australia and died there in 1991.

A fine example of his large-scale bronzes entitled \"Family\" was commissioned by the [[Government of Australia]], in 1971, as an official gift to the international organization, [[Asian Development Bank]], which displays it in its headquarters in [[Manila]].

'''{{Lang|de|Laubach}}''' is a town of approximately 10,000 people in the {{Lang|de|[[Gießen (region)|Gießen]]}} region of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. Laubach is known as a ''{{Lang|de|Luftkurort}}'', a climatic health resort. It is situated {{convert|23|km|mi}} east of Gießen. Surrounding {{Lang|de|Laubach}} are the towns of {{Lang|de|[[Hungen]]}}, {{Lang|de|[[Grünberg, Hesse|Grünberg]]}}, {{Lang|de|[[Schotten]]}} and {{Lang|de|Lich}}.

==Points of interest==
[[File:Laubach castle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Schloss Laubach|Laubach Castle]]]]
The dense Laubach Woods spread into the foothills of the [[Vogelsberg Mountains]]. With its many historic and colorful half-timbered (''{{Lang|de|fachwerk}}'') buildings, {{Lang|de|Laubach}} is an area of interest to tourists.

The main point of attraction is the castle, which is still owned by the count of [[Solms-Laubach]]. It was built in the thirteenth century and expanded over the years. The [[Schloss Laubach|Solms castle]] has one of the largest private libraries in Europe, with over 120,000 titles. An original Gutenberg Bible, on display in the Johann Gutenberg Museum in Mainz, came from this private collection. The castle grounds include a huge park with a swan lake, open to the public.

The city's Evangelical Lutheran Church, formerly named St.&nbsp;Maria, has a Baroque organ. The oldest part of the church was built in the twelfth century.  It was renovated in the eighteenth century.

The former district courthouse (''{{Lang|de|Amtsgericht}}''), the city hall, and the Heimat Museum are together on the main street of Friedrichstrasse. The courthouse is now a residence for senior citizens.

The {{Lang|de|Heimat Museum–Fridericianum}} is the local history museum, originally built near the town of {{Lang|de|Gonterskirchen}} in 1750 by Count August Solms-Laubach.  The building was moved to its present location in 1832 and served as a school before it became a museum.  The museum contains a permanent exhibit of the diary of city resident [[Friedrich Kellner]].

==Notable residents==
* [[Friedrich Kellner]] (1885–1970) - Laubach's chief justice inspector during World War II, he wrote a 10-volume diary about the misdeeds of the Nazis, later published as a book, ''[[My Opposition]]'' ({{lang-de|Mein Widerstand}}). He became deputy mayor, first town councilman, and chairman of the regional branch of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]. A Canadian documentary about Kellner was filmed on location in Laubach.
* Felix Klipstein (1880–1941), artist - grew up in {{Lang|de|Laubach}} and Belgium, spending his academic years in France and Spain, where he did special studies in Velázquez.  In 1909 he settled in Laubach with his wife, the writer Edith Blass.
* Friedel Münch (1927–2014), head of [[Münch (motorcycles)|Münch Motorcycle Works]]
* Philipp Erasmus Reich (1717–1787), bookseller and publisher
* Georg Friedrich Solms-Laubach (1899–1969)

'''HMS ''G6''''' was a [[British G-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War I.

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

'''HMS ''G6''''' was a [[British G-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War I.

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam.

The '''Egyptian Calvary Corps''' was the mounted corps of the Egyptian Army

== Establishment ==
[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali of Egypt and the Sudan]] created a strong standing army with modern weaponry, tactics, and training. As Ali's army came back from the [[Greek War of Independence]], his son, the commander of the army, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], suggested the creation of an Egyptian Cavalry Corps. In 1828, the Egyptian Cavalry Corps was established and a specialized school was founded in [[Giza]] to train Cavalry officers.
In 1839, the Cavalry Corps had a total of 15 Regiments scattered all over Egypt. These were:

* 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (Latakia)

* 2nd Guards Cavalry Regiment (Besan)

* 1st Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)

* 2nd Cavalry Regiment (Zanba)

* 3rd Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)

* 4th Cavalry Regiment (Adana)

* 5th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)

* 6th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)

* 7th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)

* 8th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)

* 9th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria )

* 10th Cavalry Regiment (Acre)

* 11th Cavalry Regiment (Kilis)

* 12th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)

* 13th Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)

=== The Cavalry School in Giza ===
Clot Bey mentioned in his book{{Which|date=April 2020}} that the formation of the cavalry teams in the Egyptian army did not start according to the new system until after the army's return from the Greek War of Independence, because, during this war, Ibrahim Pasha had witnessed the good [[France|French]] cavalry system and realized the importance of cavalry organization. After his return to Egypt, he began to form cavalry teams based on the European system, and a number of European teachers prepared for this purpose.

The Military Academy of Cavalry was established in [[Giza]] at [[Mourad Bey Palace]], which was turned into a cavalry barracks. The school was organized by [[Monsieu Varane]], who was from the officers of the Napoleonic Empire including Yawar, Marshal Gouvion Sancer, and his subordinate in-training officers, who were learning about cavalry maneuvers and infantry movements. 

The school used to follow the system of the [[Somme Military School]] in France, except for some minor modifications that were required by the local conditions.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2020}} Young Egyptians and Turks graduated as officers of the Cavalry Corps.

[[Auguste de Marmont|Marshal Marmon]] visited this school in 1834, and there were 360 trainees in it, and he admired it and wrote about it on his journey:<blockquote>\"When I saw these students in the field carrying out maneuvers, I imagined that I was in front of a line of the finest verses in our horses. While the school was lacking to reach a degree of perfection, some lessons in language, drawing, and so forth, but there is no dispute that it is from the side of organizing the cavalry teams, it lacks nothing, The students are good at riding horses, the maneuvers they perform take place with lightness, accuracy and wisdom, their system and their best regret, and their morale is fine, they are soldiers with all the meanings of the word, and the trumpet bearers perform their work with perfection. \"</blockquote>

== Post Anglo-Egyptian War ==
After the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian war]], the Egyptian Military High Command was totally controlled by [[British Empire|British]] generals and was downsized until it totally became a homeland defence.
The Cavalry Corps was split into [[Battalion|Battalions]] instead of [[Regiment|Regiments]]. Their main engagement after the war was the long-running [[Mahdist War]]

== World War I ==
In [[World War I]] it was estimated that around one million Egyptians fought for the Entente on many different fronts including 100,000 of them on European Fronts (Greece, Italy, France and Belgium). Most of the Cavalry participation were on the [[North Africa|North African]] and Arabian fronts.

== Modernization ==
{{Main|Egyptian Armored Corps}}
A few years after World War I, Egypt ended the British Protectorate and a Kingdom under the rule of [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] was established. Fuad's administration began to modernize everything in the country including economy, military, education, etc. The military modernization was focused on mechanization, building new military schools and mobilizing more men & reestablishing units. In 1928, the corps' name was changed to ''Royal Egyptian Cavalry Corps.'' The mechanization process went totally on the [[Egyptian Cavalry Corps]] where many of its units (except the Royal Guards) replaced its traditional horse formations with Armored Vehicles and Tanks that by the late 1930s all of the Corps was mechanized.

The school was organized by [[Monsieu Varane]], who was from the officers of the Napoleonic Empire including Yawar, Marshal Gouvion Sancer, and his subordinate in-training officers, who were learning about cavalry maneuvers and infantry movements. 

The school used to follow the system of the [[Somme Military School]] in France, except for some minor modifications that were required by the local conditions.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2020}} Young Egyptians and Turks graduated as officers of the Cavalry Corps.

[[Auguste de Marmont|Marshal Marmon]] visited this school in 1834, and there were 360 trainees in it, and he admired it and wrote about it on his journey:<blockquote>\"When I saw these students in the field carrying out maneuvers, I imagined that I was in front of a line of the finest verses in our horses. While the school was lacking to reach a degree of perfection, some lessons in language, drawing, and so forth, but there is no dispute that it is from the side of organizing the cavalry teams, it lacks nothing, The students are good at riding horses, the maneuvers they perform take place with lightness, accuracy and wisdom, their system and their best regret, and their morale is fine, they are soldiers with all the meanings of the word, and the trumpet bearers perform their work with perfection. \"</blockquote>

== Post Anglo-Egyptian War ==
After the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian war]], the Egyptian Military High Command was totally controlled by [[British Empire|British]] generals and was downsized until it totally became a homeland defence.
The Cavalry Corps was split into [[Battalion|Battalions]] instead of [[Regiment|Regiments]]. Their main engagement after the war was the long-running [[Mahdist War]]

== World War I ==
In [[World War I]] it was estimated that around one million Egyptians fought for the Entente on many different fronts including 100,000 of them on European Fronts (Greece, Italy, France and Belgium). Most of the Cavalry participation were on the [[North Africa|North African]] and Arabian fronts.

== Modernization ==
{{Main|Egyptian Armored Corps}}
A few years after World War I, Egypt ended the British Protectorate and a Kingdom under the rule of [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] was established. Fuad's administration began to modernize everything in the country including economy, military, education, etc. The military modernization was focused on mechanization, building new military schools and mobilizing more men & reestablishing units. In 1928, the corps' name was changed to ''Royal Egyptian Cavalry Corps.'' The mechanization process went totally on the [[Egyptian Cavalry Corps]] where many of its units (except the Royal Guards) replaced its traditional horse formations with Armored Vehicles and Tanks that by the late 1930s all of the Corps was mechanized.

'''Charles Mason Hovey''' (October 26, 1810, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] - 1887) was an American nurseryman, seed merchant, journalist and author of horticultural books best known for his two-volume large [[quarto]], ''The Fruits of America''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/66669#page/17/mode/1up |title=''The Fruits of America''|publisher=Biodiversitylibrary.org|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  published between 1848 and 1856 and containing some 100 [[chromolithographs]] by [[William Sharp (lithographer)|William Sharp]], the British-born lithographer and artist, with an extremely rare third volume which was partly published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.donaldheald.com/books/Botany/books_text_01.php?cat=Botany&pg=8 |title=Donald Heald Original Antique Books Prints and Maps - Books |publisher=Donaldheald.com |accessdate=2012-07-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419032013/http://www.donaldheald.com/books/Botany/books_text_01.php?cat=Botany |archivedate=2012-04-19 }}</ref>

Hovey was an honorary member of the Royal Societies of London and of Edinburgh.

==Biography==
Charles was the sixth of seven children born to Sarah Stone Hovey and Phineas Brown Hovey, who ran a grocery store at the comer of Main and Brookline Streets, and dealt in the sale and rental of property in Cambridge. In 1832 Hovey and his brother Phineas started ''Hovey & Co.'', a seed store and nursery in Cambridge, the nursery eventually growing to 40 acres in extent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/How-to-Trademark-a-Fruit.html# |title=Smithsonian.com |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref> Hovey set out to publish a magazine that would appeal to gardeners and showcase the various American fruits of interest. He became the editor of the ''Magazine of Horticulture'' published between 1835 and 1868, founded as ''The American Gardener's Magazine'' with a name change in 1837. It enjoyed a longer life than any other American horticultural journal and was modelled on [[John Claudius Loudon]]'s ''Gardener's Magazine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/158.html |title='&#39;History of Horticulture'&#39; |publisher=Hcs.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>

Hovey collected cultivars of pear, apple, plum and grape, also cultivating florist and ornamental plants, with a particular fondness for ''[[Camellia]]'' and ''[[Chrysanthemum]]''. He exhibited regularly with the [[Massachusetts Horticultural Society]] and was its president for four years. He was responsible for producing the ''Hovey Strawberry'' in 1836, regarded as the foundation of the [[New England]] strawberry industry, and grown on a large scale until about 1890. Hovey wrote a seminal article \"''Some Remarks upon the Production of new varieties of Strawberries from Seeds''\" that was published July 1837 in his ''Magazine of Horticulture'', and in which he gave detailed instructions for producing hybrids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/pgdic/Strawberry/book/boktwel.htm |title=12 Notable Early Strawberry Breeders of America |publisher=Nal.usda.gov |accessdate=2012-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702173338/http://www.nal.usda.gov/pgdic/Strawberry/book/boktwel.htm |archive-date=2012-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Hovey was a great champion of open spaces and wrote in the ''Magazine of Horticulture'': \"We need not enlarge upon the importance of public parks, certainly, if they were more numerous they would prevent the useless expenditure of money for lunatic hospitals. What the busy people of the city need is pure air, the sight of green trees, the smell of the fresh turf – extensive grounds, where they can enjoy the pleasures of the country, and find relief from the busy hours engaged in the turmoil of trade.\" Philadelphia nurseryman, botanist and author, [[Thomas Meehan (botanist)|Thomas Meehan]], credited Hovey with the growth of American horticulture.

Today, the only visible evidence of Hovey's nursery are the names given to the short streets within the subdivisions created on parts of his land in the 1890s: Hovey, Myrtle, Magnolia and Camellia Avenues.  These now compose a quiet little neighborhood of one, two and three-family homes, about a mile east of Harvard Yard, between Kirkland and Cambridge Streets, near the Cambridge/Somerville city line.

'''Thomas Henry Blythe''' (1822 - 1883), born '''Thomas Williams''' in Mold, Flintshire, [[Wales]],<ref>Thomas Blythe's birthname is disputed.

Blythe is most remembered for purchasing, developing, and subdividing the [[Palo Verde Valley]] in southern California, and obtaining primary rights to Colorado River water to irrigate the valley.<ref name=\"B&B1\"/>  The city of [[Blythe, California]], the largest city in the Palo Verde Valley, is named for him.

[[File:Monkeybread.jpg|thumb|Monkey bread having been pulled apart with a fork]]
The origin of the term \"monkey bread\" comes from the pastry being a finger food; the consumer would pick apart the bread as a [[monkey]] would. Hey Myrt, Like I said This is American! We’re KNOWN for rewriting history! <ref>{{cite web
 | url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodbreads.html#monkeybread
 | title=The Food Timeline: history notes
 | accessdate= October 4, 2008}}</ref>

==Origins==
What most people know as monkey bread today in the United States is actually the Hungarian dessert ''[[arany galuska]]'' (\"golden dumpling\"). Dating back to the 1880s in Hungarian literature, Hungarian immigrants brought this dish with them when they immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country's food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

In 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for ''arany galuska'', which they referred to as \"Hungarian Coffee Cake\". As it became more popular in America, ''arany galuska'' came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. \"Monkey bread\" soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert.<ref name=\"Marks2010\">{{cite book|author=Gil Marks|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC|date=17 November 2010|publisher=HMH|isbn=978-0-544-18631-6}}</ref>

Recipes for the bread first appeared in American [[women's magazine]]s and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

==Preparation==
The bread is made with pieces of sweet yeast dough (often frozen), which are baked in a cake pan at high heat after first being individually covered in melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and chopped pecans.<ref>{{cite web

Dating back to the 1880s in Hungarian literature, Hungarian immigrants brought this dish with them when they immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country's food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

In 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for ''arany galuska'', which they referred to as \"Hungarian Coffee Cake\". As it became more popular in America, ''arany galuska'' came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. \"Monkey bread\" soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert.<ref name=\"Marks2010\">{{cite book|author=Gil Marks|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC|date=17 November 2010|publisher=HMH|isbn=978-0-544-18631-6}}</ref>

Recipes for the bread first appeared in American [[women's magazine]]s and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

==Preparation==
The bread is made with pieces of sweet yeast dough (often frozen), which are baked in a cake pan at high heat after first being individually covered in melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and chopped pecans.<ref>{{cite web

Spaceport America was built with [[U.S. state|State]] money and [[Bond (finance)|bond]] funding provided by county debt.

which will be partially repaid by locally generated gross receipts tax revenues.  
The state of [[New Mexico]] has privatized the operations of Spaceport America; the spaceport will be operated by [[Virgin Galactic]], a component of the [[Virgin Group]] of global companies operated by Sir [[Richard Branson]].  While the Spaceport Authority will exercise public-sector oversight, Virgin Galactic will be the \"anchor tenant\" of the spaceport.<ref name=\"Phase I\"/>

==Operational status==

Phase II, the visitor center and actual liftoff pad, remained unbuilt as of March 2012.<ref name=\"Phase I\"/>

==Current events==
The current status of Virgin Galactic, the sole prospective tenant of the New Mexico Spaceport and its Authority, has led members of the New Mexico legislature to sharply question Executive Director Anderson. After an [[VSS Enterprise crash|incident on October 31, 2014]], Virgin Galactic indefinitely postponed its planned operational startup date in New Mexico.  In November 2014, Anderson requested that the legislature consider creating an supplemental emergency fund to enable the spaceport to maintain its operations, and told lawmakers that the Authority will try to rent out the spaceport for \"video shoots or concerts.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite web |url=http://www.utahpeoplespost.com/2014/11/spaceport-sits-empty-future-commercial-spaceflight-jeopardy/ |title=Spaceport Sits Empty, Future Commercial Spaceflight in Jeopardy |work=Utah People's Post |accessdate=2014-11-22 |format=}}</ref>

which will be partially repaid by locally generated gross receipts tax revenues.  
The state of [[New Mexico]] has privatized the operations of Spaceport America; the spaceport will be operated by [[Virgin Galactic]], a component of the [[Virgin Group]] of global companies operated by Sir [[Richard Branson]].  While the Spaceport Authority will exercise public-sector oversight, Virgin Galactic will be the \"anchor tenant\" of the spaceport.<ref name=\"Phase I\"/>

==Operational status==
In February 2011, the governor of New Mexico appointed Christine Anderson as executive director of the Spaceport Authority.<ref name=\"NMSA-Anderson\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceportamerica.com/news/press-releases/371-governor-susana-martinez-announces-christine-andersen-as-spaceport-executive-director.html |title=Governor Susana Martinez Announces Christine Anderson as Spaceport Executive Director |work=[[Spaceport America]] |accessdate=2011-03-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110719182858/http://www.spaceportamerica.com/news/press-releases/371-governor-susana-martinez-announces-christine-andersen-as-spaceport-executive-director.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>  In April 2011, the Authority announced that its budget for fiscal year 2012 had been reduced by 57 percent.<ref name=\"NMSA-Budget\">{{cite web |url=http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/92da72099618461a97829acd4febc6e3/NM--Spaceport-Budget/ |title=NM spaceport authority discusses 57 percent budget cut and spending plan |work=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2011-04-30 |format= }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  In March 2012, the Authority announced that it had completed what it called ''Phase I'' of the Virgin/Spaceport America construction project.  This Phase I included a 10,000-foot runway, a terminal hangar, and a domed Space Operations Center.  Phase II, the visitor center and actual liftoff pad, remained unbuilt as of March 2012.<ref name=\"Phase I\"/>

==Current events==
The current status of Virgin Galactic, the sole prospective tenant of the New Mexico Spaceport and its Authority, has led members of the New Mexico legislature to sharply question Executive Director Anderson. After an [[VSS Enterprise crash|incident on October 31, 2014]], Virgin Galactic indefinitely postponed its planned operational startup date in New Mexico.  In November 2014, Anderson requested that the legislature consider creating an supplemental emergency fund to enable the spaceport to maintain its operations, and told lawmakers that the Authority will try to rent out the spaceport for \"video shoots or concerts.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite web |url=http://www.utahpeoplespost.com/2014/11/spaceport-sits-empty-future-commercial-spaceflight-jeopardy/ |title=Spaceport Sits Empty, Future Commercial Spaceflight in Jeopardy |work=Utah People's Post |accessdate=2014-11-22 |format=}}</ref>

'''The Loch Ard Gorge''' is part of [[Port Campbell National Park]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia, about three minutes' drive west of [[The Twelve Apostles (Victoria)|The Twelve Apostles]].

==History==
The gorge is named after the [[clipper ship]] ''[[Loch Ard (ship)|Loch Ard]]'', which [[shipwreck|ran aground]] on nearby Muttonbird Island on 1 June 1878 approaching the end of a three-month journey from England to [[Melbourne]].  Of the fifty-four passengers and crew, only two survived: Tom Pearce, at 19 years of age, a ship's apprentice, and Eva Carmichael, an Irishwoman emigrating with her family, at 19 years of age.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60620091 |title=THE LOCH ARD COAST REVISITED. |newspaper=[[Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil]] |volume=XIV |issue=203 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=10 March 1886 |accessdate=9 March 2017 |page=39 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> According to memorials at the site, Pearce was washed ashore, and rescued Carmichael from the water after hearing her cries for help.  Pearce then proceeded to climb out of the gorge to raise the alarm to local pastoralists who immediately set into plan a rescue attempt. After three months in Australia Carmichael returned to Europe. Four of her family members drowned that night. Pearce was hailed as a hero, and continued his life living until age 49. He is buried in Southampton, England.
