They are embodied in Ifa divination, and are known as the tripartite Book of Enlightenment in Yorubaland and in its diaspora.\n\nYoruba cultural thought is a witness of two epochs. The first epoch is a history of cosmogony and cosmology. This is also an epoch-making history in the oral culture during which time Oduduwa was the king, the Bringer of Light, pioneer of Yoruba folk philosophy, and a prominent diviner. He pondered the visible and invisible worlds, reminiscing about cosmogony, cosmology, and the mythological creatures in the visible and invisible worlds. His time favored the artist-philosophers who produced magnificent naturalistic artworks of civilization during the pre-dynastic period in Yorubaland.The second epoch is the epoch of metaphysical discourse, and the birth of modern artist-philosophy. This commenced in the 19th century in terms of the academic prowess of Bishop [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]] (1807\u20131891). Although religion is often first in Yoruba culture, nonetheless, it is the philosophy \u2013 the thought of man \u2013 that actually leads spiritual consciousness (ori) to the creation and the practice of religion. Thus, it is believed that thought (philosophy) is an antecedent to religion. Values such as respect, peaceful co-existence, loyalty and freedom of speech are both upheld and highly valued in Yoruba culture. Societies that are considered secret societies often strictly guard and encourage the observance of moral values.\nToday, the academic and nonacademic communities are becoming more interested in Yoruba culture.

On a Sunday during Ramadan in January 1835, in the city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], a small group of slaves and freedmen, inspired by Muslim teachers, rose up against the government. Muslims were called Mal\u00ea in Bahia at this time, from Yoruba Imale that designated a Yoruba Muslim.\nThe Mosque served the spiritual needs of Muslims living in \u1eccy\u1ecd. Progressively, Islam started to gain a foothold in Yorubaland, and Muslims started building Mosques: [[Iwo, Osun|Iwo]] led, its first Mosque built in 1655 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, followed by [[Iseyin|I\u1e63\u1eb9yin]] in 1760 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, [[Lagos|Eko/Lagos]] got its first mosque in 1774 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, [[Shaki, Nigeria|Shaki]], 1790 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, and [[Osogbo|O\u1e63ogbo]], 1889. In time, Islam spread to other towns like [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]] (the first Oyo convert was Solagberu), [[Ibadan]], [[Ab\u1eb9okuta]], [[Ijebu Ode]], [[Ikirun]], and [[Ede, Nigeria|Ede]]. All of these cities already had sizable Muslim communities before the 19th century Sokoto jihad.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Several factors contributed to the rise of Islam in Yorubaland by the middle of the 19th century. Before the decline of \u1eccy\u1ecd, several towns around it had large Muslim communities, however, when \u1eccy\u1ecd was destroyed, these Muslims (Yorubas and immigrants) relocated to newly formed towns and villages and became Islam evangelists.\n\nSecondly, there was a mass movement of people at this time into Yorubaland, many of these immigrants were Muslims who introduced Islam to their hosts. According to Eades, the religion \"differed in attraction\" and \"better adapted to Yoruba social structure, because it permitted polygamy\", which was already a feature of various African societies; more influential Yorubas (like Seriki Kuku of Ijebuland) soon became Muslims, with a positive impact on the natives. Islam came to Lagos at about the same time as other Yoruba towns, however, it received royal support from \u1eccba Kos\u1ecdk\u1ecd, after he came back from exile in [[Epe, Nigeria|\u1eb8p\u1eb9]]. Islam, like Christianity, also found common ground with the natives who already believed in a Supreme Being [[Olodumare]] / [[Olorun]]. Without delay, Islamic scholars and local Imams started establishing Koranic centers to teach Arabic and Islamic studies, much later, conventional schools were established to educate new converts and to propagate Islam.\nToday, the Yorubas constitute the second largest Muslim group in Nigeria, after the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] people of the Northern provinces. They are mostly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], with small [[Ahmadiyya]] communities.\n\n===Traditional art and architecture===\n{{Main|Yoruba art}}\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Terracotta]] head representing ''oni'' or King of [[Ife]], 12th to 16th century]]\n\nMedieval Yoruba settlements were surrounded with massive mud [[city wall|walls]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pMjHpEyDqJMC&pg=PA168&dq=Yoruba+adobe+mud+houses#v=onepage&q=Yoruba%20adobe%20mud%20houses&f=false|title=Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions Volume 11 of International Library of Human Geography|author=Allen G.

A unique feature of Yoruba art is its striking realism that, unlike most African art, chose to create human sculptures in vividly realistic and life sized forms. The art history of the nearby [[Benin empire]] shows that there was a cross \u2013 fertilization of ideas between the neighboring Yoruba and Edo. The Benin court's brass casters learned their art from an Ife master named Iguegha, who had been sent from Ife around 1400 at the request of Benin's oba Oguola.

Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, and the priest advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed \"Efe\" (the humorist/joker); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed \"Gelede\" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.\n\nAfter getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals \u2013 dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet \u2013 they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and were perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede. This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelede. An old theory stated that the beginning of Gelede might be associated with the change from a [[matriarchal]] to a [[patriarchal]] society among the Yoruba people.<ref name=understand/>\n\nThe [[Gelede|Gelede spectacle]] and the [[If\u00e1|Ifa divination system]] represent two of Nigeria's only three pieces on the United Nations [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Oral and Intangible Heritages of Humanity]] list, as well as the only such cultural heritage from [[Benin]] and [[Togo]].\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:Arugba Osun.jpg|thumb|The ''Arugba'' leading the procession to the [[Osun-Osogbo|Osun grove]]]]\nOne of the first observations of first time visitors to Yorubaland is the rich, exuberant and ceremonial nature of their culture, which is made even more visible by the urbanized structures of Yoruba settlements.

The Eyo festival is a dedication to the god of the Sea [[Olokun]], who is an Orisha, and whose name literally mean ''Owner of the Seas''.<ref name=mapping/> Generally, there is no customarily defined time for the staging of the Eyo Festival. This leads to a building anticipation as to what date would be decided upon. Once a date for its performance is selected and announced, the festival preparations begin. It encompasses a week-long series of activities, and culminates in a striking procession of thousands of men clothed in white and wearing a variety of coloured hats, called ''Aga''. The procession moves through Lagos Island ''Isale Eko'', which is the historical centre of the Lagos metropolis. On the streets, they move through various crucial locations and landmarks in the city, including the palace of the traditional ruler of Lagos, the Oba, known as the [[Iga Idunganran]]. The festival starts from dusk to dawn, and has been held on Saturdays (Oj\u00f3 \u00c0b\u00e1m\u00e9ta) from time immemorial. A full week before the festival (always a Sunday), the 'senior' Eyo group, the Adimu (identified by a black, broad-rimmed hat), goes public with a staff. When this happens, it means the event will take place on the following Saturday. Each of the four other 'important' groups \u2013 Laba (Red), Oniko (yellow), Ologede (Green) and Agere (Purple) \u2014 take their turns in that order from Monday to Thursday.\n\n[[File:Eyo Olokun.jpg|thumb|left|Eyo Olokun]]\nThe Eyo masquerade essentially admits tall people, which is why it is described as ''Agogoro Eyo'' (literally meaning the tall Eyo masquerade). In the manner of a spirit (An Orisha) visiting the earth on a purpose, the Eyo masquerade speaks in a ventriloquial voice, suggestive of its otherworldliness; and when greeted, it replies: ''Mo yo fun e, mo yo fun ara mi'', which in Yoruba means: ''I rejoice for you, and I rejoice for myself''. This response connotes the masquerades as rejoicing with the person greeting it for the witnessing of the day, and its own joy at taking the hallowed responsibility of cleansing. During the festival, Sandals and foot wear, as well as ''Suku'', a hairstyle that is popular among the Yorubas \u2013 one that has the hair converge at the middle, then shoot upward, before tipping downward \u2013 are prohibited. The festival has also taken a more touristic dimension in recent times, which like the Osun Osogbo festival, attracts visitors from all across Nigeria, as well as Yoruba diaspora populations. In fact, it is widely believed that the play is one of the manifestations of the customary African revelry that serves as the forerunner of the modern carnival in Brazil and other parts of the [[New World]], which may have been started by the Yoruba slaves transplanted in that part of the world due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spyghana.com/celebrating-eyo-festival-in-the-modern-way/|title=Celebrating Eyo the Modern Way|website=SpyGhana}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingdomsofnigeria.com/eyolagosagog.php|title=Royalty in the news: Lagos agog for Eyo Festival today.|website=Kingdoms of Nigeria|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlagos.com/?p=654|title=Eyo Festival|website=About Lagos|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&pg=PA346&dq=Yoruba+festivals+America#v=onepage&q=Yoruba%20festivals%20America&f=false|page=346|title=Traditional Festivals, Vol. 2 [M \u2013 Z]|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|accessdate=10 June 2015|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Drummers of traditional Gbedu drum in Yoruba land of Nigeria.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gbedu drummers]]\n{{See also|Yoruba music|Bat\u00e1 drum}}\n[[File:Bata drums.jpg|thumb|The [[Bat\u00e1 drum]] \u2013 from left: ''Ok\u00f3nkolo'', ''Iy\u00e1'', ''It\u00f3tele'']]\n\nThe music of the Yoruba people is perhaps best known for an extremely advanced [[drummer|drumming]] tradition,<ref>{{cite book|title=Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Music in the Twentieth Century Identity, Agency, and Performance Practice|author=Bode Omojola|date=4 December 2012|publisher=University of Rochester Press|accessdate=28 February 2014|url=http://www.urpress.com/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=14012|isbn=978-1-58046-409-3}}</ref> especially using the dundun<ref name=\"Turino pg. 43\">Turino, pgs. 181\u2013182; Bensignor, Fran\u00e7ois with Eric Audra, and Ronnie Graham, \"Afro-Funksters\" and \"From Hausa Music to Highlife\" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 432\u2013436 and pgs. 588\u2013600; Karolyi, pg. 43</ref> hourglass tension drums. \nThe representation of musical instruments on sculptural works from Ile-Ife, indicates, in general terms a substantial accord with oral traditions.

The [[Talking drum|D\u00f9nd\u00fan / G\u00e1ngan family]], is the class of hourglass shaped talking drums, which imitate the sound of Yoruba speech. This is possible because the Yoruba language is tonal in nature. It is the most common and is present in many Yoruba traditions, such as [[Apala]], [[J\u00f9j\u00fa music|J\u00f9j\u00fa]], [[Sekere]] and [[Afrobeat]]. The second is the [[Sakara drum|Sakara family]]. Typically, they played a ceremonial role in royal settings, weddings and [[Oriki|Or\u00edk\u00ec]] recitation; it is predominantly found in traditions such as [[Sakara music]], Were and [[Fuji music]]. The [[Gbedu|Gbedu family]] (literally, \"large drum\") is used by secret fraternities such as the [[Ogboni]] and royal courts. Historically, only the Oba might dance to the music of the drum. If anyone else used the drum they were arrested for sedition of royal authority. The Gb\u00e8du are conga shaped drums played while they sit on the ground. ''Akuba'' drums (a trio of smaller conga-like drums related to the gb\u00e8du) are typically used in afrobeat. The ''Ogido'' is a cousin of the gbedu. It is also shaped like a conga but with a wider array of sounds and a bigger body. It also has a much deeper sound than the conga. It is sometimes referred to as the \"bass drum\". Both hands play directly on the Ogido drum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lagbaja.com/drums/ogido.php|website=Lagbaja|title=Ogido|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nToday, the word ''Gbedu'' has also come to be used to describe forms of Nigerian Afrobeat and Hip Hop music. The fourth major family of Yoruba drums is the [[Bat\u00e1 drum|B\u00e0t\u00e1 family]], which are well-decorated double-faced drums, with various tones. They were historically played in sacred rituals. They are believed to have been introduced by [[Shango]], an Orisha, during his earthly incarnation as a warrior king.\n\nTraditional Yoruba drummers are known as ''\u00c0y\u00e1n''. The Yoruba believe that ''\u00c0y\u00e1ngal\u00fa'' was the first drummer. He is also believed to be the spirit or muse that inspires drummers during renditions. This is why some Yoruba family names contain the prefix 'Ayan-' such as Ayangbade, Ayantunde, Ayanwande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Yoruba+Music/|title=Yoruba music|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> Ensembles using the [[Talking drum|dundun]] play a type of music that is also called ''dundun''.<ref name=\"Turino pg. 43\"/> The [[Ashiko]] (Cone shaped drums), ''Igbin'', [[Gudugudu]] (Kettledrums in the D\u00f9nd\u00fan family), [[Agidigbo]] and B\u00e8mb\u00e9 are other drums of importance. The leader of a dundun ensemble is the ''oniyalu'' meaning; ' ''Owner of the mother drum'' ', who uses the drum to \"talk\" by imitating the [[tonality]] of Yoruba. Much of this music is spiritual in nature, and is often devoted to the [[Orisa]]s.\n\n[[File:Benin, yoruba, campanaccio per invocare gli spiriti o le divinit\u00e0,.JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional [[Agog\u00f4|Agogo]] metal gongs]]\nWithin each drum family there are different sizes and roles; the lead drum in each family is called ''\u00ccy\u00e1'' or ''\u00ccy\u00e1 \u00ccl\u00f9'', which means \"Mother drum\", while the supporting drums are termed ''Omele''. Yoruba drumming exemplifies West-African cross-rhythms and is considered to be one of the most advanced drumming traditions in the world. Generally, improvisation is restricted to master drummers. Some other instruments found in Yoruba music include, but are not limited to; The [[Goje|G\u00f2j\u00e9]] ([[violin]]), [[Shekere|Sh\u00e8k\u00e8r\u00e8]] (gourd rattle), [[Agidigbo]] (thumb piano that takes the shape of a plucked [[Lamellophone]]), ''Saworo'' (metal rattles for the arm and ankles, also used on the rim of the bata drum), ''F\u00e8r\u00e8'' ([[whistle]]s), ''Aro'' ([[Cymbal]])s, [[Agog\u00f4]] ([[Bell (instrument)|bell]]), different types of [[flute]]s include the ''Ekutu'', ''Okinkin'' & ''Igba.''\n[[File:TalkingDrum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[talking drum]]]]\n\n[[Oriki]] (or praise singing), a genre of sung poetry that contains a series of proverbial phrases, praising or characterizing the respective person is of [[Egba people|Egba]] and [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] origin, is often considered the oldest Yoruba musical tradition. Yoruba music is typically [[Polyrhythm]]ic, which can be described as interlocking sets of rhythms that fit together somewhat like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. There is a basic timeline and each instrument plays a pattern in relation to that timeline. The resulting ensemble provides the typical sound of West African Yoruba drumming. Yoruba music is a component of the modern Nigerian popular music scene. Although traditional Yoruba music was not influenced by foreign music, the same cannot be said of modern-day Yoruba music, which has evolved and adapted itself through contact with foreign instruments, talent, and creativity.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Twins in Yoruba society===\n{{Main|Ibeji}}\n[[File:Yoruba Ibeji figures, representing twins Wellcome L0035694.jpg|thumb|Wooden ''Ere Ibeji'' figures representing twins.

T\u00f2bi is like the modern day apron with strings and spaces in which women can keep their valuables. They tie the t\u00f2bi around the waists before putting on the \u00ccr\u00f3 (wrapper).

These are used by both males and females, and are put on for bodily adornment. Chiefs, priests, kings or people of royal descent, especially use some of these beads as a signifier of rank. Some of these beads include ''Iyun, Lagidigba, \u00c0k\u00fan'' etc. An accessory especially popular among royalty and titled [[Babalawo|Babalawos / Babalorishas]] is the ''\u00ccr\u00f9k\u00e8r\u00e8'', which is an artistically processed animal tail, a type of [[Fly-whisk]]. The horsetail whiskers are symbols of authority and stateliness.

Hair is considered the ' ''Glory of the woman'' '. They usually take care of their hair in two major ways; They plait and they weave. There are many types of plaiting styles, and women readily pick any type they want. Some of these include ''k\u00f2l\u00e9s\u00e8, \u00ccp\u00e0k\u00f3-el\u00e9d\u00e8, S\u00f9k\u00fa, Koj\u00fas\u00f3ko, Al\u00e1gogo, Konkoso'', Etc. Traditionally, The Yoruba consider tribal marks ways of adding beauty to the face of individuals. This is apart from the fact that they show clearly from which part of Yorubaland an individual comes from, since different areas are associated with different marks. Different types of [[Yoruba tribal marks|tribal marks]] are made with local blades or knives on the cheeks. These are usually done at infancy, when children are not pain conscious.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2017}} Some of these tribal marks include ''P\u00e9l\u00e9, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-\u00c8gb\u00e1, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-\u00d2wu, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-m\u00e9rin, K\u00e9k\u00e9, G\u00f2mb\u00f2, Ture, P\u00e9l\u00e9 If\u00e8, K\u00e9k\u00e9 \u00d2wu, P\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00ccj\u00e8b\u00fa'' etc. This practice is near extinct today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africa.uga.edu/Yoruba/unit_06/cultureunit.html|website=Africa UGA|title=Traditional Clothes: Clothing and Fashion|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Yoruba believe that development of a nation is akin to the development of a man or woman.

Igala and Yoruba have important historical and cultural relationships. The languages of the two ethnic groups bear such a close resemblance that researchers such as Forde (1951) and Westermann and Bryan (1952) regarded Igala as a dialect of Yoruba.\n\nThe Yoruboid languages are assumed to have developed out of an undifferentiated Volta-Niger group by the 1st millennium BCE.\nThere are three major dialect areas: Northwest, Central, and Southeast.<ref>This widely followed classification is based on Adetugb\u1ecd's (1982) dialectological study \u2013 the classification originated in his 1967 PhD thesis ''The Yoruba Language in Western Nigeria: Its Major Dialect Areas'', {{ProQuest|288034744}}.

This was exemplified by the following remark by Adetugb\u1ecd (1967), as cited in Fagborun (1994): \"While the orthography agreed upon by the missionaries represented to a very large degree the phonemes of the Ab\u1eb9okuta dialect, the morpho-syntax reflected the \u1eccy\u1ecd-Ibadan dialects\".\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Yoruba people}}\n{{See|Ife}}\n{{See also|Yoruba religion}}\n[[File:HistoYoruba.jpeg|left|thumb|Some Yoruba cities of the [[Middle Ages]]]]\n\nAs of the [[7th century BC|7th century BCE]] the African peoples who lived in [[Yorubaland]] were not initially known as the Yoruba, although they shared a common ethnicity and language group.

They are embodied in Ifa divination, and are known as the tripartite Book of Enlightenment in Yorubaland and in its diaspora.\n\nYoruba cultural thought is a witness of two epochs. The first epoch is a history of cosmogony and cosmology. This is also an epoch-making history in the oral culture during which time Oduduwa was the king, the Bringer of Light, pioneer of Yoruba folk philosophy, and a prominent diviner. He pondered the visible and invisible worlds, reminiscing about cosmogony, cosmology, and the mythological creatures in the visible and invisible worlds. His time favored the artist-philosophers who produced magnificent naturalistic artworks of civilization during the pre-dynastic period in Yorubaland.The second epoch is the epoch of metaphysical discourse, and the birth of modern artist-philosophy. This commenced in the 19th century in terms of the academic prowess of Bishop [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]] (1807\u20131891). Although religion is often first in Yoruba culture, nonetheless, it is the philosophy \u2013 the thought of man \u2013 that actually leads spiritual consciousness (ori) to the creation and the practice of religion. Thus, it is believed that thought (philosophy) is an antecedent to religion. Values such as respect, peaceful co-existence, loyalty and freedom of speech are both upheld and highly valued in Yoruba culture. Societies that are considered secret societies often strictly guard and encourage the observance of moral values.\nToday, the academic and nonacademic communities are becoming more interested in Yoruba culture.

Roman Catholics (known to the Yorubas as Ijo Aguda, so named after returning former Yoruba slaves from Latin America, who were mostly Catholic, and were also known as the Agudas, [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saros]] or Amaros) started the race, followed by Protestants, whose prominent member \u2013 [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) based in [[England]] made the most significant in-roads into the hinterland regions for evangelism and became the largest of the Christian missions. [[Methodism|Methodists]] (known as Ijo-Eleto, so named after the Yoruba word for \"method or process\") started missions in [[Badagry|Agbadarigi / Gbegle]] by [[Thomas Birch Freeman]] in 1842. [[Henry Townsend (missionary)|Henry Townsend]], C.C.Gollmer, and [[Ajayi Crowther]] of the CMS worked in [[Abeokuta]], then under the Egba division of Southern Nigeria in 1846.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:Church of the Pater Noster Mount of Olives, Jerusalem 11.jpg|thumb|right|The Lord's prayer in Yoruba language, [[Church of the Pater Noster]] Mount of Olives, Jerusalem]]\n[[Anna Hinderer|Hinderer]] and Mann of CMS started missions in Ibadan / [[Ibarapa people|Ibarapa]] and Ijaye divisions of the present Oyo state in 1853.

With their success, other religious groups \u2013 the [[Salvation Army]] and the [[Evangelical Church of West Africa|Evangelists Commission of West Africa]] \u2013 became popular among the [[Igbomina]], and other non-denominational Christian groups joined. The increased tempo of Christianity led to the appointment of [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saros]] and indigenes as missionaries. This move was initiated by Venn, the CMS Secretary. Nevertheless, the impact of Christianity in Yorubaland was not felt until the fourth decade of the 19th century, when a Yoruba slave boy, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, became a Christian convert, linguist and minister whose knowledge in languages would become a major tool and instrument to propagate Christianity in Yorubaland and beyond.<ref>{{cite web|website=Yorupedia|url=http://yorupedia.com/subjects/yoruba-religion/christianity-and-islam/|title=Christianity and Islam Introduction|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\nToday, there are a number of Yoruba Pastors and Church founders with large congregations, e.g. Pastor [[Enoch Adeboye]] of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor [[David Oyedepo]] of Living Faith Church World Wide also known as Winners Chapel, Pastor [[Tunde Bakare]] of Latter Rain Assembly, Prophet [[T.

The adherents of the Islamic faith are called Musulumi in Yoruba to correspond to Muslim, the Arabic word for an adherent of Islam having as the active participle of the same verb form, and means \"submitter (to Allah)\" or a nominal and active participle of Islam derivative of \"Salaam\" i.e. (Religion of) Peace.

On a Sunday during Ramadan in January 1835, in the city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], a small group of slaves and freedmen, inspired by Muslim teachers, rose up against the government. Muslims were called Mal\u00ea in Bahia at this time, from Yoruba Imale that designated a Yoruba Muslim.\nThe Mosque served the spiritual needs of Muslims living in \u1eccy\u1ecd. Progressively, Islam started to gain a foothold in Yorubaland, and Muslims started building Mosques: [[Iwo, Osun|Iwo]] led, its first Mosque built in 1655 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, followed by [[Iseyin|I\u1e63\u1eb9yin]] in 1760 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, [[Lagos|Eko/Lagos]] got its first mosque in 1774 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, [[Shaki, Nigeria|Shaki]], 1790 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, and [[Osogbo|O\u1e63ogbo]], 1889. In time, Islam spread to other towns like [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]] (the first Oyo convert was Solagberu), [[Ibadan]], [[Ab\u1eb9okuta]], [[Ijebu Ode]], [[Ikirun]], and [[Ede, Nigeria|Ede]]. All of these cities already had sizable Muslim communities before the 19th century Sokoto jihad.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Several factors contributed to the rise of Islam in Yorubaland by the middle of the 19th century. Before the decline of \u1eccy\u1ecd, several towns around it had large Muslim communities, however, when \u1eccy\u1ecd was destroyed, these Muslims (Yorubas and immigrants) relocated to newly formed towns and villages and became Islam evangelists.\n\nSecondly, there was a mass movement of people at this time into Yorubaland, many of these immigrants were Muslims who introduced Islam to their hosts. According to Eades, the religion \"differed in attraction\" and \"better adapted to Yoruba social structure, because it permitted polygamy\", which was already a feature of various African societies; more influential Yorubas (like Seriki Kuku of Ijebuland) soon became Muslims, with a positive impact on the natives. Islam came to Lagos at about the same time as other Yoruba towns, however, it received royal support from \u1eccba Kos\u1ecdk\u1ecd, after he came back from exile in [[Epe, Nigeria|\u1eb8p\u1eb9]]. Islam, like Christianity, also found common ground with the natives who already believed in a Supreme Being [[Olodumare]] / [[Olorun]]. Without delay, Islamic scholars and local Imams started establishing Koranic centers to teach Arabic and Islamic studies, much later, conventional schools were established to educate new converts and to propagate Islam.\nToday, the Yorubas constitute the second largest Muslim group in Nigeria, after the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] people of the Northern provinces. They are mostly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], with small [[Ahmadiyya]] communities.\n\n===Traditional art and architecture===\n{{Main|Yoruba art}}\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Terracotta]] head representing ''oni'' or King of [[Ife]], 12th to 16th century]]\n\nMedieval Yoruba settlements were surrounded with massive mud [[city wall|walls]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pMjHpEyDqJMC&pg=PA168&dq=Yoruba+adobe+mud+houses#v=onepage&q=Yoruba%20adobe%20mud%20houses&f=false|title=Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions Volume 11 of International Library of Human Geography|author=Allen G.

The art history of the nearby [[Benin empire]] shows that there was a cross \u2013 fertilization of ideas between the neighboring Yoruba and Edo.

Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, and the priest advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed \"Efe\" (the humorist/joker); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed \"Gelede\" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.\n\nAfter getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals \u2013 dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet \u2013 they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and were perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede. This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelede.

The Eyo festival is a dedication to the god of the Sea [[Olokun]], who is an Orisha, and whose name literally mean ''Owner of the Seas''.<ref name=mapping/> Generally, there is no customarily defined time for the staging of the Eyo Festival. This leads to a building anticipation as to what date would be decided upon. Once a date for its performance is selected and announced, the festival preparations begin. It encompasses a week-long series of activities, and culminates in a striking procession of thousands of men clothed in white and wearing a variety of coloured hats, called ''Aga''. The procession moves through Lagos Island ''Isale Eko'', which is the historical centre of the Lagos metropolis. On the streets, they move through various crucial locations and landmarks in the city, including the palace of the traditional ruler of Lagos, the Oba, known as the [[Iga Idunganran]]. The festival starts from dusk to dawn, and has been held on Saturdays (Oj\u00f3 \u00c0b\u00e1m\u00e9ta) from time immemorial. A full week before the festival (always a Sunday), the 'senior' Eyo group, the Adimu (identified by a black, broad-rimmed hat), goes public with a staff. When this happens, it means the event will take place on the following Saturday. Each of the four other 'important' groups \u2013 Laba (Red), Oniko (yellow), Ologede (Green) and Agere (Purple) \u2014 take their turns in that order from Monday to Thursday.\n\n[[File:Eyo Olokun.jpg|thumb|left|Eyo Olokun]]\nThe Eyo masquerade essentially admits tall people, which is why it is described as ''Agogoro Eyo'' (literally meaning the tall Eyo masquerade). In the manner of a spirit (An Orisha) visiting the earth on a purpose, the Eyo masquerade speaks in a ventriloquial voice, suggestive of its otherworldliness; and when greeted, it replies: ''Mo yo fun e, mo yo fun ara mi'', which in Yoruba means: ''I rejoice for you, and I rejoice for myself''. This response connotes the masquerades as rejoicing with the person greeting it for the witnessing of the day, and its own joy at taking the hallowed responsibility of cleansing. During the festival, Sandals and foot wear, as well as ''Suku'', a hairstyle that is popular among the Yorubas \u2013 one that has the hair converge at the middle, then shoot upward, before tipping downward \u2013 are prohibited. The festival has also taken a more touristic dimension in recent times, which like the Osun Osogbo festival, attracts visitors from all across Nigeria, as well as Yoruba diaspora populations. In fact, it is widely believed that the play is one of the manifestations of the customary African revelry that serves as the forerunner of the modern carnival in Brazil and other parts of the [[New World]], which may have been started by the Yoruba slaves transplanted in that part of the world due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spyghana.com/celebrating-eyo-festival-in-the-modern-way/|title=Celebrating Eyo the Modern Way|website=SpyGhana}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingdomsofnigeria.com/eyolagosagog.php|title=Royalty in the news: Lagos agog for Eyo Festival today.|website=Kingdoms of Nigeria|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlagos.com/?p=654|title=Eyo Festival|website=About Lagos|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&pg=PA346&dq=Yoruba+festivals+America#v=onepage&q=Yoruba%20festivals%20America&f=false|page=346|title=Traditional Festivals, Vol. 2 [M \u2013 Z]|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|accessdate=10 June 2015|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Drummers of traditional Gbedu drum in Yoruba land of Nigeria.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gbedu drummers]]\n{{See also|Yoruba music|Bat\u00e1 drum}}\n[[File:Bata drums.jpg|thumb|The [[Bat\u00e1 drum]] \u2013 from left: ''Ok\u00f3nkolo'', ''Iy\u00e1'', ''It\u00f3tele'']]\n\nThe music of the Yoruba people is perhaps best known for an extremely advanced [[drummer|drumming]] tradition,<ref>{{cite book|title=Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Music in the Twentieth Century Identity, Agency, and Performance Practice|author=Bode Omojola|date=4 December 2012|publisher=University of Rochester Press|accessdate=28 February 2014|url=http://www.urpress.com/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=14012|isbn=978-1-58046-409-3}}</ref> especially using the dundun<ref name=\"Turino pg. 43\">Turino, pgs. 181\u2013182; Bensignor, Fran\u00e7ois with Eric Audra, and Ronnie Graham, \"Afro-Funksters\" and \"From Hausa Music to Highlife\" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 432\u2013436 and pgs. 588\u2013600; Karolyi, pg. 43</ref> hourglass tension drums. \nThe representation of musical instruments on sculptural works from Ile-Ife, indicates, in general terms a substantial accord with oral traditions.

The [[Talking drum|D\u00f9nd\u00fan / G\u00e1ngan family]], is the class of hourglass shaped talking drums, which imitate the sound of Yoruba speech. This is possible because the Yoruba language is tonal in nature. It is the most common and is present in many Yoruba traditions, such as [[Apala]], [[J\u00f9j\u00fa music|J\u00f9j\u00fa]], [[Sekere]] and [[Afrobeat]]. The second is the [[Sakara drum|Sakara family]]. Typically, they played a ceremonial role in royal settings, weddings and [[Oriki|Or\u00edk\u00ec]] recitation; it is predominantly found in traditions such as [[Sakara music]], Were and [[Fuji music]]. The [[Gbedu|Gbedu family]] (literally, \"large drum\") is used by secret fraternities such as the [[Ogboni]] and royal courts. Historically, only the Oba might dance to the music of the drum. If anyone else used the drum they were arrested for sedition of royal authority. The Gb\u00e8du are conga shaped drums played while they sit on the ground. ''Akuba'' drums (a trio of smaller conga-like drums related to the gb\u00e8du) are typically used in afrobeat. The ''Ogido'' is a cousin of the gbedu. It is also shaped like a conga but with a wider array of sounds and a bigger body. It also has a much deeper sound than the conga. It is sometimes referred to as the \"bass drum\". Both hands play directly on the Ogido drum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lagbaja.com/drums/ogido.php|website=Lagbaja|title=Ogido|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nToday, the word ''Gbedu'' has also come to be used to describe forms of Nigerian Afrobeat and Hip Hop music. The fourth major family of Yoruba drums is the [[Bat\u00e1 drum|B\u00e0t\u00e1 family]], which are well-decorated double-faced drums, with various tones. They were historically played in sacred rituals. They are believed to have been introduced by [[Shango]], an Orisha, during his earthly incarnation as a warrior king.\n\nTraditional Yoruba drummers are known as ''\u00c0y\u00e1n''. The Yoruba believe that ''\u00c0y\u00e1ngal\u00fa'' was the first drummer. He is also believed to be the spirit or muse that inspires drummers during renditions. This is why some Yoruba family names contain the prefix 'Ayan-' such as Ayangbade, Ayantunde, Ayanwande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Yoruba+Music/|title=Yoruba music|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> Ensembles using the [[Talking drum|dundun]] play a type of music that is also called ''dundun''.<ref name=\"Turino pg. 43\"/> The [[Ashiko]] (Cone shaped drums), ''Igbin'', [[Gudugudu]] (Kettledrums in the D\u00f9nd\u00fan family), [[Agidigbo]] and B\u00e8mb\u00e9 are other drums of importance. The leader of a dundun ensemble is the ''oniyalu'' meaning; ' ''Owner of the mother drum'' ', who uses the drum to \"talk\" by imitating the [[tonality]] of Yoruba. Much of this music is spiritual in nature, and is often devoted to the [[Orisa]]s.\n\n[[File:Benin, yoruba, campanaccio per invocare gli spiriti o le divinit\u00e0,.JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional [[Agog\u00f4|Agogo]] metal gongs]]\nWithin each drum family there are different sizes and roles; the lead drum in each family is called ''\u00ccy\u00e1'' or ''\u00ccy\u00e1 \u00ccl\u00f9'', which means \"Mother drum\", while the supporting drums are termed ''Omele''. Yoruba drumming exemplifies West-African cross-rhythms and is considered to be one of the most advanced drumming traditions in the world. Generally, improvisation is restricted to master drummers. Some other instruments found in Yoruba music include, but are not limited to; The [[Goje|G\u00f2j\u00e9]] ([[violin]]), [[Shekere|Sh\u00e8k\u00e8r\u00e8]] (gourd rattle), [[Agidigbo]] (thumb piano that takes the shape of a plucked [[Lamellophone]]), ''Saworo'' (metal rattles for the arm and ankles, also used on the rim of the bata drum), ''F\u00e8r\u00e8'' ([[whistle]]s), ''Aro'' ([[Cymbal]])s, [[Agog\u00f4]] ([[Bell (instrument)|bell]]), different types of [[flute]]s include the ''Ekutu'', ''Okinkin'' & ''Igba.''\n[[File:TalkingDrum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[talking drum]]]]\n\n[[Oriki]] (or praise singing), a genre of sung poetry that contains a series of proverbial phrases, praising or characterizing the respective person is of [[Egba people|Egba]] and [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] origin, is often considered the oldest Yoruba musical tradition. Yoruba music is typically [[Polyrhythm]]ic, which can be described as interlocking sets of rhythms that fit together somewhat like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. There is a basic timeline and each instrument plays a pattern in relation to that timeline. The resulting ensemble provides the typical sound of West African Yoruba drumming. Yoruba music is a component of the modern Nigerian popular music scene. Although traditional Yoruba music was not influenced by foreign music, the same cannot be said of modern-day Yoruba music, which has evolved and adapted itself through contact with foreign instruments, talent, and creativity.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Twins in Yoruba society===\n{{Main|Ibeji}}\n[[File:Yoruba Ibeji figures, representing twins Wellcome L0035694.jpg|thumb|Wooden ''Ere Ibeji'' figures representing twins.

Some of these are ''K\u00e8mb\u00e8'' (Three-Quarter baggy pants), ''Gb\u00e1anu'', ''S\u00f3\u00f3r\u00f3'' (Long slim / streamlined pants), ''K\u00e1amu'' & ''S\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2 Elemu''. A man's dressing is considered incomplete without a cap (''F\u00ecl\u00e0''). Some of these caps include, but are not limited to; ''Gobi'' (Cylindrical, which when worn may be compressed and shaped forward, sideways, or backward), ''Tinko'', ''Abet\u00ed-aj\u00e1'' (Crest-like shape that derives its name from its hanging flaps that resembles a dog's hanging ears. The flaps can be lowered to cover the ears in cold weather, otherwise, they are upwardly turned in normal weather), ''Alagbaa, Oribi, Bentigoo, Onide'', and ''Labankada'' (a bigger version of the Abet\u00ed-aj\u00e1, and is worn in such a way as to reveal the contrasting color of the cloth used as underlay for the flaps).\n\nWomen also have different types of dresses. The most commonly worn are ''\u00ccr\u00f3'' (wrapper) and ''B\u00f9b\u00e1'' (blouse-like loose top). Women also have matching ''G\u00e8l\u00e8'' (head gear) that must be put on whenever the \u00ccr\u00f3 and B\u00f9b\u00e1 is on. Just as the cap (F\u00ecl\u00e0) is important to men, women's dressing is considered incomplete without G\u00e8l\u00e8. It may be of plain cloth or costly as the women can afford. Apart from this, they also have ''\u00ecbor\u00f9n'' ([[Shawl]]) and ''\u00ccp\u00e8l\u00e9'' (which are long pieces of fabric that usually hang on the left shoulder and stretch from the hind of the body to the fore). At times, it is tied round their waists over the original one piece wrapper. Unlike men, women have two types of under wears (\u00c8w\u00f9 \u00c0w\u00f2t\u00e9l\u00e8), called; ''T\u00f2bi'' and ''Sinm\u00ed''. T\u00f2bi is like the modern day apron with strings and spaces in which women can keep their valuables. They tie the t\u00f2bi around the waists before putting on the \u00ccr\u00f3 (wrapper). Sinm\u00ed is like a sleeveless T-shirt that is worn under before wearing any other dress on the upper body.\n\n[[File:Benin, yoruba, braccialetti, anelli e altri monili.JPG|300px|thumb|left|Yoruba metal bracelets and jewellery of old. Collection of The Afro-Brazilian museum of Salvador, Bahia]]\nThere are many types of beads (''\u00ccl\u00e8k\u00e8''), hand laces, necklaces (Egba or\u00f9n), anklets (Egba es\u00e8) and bangles (Egba ow\u00f3) that are used in Yorubaland. These are used by both males and females, and are put on for bodily adornment. Chiefs, priests, kings or people of royal descent, especially use some of these beads as a signifier of rank. Some of these beads include ''Iyun, Lagidigba, \u00c0k\u00fan'' etc. An accessory especially popular among royalty and titled [[Babalawo|Babalawos / Babalorishas]] is the ''\u00ccr\u00f9k\u00e8r\u00e8'', which is an artistically processed animal tail, a type of [[Fly-whisk]]. The horsetail whiskers are symbols of authority and stateliness. It can be used in a shrine for decoration but most often is used by chief priests and priestesses as a symbol of their authority or Ashe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeoduduwa.org/the-orisha/orisha|title=Orisha|website=Oduduwa|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> As most men go about with their hair lowly cut or neatly shaven, the reverse is the case for women. Hair is considered the ' ''Glory of the woman'' '. They usually take care of their hair in two major ways; They plait and they weave. There are many types of plaiting styles, and women readily pick any type they want. Some of these include ''k\u00f2l\u00e9s\u00e8, \u00ccp\u00e0k\u00f3-el\u00e9d\u00e8, S\u00f9k\u00fa, Koj\u00fas\u00f3ko, Al\u00e1gogo, Konkoso'', Etc. Traditionally, The Yoruba consider tribal marks ways of adding beauty to the face of individuals. This is apart from the fact that they show clearly from which part of Yorubaland an individual comes from, since different areas are associated with different marks. Different types of [[Yoruba tribal marks|tribal marks]] are made with local blades or knives on the cheeks. These are usually done at infancy, when children are not pain conscious.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2017}} Some of these tribal marks include ''P\u00e9l\u00e9, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-\u00c8gb\u00e1, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-\u00d2wu, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-m\u00e9rin, K\u00e9k\u00e9, G\u00f2mb\u00f2, Ture, P\u00e9l\u00e9 If\u00e8, K\u00e9k\u00e9 \u00d2wu, P\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00ccj\u00e8b\u00fa'' etc. This practice is near extinct today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africa.uga.edu/Yoruba/unit_06/cultureunit.html|website=Africa UGA|title=Traditional Clothes: Clothing and Fashion|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Yoruba believe that development of a nation is akin to the development of a man or woman. Therefore, the personality of an individual has to be developed in order to fulfill his or her responsibilities. Clothing among the Yoruba people is a crucial factor upon which the personality of an individual is anchored. This belief is anchored in Yoruba [[proverb]]s.
