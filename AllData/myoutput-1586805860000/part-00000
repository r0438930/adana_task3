He had a good leap which compensated for his lack of height. It was after the retirement of Peter Knights and David O'Halloran he switched to full back . It was that position in which he won his first All-Australian selection in 1987.\n\nA defender, Langford won four premierships with Hawthorn, in 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1991. He captained the club in the 1994 season and earned a second [[All-Australian]] selection.\n\nHe holds a place on the interchange bench in Hawthorn's official 'Team of the Century'.\n\nLate in his career, Langford moved to [[Sydney]] where he worked as an accountant, commuting to Melbourne to training and play with his club. In 2012, he moved back to Melbourne.\n\n===Merger game===\nLangford's antics at the end of the [[Melbourne Hawks|merger game]] against Melbourne in 1996 inspired many Hawthorn members to vote against the merger proposal. Langford (Hawthorn's full back) took off his Hawthorn jumper and proudly held it above his head while leaving the field. Langford was only one of the then playing list to display his disapproval of the plan.\n\n==Statistics==\n:<ref>[https://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/S/Stephen_Silvagni.html Stephen Silvagni's player profile at AFL Tables]</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend}}\n{{AFL player statistics start with votes}}\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1983 VFL season|1983]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 11 || 3 || 9 || 105 || 66 || 171 || 39 || {{n/a}} || 0.3 || 0.8 || 9.5 || 6.0 || 15.5 || 3.5 || {{n/a}} || 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1984 VFL season|1984]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 22 || 17 || 19 || 185 || 62 || 247 || 54 || {{n/a}} || 0.8 || 0.9 || 8.4 || 2.8 || 11.2 || 2.5 || {{n/a}} || 1\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1985 VFL season|1985]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 22 || 2 || 7 || 190 || 74 || 264 || 62 || {{n/a}} || 0.1 || 0.3 || 8.6 || 3.4 || 12.0 || 2.8 || {{n/a}} || 0\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1986 VFL season|1986]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 23 || 0 || 0 || 216 || 96 || 312 || 64 || {{n/a}} || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.4 || 4.2 || 13.6 || 2.8 || {{n/a}} || 5\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1987 VFL season|1987]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 26 || 1 || 2 || 265 || 114 || 379 || 98 || 26 || 0.0 || 0.1 || 10.2 || 4.4 || 14.6 || 3.8 || 1.0 || 0\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1988 VFL season|1988]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 2 || 1 || 223 || 77 || 300 || 75 || 16 || 0.1 || 0.0 || 10.1 || 3.5 || 13.6 || 3.4 || 0.7 || 5\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1989 VFL season|1989]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 0 || 1 || 216 || 96 || 312 || 82 || 19 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.4 || 4.2 || 13.6 || 3.6 || 0.8 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1990 AFL season|1990]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 20 || 2 || 0 || 164 || 68 || 232 || 62 || 13 || 0.1 || 0.0 || 8.2 || 3.4 || 11.6 || 3.1 || 0.7 || 3\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1991 AFL season|1991]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 25 || 0 || 0 || 231 || 86 || 317 || 72 || 29 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.2 || 3.4 || 12.7 || 2.9 || 1.2 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1992 AFL season|1992]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 4 || 0 || 185 || 79 || 264 || 49 || 20 || 0.2 || 0.0 || 8.0 || 3.4 || 11.5 || 2.1 || 0.9 || 0\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1993 AFL season|1993]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 0 || 0 || 192 || 85 || 277 || 50 || 38 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.1 || 4.0 || 13.2 || 2.4 || 1.8 || 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1994 AFL season|1994]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 0 || 3 || 132 || 87 || 219 || 64 || 22 || 0.0 || 0.2 || 7.3 || 4.8 || 12.2 || 3.6 || 1.2 || 11\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1995 AFL season|1995]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 0 || 1 || 160 || 79 || 239 || 54 || 21 || 0.0 || 0.1 || 8.9 || 4.4 || 13.3 || 3.0 || 1.2 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1996 AFL season|1996]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 1 || 0 || 248 || 58 || 306 || 97 || 30 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 11.8 || 2.8 || 14.6 || 4.6 || 1.4 || 3\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1997 AFL season|1997]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 8 || 1 || 2 || 77 || 21 || 98 || 32 || 6 || 0.1 || 0.3 || 9.6 || 2.6 || 12.3 || 4.0 || 0.8 || 0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 303\n! 33\n! 45\n! 2789\n! 1148\n! 3937\n! 954\n! 240\n! 0.1\n! 0.1\n! 9.2\n! 3.8\n! 13.0\n! 3.1\n! 1.1\n! 38\n|}\n\n==Career==\nAfter his career, he moved into game administration and was appointed to the [[AFL Commission]] in 1999.\n\n==Family==\n\nChris' son [[Will Langford|Will]] was recruited to Hawthorn in the 2011 Rookie draft, and was upgraded to the Hawthorn senior list in June 2013.
