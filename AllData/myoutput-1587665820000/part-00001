Musicians during this period believed that the [[bebop]], [[hard bop]], and [[modal jazz]] that had been played before them was too limiting. They became preoccupied with creating something new. Free jazz has often been combined with or substituted for the term \"[[avant-garde jazz]]\". Europeans tend to favor the term \"[[free improvisation]]\". Others have used \"modern jazz\", \"creative music\", and \"art music\".\n\nThe ambiguity of free jazz presents problems of definition. Although it is usually played by small groups or individuals, free jazz big bands have existed. Although musicians and critics claim it is innovative and forward looking, it draws on early styles of jazz and has been described as an attempt to return to primitive, often religious, roots. Although jazz is an American invention, free jazz musicians drew heavily from [[world music]] and ethnic music traditions from around the world. Sometimes they played foreign instruments, unusual instruments, or invented their own. They emphasized emotional intensity and sound for its own sake.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:Ornette Coleman.jpg|thumb|right|Ornette Coleman]]\n[[File:Pharoah Sanders photo.jpg|thumb|right|Pharoah Sanders]]\n\nSome jazz musicians resist any attempt at classification. One difficulty is that most jazz has an element of improvisation. Many musicians draw on free jazz concepts and idioms, and free jazz was never entirely distinct from other genres. But free jazz does have its own characteristics. [[Pharoah Sanders]] and [[John Coltrane]] used harsh overblowing or other extended techniques to elicit unconventional sounds from their instruments. Like other forms of jazz it places an aesthetic premium on expressing the \"voice\" or \"sound\" of the musician, as opposed to the classical tradition in which the performer is seen more as expressing the thoughts of the composer.\n\nEarlier jazz styles typically were built on a framework of song forms, such as [[twelve-bar blues]] or the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar AABA popular song form]] with chord changes. In free jazz, the dependence on a fixed and pre-established form is eliminated, and the role of [[improvisation]] is correspondingly increased.\n\nOther forms of jazz use regular [[metre (music)|meter]]s and pulsed rhythms, usually in 4/4 or (less often) 3/4. Free jazz retains pulsation and sometimes [[Swing music|swing]]s but without regular meter. Frequent [[wikt:accelerando|Accelerando]] and [[ritardando]] give an impression of rhythm that moves like a wave.<ref name=\"Litweiler\">{{cite book |last1=Litweiler |first1=John |title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 |date=1984 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=0-306-80377-1 |page=158}}</ref>\n\nPrevious jazz forms used [[harmonic]] structures, usually cycles of [[diatonic]] chords. When improvisation occurred, it was founded on the notes in the chords. Free jazz almost by definition is free of such structures, but also by definition (it is, after all, \"jazz\" as much as it is \"free\") it retains much of the language of earlier jazz playing. It is therefore very common to hear diatonic, [[altered dominant]] and [[blues]] phrases in this music.\n\nGuitarist [[Marc Ribot]] commented that [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Albert Ayler]] \"although they were freeing up certain strictures of bebop, were in fact each developing new structures of composition.\" <ref name=\"Ribot\">{{cite web |title=A Fireside Chat with Marc Ribot |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/a-fireside-chat-with-marc-ribot-marc-ribot-by-aaj-staff.php?page=1 |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=18 December 2018 |date=21 February 2004}}</ref> Some forms use composed melodies as the basis for group performance and improvisation. Free jazz practitioners sometimes use such material. Other compositional structures are employed, some detailed and complex.<ref name=\"Litweiler\" />{{rp|276}}\n\nThe breakdown of form and rhythmic structure has been seen by some critics to coincide with jazz musicians' exposure to and use of elements from non-Western music, especially African, Arabic, and Indian. The atonality of free jazz is often credited by historians and jazz performers to a return to non-tonal music of the nineteenth century, including [[field holler]]s, street cries, and jubilees (part of the \"return to the roots\" element of free jazz). This suggests that perhaps the movement away from tonality was not a conscious effort to devise a formal atonal system, but rather a reflection of the concepts surrounding free jazz. Jazz became \"free\" by removing dependence on chord progressions and instead using [[polytempic]] and [[polyrhythmic]] structures.<ref name=\"Southern\">{{cite book |last1=Southern |first1=Ellen |title=The Music of Black Americans |date=1997 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-97141-4 |pages=494\u2013497 |edition=3rd}}</ref>\n\nRejection of the bop aesthetic was combined with a fascination with earlier styles of jazz, such as [[dixieland]] with its collective improvisation, as well as African music. Interest in ethnic music resulted in the use of instruments from around the world, such as [[Ed Blackwell]]'s West African [[talking drum]], and [[Leon Thomas]]'s interpretation of pygmy yodeling.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=J.

Today such views are more marginal, and the music has built a body of critical writing.<ref name=\"Jost\">{{cite book |last1=Jost |first1=Ekkehard |title=Free Jazz |date=1974 |publisher=Universal Edition |isbn=9783702400132}}</ref>\n\nMany critics have drawn connections between the term \"free jazz\" and the American social setting during the late 1950s and 1960s, especially the emerging social tensions of racial integration and the [[civil rights movement]]. Many argue those recent phenomena such as the landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision in 1954, the emergence of the \"[[Freedom Riders]]\" in 1961, the 1963 [[Freedom Summer]] of activist-supported black voter registration, and the free alternative black [[Freedom Schools]] demonstrate the political implications of the word \"free\" in context of free jazz. Thus many consider free jazz to be not only a rejection of certain musical credos and ideas, but a musical reaction to the oppression and experience of [[black Americans]].<ref name=\"Gioia\">{{cite book |last1=Gioia |first1=Ted |title=The History of Jazz |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia |url-access=registration |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia/page/309 309\u2013311]}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlthough free jazz is widely considered to begin in the late 1950s, there are compositions that precede this era that have notable connections to the free jazz aesthetic. Some of the works of [[Lennie Tristano]] in the late 1940s, particularly \"[[Intuition (free improvisation)|Intuition]]\", \"Digression\", and \"Descent into the Maelstrom\" exhibit the use of techniques associated with free jazz, such as [[atonal]] collective improvisation and lack of discrete chord changes. Other notable examples of proto-free jazz include ''City of Glass'' written in 1948 by [[Bob Graettinger]] for the [[Stan Kenton]] band and [[Jimmy Giuffre]]'s 1953 \"Fugue\". It can be argued, however, that these works are more representative of [[third stream]] jazz with its references to [[contemporary classical music]] techniques such as [[serialism]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\nKeith Johnson of [[AllMusic]] describes a \"Modern Creative\" genre, in which \"musicians may incorporate free playing into structured modes\u2014or play just about anything.\"<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Keith |title=Modern Creative Music Genre Overview |url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/modern-creative-ma0000011987 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=18 December 2018 }}</ref> He includes [[John Zorn]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], [[Tim Berne]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and [[Ray Anderson (musician)|Ray Anderson]] in this genre, which continues \"the tradition of the '50s to '60s free-jazz mode\".<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\n[[Ornette Coleman]] rejected pre-written chord changes, believing that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression. His first notable recordings for [[Contemporary Records|Contemporary]] included ''[[Tomorrow Is the Question!]]'' and ''[[Something Else!!!!]]'' in 1958.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Ian |title=This is Our Music: Free Jazz, the Sixties, and American Culture |date=2007 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |location=Philadlephia |page=62}}</ref>  These albums do not follow typical 32-bar form and often employ abrupt changes in tempo and mood.<ref name=\"Shipton\">{{cite book |last1=Shipton |first1=Alyn |title=A New History of Jazz |url=https://archive.org/details/newhistoryofjazz00ship |url-access=registration |date=2001 |publisher=Continuum |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/newhistoryofjazz00ship/page/780 780]}}</ref>\n\nThe free jazz movement received its biggest impetus when Coleman moved from the west coast to New York City and was signed to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]. Albums such as ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'' and ''[[Change of the Century]]'' marked a radical step beyond his more conventional early work. On these albums, he strayed from the tonal basis that formed the lines of his earlier albums and began truly examining the possibilities of atonal improvisation. The most important recording to the free jazz movement from Coleman during this era, however, came with ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation|Free Jazz]]'', recorded in A&R Studios in New York in 1960. It marked an abrupt departure from the highly structured compositions of his past. Recorded with a double quartet separated into left and right channels, ''Free Jazz'' brought a more aggressive, cacophonous texture to Coleman's work, and the record's title would provide the name for the nascent free jazz movement.<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|314}}\n\nPianist [[Cecil Taylor]] was also exploring the possibilities of avant-garde free jazz. A classically trained pianist, Taylor's main influences included [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Horace Silver]], who prove key to Taylor's later unconventional uses of the piano.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|792}} ''Jazz Advance'', his album released in 1956 for Transition showed ties to traditional jazz, albeit with an expanded harmonic vocabulary. But the harmonic freedom of these early releases would lead to his transition into free jazz during the early 1960s. Key to this transformation was the introduction of saxophonist [[Jimmy Lyons]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]] in 1962 because they encouraged more progressive musical language, such as tone clusters and abstracted rhythmic figures. \nOn ''Unit Structures'' (Blue Note, 1966)<ref name=\"Allen\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Jim |title=Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians |url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/taylor-cecil |work=Taylor, Cecil |publisher=Jazz.com |access-date=2014-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701141201/http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/taylor-cecil |archive-date=2014-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Taylor marked his transition to free jazz, as his compositions were composed almost without notated scores, devoid of conventional jazz meter, and harmonic progression. This direction influenced by drummer Andrew Cyrille, who provided rhythmic dynamism outside the conventions of bebop and swing<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|319\u2013320}} Taylor also began exploring classical avant-garde, as in his use of prepared pianos developed by composer John Cage.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|794}}\n\n[[Albert Ayler]] was one of the essential composers and performers during the beginning period of free jazz. He began his career as a bebop tenor saxophonist in Scandinavia, and had already begun pushing the boundaries of tonal jazz and blues to their harmonic limits. He soon began collaborating with notable free jazz musicians, including Cecil Taylor in 1962. He pushed the jazz idiom to its absolute limits, and many of his compositions bear little resemblance to jazz of the past. Ayler's musical language focused on the possibilities of [[microtonal]] improvisation and extended saxophone technique, creating squawks and honks with his instrument to achieve [[multiphonic]] effects. Yet amidst Ayler's progressive techniques, he shows an attachment for simple, rounded melodies reminiscent of [[folk music]], which he explores via his more avant-garde style.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|795\u2013796}} \n\nOne of Ayler's key free jazz recordings is ''[[Spiritual Unity]]'', including his often recorded and most famous composition, ''Ghosts'', in which a simple spiritual-like melody is gradually shifted and distorted through Ayler's unique improvisatory interpretation. Ultimately, Ayler serves as an important example of many ways which free jazz could be interpreted, as he often strays into more tonal areas and melodies while exploring the timbral and textural possibilities within his melodies. In this way, his free jazz is built upon both a progressive attitude towards melody and timbre as well as a desire to examine and recontextualize the music of the past.<ref name=\"Kernfeld\">{{cite book |last1=Kernfeld |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Kernfeld |editor1-first=Barry |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz |date=2002 |publisher=Grove's Dictionaries |location=New York |isbn=1-56159-284-6 |pages=96\u201397 |volume=1 |edition=2nd }}</ref> \n\nIn a 1963 interview with ''Jazz'' Magazine, Coltrane said he felt indebted to Coleman.<ref name=\"Quersin\">{{cite book |last1=Quersin |first1=Benoit |editor1-last=Woideck |editor1-first=Carl |title=The John Coltrane companion : five decades of commentary |date=1998 |publisher=Schirmer Books |isbn=978-0028647906 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johncoltranecomp0000unse/page/123 123] |chapter=La Passe Dangereuse (1963) |url=https://archive.org/details/johncoltranecomp0000unse/page/123 }}</ref> While Coltrane's desire to explore the limits of solo improvisation and the possibilities of innovative form and structure was evident in records like ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', his work owed more to the tradition of [[modal jazz]] and [[post-bop]]. But with the recording of ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'' in 1965, Coltrane demonstrated his appreciation for the new wave of free jazz innovators.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />{{rp|114}} On ''Ascension'' Coltrane augmenting his quartet with six horn players, including Archie Shepp and Pharoah Sanders.<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|322}} The composition includes free-form solo improvisation interspersed with sections of collective improvisation reminiscent of Coleman's ''Free Jazz''.

As evidenced by his compositions on the 1956 record ''[[Sounds of Joy]]'', Sun Ra's early work employed a typical bop style. But he soon foreshadowed the free jazz movements with compositions like \"A Call for All Demons\" off of the 1955-57 record ''[[Angels and Demons at Play]]'', which combines atonal improvisation with Latin-inspired mambo percussion. His period of fully realized free jazz experimentation began in 1965, with the release of ''[[The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra]]'' and ''[[The Magic City (Sun Ra album)|The Magic City]].'' These records placed a musical emphasis on [[timbre]] and texture over meter and harmony, employing a wide variety of [[electronic instrument]]s and innovative [[percussion instrument]]s, including the electric [[Celesta|celeste]], [[Hammond B-3]], bass [[marimba]], harp, and [[timpani]]. As result, Sun Ra proved to be one of the first free jazz musicians to explore electronic instrumentation, as well as displaying an interest in timbral possibilities through his use of progressive and unconventional instrumentation in his compositions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kernfield |first=Barry |title=Sun Ra |url=http://0-www.oxfordmusiconline.com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J434800 |work=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe title song of Charles Mingus' ''[[Pithecanthropus Erectus (album)|Pithecanthropus Erectus]]'' contained one improvised section in a style unrelated to the song's melody or chord structure. His contributions were primarily in his efforts to bring back collective improvisation in a music scene that had become dominated by solo improvisation as a result of big bands.<ref name=\"Southern\" />\n\nBy the 1970s, the setting for avant-garde jazz was shifting to New York City. Arrivals included [[Arthur Blythe]], [[James Newton]], and [[Mark Dresser]], beginning the period of New York loft jazz. As the name may imply, musicians during this time would perform in private homes and other unconventional spaces. The status of free jazz became more complex, as many musicians sought to bring in  different genres into their works. Free jazz no longer necessarily indicated the rejection of tonal melody, overarching harmonic structure, or metrical divide, as laid out by Coleman, Coltrane, and Taylor. Instead, the free jazz that developed in the 1960s became one of many influences, including pop music and world music.<ref name=\"DeVeaux\">{{cite book |last1=DeVeaux |first1=Scott |title=Jazz |date=2009 |publisher=W.W.

Most successful recording artists today construct their works in this way: beginning with a strain with which listeners can relate, following with an entirely free portion, and then returning to the recognizable strain. The pattern may occur several times in a long selection, giving listeners pivotal points to cling to. At this time, listeners accept this \u2013 they can recognize the selection while also appreciating the freedom of the player in other portions. Players, meanwhile, are tending toward retaining a key center for the seemingly free parts. It is as if the musician has learned that entire freedom is not an answer to expression, that the player needs boundaries, bases, from which to explore.<ref name=tanner>{{cite book|last=Tanner|first=Paul O.

Musicians during this period believed that the [[bebop]], [[hard bop]], and [[modal jazz]] that had been played before them was too limiting. They became preoccupied with creating something new. Free jazz has often been combined with or substituted for the term \"[[avant-garde jazz]]\". Europeans tend to favor the term \"[[free improvisation]]\". Others have used \"modern jazz\", \"creative music\", and \"art music\".\n\nThe ambiguity of free jazz presents problems of definition. Although it is usually played by small groups or individuals, free jazz big bands have existed. Although musicians and critics claim it is innovative and forward looking, it draws on early styles of jazz and has been described as an attempt to return to primitive, often religious, roots. Although jazz is an American invention, free jazz musicians drew heavily from [[world music]] and ethnic music traditions from around the world. Sometimes they played foreign instruments, unusual instruments, or invented their own. They emphasized emotional intensity and sound for its own sake.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:Ornette Coleman.jpg|thumb|right|Ornette Coleman]]\n[[File:Pharoah Sanders photo.jpg|thumb|right|Pharoah Sanders]]\n\nSome jazz musicians resist any attempt at classification. One difficulty is that most jazz has an element of improvisation. Many musicians draw on free jazz concepts and idioms, and free jazz was never entirely distinct from other genres. But free jazz does have its own characteristics. [[Pharoah Sanders]] and [[John Coltrane]] used harsh overblowing or other extended techniques to elicit unconventional sounds from their instruments. Like other forms of jazz it places an aesthetic premium on expressing the \"voice\" or \"sound\" of the musician, as opposed to the classical tradition in which the performer is seen more as expressing the thoughts of the composer.\n\nEarlier jazz styles typically were built on a framework of song forms, such as [[twelve-bar blues]] or the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar AABA popular song form]] with chord changes. In free jazz, the dependence on a fixed and pre-established form is eliminated, and the role of [[improvisation]] is correspondingly increased.\n\nOther forms of jazz use regular [[metre (music)|meter]]s and pulsed rhythms, usually in 4/4 or (less often) 3/4. Free jazz retains pulsation and sometimes [[Swing music|swing]]s but without regular meter. Frequent [[wikt:accelerando|Accelerando]] and [[ritardando]] give an impression of rhythm that moves like a wave.<ref name=\"Litweiler\">{{cite book |last1=Litweiler |first1=John |title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 |date=1984 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=0-306-80377-1 |page=158}}</ref>\n\nPrevious jazz forms used [[harmonic]] structures, usually cycles of [[diatonic]] chords. When improvisation occurred, it was founded on the notes in the chords. Free jazz almost by definition is free of such structures, but also by definition (it is, after all, \"jazz\" as much as it is \"free\") it retains much of the language of earlier jazz playing. It is therefore very common to hear diatonic, [[altered dominant]] and [[blues]] phrases in this music.\n\nGuitarist [[Marc Ribot]] commented that [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Albert Ayler]] \"although they were freeing up certain strictures of bebop, were in fact each developing new structures of composition.\" <ref name=\"Ribot\">{{cite web |title=A Fireside Chat with Marc Ribot |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/a-fireside-chat-with-marc-ribot-marc-ribot-by-aaj-staff.php?page=1 |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=18 December 2018 |date=21 February 2004}}</ref> Some forms use composed melodies as the basis for group performance and improvisation. Free jazz practitioners sometimes use such material. Other compositional structures are employed, some detailed and complex.<ref name=\"Litweiler\" />{{rp|276}}\n\nThe breakdown of form and rhythmic structure has been seen by some critics to coincide with jazz musicians' exposure to and use of elements from non-Western music, especially African, Arabic, and Indian. The atonality of free jazz is often credited by historians and jazz performers to a return to non-tonal music of the nineteenth century, including [[field holler]]s, street cries, and jubilees (part of the \"return to the roots\" element of free jazz). This suggests that perhaps the movement away from tonality was not a conscious effort to devise a formal atonal system, but rather a reflection of the concepts surrounding free jazz. Jazz became \"free\" by removing dependence on chord progressions and instead using [[polytempic]] and [[polyrhythmic]] structures.<ref name=\"Southern\">{{cite book |last1=Southern |first1=Ellen |title=The Music of Black Americans |date=1997 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-97141-4 |pages=494\u2013497 |edition=3rd}}</ref>\n\nRejection of the bop aesthetic was combined with a fascination with earlier styles of jazz, such as [[dixieland]] with its collective improvisation, as well as African music. Interest in ethnic music resulted in the use of instruments from around the world, such as [[Ed Blackwell]]'s West African [[talking drum]], and [[Leon Thomas]]'s interpretation of pygmy yodeling.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=J.

Many argue those recent phenomena such as the landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision in 1954, the emergence of the \"[[Freedom Riders]]\" in 1961, the 1963 [[Freedom Summer]] of activist-supported black voter registration, and the free alternative black [[Freedom Schools]] demonstrate the political implications of the word \"free\" in context of free jazz. Thus many consider free jazz to be not only a rejection of certain musical credos and ideas, but a musical reaction to the oppression and experience of [[black Americans]].<ref name=\"Gioia\">{{cite book |last1=Gioia |first1=Ted |title=The History of Jazz |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia |url-access=registration |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia/page/309 309\u2013311]}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlthough free jazz is widely considered to begin in the late 1950s, there are compositions that precede this era that have notable connections to the free jazz aesthetic. Some of the works of [[Lennie Tristano]] in the late 1940s, particularly \"[[Intuition (free improvisation)|Intuition]]\", \"Digression\", and \"Descent into the Maelstrom\" exhibit the use of techniques associated with free jazz, such as [[atonal]] collective improvisation and lack of discrete chord changes. Other notable examples of proto-free jazz include ''City of Glass'' written in 1948 by [[Bob Graettinger]] for the [[Stan Kenton]] band and [[Jimmy Giuffre]]'s 1953 \"Fugue\". It can be argued, however, that these works are more representative of [[third stream]] jazz with its references to [[contemporary classical music]] techniques such as [[serialism]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\nKeith Johnson of [[AllMusic]] describes a \"Modern Creative\" genre, in which \"musicians may incorporate free playing into structured modes\u2014or play just about anything.\"<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Keith |title=Modern Creative Music Genre Overview |url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/modern-creative-ma0000011987 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=18 December 2018 }}</ref> He includes [[John Zorn]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], [[Tim Berne]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and [[Ray Anderson (musician)|Ray Anderson]] in this genre, which continues \"the tradition of the '50s to '60s free-jazz mode\".<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\n[[Ornette Coleman]] rejected pre-written chord changes, believing that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression. His first notable recordings for [[Contemporary Records|Contemporary]] included ''[[Tomorrow Is the Question!]]'' and ''[[Something Else!!!!]]'' in 1958.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Ian |title=This is Our Music: Free Jazz, the Sixties, and American Culture |date=2007 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |location=Philadlephia |page=62}}</ref>  These albums do not follow typical 32-bar form and often employ abrupt changes in tempo and mood.<ref name=\"Shipton\">{{cite book |last1=Shipton |first1=Alyn |title=A New History of Jazz |url=https://archive.org/details/newhistoryofjazz00ship |url-access=registration |date=2001 |publisher=Continuum |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/newhistoryofjazz00ship/page/780 780]}}</ref>\n\nThe free jazz movement received its biggest impetus when Coleman moved from the west coast to New York City and was signed to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]. Albums such as ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'' and ''[[Change of the Century]]'' marked a radical step beyond his more conventional early work. On these albums, he strayed from the tonal basis that formed the lines of his earlier albums and began truly examining the possibilities of atonal improvisation. The most important recording to the free jazz movement from Coleman during this era, however, came with ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation|Free Jazz]]'', recorded in A&R Studios in New York in 1960. It marked an abrupt departure from the highly structured compositions of his past. Recorded with a double quartet separated into left and right channels, ''Free Jazz'' brought a more aggressive, cacophonous texture to Coleman's work, and the record's title would provide the name for the nascent free jazz movement.<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|314}}\n\nPianist [[Cecil Taylor]] was also exploring the possibilities of avant-garde free jazz. A classically trained pianist, Taylor's main influences included [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Horace Silver]], who prove key to Taylor's later unconventional uses of the piano.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|792}} ''Jazz Advance'', his album released in 1956 for Transition showed ties to traditional jazz, albeit with an expanded harmonic vocabulary. But the harmonic freedom of these early releases would lead to his transition into free jazz during the early 1960s. Key to this transformation was the introduction of saxophonist [[Jimmy Lyons]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]] in 1962 because they encouraged more progressive musical language, such as tone clusters and abstracted rhythmic figures. \nOn ''Unit Structures'' (Blue Note, 1966)<ref name=\"Allen\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Jim |title=Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians |url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/taylor-cecil |work=Taylor, Cecil |publisher=Jazz.com |access-date=2014-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701141201/http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/taylor-cecil |archive-date=2014-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Taylor marked his transition to free jazz, as his compositions were composed almost without notated scores, devoid of conventional jazz meter, and harmonic progression. This direction influenced by drummer Andrew Cyrille, who provided rhythmic dynamism outside the conventions of bebop and swing<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|319\u2013320}} Taylor also began exploring classical avant-garde, as in his use of prepared pianos developed by composer John Cage.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|794}}\n\n[[Albert Ayler]] was one of the essential composers and performers during the beginning period of free jazz. He began his career as a bebop tenor saxophonist in Scandinavia, and had already begun pushing the boundaries of tonal jazz and blues to their harmonic limits. He soon began collaborating with notable free jazz musicians, including Cecil Taylor in 1962. He pushed the jazz idiom to its absolute limits, and many of his compositions bear little resemblance to jazz of the past. Ayler's musical language focused on the possibilities of [[microtonal]] improvisation and extended saxophone technique, creating squawks and honks with his instrument to achieve [[multiphonic]] effects. Yet amidst Ayler's progressive techniques, he shows an attachment for simple, rounded melodies reminiscent of [[folk music]], which he explores via his more avant-garde style.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|795\u2013796}} \n\nOne of Ayler's key free jazz recordings is ''[[Spiritual Unity]]'', including his often recorded and most famous composition, ''Ghosts'', in which a simple spiritual-like melody is gradually shifted and distorted through Ayler's unique improvisatory interpretation. Ultimately, Ayler serves as an important example of many ways which free jazz could be interpreted, as he often strays into more tonal areas and melodies while exploring the timbral and textural possibilities within his melodies. In this way, his free jazz is built upon both a progressive attitude towards melody and timbre as well as a desire to examine and recontextualize the music of the past.<ref name=\"Kernfeld\">{{cite book |last1=Kernfeld |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Kernfeld |editor1-first=Barry |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz |date=2002 |publisher=Grove's Dictionaries |location=New York |isbn=1-56159-284-6 |pages=96\u201397 |volume=1 |edition=2nd }}</ref> \n\nIn a 1963 interview with ''Jazz'' Magazine, Coltrane said he felt indebted to Coleman.<ref name=\"Quersin\">{{cite book |last1=Quersin |first1=Benoit |editor1-last=Woideck |editor1-first=Carl |title=The John Coltrane companion : five decades of commentary |date=1998 |publisher=Schirmer Books |isbn=978-0028647906 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johncoltranecomp0000unse/page/123 123] |chapter=La Passe Dangereuse (1963) |url=https://archive.org/details/johncoltranecomp0000unse/page/123 }}</ref> While Coltrane's desire to explore the limits of solo improvisation and the possibilities of innovative form and structure was evident in records like ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', his work owed more to the tradition of [[modal jazz]] and [[post-bop]]. But with the recording of ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'' in 1965, Coltrane demonstrated his appreciation for the new wave of free jazz innovators.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />{{rp|114}} On ''Ascension'' Coltrane augmenting his quartet with six horn players, including Archie Shepp and Pharoah Sanders.<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|322}} The composition includes free-form solo improvisation interspersed with sections of collective improvisation reminiscent of Coleman's ''Free Jazz''.

Coltrane continued to explore the avant-garde in his following compositions, including such albums as [[Om (John Coltrane album)|''Om'']], ''[[Kulu Se Mama]]'', and [[Meditations (John Coltrane album)|''Meditations'']], as well as collaborating with [[John Tchicai]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|322}} <ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|797}} \n\nMuch of [[Sun Ra]]'s music could be classified as free jazz, especially his work from the 1960s, although Sun Ra said repeatedly that his music was written and boasted that what he wrote sounded more free than what \"the freedom boys\" played.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Jazz Book: From Ragtime to the 21st Century |last1=Berendt |first1=Joachim-Ernst |last2=Huesmann |first2=G\u00fcnther |publisher=Lawrence Hill Books, Chicago Review Press |year=2009 |page=28 }}</ref> ''The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra'' (1965) was steeped in what could be referred to as a new black mysticism.<ref name=\"Southern\" /> But Sun Ra's penchant for nonconformity aside, he was along with Coleman and Taylor an integral voice to the formation of new jazz styles during the 1960s. As evidenced by his compositions on the 1956 record ''[[Sounds of Joy]]'', Sun Ra's early work employed a typical bop style. But he soon foreshadowed the free jazz movements with compositions like \"A Call for All Demons\" off of the 1955-57 record ''[[Angels and Demons at Play]]'', which combines atonal improvisation with Latin-inspired mambo percussion. His period of fully realized free jazz experimentation began in 1965, with the release of ''[[The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra]]'' and ''[[The Magic City (Sun Ra album)|The Magic City]].'' These records placed a musical emphasis on [[timbre]] and texture over meter and harmony, employing a wide variety of [[electronic instrument]]s and innovative [[percussion instrument]]s, including the electric [[Celesta|celeste]], [[Hammond B-3]], bass [[marimba]], harp, and [[timpani]]. As result, Sun Ra proved to be one of the first free jazz musicians to explore electronic instrumentation, as well as displaying an interest in timbral possibilities through his use of progressive and unconventional instrumentation in his compositions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kernfield |first=Barry |title=Sun Ra |url=http://0-www.oxfordmusiconline.com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J434800 |work=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe title song of Charles Mingus' ''[[Pithecanthropus Erectus (album)|Pithecanthropus Erectus]]'' contained one improvised section in a style unrelated to the song's melody or chord structure. His contributions were primarily in his efforts to bring back collective improvisation in a music scene that had become dominated by solo improvisation as a result of big bands.<ref name=\"Southern\" />\n\nBy the 1970s, the setting for avant-garde jazz was shifting to New York City. Arrivals included [[Arthur Blythe]], [[James Newton]], and [[Mark Dresser]], beginning the period of New York loft jazz. As the name may imply, musicians during this time would perform in private homes and other unconventional spaces. The status of free jazz became more complex, as many musicians sought to bring in  different genres into their works. Free jazz no longer necessarily indicated the rejection of tonal melody, overarching harmonic structure, or metrical divide, as laid out by Coleman, Coltrane, and Taylor. Instead, the free jazz that developed in the 1960s became one of many influences, including pop music and world music.<ref name=\"DeVeaux\">{{cite book |last1=DeVeaux |first1=Scott |title=Jazz |date=2009 |publisher=W.W.

Most successful recording artists today construct their works in this way: beginning with a strain with which listeners can relate, following with an entirely free portion, and then returning to the recognizable strain. The pattern may occur several times in a long selection, giving listeners pivotal points to cling to. At this time, listeners accept this \u2013 they can recognize the selection while also appreciating the freedom of the player in other portions. Players, meanwhile, are tending toward retaining a key center for the seemingly free parts. It is as if the musician has learned that entire freedom is not an answer to expression, that the player needs boundaries, bases, from which to explore.<ref name=tanner>{{cite book|last=Tanner|first=Paul O.
