The population was 10,602 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Lakeville town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor geographic and demographic information on the village of North Lakeville, please see the article [[North Lakeville, Massachusetts]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lakeville MA Ancient House.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient House in Lakeville]]\nLakeville was settled in 1717 as a western parish of [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]].  It was incorporated as a separate town in 1853.  The town's name comes from the system of lakes in the town, including [[Assawompset Pond]], [[Great Quittacas Pond]], [[Little Quittacas Pond]], [[Pocksha Pond]], and [[Long Pond (Lakeville, Massachusetts)|Long Pond]].  Long Pond is the source of the [[Acushnet River]], and Assawompsett Pond is the source of the [[Nemasket River]], which feeds the [[Taunton River]]. [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] is headquartered in Lakeville.  Lakeville is also commonly referred to as \"The Promised Land.\"\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|93.6|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|76.6|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|17.0|km2|order=flip}}, or 18.17%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Kingston town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>  Lakeville is irregularly shaped, bordered by [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] to the northeast and east, [[Rochester, Massachusetts|Rochester]] to the southeast, [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] to the south and southwest, and [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]] and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] to the west.  Its borders with Taunton, Berkley and Freetown are also a central section of the western borders of Plymouth County.  Lakeville is roughly at the center of what is considered Southeastern Massachusetts, and is approximately {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], {{convert|20|mi}} north of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], {{convert|30|mi}} east of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and {{convert|40|mi}} south of [[Boston]].\n\nThe town's geography is dominated by its namesake lakes, which are referred to as \"ponds\" in general usage.  In addition to the main bodies of water and their feeder brooks and rivers, there are also several smaller ponds, as well as many brooks and swamps, including the Casual Swamp and the Cedar Swamp, which is protected as a part of the Assonet Cedar Swamp Wildlife Management Area, which is operated by the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]].  There are also several small conservation areas, four country clubs and two parks, including the Ted Williams Camp, which was once the site of a summer baseball camp run by [[Ted Williams]]. According to \"Lakeville, Massachusetts Gravestone Inscriptions 1711-2003\" by Jean Douillette, there are 31 known cemeteries in Lakeville, or almost 1 per square mile.\n\nThe body of [[John Sassamon]], advisor to Governor [[Josiah Winslow]], was discovered beneath the ice of Assawompsett Pond. He was believed to have been murdered, and three Native Americans were arrested. On the testimony of only one witness (contrary to English law, which required the testimony of at least two witnesses in a murder trial), the three were sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. When the sentence was carried out, Tobias, senior counselor to the [[Pokanoket]] sachem [[Metacomet|King Philip]], and a second supposed accomplice died. When the attempt was made to carry out the sentence on the third \"accomplice\" - Tobias's son - the rope broke and he was imprisoned, having first confessed to the killings. His confession is widely believed to have been coerced.\n\nThe death of John Sassamon and the subsequent trial and execution of the Native Americans - while not the cause of [[King Philip's War]] and the bloodshed that followed - nonetheless probably contributed to the ardor of the participants.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations | type=USA | state=collapsed\n | 1860|1160\n | 1870|1159\n | 1880|1008\n | 1890|935\n | 1900|958\n | 1910|1141\n | 1920|1419\n | 1930|1574\n | 1940|1780\n | 1950|2066\n | 1960|3209\n | 1970|4376\n | 1980|5931\n | 1990|7785\n | 2000|9821\n | 2010|10602\n | footnote=* = population estimate.

The \"new\" library is located behind the old town hall, just across Route 18 from its former location at the junction of Routes 18 and 105.  The town of Lakeville also has other services, such as a Council on Aging and a historical commission.\n\nOn the state level, Lakeville is represented in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] as a part of the Twelfth Bristol District.  The town is represented by Senator [[Michael J. Rodrigues]] (D-Westport), as a part of the First Bristol and Plymouth District, which also includes Fall River, Freetown, Rochester, Somerset, Swansea and Westport.<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/legis/citytown.htm Index of Legislative Representation by City and Town, from Mass.gov]</ref><ref>[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&L=5&L0=Home&L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&L2=Law+Enforcement&L3=State+Police+Troops&L4=Troop+D&sid=Eeops&b=terminalcontent&f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_d_msp_field_troop_d_station_d4&csid=Eeops Station D-4, SP Middleborough]</ref>\n\nOn the national level, Lakeville is a part of [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district]], and is currently represented by [[Joseph P.

Lakeville operates several schools for its school aged population.  [[Assawompsett Elementary School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grades K-3.  The [[George R. Austin Intermediate School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grade 4 and 5.  [[Freetown-Lakeville Middle School]] is operated jointly with Freetown for grades 6-8, and [[Apponequet Regional High School]] is jointly operated with Freetown for grades 9-12.  Apponequet's colors are navy, white, and red, their nickname is the \"Lakers,\" and their mascot was a [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] brave, but after a sensitivity issue among the faculty at Apponequet, it was changed to an \"A\".  The school, like several others in the region, used to use the spear logo made famous by [[Florida State University]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] for its athletics marks, but this was deemed to promote violence, so it was replaced with the \"A\".  Their teams compete in the South Coast Conference, and their chief rival is Old Rochester Regional High School in Mattapoisett.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Massachusetts Route 140]], a four-lane divided highway, passes through the town on its trip between [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] in nearby [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] and [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The town is also crossed by [[Massachusetts Route 18|Route 18]], [[Massachusetts Route 79|Route 79]] and [[Massachusetts Route 105|Route 105]], as well as a short, {{convert|0.4|mi|adj=on}} stretch of [[U.S. Route 44]] in the far northern point of town.  Route 79's eastern terminus is at its intersection with Route 105 on the town line.  Additionally, three exits of [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] are located just over the town line in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]], granting access to Routes 44, 18 and 105 (from north to south in order).\n\nIn addition to its highways, the terminus of the Middleborough-Lakeville Line of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA's]] commuter rail is along the town's border (the rail itself passes along the town line; the parking lots are entirely within Lakeville).  There is also a spur off that line, heading due west to Taunton, which is operated by [[CSX Transportation]].  This spur links the two main lines of the railroad in southeastern Massachusetts; the easternmost heads to [[Cape Cod]] via the line used by the MBTA, and the westernmost proceeds to split in Taunton, sending two lines towards [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and New Bedford, respectively.

The population was 10,602 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Lakeville town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor geographic and demographic information on the village of North Lakeville, please see the article [[North Lakeville, Massachusetts]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lakeville MA Ancient House.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient House in Lakeville]]\nLakeville was settled in 1717 as a western parish of [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]].  It was incorporated as a separate town in 1853.  The town's name comes from the system of lakes in the town, including [[Assawompset Pond]], [[Great Quittacas Pond]], [[Little Quittacas Pond]], [[Pocksha Pond]], and [[Long Pond (Lakeville, Massachusetts)|Long Pond]].  Long Pond is the source of the [[Acushnet River]], and Assawompsett Pond is the source of the [[Nemasket River]], which feeds the [[Taunton River]]. [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] is headquartered in Lakeville.  Lakeville is also commonly referred to as \"The Promised Land.\"\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|93.6|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|76.6|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|17.0|km2|order=flip}}, or 18.17%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Kingston town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>  Lakeville is irregularly shaped, bordered by [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] to the northeast and east, [[Rochester, Massachusetts|Rochester]] to the southeast, [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] to the south and southwest, and [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]] and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] to the west.  Its borders with Taunton, Berkley and Freetown are also a central section of the western borders of Plymouth County.  Lakeville is roughly at the center of what is considered Southeastern Massachusetts, and is approximately {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], {{convert|20|mi}} north of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], {{convert|30|mi}} east of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and {{convert|40|mi}} south of [[Boston]].\n\nThe town's geography is dominated by its namesake lakes, which are referred to as \"ponds\" in general usage.  In addition to the main bodies of water and their feeder brooks and rivers, there are also several smaller ponds, as well as many brooks and swamps, including the Casual Swamp and the Cedar Swamp, which is protected as a part of the Assonet Cedar Swamp Wildlife Management Area, which is operated by the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]].  There are also several small conservation areas, four country clubs and two parks, including the Ted Williams Camp, which was once the site of a summer baseball camp run by [[Ted Williams]]. According to \"Lakeville, Massachusetts Gravestone Inscriptions 1711-2003\" by Jean Douillette, there are 31 known cemeteries in Lakeville, or almost 1 per square mile.\n\nThe body of [[John Sassamon]], advisor to Governor [[Josiah Winslow]], was discovered beneath the ice of Assawompsett Pond. He was believed to have been murdered, and three Native Americans were arrested. On the testimony of only one witness (contrary to English law, which required the testimony of at least two witnesses in a murder trial), the three were sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. When the sentence was carried out, Tobias, senior counselor to the [[Pokanoket]] sachem [[Metacomet|King Philip]], and a second supposed accomplice died. When the attempt was made to carry out the sentence on the third \"accomplice\" - Tobias's son - the rope broke and he was imprisoned, having first confessed to the killings. His confession is widely believed to have been coerced.\n\nThe death of John Sassamon and the subsequent trial and execution of the Native Americans - while not the cause of [[King Philip's War]] and the bloodshed that followed - nonetheless probably contributed to the ardor of the participants.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations | type=USA | state=collapsed\n | 1860|1160\n | 1870|1159\n | 1880|1008\n | 1890|935\n | 1900|958\n | 1910|1141\n | 1920|1419\n | 1930|1574\n | 1940|1780\n | 1950|2066\n | 1960|3209\n | 1970|4376\n | 1980|5931\n | 1990|7785\n | 2000|9821\n | 2010|10602\n | footnote=* = population estimate.

The town has its own police department and a single [[fire station]], located next to the town hall.  The \"new\" library is located behind the old town hall, just across Route 18 from its former location at the junction of Routes 18 and 105.  The town of Lakeville also has other services, such as a Council on Aging and a historical commission.\n\nOn the state level, Lakeville is represented in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] as a part of the Twelfth Bristol District.  The town is represented by Senator [[Michael J. Rodrigues]] (D-Westport), as a part of the First Bristol and Plymouth District, which also includes Fall River, Freetown, Rochester, Somerset, Swansea and Westport.<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/legis/citytown.htm Index of Legislative Representation by City and Town, from Mass.gov]</ref><ref>[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&L=5&L0=Home&L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&L2=Law+Enforcement&L3=State+Police+Troops&L4=Troop+D&sid=Eeops&b=terminalcontent&f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_d_msp_field_troop_d_station_d4&csid=Eeops Station D-4, SP Middleborough]</ref>\n\nOn the national level, Lakeville is a part of [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district]], and is currently represented by [[Joseph P.

The junior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class II]]) senator, elected in 2013, is [[Ed Markey]].\n\n==Education==\nSince 1959, Lakeville has shared its school department with Freetown, creating the Freetown - Lakeville Regional School District. Lakeville operates several schools for its school aged population.  [[Assawompsett Elementary School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grades K-3.  The [[George R. Austin Intermediate School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grade 4 and 5.  [[Freetown-Lakeville Middle School]] is operated jointly with Freetown for grades 6-8, and [[Apponequet Regional High School]] is jointly operated with Freetown for grades 9-12.  Apponequet's colors are navy, white, and red, their nickname is the \"Lakers,\" and their mascot was a [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] brave, but after a sensitivity issue among one of the faculty at Apponequet, it was changed to an \"A\".  The school, like several others in the region, used to use the spear logo made famous by [[Florida State University]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] for its athletics marks, but this was deemed to promote violence, so it was replaced with the \"A\".  Their teams compete in the South Coast Conference, and their chief rival is Old Rochester Regional High School in Mattapoisett.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Massachusetts Route 140]], a four-lane divided highway, passes through the town on its trip between [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] in nearby [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] and [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The town is also crossed by [[Massachusetts Route 18|Route 18]], [[Massachusetts Route 79|Route 79]] and [[Massachusetts Route 105|Route 105]], as well as a short, {{convert|0.4|mi|adj=on}} stretch of [[U.S. Route 44]] in the far northern point of town.  Route 79's eastern terminus is at its intersection with Route 105 on the town line.  Additionally, three exits of [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] are located just over the town line in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]], granting access to Routes 44, 18 and 105 (from north to south in order).\n\nIn addition to its highways, the terminus of the Middleborough-Lakeville Line of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA's]] commuter rail is along the town's border (the rail itself passes along the town line; the parking lots are entirely within Lakeville).  There is also a spur off that line, heading due west to Taunton, which is operated by [[CSX Transportation]].  This spur links the two main lines of the railroad in southeastern Massachusetts; the easternmost heads to [[Cape Cod]] via the line used by the MBTA, and the westernmost proceeds to split in Taunton, sending two lines towards [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and New Bedford, respectively.  The New Bedford line also passes through the town on its west side.  The town has no air facilities of its own.  The nearest private airfield is in Taunton; the nearest regional airport is in New Bedford, and the nearest national and international airport is [[T. F. Green Airport]] in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Lakeville (Massachusetts)}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.lakevillema.org/ Town of Lakeville official website]\n* [http://www.lakevillelibrary.org/ Lakeville Public Library]\n* [http://www.wickedlocallakeville.com ''Lakeville Call''], local newspaper\n* Answer Book/Lakeville: [http://www.enterprisenews.com/lakeville/ \u201cEverything you need to know\u201d]\n* [http://www.hauntedlakeville.com/ A site about Lakeville's cemeteries]\n\n{{Plymouth County, Massachusetts}}\n{{Greater Boston}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Plymouth County, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Lakeville, Massachusetts|*Main]]\n[[Category:Towns in Massachusetts]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reword - you can't be \"among one\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeville,_Massachusetts"}
