His seminal work was ''The Geography of the Oceans''.\n\n==Family==\nJohn Francon Williams was the second son of Richard Williams (b. 1818 [[Llanllechid]]) and his wife Mary (b. 1822 [[Denbighshire]]). Richard and Mary were blessed with two further sons, William (b. 1843) and Henry (b. 1858), and two daughters, Mary Jr. (b. 1857)<ref>1861 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 43), Mary Williams (aged 39) and their children, William (aged 18), John (aged 7), Mary (aged 4), Henry (aged 3), residing at Cenfaes Terrace,[[Llanllechid]], (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)</ref> and Grace (b. 1862).<ref>1871 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 54), Mary Williams (aged 49) and their children, John (aged 17), Mary (aged 14), Henry (aged 13), and Grace (aged 9) residing at Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), [[Llanllechid]], (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)</ref> All the children were born in [[Llanllechid]], North Wales. The Williams family first lived at Cenfaes Terrace and then, as the family grew larger, moved to a stone cottage at 5 Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), one of a row of traditional terraced stone cottages in [[Llanllechid]], where all their immediate neighbours were also named Williams. The cottages positioned on a gentle slope had views directly overlooking the [[Ogwen Valley]] and the Snowdonian Mountains in the distance. Richard worked nearby as a slate quarryman (most probably) in [[Penrhyn Quarry]] located north of [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]] overlooking the [[River Ogwen]]. The Quarry was owned and run by the wealthy Dawkins-Pennant family who also owned [[Penrhyn Castle]] and most of the land in the area. Over time, Richard Williams was promoted to the role of 'Overlooker' (a term used in the 19th century for a superintendent or overseer)<ref>Obscure Old English Occupations:http://www.worldthroughthelens.com/family-history/old-occupations.php (retrieved 12 February 2018)</ref> at the slate quarry where he worked.\n\nDuring the next decade an increase of population in the area occurred due to the extension of slate and stone quarrying. In the [[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] (published in 1870-2), [[Llanllechid]] is described as thus: \"Llanllechid, a village, a parish, and a sub-district in Bangor district, Carnarvon. The village stands near the river Ogwen, 3\u00bd miles SW by S of Aber r. station, and 3\u00bd SE of Bangor; and has a post office under Bangor, and a fair on 29 October.\"<ref>[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] edited by Rev.

By the mid-1870s, as a young adult, John moved away from Wales to [[Northampton]] where he took up a post as a school teacher. It was in [[Northampton]] that John met his future wife Barbara.\n\nOn 8 July 1876, John married Barbara Balmain Dougall at St. Giles Church, [[Northampton]].<ref>1876 Marriage Certificate: Marriage solemnized at the Parish Church in the Parish of St Giles, Northampton \u2013 8 July 1876 \u2013 No. 29, between John Williams, School Master of Palmerston Road; father's name: Richard Williams (Overlooker at Slate Quarries), and Barbara Balmain Dougall; father's name John Dougall (manufacturer)</ref> The newlyweds first home was at Palmerston Road, Northampton.

Philip & Son of Liverpool and London, is entitled to be regarded as a special boon. Containing more than a hundred maps with brief but succinct notes and a capital index, the different countries of the world are revealed in all essential particulars with luminous perspicacity. The maps are fine specimens of engraving, and the letterpress clear and distinct. The author is Mr. J.

The production of this most useful work must have entailed a large outlay, but it cannot be doubted that, as it will supply a popular want, the sale will be enormous, and fully compensate the enterprising publishers for the cost and trouble incurred.

In his articles Williams emphasizes the importance of maps in the study of geography and accents the necessity for children to learn the art of map reading. \u2018Geography for all practical purposes of life is embodied in maps,\u2019 and follows on by declaring, \u2018Maps are to geography what notation is to music.\u2019 He advises the prospective teacher that; \u2018Every lesson must be thoughtfully and thoroughly prepared, and the more elementary the lesson the greater, and really, the need of careful preparation. Not everyone is a born teacher, but everyone engaged in teaching may, by diligent study and perseverance, gain by art what he has not by nature, and no subject affords such opportunities for the exercise and display of skill in the art of teaching as geography.\u2019<ref>''Child Life'', February 1891 Vol. 1 no 2: J.

Francon Williams. A series of 24 books in two different editions were published; the Imperial at 13 in. by 11 in. priced at 6d, or the slightly smaller Crown edition at 10 in. by 8 in. priced at 3d. Each book contained a complete full-coloured map and an uncoloured map for the student to colour in and to complete names etc., an outline map with coastlines and lines of latitude and longitude, and a blank sheet with the border of only the map. The books allowed the student to draw the maps repeatedly.<ref>''The Seaman\u2019s Medical Guide'', by Archibald Finlay, 1891, page 217, publ.

Francon Williams. The book retailed at 5s. A review in the ''[[Scotsman]]'' praised Williams for his \u2018unflagging vivacity and narrative power.

Francon Williams, 1893.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|A Compendium of Modern Geography by William Hughes and J. Francon Williams, 1893, published by [[George Philip & Son]], Liverpool & London]] \nIn 1893, [[George Philip & Son]] published the 866-page tome, ''A Compendium of Modern Geography \u2013 Physical \u2013 Political \u2013 Commercial'', by William Hughes and John Francon Williams. Williams writes in the preface of the book, \u2018This work, as the tile implies, is designed for the use of advanced students, and also as a work of reference for those who are engaged in teaching geography.\u2019 Compiling the book was a mammoth undertaking.  \u2018All the Countries of the World, as well as the Continents, are described in a sufficiently exhaustive manner to meet the requirements of almost all examinations in geography. Due prominence has been given to the Mountain and River Systems and other natural features; the present political condition of each State is indicated and, bearing in mind the fact the study of Commercial geography is daily becoming of greater importance, the Industry and Trade of the principal countries are dealt with in considerable detail.\u2019 Williams goes on to assure the reader, 'In the preparation of this work the best and most recent British and foreign authorities have been consulted, and no pains have been spared to make the book a reliable exponent of the geographical knowledge of the present day.'<ref>Preface in ''A Compendium of Modern Geography'' by William Hughes and J.

The Williams family is living in Wallasey in Cheshire. John Francon Williams (aged 37)</ref> this time to a freehold property in Mount Pleasant Road in [[Wallasey]], which he named Balmain, after his wife, whose middle name was Balmain.<ref>New Brighton Electoral Division, Wallasey Polling District, 1896 \u2013 John Francon Williams, Balmain, Mount Pleasant Road.</ref>\n\nIn the decade prior to the arrival of ''[[Pears' Cyclopaedia]]'' (1897), a much smaller work measuring 135 x 105&nbsp;mm was available. It sold for sixpence in cloth, or one shilling in leather hardback, and was extremely popular, selling 800,000 copies by 1896. Eli Lemon Sheldon (pen-name Dom Lemon) compiled the book. Its success led its publisher to create a series of similar little books that sold equally well. Number 36 in the series was ''A World Gazetteer'' compiled by John Francon Williams.<ref>George Philip 1888 Maps and John Francon Williams: Historyhttp://www.miniaturemaps.net/_webedit/uploaded-files/All%20Files/1851-1900/1888a%20Philip.pdf</ref> Williams' revised version had the same atlas, with slightly larger maps. [[George Philip & Son]] printed the book.\n\n===== Stories Illustrated =====\nIn 1897, Williams founded and edited the monthly magazine ''Stories Illustrated''.<ref>''Stories Illustrated'', a monthly magazine founded and edited by J. Francon Williams, London 1887/88 [[British Library]] archive, System number 002854273, General Reference Collection P.P.6018.fea.

A few months later, once ''Stories Illustrated'' was up and running, Williams increased its price to 3.1/2d. Being of similar format to ''Strand Magazine'', such competition irked Newnes and appears to have encouraged him to reach out and make Williams an offer to sell ''Stories Illustrated'' to him. Newnes had originally been inspired to create ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in 1891 as a competitor to the successful American monthly ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', which had now made inroads into the British market. In publishing ''Strand Magazin''e Newnes undercut ''Harper\u2019s'' price by 50 per-cent.<ref>''Revolutions from Grub Street: A History of Magazine Publishing in Britain'' by Howard Cox, Simon Mowatt, (publisher: OUP Oxford, 6 Mar. 2014) {{ISBN|978-0199601639}}, page 25</ref> Each publisher undercut the other in order to get higher sales. For whatever reason Williams accepted Newnes's offer to purchase ''Stories Illustrated'', the deal later transpired not to be what Williams had been assured. Newnes had bought ''Stories Illustrated'' to expand his growing catalogue after the recent floatation of his company on the [[London Stock Exchange]] had netted him \u00a31 million,<ref>''Sherlock Holmes My Life'' by Lawrence R. Spencer, (publisher: lulu.com, 20 Jan. 2011) {{ISBN|978-0557863518}} page 80-81 \u2013 the author discusses the \u00a31 million restructuring of George Newnes Ltd.</ref> the equivalent of which in 2019 would be over \u00a3128 million. The discrepancy of the \u00a330,000 undervaluation of the magazine came to light after the deal had been signed. As a result, a huge rift developed between Williams and Newnes. the matter was never resolved and led to a breakdown in friendship between the two men that lasted for the remainder of their lives.\n\n===Later career===\nBy late 1898, the Williams family had moved yet again and were now living in a detached house ''Fairlight'' in Forest Avenue, Chingford, London.<ref>Letter to [[John George Bartholomew]] from John Francon Williams, dated 17 November 1898, and addressed, Fairlight, Forest Avenue, Chingford, London \u2013 National Library Scotland \u2013 Map Division, 159 Causewayside, Edinburgh, EH91PH: J.

He would travel to [[Edinburgh]], [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leicester]], [[Manchester]], [[London]] and also abroad, primarily the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], pursuing and securing contracts for publishing houses. One of the houses he acted for in [[Edinburgh]] was [[John Bartholomew and Son]], which now belonged to his longtime friend, [[John George Bartholomew]]. Williams' eldest son John Jr. would accompany his father on some of these trips. John Jr. was noted as being a sickly child, \"who is much troubled with asthma and bronchitis.\"<ref>Letter written by John Francon Williams, dated 23 January 1899, to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]], in which Williams talks of his eldest son John, \"who is much troubled with asthma and bronchitis.\"</ref> In 1899, Williams's friend Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]] (a Liverpool ship-owner) of Messrs [[Elder Dempster Lines|Elder, Dempster & Co.]], kindly gave Williams's son John Jr. a voyage on one of his steamers to [[New Orleans]] in the hope that it would help with his medical condition.\n\nOne of the prime reasons why Williams travelled to the United States was to try and set up an Anglo-American Syndicate, which would help promote publishers, publishing houses and their products. Williams discusses this matter in a handwritten letter to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]].<ref>Letter written by John Francon Williams, dated 28 January 1899, to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]] in which Williams talks of setting up an Anglo-American Syndicate.</ref> In it he mentions his \"unavoidable connection\" with map-maker [[George Washington Bacon]], with whom he is working with on several projects, both editorial and administrative, and hopes that his friend Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]] (the millionaire ship-owner) might be interested in becoming a financial partner in the Syndicate. Williams was particularly keen to publish a Physical Atlas worldwide through the syndicate.\n\nIn 1899, Williams was commissioned by Mazawattee (publishers) to write a Gazetteer Pocket Atlas containing 9,000 to 10,000 places.<ref>In a handwritten letter from Williams to [[John George Bartholomew]] dated 3 January 1899 held in the [[National Library of Scotland]] Williams mentions his commission for the atlas by the Mazawattee company.</ref> Williams was also commissioned by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], (later 1st Viscount Northcliffe), founder of the ''Harmsworth Magazine'' (later known as the ''London Magazine''), to write a series of articles. His first article, published at the beginning of 1900, was entitled ''Then and Now: 1800\u20131900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time''. It was written to commemorate the advancement in engineering during the 19th century and to welcome the 20th century.<ref>Then and Now: 1800\u20131900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time, article by J.F.

From the manner John writes to his friend one assumes Bartholomew has agreed to produce the maps for the publication. Williams talks of submitting the project to [[George Philip & Son]] publishing house in the hope they might publish it. He also mentions an alternative publisher [[C. Arthur Pearson|C. Arthur Pearson Ltd.]] to submit it to as a \u2018second\u2019 placing as he personally knows [[C. Arthur Pearson]] and his managing partner Peter Keary. His concerns regarding copyright of the \u2018self-educator Atlas\u2019 have prompted Williams to confide in his friend that he intends to have his idea patented; \u2018I wouldn\u2019t dream of ever suggesting anything of the kind, but these huge administrative houses have the idea-absorption propensity so strongly developed that every possible means of legitimate protection is fully justified.\u2019 <ref>Handwritten letter from J.F.

John Francon Williams and his eldest son John Williams Jr. happened to be in Manchester attending to publishing business on 24 December and had arranged to spend Christmas Day with relatives and friends in [[Clackmannan]] in the [[Central Lowlands]] of Scotland. They decided to catch the overnight express train at Manchester, so that they could enjoy Christmas festivities in Clackmannan.\n\nAt 19 minutes to six in the morning, close to [[Hawes Junction]], the express train travelling at high speed smashed into an oncoming locomotive. The express train concertina'd and careered off the tracks. Except for two electrically lit sleeping cars, the coaches were lit by the Pintsch oil gas system. The impact broke the gas pipe in one of the front carriages and an explosion followed. Fire spread quickly through the wooden carriages killing twelve trapped and injured passengers.\n\nThe ''Dundee Courier'' on Tuesday 27 December in their coverage of the [[Hawes Junction rail crash]] reported: ''The news of the disaster occasioned considerable anxiety to the relatives of Mr John Francon Williams, a prominent and highly-respected resident of Clackmannan. Mr Williams and his eldest son Mr John Williams, were in business in Manchester, and had sent word to their friends in Clackmannan that they intended to travel North with the night express so as to arrive home on Saturday morning for Christmas. The fact that they did not put in an appearance in Clackmannan on Saturday, coupled with the news of the disaster, naturally aroused fears for their safety in the minds of their waiting relatives. Telegraphic communication was opened up with the hotel in Manchester where Mr Williams had been staying, and yesterday (26 December) it was ascertained that, though the father and son had fully intended travelling with the ill-fated express, through pressure of business they had been compelled to postpone their departure till Monday evening, an arrangement, which, in the light of what subsequently occurred, may be regarded as providential.'' <ref>''The Dundee Courier'', Tuesday 27 December 1910, p. 5 \u2013 Pathetic Scenes at Hawes Junction During Inquest on Victims of Express Disaster (report) \u2013 Clackmannan Gentleman's Providential Escape (retrieved 8 August 2017).</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBy 1911 John's landscape had changed dramatically.

His seminal work was ''The Geography of the Oceans''.\n\n==Family==\nJohn Francon Williams was the second son of Richard Williams (b. 1818 [[Llanllechid]]) and his wife Mary (b. 1822 [[Denbighshire]]). Richard and Mary were blessed with two further sons, William (b. 1843) and Henry (b. 1858), and two daughters, Mary Jr. (b. 1857)<ref>1861 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 43), Mary Williams (aged 39) and their children, William (aged 18), John (aged 7), Mary (aged 4), Henry (aged 3), residing at Cenfaes Terrace,[[Llanllechid]], (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)</ref> and Grace (b. 1862).<ref>1871 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 54), Mary Williams (aged 49) and their children, John (aged 17), Mary (aged 14), Henry (aged 13), and Grace (aged 9) residing at Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), [[Llanllechid]], (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)</ref> All the children were born in [[Llanllechid]], North Wales. The Williams family first lived at Cenfaes Terrace and then, as the family grew larger, moved to a stone cottage at 5 Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), one of a row of traditional terraced stone cottages in [[Llanllechid]], where all their immediate neighbours were also named Williams. The cottages positioned on a gentle slope had views directly overlooking the [[Ogwen Valley]] and the Snowdonian Mountains in the distance. Richard worked nearby as a slate quarryman (most probably) in [[Penrhyn Quarry]] located north of [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]] overlooking the [[River Ogwen]]. The Quarry was owned and run by the wealthy Dawkins-Pennant family who also owned [[Penrhyn Castle]] and most of the land in the area. Over time, Richard Williams was promoted to the role of 'Overlooker' (a term used in the 19th century for a superintendent or overseer)<ref>Obscure Old English Occupations:http://www.worldthroughthelens.com/family-history/old-occupations.php (retrieved 12 February 2018)</ref> at the slate quarry where he worked.\n\nDuring the next decade an increase of population in the area occurred due to the extension of slate and stone quarrying. In the [[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] (published in 1870-2), [[Llanllechid]] is described as thus: \"Llanllechid, a village, a parish, and a sub-district in Bangor district, Carnarvon. The village stands near the river Ogwen, 3\u00bd miles SW by S of Aber r. station, and 3\u00bd SE of Bangor; and has a post office under Bangor, and a fair on 29 October.\"<ref>[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] edited by Rev.

By the mid-1870s, as a young adult, John moved away from Wales to [[Northampton]] where he took up a post as a school teacher. It was in [[Northampton]] that John met his future wife Barbara.\n\nOn 8 July 1876, John married Barbara Balmain Dougall at St. Giles Church, [[Northampton]].<ref>1876 Marriage Certificate: Marriage solemnized at the Parish Church in the Parish of St Giles, Northampton \u2013 8 July 1876 \u2013 No. 29, between John Williams, School Master of Palmerston Road; father's name: Richard Williams (Overlooker at Slate Quarries), and Barbara Balmain Dougall; father's name John Dougall (manufacturer)</ref> The newlyweds first home was at Palmerston Road, Northampton.

In London influenza became epidemic for the second time about the end of April, and soon afterwards was widely distributed in England and Wales. The large towns in the north, together with London and Wales, suffered much more heavily in mortality than in the previous attack. In 1891 it was very sudden and extremely severe, the death-rate rising to 73.4 during the month of April, and subsiding with equal rapidity.

The book was written in collaboration with cartographer Professor [[William Hughes (geographer)]] [[FRGS]] and became the first publication in a successful run of works over the coming two decades by Williams for the publishing house George Philip & Son.

A glowing review of ''Philips' Handy Volume and Atlas of the World'' appeared in the ''West London Observer'' on Saturday 23 July 1887: \"In days when the facilities of locomotion are such that everybody runs about the world, and the process of what popularly known as 'globe-trotting' goes on to an extraordinary extent and in a systematic manner, a comprehensive volume, small, compact, admirably arranged, clearly printed and well bound, and which can be carried in the pocket, like that published by Messrs. Philip & Son of Liverpool and London, is entitled to be regarded as a special boon. Containing more than a hundred maps with brief but succinct notes and a capital index, the different countries of the world are revealed in all essential particulars with luminous perspicacity. The maps are fine specimens of engraving, and the letterpress clear and distinct. The author is Mr. J. Francon Williams FRGS and his name will be a sufficient guarantee for the correctness of the data furnished up to the period of publication. The production of this most useful work must have entailed a large outlay, but it cannot be doubted that, as it will supply a popular want, the sale will be enormous, and fully compensate the enterprising publishers for the cost and trouble incurred. We earnestly recommend the 'Handy Volume', not alone to travellers, but to all who have occasion in connection with literary pursuits, or the prosecution of business, 'to survey mankind from China to Peru,' or over those wider districts, which a century ago were practically beyond even a poets pen.\"<ref>''West London Observer'', Saturday 23 July 1887, p. 5 \u2013 Philips' Handy Volume and Atlas of the World'' (review).</ref>\n\nIn the late 1880s, Williams worked in conjunction with the publisher and editor [[George Newnes]] (Sir George Newnes, 1st Baronet) \u2013 now regarded as the founding father of popular journalism \u2013 during the years when Newnes was building his publishing empire.

Francon Williams. A series of 24 books in two different editions were published; the Imperial at 13 in. by 11 in. priced at 6d, or the slightly smaller Crown edition at 10 in. by 8 in. priced at 3d. Each book contained a complete full-coloured map and an uncoloured map for the student to colour in and to complete names etc., an outline map with coastlines and lines of latitude and longitude, and a blank sheet with the border of only the map. The books allowed the student to draw the maps repeatedly.<ref>''The Seaman\u2019s Medical Guide'', by Archibald Finlay, 1891, page 217, publ.

Williams writes in the preface of the book, \u2018This work, as the tile implies, is designed for the use of advanced students, and also as a work of reference for those who are engaged in teaching geography.\u2019 Compiling the book was a mammoth undertaking.  \u2018All the Countries of the World, as well as the Continents, are described in a sufficiently exhaustive manner to meet the requirements of almost all examinations in geography. Due prominence has been given to the Mountain and River Systems and other natural features; the present political condition of each State is indicated and, bearing in mind the fact the study of Commercial geography is daily becoming of greater importance, the Industry and Trade of the principal countries are dealt with in considerable detail.\u2019 Williams goes on to assure the reader, 'In the preparation of this work the best and most recent British and foreign authorities have been consulted, and no pains have been spared to make the book a reliable exponent of the geographical knowledge of the present day.'<ref>Preface in ''A Compendium of Modern Geography'' by William Hughes and J.

The Williams family is living in Wallasey in Cheshire. John Francon Williams (aged 37)</ref> this time to a freehold property in Mount Pleasant Road in [[Wallasey]], which he named Balmain, after his wife, whose middle name was Balmain.<ref>New Brighton Electoral Division, Wallasey Polling District, 1896 \u2013 John Francon Williams, Balmain, Mount Pleasant Road.</ref>\n\nIn the decade prior to the arrival of ''[[Pears' Cyclopaedia]]'' (1897), a much smaller work measuring 135 x 105&nbsp;mm was available. It sold for sixpence in cloth, or one shilling in leather hardback, and was extremely popular, selling 800,000 copies by 1896. Eli Lemon Sheldon (pen-name Dom Lemon) compiled the book. Its success led its publisher to create a series of similar little books that sold equally well. Number 36 in the series was ''A World Gazetteer'' compiled by John Francon Williams.<ref>George Philip 1888 Maps and John Francon Williams: Historyhttp://www.miniaturemaps.net/_webedit/uploaded-files/All%20Files/1851-1900/1888a%20Philip.pdf</ref> Williams' revised version had the same atlas, with slightly larger maps. [[George Philip & Son]] printed the book.\n\n===== Stories Illustrated =====\nIn 1897, Williams founded and edited the monthly magazine ''Stories Illustrated''.<ref>''Stories Illustrated'', a monthly magazine founded and edited by J. Francon Williams, London 1887/88 [[British Library]] archive, System number 002854273, General Reference Collection P.P.6018.fea.

A few months later, once ''Stories Illustrated'' was up and running, Williams increased its price to 3.1/2d. Being of similar format to ''Strand Magazine'', such competition irked Newnes and appears to have encouraged him to reach out and make Williams an offer to sell ''Stories Illustrated'' to him. Newnes had originally been inspired to create ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in 1891 as a competitor to the successful American monthly ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', which had now made inroads into the British market. In publishing ''Strand Magazin''e Newnes undercut ''Harper\u2019s'' price by 50 per-cent.<ref>''Revolutions from Grub Street: A History of Magazine Publishing in Britain'' by Howard Cox, Simon Mowatt, (publisher: OUP Oxford, 6 Mar. 2014) {{ISBN|978-0199601639}}, page 25</ref> Each publisher undercut the other in order to get higher sales. For whatever reason Williams accepted Newnes's offer to purchase ''Stories Illustrated'', the deal later transpired not to be what Williams had been assured. Newnes had bought ''Stories Illustrated'' to expand his growing catalogue after the recent floatation of his company on the [[London Stock Exchange]] had netted him \u00a31 million,<ref>''Sherlock Holmes My Life'' by Lawrence R. Spencer, (publisher: lulu.com, 20 Jan. 2011) {{ISBN|978-0557863518}} page 80-81 \u2013 the author discusses the \u00a31 million restructuring of George Newnes Ltd.</ref> the equivalent of which in 2019 would be over \u00a3128 million. The discrepancy of the \u00a330,000 undervaluation of ''Stories Illustrated'' appears to have come to light after Williams had signed the contract to sell the publication to Newnes. As a result, a huge rift developed between Williams and Newnes that lasted for the remainder of Williams's life.\n\n===Later career===\nBy late 1898, the Williams family had moved yet again and were now living in a detached house ''Fairlight'' in Forest Avenue, Chingford, London.<ref>Letter to [[John George Bartholomew]] from John Francon Williams, dated 17 November 1898, and addressed, Fairlight, Forest Avenue, Chingford, London \u2013 National Library Scotland \u2013 Map Division, 159 Causewayside, Edinburgh, EH91PH: J.

He would travel to [[Edinburgh]], [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leicester]], [[Manchester]], [[London]] and also abroad, primarily the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], pursuing and securing contracts for publishing houses. One of the houses he acted for in [[Edinburgh]] was [[John Bartholomew and Son]], which now belonged to his longtime friend, [[John George Bartholomew]]. Williams' eldest son John Jr. would accompany his father on some of these trips. John Jr. was noted as being a sickly child, \"who is much troubled with asthma and bronchitis.\"<ref>Letter written by John Francon Williams, dated 23 January 1899, to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]], in which Williams talks of his eldest son John, \"who is much troubled with asthma and bronchitis.\"</ref> In 1899, Williams's friend Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]] (a Liverpool ship-owner) of Messrs [[Elder Dempster Lines|Elder, Dempster & Co.]], kindly gave Williams's son John Jr. a voyage on one of his steamers to [[New Orleans]] in the hope that it would help with his medical condition.\n\nOne of the prime reasons why Williams travelled to the United States was to try and set up an Anglo-American Syndicate, which would help promote publishers, publishing houses and their products. Williams discusses this matter in a handwritten letter to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]].<ref>Letter written by John Francon Williams, dated 28 January 1899, to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]] in which Williams talks of setting up an Anglo-American Syndicate.</ref> In it he mentions his \"unavoidable connection\" with map-maker [[George Washington Bacon]], with whom he is working with on several projects, both editorial and administrative, and hopes that his friend Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]] (the millionaire ship-owner) might be interested in becoming a financial partner in the Syndicate. Williams was particularly keen to publish a Physical Atlas worldwide through the syndicate.\n\nIn 1899, Williams was commissioned by Mazawattee (publishers) to write a Gazetteer Pocket Atlas containing 9,000 to 10,000 places.<ref>In a handwritten letter from Williams to [[John George Bartholomew]] dated 3 January 1899 held in the [[National Library of Scotland]] Williams mentions his commission for the atlas by the Mazawattee company.</ref> Williams was also commissioned by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], (later 1st Viscount Northcliffe), founder of the ''Harmsworth Magazine'' (later known as the ''London Magazine''), to write a series of articles. His first article, published at the beginning of 1900, was entitled ''Then and Now: 1800\u20131900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time''. It was written to commemorate the advancement in engineering during the 19th century and to welcome the 20th century.<ref>Then and Now: 1800\u20131900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time, article by J.F.

From the manner John writes to his friend one assumes Bartholomew has agreed to produce the maps for the publication. Williams talks of submitting the project to [[George Philip & Son]] publishing house in the hope they might publish it. He also mentions an alternative publisher [[C. Arthur Pearson|C. Arthur Pearson Ltd.]] to submit it to as a \u2018second\u2019 placing as he personally knows [[C. Arthur Pearson]] and his managing partner Peter Keary. His concerns regarding copyright of the \u2018self-educator Atlas\u2019 have prompted Williams to confide in his friend that he intends to have his idea patented; \u2018I wouldn\u2019t dream of ever suggesting anything of the kind, but these huge administrative houses have the idea-absorption propensity so strongly developed that every possible means of legitimate protection is fully justified.\u2019 <ref>Handwritten letter from J.F.

John Francon Williams and his eldest son John Williams Jr. happened to be in Manchester attending to publishing business on 24 December and had arranged to spend Christmas Day with relatives and friends in [[Clackmannan]] in the [[Central Lowlands]] of Scotland. They decided to catch the overnight express train at Manchester, so that they could enjoy Christmas festivities in Clackmannan.\n\nAt 19 minutes to six in the morning, close to [[Hawes Junction]], the express train travelling at high speed smashed into an oncoming locomotive. The express train concertina'd and careered off the tracks. Except for two electrically lit sleeping cars, the coaches were lit by the Pintsch oil gas system. The impact broke the gas pipe in one of the front carriages and an explosion followed. Fire spread quickly through the wooden carriages killing twelve trapped and injured passengers.\n\nThe ''Dundee Courier'' on Tuesday 27 December in their coverage of the [[Hawes Junction rail crash]] reported: ''The news of the disaster occasioned considerable anxiety to the relatives of Mr John Francon Williams, a prominent and highly-respected resident of Clackmannan. Mr Williams and his eldest son Mr John Williams, were in business in Manchester, and had sent word to their friends in Clackmannan that they intended to travel North with the night express so as to arrive home on Saturday morning for Christmas. The fact that they did not put in an appearance in Clackmannan on Saturday, coupled with the news of the disaster, naturally aroused fears for their safety in the minds of their waiting relatives. Telegraphic communication was opened up with the hotel in Manchester where Mr Williams had been staying, and yesterday (26 December) it was ascertained that, though the father and son had fully intended travelling with the ill-fated express, through pressure of business they had been compelled to postpone their departure till Monday evening, an arrangement, which, in the light of what subsequently occurred, may be regarded as providential.'' <ref>''The Dundee Courier'', Tuesday 27 December 1910, p. 5 \u2013 Pathetic Scenes at Hawes Junction During Inquest on Victims of Express Disaster (report) \u2013 Clackmannan Gentleman's Providential Escape (retrieved 8 August 2017).</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBy 1911 John's landscape had changed dramatically.
