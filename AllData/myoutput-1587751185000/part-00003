According to a [[hadith]], observing the Ramadan fast is forbidden for [[menstruation|menstruating]] women.\n\nOther individuals for whom it is usually considered acceptable not to fast are those in battle, and travellers who intend to spend fewer than five days away from home. If the circumstance preventing fasting is temporary, a person is required to make up for the missed days after the month of Ramadan is over and before the next Ramadan arrives. Should the circumstance be permanent or present for an extended amount of time, one may recompense by feeding a needy person for every day missed.\n\nIf one does not fit into any category of exemption and breaks the fast out of forgetfulness, the fast is still valid.

It is also common for such meals to take place at Muslim [[soup kitchen]]s. The fast is broken with a date (when possible) following the tradition of Muhammad, or with water.\n\n==Rulings for a fasting person==\nLinguistically, the word fasting in the Arabic language means unconditional 'restraint' (imsak) from any action or speech during any time.\nAccording to the Sacred Law, fasting is the act of:\n\n=== refraining from entering anything into the body cavity; ===\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>refraining from engaging in sexual activity;\n</li>\n<li>refraining from immoral acts such as backbiting;\n</li>\n<li>from the time the sun begins to rise to the time the sun sets; </li>\n<li>accompanied with the intention of fasting; </li>\n<li>from individuals who are permitted to fast.</li>\n</ol>\n\n'Refraining from engaging in sexual activity' includes actual sexual intercourse and ejaculation caused by foreplay. 'Refraining from entering anything into the body cavity' refers to the acts of entering food, drink, or medicine into the body cavity, regardless of whether this is a typical item one would enter into the body cavity or not. Entering any of these substances inside the body cavity means that the substance enters into the throat, the intestines, the stomach, or the brain by way of the nose, the throat, the private parts, or open wounds. 'Whether deliberately or accidentally' excludes forgetful acts of eating, drinking, or sexual activity. 'From the time the sun begins to rise to the time the sun sets' refers to the true entering of the Fajr time to the entering of the Maghrib time. 'Accompanied with the intention of fasting' means that one must intend to fast in order to distinguish if one is really performing an act of worship or not when one refrains from eating, drinking, or having sexual intercourse. For example, if one were to merely stay away from food, drink, or sexual activity without an intention to fast, then this fast is not valid and does not count. 'From individuals who are permitted to fast' means that one must be free from a situation that would prevent the validity of one's fast, such as menstruation or lochia (post-natal bleeding).[Shurunbulali, Maraqi al-Falah; Ala al-Din Abidin, al-Hadiyya al-Alaiyya; Shurunbulali Imdad al-Fattah]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://central-mosque.com/index.php/Ramadhan/fiqh-of-fasting.html|title=Fiqh of Ramadhan & Fasting - Ramadhan - Fiqh|first=Central-Mosque|last=Administrator|website=central-mosque.com|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Differences in how Sunnis, Shias, and Sufis Observe Ramadan ==\nFor the most part, Sunnis and Shia\u2019s observe Ramadan the same way, but there are some differences. For one, Sunnis break their fast at sunset, once the sun is no longer visible, but there is still light in the sky. However, for Shias they wait to break after it gets completely dark.
