There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n* The size of the event\n* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point\n* Financial transparency\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the [[September 11 attacks]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.\n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released. In 2012, a round of negotiations between the FGG and GLISA ended after a mutually agreed deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122071856/http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |archivedate=November 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The board of GLISA unanimously agree to the proposal set forth by the negotiation teams, however the FGG board did not reciprocate.

In contrast, the Montreal World Outgames ended with $5.3 million (Canadian) of debt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn addition, the lack of attendees and participants at both events resulted in GLISA (the organization which heads the Outgames) changing the years of the event to precede the years of the Gay Games, {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}meaning that the World Outgames were held in 2009 in Copenhagen and the Gay Games held in Cologne in 2010, while the World Outgames were held in 2013 in Antwerp and Gay Games were held in 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n=== Media impact of AIDS on the Gay Games ===\nBefore and during the time of the 1986 Gay Games there was mass media about Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]) and how it was affecting the gay community.<ref name=\":1\" /> With the number of [[LGBT]] members at the Gay Games the founder Waddell took this time try and break the stereotype of the AIDS with a show of athleticism the Gay Games had to offer.<ref name=\":0\" /> This also was a time that volunteers would provide safe sex materials along with condoms to educate the public.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Sports}}\n* [[EuroGames|EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)]]\n* [[International Gay and Lesbian Football Association]]\n* [[List of LGBT sportspeople]]\n* [[Principle 6 campaign]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130929011426/http://www.gg9cle.com/ Gay Games Cleveland/Akron 2014]\n* [http://www.gaygames.org/ Federation of Gay Games]\n* [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5868750,00.html Postcard from Europe: Questioning the necessity of the Gay Games]\n* [http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00450.xml Minnesota lesbian/gay committee of the International Athletic Association archives]\n*  [http://www.vivomediaarts.com/archive/gay-games-iii/ Documentation of Celebration '90 Gay Games III held in Vancouver on VIVO Media Arts Centre's website]\n* [http://gaytodo.com/ Gay Ireland]\n\n{{Gay Games}}\n{{International multi-sport events}}\n\n[[Category:Gay Games]]\n[[Category:Quadrennial sporting events]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Multi-sport events]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1982]]\n[[Category:LGBT sports]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Gay Olympics|other events|Gay Olympics (disambiguation)}}\n{{Distinguish|Outgames}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2013}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[File:Gay Games 2006 End-Ceremony 03.jpg|thumb|300px|The Gay Games Closing Ceremony 2006 \u2013 Handing off the flag to the [[Cologne, Germany]] contingent, host of Gay Games 2010]]\nThe '''Gay Games''' is a worldwide sport and cultural event that promotes acceptance of [[sexual diversity]], featuring [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) athletes and artists.\n\nFounded as the '''Gay Olympics''', it was started in the United States in [[San Francisco, California]], in 1982, as the brainchild of Olympic decathlete (Mexico City 1968) and medical doctor [[Tom Waddell]], [[Rikki Streicher]],<ref>ROB MORSE, San Francisco Chronicle, Perspiration Condemnation for N.Y.

There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n* The size of the event\n* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point\n* Financial transparency\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the [[September 11 attacks]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.\n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released. In 2012, a round of negotiations between the FGG and GLISA ended after a mutually agreed deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122071856/http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |archivedate=November 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The board of GLISA unanimously agree to the proposal set forth by the negotiation teams, however the FGG board did not reciprocate.
