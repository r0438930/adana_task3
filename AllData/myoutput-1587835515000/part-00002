The first ''[[Steel Panthers (video game)|Steel Panthers]]'' game was released in 1995, and the most recent update was released in 2018 and is still updated regularly (yearly).\n\nPlayers control individual tanks and vehicles from a top-down perspective, on a map with a hexagonal overlay.  Infantry are mostly in squad/section (8-12 men) sized units, but some units, like snipers, can be controlled individually.  The whole force under a players control would typically be Battalion sized, but may be as small as a Platoon or Company, or as large as a Regiment/Brigade.\n\nThe games are [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] and are played against the AI or other humans via email or hotseat.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAs with other tactical turn-based wargames, the game features realistic military control, with the smallest common units being squads, up to a brigade sized force. The player takes control of nearly every aspects of warfare around his soldiers, from simple ammunition usage, to the morale, disposition, and command-chain of his troops.\n\nThe game features: packed single-battle scenarios and campaigns (either branched or linear), single battle generator, campaign generator, and long campaign generator.\n\nAll of the games in the series are quite similar in features and appearance. However, the third part in the original series is clearly distinct in that it offers [[platoon]]-size formations instead of the scale of individual [[tank]]s and squads of the other installments.\n\nThe games offer various modes of play: human vs. human ([[hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] or online), human vs. [[artificial intelligence|AI]] and [[Play-by-mail game|PBEM]] (play by [[email]]). The players receive historical military units at the beginning of a scenario and have the option to buy reinforcements with points earned in different ways. The units are then moved on a hexagon grid map similar to a large number of board and computerized wargames. In addition to ready-made battles and campaigns, players can customize single scenarios or create their own campaigns.\n\n==Series history==\nThe ''Steel Panthers'' series includes the following titles:\n\n*1995 ''[[Steel Panthers (video game)|Steel Panthers]]'' by Strategic Simulations\n**1996 ''Steel Panthers: Campaign Disk'' by Strategic Simulations\n**1997 ''Steel Panthers: Campaign Disk #2'' by Strategic Simulations\n*1996 ''[[Steel Panthers II: Modern Battles]]'' by Strategic Simulations\n**1996 ''Steel Panthers II: Modern Battles - Campaign Disk'' by Strategic Simulations\n*1997 ''[[Steel Panthers III: Brigade Command: 1939-1999]]'' by Strategic Simulations\n*1998 ''SP2WW2'' (''Steel Panthers II: World War 2'') by Camo Workshop\n**1999 ''SPWW2'' by Camo Workshop\n**2006 ''WinSPWW2'' by Camo Workshop, Distributed by Shrapnel Games\n*2000 ''Steel Panthers: World at War'' by Matrix Games\n*2002 ''SPMBT'' (''Steel Panthers: Main Battle Tank'') by Camo Workshop\n**2005 ''WinSPMBT'' by Camo Workshop, Distributed by Shrapnel Games\n\nRights to the game and source code were acquired by both [[Matrix Games]] and the Camo Workshop.\n\nMatrix Games developed and released as a freeware a remake based on the ''Steel Panthers III'' engine (but limited to the timespan of World War II), ''Steel Panthers: World at War!''\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Steel Panthers (video game)|Steel Panthers]]'' was named the best wargame of 1995 by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' and ''[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]]''.<ref name=pcgamerusawards>{{cite journal |date=March 1996 | title=The Year's Best Games | pages=64, 65, 67, 68, 71, 73\u201375 | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | author=Editors of ''PC Gamer'' | volume=3 | issue=3 }}</ref><ref name=cgw1995>{{cite journal | author=Staff |title=The Computer Gaming World 1996 Premier Awards |journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=143 |date=June 1996 |pages=55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 67 }}</ref><ref name=cgm1995awards>{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | title=A Decade of Gaming; Award Winners of 1995 |date=November 2000 | issue=120 | pages=56\u201358, 60, 62, 66, 68, 70\u201376 }}</ref> The editors of ''PC Gamer US'' called it \"easily one of the best tactical simulations ever developed for the PC.\"<ref name=pcgamerusawards />\n\n''Steel Panthers'' and ''Steel Panthers II'' were named, collectively, the 62nd best computer game ever by ''PC Gamer UK'' in 1997.<ref name=pcgameruktop100>{{cite journal |author1=Flynn, James |author2=Owen, Steve |author3=Pierce, Matthew |author4=Davis, Jonathan |author5=Longhurst, Richard | journal=[[PC Gamer UK]] | title=The ''PC Gamer'' Top 100 |date=July 1997 | issue=45 | pages=51\u201383 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n|30em}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* ''Walker M.
