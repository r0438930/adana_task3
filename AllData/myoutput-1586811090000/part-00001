Patients tend to have three different levels of axillary lymph nodes; the level helps to determine whether or not the patient should undergo axillary dissection.\n\n== Appropriate Candidates for Treatment ==\nThis treatment is only appropriate for women who are node positive or who have tested positive for disease in the armpit area. Conducting the axillary dissection procedure on patients who are node negative can result in over-treatment and unnecessary procedures for patients to endure.<ref name=\":0\" /> To determine if a patient is permitted to receive treatment, the number of affected axillary nodes will have to be counted for. If there are only one or two affected guardian lymph nodes, then it may not be necessary for the patient to undergo the axillary dissection procedure.

Level I refers to lymph nodes located below the axillary vein or towards the very bottom end of the pectoralis minor muscle. Level II refers to lymph nodes located directly under the [[Pectoralis minor|pectoralis minor muscle]]. Level III refers to lymph nodes that are located over the pectoralis minor muscle and would require an intense procedure. Typically lymph nodes located in Levels I and II are removed with the axillary dissection. A mastectomy may also have to accompany this procedure in some cases depending on the patient.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Surgical procedures and techniques]]\n\n{{Surgery-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Surgical procedure that incises the axilla}}\n'''Axilliary dissection''' is a [[surgical procedure]] that incises the [[axilla]], usually in order to identify, examine, or take out [[lymph nodes]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dorling Kindersley illustrated family encyclopedia. |year=2002 |url=https://archive.org/details/dkillustratedfam00kind |url-access=registration |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=9780789488657}}</ref> The term \"axilla\" refers to the armpit or underarm section of the body.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/lymph_node_removal/axillary_dissection|title=Axillary Lymph Node Dissection|date=2018-09-19|website=Breastcancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> The axillary dissection procedure is commonly used in treating the underarm portion of women who are dealing with breast cancer.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2020-01-17|title=Axillary Dissection: Overview, Periprocedural Care, Technique|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1894763-overview}}</ref> The lymph nodes located in the axilla area that are affected by breast cancer are called the guardian or sentinel lymph nodes.
