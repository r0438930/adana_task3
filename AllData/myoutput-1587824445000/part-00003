Its [[working title]] was ''All Lovers Are Strangers''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6963ea0b|title=''Escort Girls'' (1974)|work=bfi.org.uk|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|location=London, UK|accessdate=6 October 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006120152/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6963ea0b|archivedate=6 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSet in London, the film tells six stories of people seeking companionship in the run-up to Christmas.\n\n*'''Hugh and Susan''' ([[David Dixon]] and Maria O'Brien): Hugh, a young office clerk, spends his Christmas bonus on a night out with Susan, a [[social escort]]. After dinner at an Italian restaurant, they take a taxi back to Susan's flat, where both admit their loneliness. Susan takes Hugh's virginity.\n*'''Mary and Barry''' ([[Helen Christie]] and Richard Wren): Mary is a wealthy widow whose outward pride conceals her inner loneliness. She takes a young [[male escort]], Barry, to a nightclub and then back to her hotel room. Barry is put off by Mary's overbearing nature and slips away while her back is turned, leaving her heartbroken.\n*'''Emma and Wayne''' (Marijke Mann and Gil Barber): Emma is a company director weary of the business world. As an amusement, she hires a male escort, Wayne, to accompany her to a high-level Christmas party. Returning to Emma's house, Emma and Wayne have sex.\n*'''Harvey and Sheila''' ([[Brian Jackson (actor)|Brian Jackson]] and Barbara Wise): Harvey Matelow is a corrupt businessman who books an escort, Sheila, to take with him to a casino. Later, he tricks his way into her flat and rapes her. He is interrupted by Sheila's boyfriend (Max Mason), who photographs him in the act and proceeds to blackmail him, stealing his money and threatening to publish the photographs if he goes to the police. Realising that he has been set up, the humiliated Harvey is kicked out of the flat. Left alone, Sheila and the boyfriend have sex.\n*'''Vicky and Lester''' ([[Veronica Doran]] and Ken Gajadhar): To impress her old school friends, Vicky shows up at a reunion accompanied by Lester, a black male escort who has agreed to pose as her fianc\u00e9. Over the course of the party, Vicky's female friends fantasise about Lester and discreetly pass him their telephone numbers. Back at Vicky's flat, Lester hesitantly indulges Vicky's interracial [[rape fantasy]].\n*'''James and Ian''' ([[David Brierly]] and James Hunter): James and Ian are Scotsmen visiting London for the first time. They pick up two women and take them to dinner at a restaurant, where they are shocked to see an exotic dancer (Teresa Van Ross) give an explicit solo [[sex show]]. Later, they pursue the two women for sex but are knocked to the ground and drunkenly pass out.\n\nIn the film's epilogue, the normally shy and reserved Hugh arrives at work and greets his female colleagues by cheerfully slapping one of them on the rear with his morning newspaper.\n\n==Critical response==\n[[Gavin Millar]] of ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' gave the film one star out of four. Reviews in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' were negative.<ref name=\"MFB\">{{Cite magazine |magazine=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |title=5 Critics on the Month's Films |date=December 1974 |editor1-last=Combs |editor1-first=Richard |publisher=British Film Institute |location=London, UK |volume=41 |issue=491 |oclc=2594020 |issn=0027-0407 }} Back cover.</ref>\n\nRichard Combs of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' described ''Escort Girls'' as a \"sexploiter with pretensions\" whose acting \"is better than might be expected.\" He added that Winter \"profitably pays as much attention to all the background flummery of the social settings ... as he does to the walking clich\u00e9s who inhabit them.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine |magazine=The Monthly Film Bulletin |title=''Escort Girls'' |date=June 1974 |last=Combs |first=Richard |editor1-last=Combs |editor1-first=Richard |publisher=British Film Institute |location=London, UK |pages=124-125 |volume=41 |issue=485 |oclc=2594020 |issn=0027-0407}}</ref>\n\n[[Duncan Fallowell]] of ''[[The Spectator]]'' questioned the choice of title, pointing out that the film features both [[Female escort|female]] and [[male escort]]s.
