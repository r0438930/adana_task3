She is often confused with the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] from the previous book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865), although the two are very different.\n\n== Overview ==\nWith a motif of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' being a representation of the game of [[chess]], the Red Queen could be viewed as an [[antagonist]] in the story as she is the [[queen (chess)|queen]] for the side opposing Alice. Despite this, their initial encounter is a cordial one, with the Red Queen explaining the rules of chess concerning [[Promotion (chess)|promotion]] \u2014 specifically that Alice is able to become a queen by starting out as a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]] and reaching the eighth square at the opposite end of the board. As a queen in the game of chess, the Red Queen is able to move swiftly and effortlessly.\n\nLater, in Chapter 9, the Red Queen appears with the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]], posing a series of typical Wonderland/Looking-Glass questions (\"Divide a loaf by a knife: what's the answer to ''that''?\"), and then celebrating Alice's promotion from pawn to queen. When that celebration goes awry, Alice turns against the Red Queen, whom she \"considers as the cause of all the mischief\", and shakes her until the queen morphs into Alice's pet [[kitten]].  In doing this, Alice presents an end game, awakening from the dream world of the [[mirror|looking glass]], by both realizing her hallucination and symbolically \"taking\" the Red Queen in order to [[checkmate]] the [[Red King (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red King]].\n\n==Confusion with the Queen of Hearts==\nThe Red Queen is commonly mistaken for the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] in the story's predecessor, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The two share the characteristics of being strict queens associated with the color red. However, their personalities are very different. Indeed, Carroll, in his lifetime, made the distinction between the two Queens by saying:\n{{quote|<poem>I pictured to myself the Queen of Hearts as a sort of embodiment of ungovernable [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] - a blind and aimless [[Erinyes|Fury]].\nThe Red Queen I pictured as a Fury, but of another type; her passion must be cold and calm - she must be formal and strict, yet not unkindly; pedantic to the 10th degree, the concentrated essence of all [[governess]]es!<ref>{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gardner|author2=Lewis Carroll |title=[[The Annotated Alice]]|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-517-18920-7|page=206}}</ref></poem>|source=[[Lewis Carroll]] in \"Alice on the Stage\"}}\n\nThe 1951 [[Walt Disney]] animated film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' perpetuates the long-standing confusion between the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts. In the film, the Queen of Hearts delivers several of the Red Queen's statements, the most notable of which is based on her \"all the ways about here belong to me\". Both characters say this to suggest importance and possible arrogance, but in the Red Queen's case it has a double meaning since her status as a chess-queen means that she can move in any direction she desires.\n\nIn both ''[[American McGee's Alice]]''<!-- In the American McGee game, the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts are two distinct characters/bosses. Alice must defeat the Red Queen first, and deposits a pawn on the chessboard to create a new White Queen in a certain stage. At the end of the game, Alice confronts the Queen of Hearts right after the killing of the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts, once defeated, reveals a second form whom Alice must defeat again. I remember both specifically while playing '''''because they were both a pain to kill! The Queen of Hearts doubly so!''''' There is no confusion between these two characters from what I remember in playing the game. --> and [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|film adaptation]] of the books, the characters are also combined, leading to further popular misconception. Also, [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s song \"[[White Rabbit (Jefferson Airplane song)|White Rabbit]]\" contains the lyric \"and the Red Queen's off with her head\", another instance of the two characters combined or mistaken for one another (as the phrase \"off with his/her head\" is constantly uttered only by the Queen of Hearts in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''). However, American McGee's game implies that after Alice was put into the asylum the Queen of Hearts and Red Queen fused together.\n\n==Popular culture==\n===''Alice in Wonderland'' (2010)===\n{{main|Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = The Red Queen\n| series             = [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)]]\n| image              = [[File:Queen of hearts 2010.jpg |250 px]]\n| caption            = [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as the Red Queen in Tim Burton's [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|2010 adaptation]]\n| creator            = [[Lewis Carroll]] & [[Tim Burton]]\n| portrayer          = [[Helena Bonham Carter]] (adult)<br/>Leilah de Meza (child)\n| first              = \n| last               = \n| full_name          = Iracebeth of Crims\n| occupation         = \n| family             = King Oleron (father)<br>Queen Elsemere (mother)<br>[[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Mirana of Marmoreal]] (sister)\n}}\nThe 2010 live-action film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', fashioned as a sequel to the novel, features [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as the Red Queen \n.<ref name=glove>{{cite news|first=Borys |last=Kit |title=Crispin Glover joins ''Alice in Wonderland'' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3icc3b73373ecfd4eb5c2cfcccbef7d905 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]] |date=October 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025204502/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3icc3b73373ecfd4eb5c2cfcccbef7d905 |archivedate=October 25, 2008 }}</ref> Bonham Carter's head was digitally increased three times its original size on screen.<ref name=\"animation\">{{cite news | first = Fred | last = Topel | url = http://crushable.com/entertainment/alan-rickman-talks-about-alice-in-wonderland/ | title = Alan Rickman talks about Alice in Wonderland | date = December 19, 2008 | work = Crushable.com] | accessdate = February 21, 2010}}</ref>\nBonham Carter's character is a combination of the Red Queen, the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] and the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]].<ref name=\"usatoday.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/l090623_alice_in_wonderland/flash.htm?gid=1057 | title = The inhabitants of 'Alice in Wonderland'  | work = [[USA Today]] | publisher=[[Gannett Company]] | date = June 23, 2009 | accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref>  From the original Red Queen, this character gets only a relationship to the White Queen.

The White Queen banishes the Red Queen to Outland where nobody is to say a word to her or show her any kindness. The Knave of Hearts is also banished and tries to kill the Red Queen only to be thwarted by the Mad Hatter. As the Red Queen and the Knave of Hearts are carried off to their exile, the Red Queen repeatedly shouts \"He tried to kill me\" while the Knave of Hearts begged for the White Queen to have him killed.\n\nIn the video game adaptation of the film, she plays a minor role, first appearing as a mere illustration. She is not seen in person until near the end of the game, first playing croquet and beheading the hedgehogs she uses as balls whenever they miss their target at her castle, and then again both before and after the battle with the Jabberwocky.\n\nIn the [[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|sequel of the 2010 film]], the Red Queen returns as the main antagonist and Bonham Carter reprises her role. In the film, the Red Queen currently lives in a castle made with vegetation and other things in Outland where she is still exiled. The Red Queen is the love interest of Time and the two ally: If he will give to her the powerful chronosphere and kill Alice she will give to him his love and they will rule the universe. When Alice steals the chronosphere to save Tarrant, the Red Queen orders Time to find her and kill her. The Red Queen's true past is discovered when Alice travels in time: as a child, she was continually bullied by her sister and her parents treated her like she was nothing and her sister was their preferred; one day the Red Queen was accused of eating tarts when it was her sister who ate them. During the tart fiasco, the Red Queen would fall and crash her head into a grandfather's clock where her head expands turning her into a crazy and hating person. At the day of the coronation, the Red Queen believed that Tarrant was laughing about her large head. When her father says that her sister will become the queen of Underland, she swears a horrible revenge on Tarrant. During the climax, both Queens are taken back in time where the Queens witnessing the tart event causes a paradox. Once Wonderland was saved from destruction, the White Queen apologizes for lying about the tarts and the two sisters reconcile.\n\n===''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland''===\n{{Main|Once Upon a Time in Wonderland}}\nThe Red Queen appears in ''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland'' (a spin-off to ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') portrayed by [[Emma Rigby]].

As the Red Queen and the Knave of Hearts are carried off to their exile, the Red Queen repeatedly shouts \"He tried to kill me\" while the Knave of Hearts begged for the White Queen to have him killed.\n\nIn the video game adaptation of the film, she plays a minor role, first appearing as a mere illustration. She is not seen in person until near the end of the game, first playing croquet and beheading the hedgehogs she uses as balls whenever they miss their target at her castle, and then again both before and after the battle with the Jabberwocky.\n\nIn the [[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|sequel of the 2010 film]], the Red Queen returns as the main antagonist and Bonham Carter reprises her role. In the film, the Red Queen currently lives in a castle made with vegetation and other things in Outland where she is still exiled. The Red Queen is the love interest of Time and the two ally: If he will give to her the powerful chronosphere and kill Alice she will give to him his love and they will rule the universe. When Alice steals the chronosphere to save Tarrant, the Red Queen orders Time to find her and kill her. The Red Queen's true past is discovered when Alice travels in time: as a child, she was continually bullied by her sister and her parents treated her like she was nothing and her sister was their preferred; one day the Red Queen was accused of eating tarts when it was her sister who ate them. During the tart fiasco, the Red Queen would fall and crash her head into a grandfather's clock where her head expands turning her into a crazy and hating person. At the day of the coronation, the Red Queen believed that Tarrant was laughing about her large head. When her father says that her sister will become the queen of Underland, she swears a horrible revenge on Tarrant. During the climax, both Queens are taken back in time where the Queens witnessing the tart event causes a paradox. Once Wonderland was saved from destruction, the White Queen apologizes for lying about the tarts and the two sisters reconcile.\n\n===''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland''===\n{{Main|Once Upon a Time in Wonderland}}\nThe Red Queen appears in ''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland'' (a spin-off to ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') portrayed by [[Emma Rigby]]. She is a character distinct from the [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Cora|Queen of Hearts]] ([[Barbara Hershey]]), who was her tutor in magic. Like the Queen of Hearts and the [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Jefferson|Mad Hatter]], the Red Queen is an \u00e9migr\u00e9 to Wonderland from the Enchanted Forest, having originally been a young woman named Anastasia, with whom [[Will Scarlet]] (the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]]) was in love. The Red Queen featured as one of the show's main antagonists, alongside [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]].\n\n===''Pandora Hearts''===\n{{Main|Pandora Hearts}}\nTwo characters from the [[manga]]/[[anime]] ''Pandora Hearts'' are based on the Red Queen, [[List of Pandora Hearts characters|Alice]] and [[List of Pandora Hearts characters|Lacie]], though Lacie has more in common with the Red Queen than Alice, who also has connections with [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]].\n\n===''American McGee's Alice'' and ''Alice: Madness Returns''===\n{{Main|American McGee's Alice|Alice: Madness Returns}}\nThe Red Queen is combined into the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] in the first game, ''American McGee's Alice''. The names are used interchangeably. \nHowever, in the second game, ''Alice: Madness Returns'', they are separated once more and the player meets the Queen of Hearts in her original form; the Red Queen is seen at the very beginning of the game as a flashback from Alice's memories of when The Red Queen reigned sovereign in Wonderland.\n\n===DC Comics===\nIn the third volume of ''Shazam!'', the Red Queen came from the Wozenderlands and is a member of the [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Monster Society of Evil]]. She was among its members imprisoned in the Dungeon of Eternity within the Monsterlands until Mister Mind instructed [[Doctor Sivana]] on how to free them.<ref>''Shazam!'' Vol. 3 #11.
