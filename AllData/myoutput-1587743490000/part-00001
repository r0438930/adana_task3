The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive [[pupa]]l stage in those groups that undergo  [[holometabolism|four-stage metamorphosis]].

Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the [[Paleozoic]] Era, including [[Meganisoptera|giant dragonflies]] with wingspans of 55 to 70&nbsp;cm (22 to 28&nbsp;in). The most diverse insect groups appear to have [[coevolution|coevolved]] with [[flowering plants]].\n\nAdult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming. As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles, composed of the front & rear on one side with the middle on the other side. Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight, and all flying insects derive from one common ancestor. Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with [[larval]] adaptations that include [[gill]]s, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming. Some species, such as [[Gerridae|water striders]], are capable of walking on the surface of water. Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some insects, such as [[earwig]]s, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young. Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Male [[moth]]s can sense the [[pheromone]]s of female moths over great distances. Other species communicate with sounds: [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]] [[Stridulation|stridulate]], or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males. [[Firefly|Lampyrid]] [[beetle]]s  communicate with light.\n\nHumans regard certain insects as [[Pest (organism)|pests]], and attempt to control them using [[insecticide]]s, and a host of other techniques. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves, fruits, or wood. Some species are [[parasitic]], and may [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] diseases. Some insects perform complex ecological roles; [[blow-flies]], for example, help consume [[carrion]] but also spread diseases. Insect [[Pollination|pollinators]] are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere would be devastated.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289001/insect |author=Vincent Brian Wigglesworth |title=Insect |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] online |accessdate=19 April 2012 |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504183402/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289001/insect |archivedate=4 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit.

The following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta.\n\nInsects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]], while Zygentoma and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not [[monophyletic]], with the family [[Lepidotrichidae]] being a [[sister group]] to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).<ref name=\"Classification of Insects\">{{cite book|last=Gilliott | first=Cedric | title=Entomology | publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | date=1995 | edition= 2nd | page=96 | isbn=978-0-306-44967-3 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=DrTKxvZq_IcC&pg=PA96}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Kapoor | first=V.C.C. | title=Principles and Practices of Animal Taxonomy | publisher=Science Publishers | date=1998 | edition= 1st | volume=1 | page=48 | isbn=978-1-57808-024-3}}</ref>\n\nPaleoptera and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called [[sclerite]]s, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based ([[Polyneoptera]] and [[Paraneoptera]]) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera have turned out to be more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders [[Mallophaga]] and [[Anoplura]] are derived from within [[Psocoptera]] has led to the new taxon [[Psocodea]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = K.

The thorax is made up of three segments: the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax. Each thoracic segment supports one pair of legs. The meso- and metathoracic segments may each have a pair of [[Insect wing|wings]], depending on the insect. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the [[digestion|digestive]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]], [[Excretion|excretory]] and reproductive internal structures.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\">{{cite book |last=Gullan |first=P.J. |author2=Cranston, P.S. |title=The Insects: An Outline of Entomology |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |year=2005 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-1-4051-1113-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781405111133 }}</ref>{{Rp|22\u201348}} Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.\n\n=== Segmentation ===\nThe [[head]] is enclosed in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or [[epicranium]], which contains most of the sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the [[Suture (anatomy)|sutures]] and [[sclerite]]s.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\">{{cite book |last=Resh |first=Vincent H. |author2=Ring T. Carde |title=Encyclopedia of Insects |publisher=Academic Press |location=U.S |date=2009 |edition= 2 |isbn=978-0-12-374144-8}}</ref> Here, the [[vertex (anatomy)|vertex]], or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a [[hypognathous]] and [[opisthognathous]] head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the [[ocellus|ocelli]] are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90\u00b0 to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />{{rp|13}}\n\nThe [[thorax]] is a tagma composed of three sections, the [[prothorax]], [[mesothorax]] and the [[metathorax]]. The anterior segment, closest to the head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or ''notum'') to distinguish it from the abdominal terga.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" /> The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, as well as the mesosternum and metasternum, are used.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />\n\nThe [[abdomen]] is the largest tagma of the insect, which typically consists of 11\u201312 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated from each other and from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called [[laterosternite]]s. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />\n\n==== Exoskeleton ====\nThe insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, is made up of two layers: the [[epicuticle]], which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no [[chitin]], and a lower layer called the [[procuticle]]. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and [[sclerotization|hardened]].<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|22\u201324}} The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many insects during their [[larva]]l stages, e.g., [[caterpillar]]s. It is also reduced in soft-bodied adult insects.\n\nInsects are the only [[invertebrate]]s to have developed active flight capability, and this has played an important role in their success.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|186}} Their flight muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible.\n\nHaving their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is efficient and allows more muscle connections.\n\n=== Internal ===\n\n==== Nervous system ====\nThe [[nervous system]] of an insect can be divided into a [[insect brain|brain]] and a [[ventral nerve cord]]. The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of [[ganglion|ganglia]], or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first three pairs of ganglia are fused into the brain, while the three following pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect's [[esophagus]], called the [[subesophageal ganglion]].<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|57}}\n\nThe [[thoracic]] segments have one ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments.

The present description focus on a generalized composition of the digestive system of an adult orthopteroid insect, which is considered basal to interpreting particularities of other groups.\n\nThe main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the [[alimentary canal]], which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the [[mouth]] to the [[anus]]. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|70\u201377}} The [[salivary gland]]s (element 30 in numbered diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web | title=General Entomology \u2013 Digestive and Excretory system | url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/digestive.html | publisher=NC state University | accessdate=3 May 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523024349/http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/digestive.html | archive-date=23 May 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Duncan1939\">{{cite book |last=Duncan |first=Carl D. |title=A Contribution to The Biology of North American Vespine Wasps|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |location=Stanford|year=1939 |edition= 1st |pages=24\u201329}}</ref> Some insects, like [[Diptera|flies]], have [[Mastication|extra-oral digestion]].

The foregut includes the [[buccal cavity]] (mouth), [[pharynx]], [[esophagus]] and [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]] and [[proventriculus]] (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|70}}\n\nDigestion starts in [[buccal cavity]] (mouth) as partially chewed food is broken down by saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and [[enzyme|carbohydrate-digesting enzymes]] (mostly [[amylase]]s), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.\n\nFrom there, the pharynx passes food to the esophagus, which could be just a simple tube passing it on to the crop and proventriculus, and then onward to the midgut, as in most insects. Alternately, the foregut may expand into a very enlarged crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a [[diverticulum]], or fluid-filled structure, as in some Diptera species.<ref name=\"Insect Physiology and Biochemistry\" />{{Rp|30\u201331}}\n\n[[File:Bee Squirt.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Bumblebee]] defecating. Note the contraction of the [[abdomen]] to provide internal pressure]]\n\n===== Midgut =====\nOnce food leaves the crop, it passes to the [[stomach|midgut]] (element 13 in numbered diagram), also known as the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called [[microvillus|microvilli]], increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.<ref name=\"Insect Physiology and Biochemistry\" />{{Rp|32}}\n\n===== Hindgut =====\nIn the [[hindgut]] (element 16 in numbered diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food particles are joined by [[uric acid]] to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% of the water in these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. Envaginations at the anterior end of the hindgut form the Malpighian tubules, which form the main excretory system of insects.\n\n==== Excretory system ====\nInsects may have one to hundreds of [[Malpighian tubule system|Malpighian tubules]] (element 20). These tubules remove nitrogenous wastes from the hemolymph of the insect and regulate osmotic balance. Wastes and solutes are emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|71\u201372, 78\u201380}}\n\n==== Reproductive system ====\n{{main|Insect reproductive system}}\nThe reproductive system of female insects consist of a pair of [[ovaries]], accessory glands, one or more [[spermatheca]]e, and ducts connecting these parts. The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes, called [[ovarioles]], which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can develop being also influenced by ovariole design. Female insects are able make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport and fertilization, as well as for protection of eggs. They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called [[ootheca]]e. Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />{{rp|880}}\n\nFor males, the reproductive system is the [[testis]], suspended in the body cavity by [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]] and the [[fat body]]. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct that leads to the outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or [[spermatogonia]], which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />{{rp|885}}\n\n==== Respiratory system ====\n[[File:Structural organization of the heart of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae - image.ppat.v08.i11.g001.png|thumb|The tube-like heart (green) of the mosquito ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' extends horizontally across the body, interlinked with the diamond-shaped [[insect wing#Muscles|wing muscles]] (also green) and surrounded by [[pericardium|pericardial cells]] (red). Blue depicts [[cell nuclei]].]]\n[[Respiratory system of insects|Insect respiration]] is accomplished without [[lung]]s. Instead, the [[Respiratory system of insects|insect respiratory system]] uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]] (element 8 in numbered diagram). In most insects, air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen and thorax called [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s.\n\nThe respiratory system is an important factor that limits the size of insects. As insects get larger, this type of oxygen transport is less efficient and thus the heaviest insect currently weighs less than 100&nbsp;g. However, with increased atmospheric oxygen levels, as were present in the late [[Paleozoic]], larger insects were possible, such as dragonflies with wingspans of more than two feet.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Keeps Bugs from Being Bigger?|date=8 August 2007|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|url=https://www1.aps.anl.gov/APS-Science-Highlight/2007/What-Keeps-Bugs-from-Being-Bigger|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514060330/https://www1.aps.anl.gov/APS-Science-Highlight/2007/What-Keeps-Bugs-from-Being-Bigger |archive-date=14 May 2017|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere are many different patterns of [[gas exchange]] demonstrated by different groups of insects.

The insect circulatory system is open; it has no [[vein]]s or [[artery|arteries]], and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses [[peristalsis|peristaltically]]. This dorsal blood vessel (element 14) is divided into two sections: the heart and aorta.

The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell ([[chorion]]) that consists of maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the [[amnion]] and the [[serosa]]. This serosa secretes a [[cuticle]] rich in [[chitin]] that protects the embryo against desiccation. In [[Schizophora]] however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Jacobs|first1= C.G.|last2= Rezende|first2= G.L.|last3= Lamers|first3= G.E.|last4= van der Zee|first4= M.|year= 2013|title= The extraembryonic serosa protects the insect egg against desiccation|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume= 280|issue= 1764|page= 20131082|pmid= 23782888|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.1082|pmc= 3712428}}</ref> Some species of insects, like the cockroach ''[[Blaptica dubia]]'', as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]].

There are two forms of metamorphosis: incomplete metamorphosis and complete metamorphosis.\n\n==== Incomplete metamorphosis ====\n{{Main|Hemimetabolism}}\n\n[[hemimetabolism|Hemimetabolous]] insects, those with incomplete metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing a series of [[ecdysis|molts]]. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] secretes a new [[epicuticle]] inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|142}}<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\">{{cite book |author1=Ruppert, E.E. |author2=Fox, R.S. |author3=Barnes, R.D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Invertebrate Zoology |publisher=Brooks / Cole |edition=7th |isbn=978-0-03-025982-1 |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/523 523\u2013524] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/523 }}</ref>\n\nImmature insects that go through incomplete metamorphosis are called [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] or in the case of dragonflies and damselflies, also [[Naiad (biology)|naiads]].

In these species, an egg hatches to produce a [[larva]], which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a [[pupa]], a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a [[pupa|cocoon]]. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|151}} Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle.

A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones.

The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position.

In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate.<ref name=\"Evans126\" /> Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as ''O. macklotti'' and ''Palophus centaurus'') are covered in mossy or [[lichen]]ous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Very rarely, a species may have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (''[[Bostra scabrinota]]''). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement [[crypsis]], a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death ([[catalepsy]]), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.<ref name=\"bedford\">{{cite journal|last=Bedford|first=Geoffrey O.|title=Biology and Ecology of the Phasmatodea|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|year=1978|volume=23|pages=125\u2013149|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.23.010178.001013}}</ref>\n\nAnother defense that often uses color or shape to deceive potential enemies is [[mimicry]]. A number of [[longhorn beetle]]s (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to [[wasp]]s, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless.<ref name=\"Evans126\" /> [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian]] and [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry|M\u00fcllerian]] [[mimicry]] complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as ''Batesian''. One of the most famous examples, where the [[viceroy butterfly]] was long believed to be a Batesian mimic of the inedible [[monarch butterfly|monarch]], was later disproven, as the viceroy is more toxic than the monarch, and this resemblance is now considered to be a case of M\u00fcllerian mimicry.<ref name=\"Ritland & Brower\" /> In M\u00fcllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility.

They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of M\u00fcllerian mimicry.

These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant [[pheromones]]. The study of pollination by insects is known as ''[[anthecology]]''.\n\n=== Parasitism ===\nMany insects are parasites of other insects such as the [[parasitoid]] wasps. These insects are known as [[entomophagous parasites]]. They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources. Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito.

Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic [[exoskeleton]] and development involves a series of [[Moulting|molts]]. The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive [[pupa]]l stage in those groups that undergo  [[holometabolism|four-stage metamorphosis]]. Insects that undergo [[hemimetabolism|three-stage metamorphosis]] lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of [[Nymph (biology)|nymphal]] stages.<ref name=\"mcgraw-hill\">\"insect physiology\" ''McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology'', Ch. 9, p. 233, 2007</ref> The higher level relationship of the [[Hexapoda|insects]] is unclear. Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the [[Paleozoic]] Era, including [[Meganisoptera|giant dragonflies]] with wingspans of 55 to 70&nbsp;cm (22 to 28&nbsp;in). The most diverse insect groups appear to have [[coevolution|coevolved]] with [[flowering plants]].\n\nAdult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming. As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles, composed of the front & rear on one side with the middle on the other side. Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight, and all flying insects derive from one common ancestor. Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with [[larval]] adaptations that include [[gill]]s, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming. Some species, such as [[Gerridae|water striders]], are capable of walking on the surface of water. Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some insects, such as [[earwig]]s, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young. Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Male [[moth]]s can sense the [[pheromone]]s of female moths over great distances. Other species communicate with sounds: [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]] [[Stridulation|stridulate]], or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males. [[Firefly|Lampyrid]] [[beetle]]s  communicate with light.\n\nHumans regard certain insects as [[Pest (organism)|pests]], and attempt to control them using [[insecticide]]s, and a host of other techniques. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves, fruits, or wood. Some species are [[parasitic]], and may [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] diseases. Some insects perform complex ecological roles; [[blow-flies]], for example, help consume [[carrion]] but also spread diseases. Insect [[Pollination|pollinators]] are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere would be devastated.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289001/insect |author=Vincent Brian Wigglesworth |title=Insect |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] online |accessdate=19 April 2012 |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504183402/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289001/insect |archivedate=4 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit.

The following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta.\n\nInsects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]], while Zygentoma and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not [[monophyletic]], with the family [[Lepidotrichidae]] being a [[sister group]] to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).<ref name=\"Classification of Insects\">{{cite book|last=Gilliott | first=Cedric | title=Entomology | publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | date=1995 | edition= 2nd | page=96 | isbn=978-0-306-44967-3 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=DrTKxvZq_IcC&pg=PA96}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Kapoor | first=V.C.C. | title=Principles and Practices of Animal Taxonomy | publisher=Science Publishers | date=1998 | edition= 1st | volume=1 | page=48 | isbn=978-1-57808-024-3}}</ref>\n\nPaleoptera and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called [[sclerite]]s, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based ([[Polyneoptera]] and [[Paraneoptera]]) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera have turned out to be more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota.

The thorax is made up of three segments: the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax. Each thoracic segment supports one pair of legs. The meso- and metathoracic segments may each have a pair of [[Insect wing|wings]], depending on the insect. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the [[digestion|digestive]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]], [[Excretion|excretory]] and reproductive internal structures.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\">{{cite book |last=Gullan |first=P.J. |author2=Cranston, P.S. |title=The Insects: An Outline of Entomology |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |year=2005 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-1-4051-1113-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781405111133 }}</ref>{{Rp|22\u201348}} Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.\n\n=== Segmentation ===\nThe [[head]] is enclosed in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or [[epicranium]], which contains most of the sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the [[Suture (anatomy)|sutures]] and [[sclerite]]s.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\">{{cite book |last=Resh |first=Vincent H. |author2=Ring T.

In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the [[ocellus|ocelli]] are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90\u00b0 to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />{{rp|13}}\n\nThe [[thorax]] is a tagma composed of three sections, the [[prothorax]], [[mesothorax]] and the [[metathorax]]. The anterior segment, closest to the head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or ''notum'') to distinguish it from the abdominal terga.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" /> The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, as well as the mesosternum and metasternum, are used.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />\n\nThe [[abdomen]] is the largest tagma of the insect, which typically consists of 11\u201312 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated from each other and from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called [[laterosternite]]s. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />\n\n==== Exoskeleton ====\nThe insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, is made up of two layers: the [[epicuticle]], which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no [[chitin]], and a lower layer called the [[procuticle]]. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and [[sclerotization|hardened]].<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|22\u201324}} The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many insects during their [[larva]]l stages, e.g., [[caterpillar]]s. It is also reduced in soft-bodied adult insects.\n\nInsects are the only [[invertebrate]]s to have developed active flight capability, and this has played an important role in their success.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|186}} Their flight muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible.\n\nHaving their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is efficient and allows more muscle connections.\n\n=== Internal ===\n\n==== Nervous system ====\nThe [[nervous system]] of an insect can be divided into a [[insect brain|brain]] and a [[ventral nerve cord]]. The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of [[ganglion|ganglia]], or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first three pairs of ganglia are fused into the brain, while the three following pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect's [[esophagus]], called the [[subesophageal ganglion]].<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|57}}\n\nThe [[thoracic]] segments have one ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment.

The present description focus on a generalized composition of the digestive system of an adult orthopteroid insect, which is considered basal to interpreting particularities of other groups.\n\nThe main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the [[alimentary canal]], which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the [[mouth]] to the [[anus]]. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|70\u201377}} The [[salivary gland]]s (element 30 in numbered diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web | title=General Entomology \u2013 Digestive and Excretory system | url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/digestive.html | publisher=NC state University | accessdate=3 May 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523024349/http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/digestive.html | archive-date=23 May 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Duncan1939\">{{cite book |last=Duncan |first=Carl D. |title=A Contribution to The Biology of North American Vespine Wasps|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |location=Stanford|year=1939 |edition= 1st |pages=24\u201329}}</ref> Some insects, like [[Diptera|flies]], have [[Mastication|extra-oral digestion]].

It can be divided into the [[foregut]], [[stomach|midgut]] and [[hindgut]].\n\n===== Foregut =====\n[[File:Malpighian tube.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Stylized diagram of insect digestive tract showing [[Malpighian tubule system|malpighian tubule]], from an insect of the order [[Orthoptera]]]]\nThe first section of the alimentary canal is the [[foregut]] (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of [[chitin]] and [[protein]]s as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the [[buccal cavity]] (mouth), [[pharynx]], [[esophagus]] and [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]] and [[proventriculus]] (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|70}}\n\nDigestion starts in [[buccal cavity]] (mouth) as partially chewed food is broken down by saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and [[enzyme|carbohydrate-digesting enzymes]] (mostly [[amylase]]s), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.\n\nFrom there, the pharynx passes food to the esophagus, which could be just a simple tube passing it on to the crop and proventriculus, and then onward to the midgut, as in most insects. Alternately, the foregut may expand into a very enlarged crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a [[diverticulum]], or fluid-filled structure, as in some Diptera species.<ref name=\"Insect Physiology and Biochemistry\" />{{Rp|30\u201331}}\n\n[[File:Bee Squirt.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Bumblebee]] defecating. Note the contraction of the [[abdomen]] to provide internal pressure]]\n\n===== Midgut =====\nOnce food leaves the crop, it passes to the [[stomach|midgut]] (element 13 in numbered diagram), also known as the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called [[microvillus|microvilli]], increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.<ref name=\"Insect Physiology and Biochemistry\" />{{Rp|32}}\n\n===== Hindgut =====\nIn the [[hindgut]] (element 16 in numbered diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food particles are joined by [[uric acid]] to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% of the water in these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. Envaginations at the anterior end of the hindgut form the Malpighian tubules, which form the main excretory system of insects.\n\n==== Excretory system ====\nInsects may have one to hundreds of [[Malpighian tubule system|Malpighian tubules]] (element 20). These tubules remove nitrogenous wastes from the hemolymph of the insect and regulate osmotic balance. Wastes and solutes are emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|71\u201372, 78\u201380}}\n\n==== Reproductive system ====\n{{main|Insect reproductive system}}\nThe reproductive system of female insects consist of a pair of [[ovaries]], accessory glands, one or more [[spermatheca]]e, and ducts connecting these parts. The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes, called [[ovarioles]], which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can develop being also influenced by ovariole design. Female insects are able make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport and fertilization, as well as for protection of eggs. They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called [[ootheca]]e. Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />{{rp|880}}\n\nFor males, the reproductive system is the [[testis]], suspended in the body cavity by [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]] and the [[fat body]]. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct that leads to the outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or [[spermatogonia]], which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.<ref name=\"ReshCarde2009\" />{{rp|885}}\n\n==== Respiratory system ====\n[[File:Structural organization of the heart of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae - image.ppat.v08.i11.g001.png|thumb|The tube-like heart (green) of the mosquito ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' extends horizontally across the body, interlinked with the diamond-shaped [[insect wing#Muscles|wing muscles]] (also green) and surrounded by [[pericardium|pericardial cells]] (red). Blue depicts [[cell nuclei]].]]\n[[Respiratory system of insects|Insect respiration]] is accomplished without [[lung]]s. Instead, the [[Respiratory system of insects|insect respiratory system]] uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]] (element 8 in numbered diagram). In most insects, air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen and thorax called [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s.\n\nThe respiratory system is an important factor that limits the size of insects. As insects get larger, this type of oxygen transport is less efficient and thus the heaviest insect currently weighs less than 100&nbsp;g. However, with increased atmospheric oxygen levels, as were present in the late [[Paleozoic]], larger insects were possible, such as dragonflies with wingspans of more than two feet.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Keeps Bugs from Being Bigger?|date=8 August 2007|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|url=https://www1.aps.anl.gov/APS-Science-Highlight/2007/What-Keeps-Bugs-from-Being-Bigger|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514060330/https://www1.aps.anl.gov/APS-Science-Highlight/2007/What-Keeps-Bugs-from-Being-Bigger |archive-date=14 May 2017|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere are many different patterns of [[gas exchange]] demonstrated by different groups of insects.

There are two forms of metamorphosis: incomplete metamorphosis and complete metamorphosis.\n\n==== Incomplete metamorphosis ====\n{{Main|Hemimetabolism}}\n\n[[hemimetabolism|Hemimetabolous]] insects, those with incomplete metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing a series of [[ecdysis|molts]]. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] secretes a new [[epicuticle]] inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|142}}<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\">{{cite book |author1=Ruppert, E.E. |author2=Fox, R.S. |author3=Barnes, R.D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Invertebrate Zoology |publisher=Brooks / Cole |edition=7th |isbn=978-0-03-025982-1 |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/523 523\u2013524] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/523 }}</ref>\n\nImmature insects that go through incomplete metamorphosis are called [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] or in the case of dragonflies and damselflies, also [[Naiad (biology)|naiads]].

In these species, an egg hatches to produce a [[larva]], which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a [[pupa]], a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a [[pupa|cocoon]]. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.<ref name=\"Gullan and Cranston\" />{{Rp|151}} Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle.

The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in [[cockroach]]es and [[ant]]s. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on.<ref name=\"Locomotion\">{{cite book | last=Biewener | first=Andrew A | title=Animal Locomotion | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-19-850022-3}}</ref> The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds.

Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.\n\nCockroaches are among the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks ([[Phasmatodea]]). A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water, especially members of the [[Water strider|Gerridae]] family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus ''[[Halobates]]'' even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ikawa, Terumi |author2=Okabe, Hidehiko |author3=Hoshizaki, Sugihiko |author4=Kamikado, Takahiro |author5=Cheng, Lanna |title=Distribution of the oceanic insects ''Halobates'' (Hemiptera: Gerridae) off the south coast of Japan |journal=Entomological Science | volume=7| issue=4| pages= 351\u2013357 |year=2004| doi=10.1111/j.1479-8298.2004.00083.x}}</ref>\n\n==== Use in robotics ====\n{{See also|Robot locomotion|Hexapod (robotics)}}\nInsect walking is of particular interest as an alternative form of locomotion in [[robot]]s.

The immature stages are small, move slowly or are immobile, and so all stages are exposed to [[predation]] and [[parasitism]].

These include [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]], toxicity and active defense.<ref name=\"Evans126\">{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Arthur V. |author2=Charles Bellamy |year=2000 |title=An Inordinate Fondness for Beetles |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-22323-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZZ_hfpMo8oAC&pg=PA31 |ref=refEvans}}</ref>\n\n[[Camouflage]] is an important defense strategy, which involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment.<ref>{{cite web|title = Photos: Masters of Disguise \u2013 Amazing Insect Camouflage|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140321-insects-fossil-camouflage-mimicry-pictures/|accessdate = 11 June 2015|date = 2014-03-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150612201555/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140321-insects-fossil-camouflage-mimicry-pictures/|archive-date = 12 June 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the [[leaf beetle]]s (family [[Chrysomelidae]]) or [[weevil]]s. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate.<ref name=\"Evans126\" /> Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as ''O. macklotti'' and ''Palophus centaurus'') are covered in mossy or [[lichen]]ous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Very rarely, a species may have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (''[[Bostra scabrinota]]''). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement [[crypsis]], a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death ([[catalepsy]]), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.<ref name=\"bedford\">{{cite journal|last=Bedford|first=Geoffrey O.|title=Biology and Ecology of the Phasmatodea|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|year=1978|volume=23|pages=125\u2013149|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.23.010178.001013}}</ref>\n\nAnother defense that often uses color or shape to deceive potential enemies is [[mimicry]]. A number of [[longhorn beetle]]s (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to [[wasp]]s, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless.<ref name=\"Evans126\" /> [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian]] and [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry|M\u00fcllerian]] [[mimicry]] complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as ''Batesian''. One of the most famous examples, where the [[viceroy butterfly]] was long believed to be a Batesian mimic of the inedible [[monarch butterfly|monarch]], was later disproven, as the viceroy is more toxic than the monarch, and this resemblance is now considered to be a case of M\u00fcllerian mimicry.<ref name=\"Ritland & Brower\" /> In M\u00fcllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility.

They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of M\u00fcllerian mimicry.

For example, because of its small size, short generation time and high [[fecundity]], the common fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is a [[model organism]] for studies in the [[genetics]] of higher [[eukaryote]]s. ''D. melanogaster'' has been an essential part of studies into principles like [[genetic linkage]], [[epistasis|interactions between genes]], [[chromosome|chromosomal]] genetics, [[evo-devo|development]], behavior and [[evolution]]. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like [[DNA replication]] or [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in fruit flies can help to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans.<ref name=\"Pierce\">{{cite book | title=Genetics: A Conceptual Approach | author=Pierce, BA | edition=2nd | publisher=W.H.

[[Food safety]] laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food, but rather limit their quantity. According to [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialist]] anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or livestock.\n\nDue to the abundance of insects and a worldwide concern of food shortages, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] considers that the world may have to, in the future, regard the prospects of eating insects as a food staple.
