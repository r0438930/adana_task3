The old [[Parish Priest]] of [[Lagonoy]], Fr. Salvador Mendoza, decided to build a church in a place called \"Cabayawasnan\" because of the presence of so many guava trees in the area. Unfortunately, the place was owned by Laurenciano Barcillano who refused to donate the land to the Church. However, through circumstances beyond his control, ownership was passed to the Church.\n\nThe construction of the church began in 1818 and there were only around thirty houses around the area. So, the priest sought the help of the people of Lagonoy. It was a cooperative effort of the people of [[Lagonoy]] who worked on the northern part and the people of Danlog on the southern part. Most of the materials and labor were either free or as payment for weddings and baptism.\n\nIn 1813, the town of San Jose was officially established under the name \"Patrocinio\" derived from the word \"Patron\", meaning model. Then it was changed to Patrocinio de San Jose in honor of its Patron Saint, San Jose de Patriarca. Later in 1883, it was shortened to \"San Jose\" which is now the official name. Its founders were Fr. Salvador Mendoza, then the Parish Priest of El Pueblo de Lagonoy and Don Macario Agustin, the first Capitan Municipal of the town.\n\nAfter the founding of the town, progress and development became eminent and this could be attributed to the cooperative efforts of the church and the state. In 1887, the foundations of the municipal building were laid when Venancio Obias was the Captain Municipal. His successors continued the work but the structure was completely destroyed by a very strong typhoon called \"Bagyong Ogis\", so named because the back of the trees were shredded of and trunks turned white in 1898. A big house owned by Capitan Gregorio Patrocinio was made the temporary \"tribunal.\"\n\nWhen the people of [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] decided to take up arms against the [[Spaniards]], Elias Angeles, then the leading \"Guard Civil\" of Naga convinced the people of San Jose to join the revolutionary movement. Ariston Prila, a \"cabeza de barangay\" from barangay [[Kinalansan]] heeded the call.\n\nIn the early part of 1903, when the Americans reached the town, there were a handful of revolutionaries led by Jose Valencia and Nicomedes Mata but they fled when they realized that their resistance was futile. The American Government was easily established and continued its pacification campaign while pursuing its goal of effecting changes in various aspects of the lives of the people.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Japanese soldiers reached the town in the latest of 1942. Most of the people had evacuated to the far-flung barangays and up to the mountains of Goa and Lagonoy while some joined the [[guerilla]] movement. Filipino-Japanese government continued with an appointed Mayor. [[Filipinos|Filipino]] volunteers manned the defense of the town hall which served as garrison while the Japanese Imperial Forces had Goa for its headquarters. Schools were ordered opened by the authorities to allay fears and to give confidence of the people.\n\nWith the end of the [[Pacific War]] and the celebration of Independence in 1946, the people slowly rehabilitated their lives from the ravages of the war and returned to their usual milieu with renewed vigor.\n\nMay 19 marks the annual celebration of the feast day of San Jose, the town's patron saint.\n\n==Geography==\nSan Jose has a total land area of 4,702.8146 hectares and is bounded in north by [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur|Lagonoy]], south by [[Tigaon, Camarines Sur|Tigaon]], east by [[Lagonoy Gulf]], and west by [[Goa, Camarines Sur|Goa]]. The whole town is roughly 0.27% of the region's 1.76 million hectares; 0.89% of the total land area of [[Camarines Sur]] with an area of 526.680 square kilometers; and 2.26% of the total land area of the 4th Congressional District of [[Camarines Sur]] with an area of 207,596.71 hectares.<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box|location = San Jose, Camarines Sur\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Mar high C = 30\n| Apr high C = 31\n| May high C = 32\n| Jun high C = 32\n| Jul high C = 31\n| Aug high C = 32\n| Sep high C = 31\n| Oct high C = 31\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Dec high C = 29\n| Jan low C = 23\n| Feb low C = 23\n| Mar low C = 23\n| Apr low C = 24\n| May low C = 25\n| Jun low C = 25\n| Jul low C = 25\n| Aug low C = 25\n| Sep low C = 24\n| Oct low C = 24\n| Nov low C = 24\n| Dec low C = 23\n| Jan precipitation mm = 189.5\n| Jan rain days = 18\n| Feb precipitation mm = 169.4 \n| Feb rain days = 14\n| Mar precipitation mm = 133.1 \n| Mar rain days = 14\n| Apr precipitation mm = 119.4 \n| Apr rain days = 13\n| May precipitation mm = 134.2\n| May rain days = 13\n| Jun precipitation mm = 221.2 \n| Jun rain days = 15\n| Jul precipitation mm = 200.5\n| Jul rain days = 17\n| Aug precipitation mm = 155 \n| Aug rain days = 14\n| Sep precipitation mm = 189 \n| Sep rain days = 16\n| Oct precipitation mm = 314.6 \n| Oct rain days = 22\n| Nov precipitation mm = 369.2 \n| Nov rain days = 23\n| Dec precipitation mm = 444 \n| Dec rain days = 24\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/san-jose-weather-averages/camarines-sur/PH.aspx\n| title = San Jose, Camarines Sur: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 6 December 2015}}</ref>\n| date=December 2015}}\n\nThe municipality belongs to Type II Climate<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> characterized by the absence of a dry season and very pronounced maximum rainfall from November to December. It is during these months that the Northeast monsoon season occurs and the [[cyclones|tropical cyclones]] contribute to the increased rainfall in the area. In January and February, the effect of these air masses on rainfall is considerably radical. In addition to the north-east monsoon during the months of February and March, the trail winds traveling from East to West do not give significant increase of rainfall. Likely, the month of May is the transition period between the monsoon that is prevalent from June to September. During the south-west monsoon season, the linear system called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITZ), brings the largest amount of rainfall to the area. In October, which is the transitive period between the south-west and north-east monsoons, the tropical cyclone brings considerable amount of rain.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe rainfall distribution in the municipality is greatly influenced by the air streams, tropical cyclones, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], shorelines, easterly waves and other rainfall-causing weather patterns.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> The rainfall season occurs from June to December with high rainfall intensity of 285.06mm to 474.22m and less rainfall intensity of 245.30mm to 224.06m from January to the month May which at the same time is the onset of effective rainfall with 75% probability and it would terminate in February of the following year which consequently during this period the mountainous areas receive higher intensity of rainfall. But the trend of monthly rainfall is unimodal (having one peak) and the maximum rain period is from October to December. On the other hand, the monthly average rainfall varies from 125.86mm to 594.56mm with a mean annual rainfall of 298.54mm.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe winds are influenced by the monsoon and the Pacific Trade System with Northeast direction that occurs in November to February; Easterly winds during the months of March, April, May and October; Southwest winds in June to August; and Westerly winds in September.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe maximum [[temperature]] during the month of January reaches about 27.9[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] while 31.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in November. The minimum [[temperature]] from December to June reaches about 20.6&nbsp;\u00b0C to 24.5&nbsp;\u00b0C; and the average monthly [[temperature]] is recorded at 25.0&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to 27.9&nbsp;\u00b0C in June.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\n[[Relative humidity]] is indicative of the amount of [[water vapor]] present in the [[atmosphere]]. [[Humidity]] in the [[Philippines]] as in the municipality of San Jose<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is high because of the warm moist air streams flowing over the [[archipelago]], the surrounding seas, rich vegetation and abundant rainfall. The lowest average [[humidity|relative humidity]] occurs in May with 85.9%; highest in February with 93.4%; and the annual average [[humidity]] is 90% which is higher than the regional and national average of 82%.\n\n====Typhoon and storm surges====\n\nThe [[cyclone|tropical cyclone]] is a climatic control that contributes largely to the rainfall from June to December.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> It was shown to usually cause maximum values of rainfall and winds as exemplified by the highest wind speed of 77 miles per second as recorded in [[Virac, Catanduanes]] areas during the height of [[Typhoon Joan (1970)|Typhoon Sening]] in 1970.\n\nThe tropical cyclones are internationally classified with these depending on their maximum wind speed or peak wind velocities (V) as follows:\n* Tropical Depression, V<33 knots (63&nbsp;km/h)\n* Tropical Storm, 33 knots < V < 47 k (87&nbsp;km/h)\n* Tropical Storm, 47 knots < u < 63 knots (116&nbsp;km/h)\n* Typhoon, u > 63 knots (116&nbsp;km/h)\n\nThe cyclones affecting the Philippine islands<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> originate from the [[Pacific Ocean]] East of the Islands between latitude 8 degrees North, 10 degrees South, traveling on a Westerly or Northwesterly course over the country. It has the highest sustained wind [[velocity]] of 6 knots in November to April and lowest sustained wind velocity of 4 knots in September. Note that the average cyclone that passes over mainland [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] which include San Jose town is 3 cyclones for every 2 years.<ref>Research Study by PAGASA (1948-1982)</ref>\n\n===Topography===\nThe terrain of the municipality<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is characterized as level to gently rolling and sloping. About 91.96% is characterized as having a generally flat terrain with a slope 0-3% which is described to be level to nearly level. It practically covers the entire land area of the town except barangay [[Adiangao]] which is located along the mountain range of [[Caramoan Peninsula]] which has an undulating to rolling terrain with 8.04% portions of steep slopes.\n\nThe elevation of the municipality<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is roughly 92.55% low to very low with a mean elevation from 0\u2013100 meters above sea level. Hence, low elevation is about 5.72% ranging from 100\u2013300 meters above sea level as well as 1.73% with moderately high elevation ranging from 300\u2013500 meters above sea level.\n\n===Geology===\nThe major part of the municipal area is composed of Alluvium River Terraces<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\">{{cite journal|last1=LGU San Jose|first1=MPDC|title=Brief  Profile of the Municipality of San Jose,  Camarines Sur|date=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which is particularly described as ''fluvicatile lacustrine alluvium'' composed of unsorted loosely consolidated pebbles, gravel, silt, coral debris and clay that can be found in flooded plains, riverbanks, sand bars, beaches, and tidal flats. It is notable that river terraces along the [[Lagonoy]] River and its tributaries which include also the Rangas River that practically originating from the foot of the [[Mount Isarog]] account for about 90.69% or 4,264.9826 hectares of the total land area of the municipality while the rest is of igneous and metamorphic rock origin of which volcanoclast alluvial fans cover about 0.19% or 8.94 hectares. These are specifically found in barangays [[Catalotoan]] and [[Salogon]]. Note that volcanoclast is a thick and extensive pyroclastic material consists of ashes, cinder lapili, tuff agromerate and volcanic debris while alluvial fans consists only of worked pyroclastics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Geological Table\n|-\n!

It is characterized as highly fractured and folded complex consisting of quartzite, quartzatedspathit and mica schists that cover roughly 5.26% or 247.37 hectares. Meanwhile, the lower part of the place is composed of sedimentary rocks known as crystalline limestone which covers about 3.86% or 181.53 hectares. Crystalline limestone is an extensive transgressive rectal carbonated facies including wall preserved bushes of corals, megafossils and algae structure, detritae to fuffacious limestone showing well developed karst landforms or formation that can be found prevalent in the [[Caramoan Peninsula]].<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/>\n\n===Landforms===\nThe many landforms<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> found in the municipality have been the natural production of the different geographical pressures of the different structural land forms such as alluvial lowland, alluvial fans, sedimentary plateau or masses of residual slopes and thick sedimentary landscapes. Most of its territorial areas are best characterized by broad alluvial plans described as level to nearly level, and moderately well-drained terraces. The level to undulating plains are the product of paludal environment or deltaic plains which are usually being flooded during slight and heavy downpours.\n\nOn the other hand, Barangay [[Adiangao]] is characterized by Shale/Sandstone Hills (SSH)<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which is described to be undulating to rolling, slightly to moderately dissected, and moistly top-rounded hills, both are low and high relief. Likewise, steep slopes are dissected closely with each other particularly those with greater than 18<sup>o</sup> inclinations. Meanwhile, V-shaped valleys are noted to have been composed and dominated by sandstone. Likewise, landforms in barangays [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], part of [[Minoro]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]] and [[Tagas]] are noted to be flat with very poorly drained terrains and oftentimes affected by floods caused by high tides. The coastal plains are most commonly swarmed with mangroves, nipa plants, break rides, swales and tidal flats.\n\n====Major Types of Land Management Units====\nThe municipality is composed of 5 major types of Land Management Units (LMUs)<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which are classified into 2 forms, namely: Warm Lowland and Warm Cool Hillyland. They are enumerated and explained below.\n\nWarm Lowland:\n* Tidal Flats (LMU 02) is very deep, fine loamy dark grayish brown but sometimes coarse loamy grayish soil, medium acid to mildly alkaline reaction, low available P and CaMg but adequate with O.M., constant extractable KBSP and CEC; generally moderate fertility level, very low infiltration and moderate to slow permeability rate, submerged and very poorly drained.\n* Beach Ridges and Swales (LMU 03) is shallow to moderately deep, very dark brown, coarse, and loamy underlain by sandy skeletal substratum; slightly acid to mutual moderate CaMg and CEC; available highly extractable K acid; BSP generally moderate fertility level; rapid to very rapid infiltration and rapid to moderate rapid permeability rate, and excessively drained.\n* Estuarin Plain (LMU 04) is deep to very deep clay, predominantly very dark brown, yellowish brown, coarse, loamy underlain by sandy skeletal substratum; medium acid to neutral soil reaction; moderate exchangeable K, high O.M. content, available P, BSP and CEC; generally high fertility level; slow to very slow infiltration and rapid to moderately rapid permeability rate, and moderately well to poorly drained.\n* Broad Plain (LMU 09) is moderately deep and sometimes shallow predominantly brown fine, loamy and sometimes coarse, loamy sub-soil underlain by coarse loamy skeletal stratum; strong acid to slightly acid, moderately available P, extractable K and Ca/Mg; adequate O.M. content CEC and BSP, moderate general fertility level; very slow to very rapid permeability rate, poorly to well drained, none to moderate flooding.\n\nWarm Cool Hillyland:\n* Shale/Sandstones Hills (LMU 70) is moderately shallow to very deep, predominantly dark, yellowish brown, and strong fine loamy and sometimes clayey subsoil underlain by skeletal substratum; medium soil to mildly alkaline reaction, low O.M. content and available P, high extractable K, Ca/Mg, BS and CEC generally moderate fertility level, slow to moderate permeability, moderate to well drained.\n\n===Soil classifications===\nThe soil map reveals that the municipality is composed of 9 soil types, namely:\n* [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]] Sandy clay loan and sandy loam\n* [[Minoro]] Loam\n* Venagre Clay loam and sandy loam\n* Huyon-huyon Sandy loam\n* [[Kinalansan]] Silty clay loam and Clay\n* Magsaysay Sandy Loam\n* San Miguel Silty Loam\n* Porous rocks & clay load\n* Sandy soil\n\nIt is also noted that the soil composition of the low-lying areas is rich loamy characterized as broad alluvial plains. However, the inherent soil fertility is generally moderate because of the moderate levels of calcium and magnesium contents that would be adequate for normal growth of crops. Meanwhile, the solids of the coastal plains are generally deep to poorly drained while beach ridges are shallow, coarse and loamy. These areas are noted to be moderately fertile due to low organic matter content; while some areas are poorly drained and prone to tidal floods usually occurring in barangays [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], and [[Kinalansan]].\n\nOn the other hand, soils that came from shales and sandstones can be found in barangay [[Adiangao]]. These are noted to be moderately shallow to moderately deep, fine loamy to clayey. Generally, it is high in fertility brought about by adequate levels of soil reaction, organic matter content, and permeability. However, soil limitations may include heavy texture, erosion hazard, surface stoniness as well as the presence of rock outcrops and shallow soils.\n\n===Soil Erosion and Landslide Susceptibility===\nThe lands that are prone to erosion account for about 8.04% of the total land area and they have slopes ranging from 30%-50%. However, the erosion map of the municipality revealed that only 8.49% of the total land area are observed to be slightly eroded while no apparent erosion occurred in the rest of the territory.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Erosion Hazard<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

However, there is a slight seasonal flooding or about 1.67% that usually occur in barangay [[Minoro]] and in the northern part of [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]] which covers about 78.54 hectares. The flood reaches a depth of less than 0.5 to 1.0 meter after heavy downpour. It would usually recedes within 12 hours to a maximum of one day. Likewise, seasonal flooding is moderately experienced in some portions of barangays [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Telegrafo]] and [[Calalahan]] with a depth of about 0.75 to 1.50 meters which would usually recedes within a few days only.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Flooding Hazard<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

Isarog]]. These rivers and creeks are most frequently being utilized not only for irrigation purposes of existing paddies but also for the day to day human activities such as bathing and washing.\n\n===Marine ecosystem===\nThe municipality has a total length of shoreline along the [[Lagonoy Gulf]] of 11.30&nbsp;km. which is about 3.15% of the 358.70&nbsp;km. of shoreline found within the 4th District of [[Camarines Sur]].<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> The fine beach sand in the area makes it suitable for natural harbors as well as refuge for ships and motorbancas during the peak of weather disturbances. Moreover, a variety of marine life and species are notably abounding in the municipal waters that provided a rich source of livelihood among coastal families. At present, there are two separate municipal ports, one located in barangay [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]] and the San Jose Fishing Port in Sitio Talisay, of barangay [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]]. They most frequently served as docking points for both inter-island passenger motorbancas and fishing vessels operating in [[Lagonoy Gulf]].\n\n===Land classification===\nThe entire land area of San Jose<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> with 4,702.8146 hectares is classified as alienable and disposable. The existing land use and vegetation is composed of 62.04% for Paddy rice irrigated with 90-100% dominant land use; 26.48% for Coconuts; 7.33% for Build-up areas; 2.54% for Mangrove-tree type; and 1.61% for Beach sand.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Slope Category<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

Forestry areas cover 414.7883 hectares, of which about 3.51% or 14.5787 hectares each compose the preservation forest and agro-forestry areas; while 19.61% or 81.3587 hectares are both mangrove trees and nipa plants categorized also as preservation areas. On the other hand, built-up areas is only about 7.05% of 331.5484 hectares of the total land area of the municipality.\n\nFurthermore, based on the Pedo-ecological Zone Map of the town, around 90.13% or 4,238.6468 hectares of the total land area are under the warm lowland zone with a slope not greater than 8% and elevation of 100 meters above sea level. In the same context, about 8.35% or 392.6850 hectares are categorized as warm cool hilly land, usually found in barangay [[Adiangao]]; and miscellaneous areas composed the so-called Miscellaneous areas which is about 1.52% or with a land area of about 71.4828 hectares.\n\nMeantime, the details on pedo-ecological zone based on the total land area<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> can be found in the table below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Pedo-Ecological Zone\n|-\n!

It has been known that the [[marble]] deposit in barangay [[Adiangao]] has an estimated volume of 71,772,912 metric tons; and it has been contained along the Maangas-Adiangao area and believed to be suitable for [[dimension]] stones.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThere is noted also a considerable amount of deposit of \"guano\" inside the [[Adiangao]] Caves. On the other hand, high quality sand, gravels and boulders are abundantly found along the Rangas River traversing barangays [[Bagacay]], [[Mampirao]], [[Pugay]], [[Calalahan]], [[Tambangan]] and [[Calawit]].\n\n===Volcanoes, Faults, and Earthquake Belt===\nThe  parallel location of the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Volcanic Belt]], or [[Philippine Fault System|Philippine Fault Zone]], to the [[Philippine Trench|Deep Philippine Trench]]<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> practically contributed to the triangulated distribution of events with faults or volcanic abnormalities within the earthquake belts in the Bicol Region. It has been observed that the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Volcanic Belt]] or Chain had a span of 240&nbsp;km. from [[Camarines Norte]] in the North down to [[Sorsogon]] in the South with a total of 16 volcanoes separately spread over by about 24&nbsp;km. apart and rested parallel along the 200&nbsp;km. chain west of the [[Philippine Trench]], which is the major source of earthquake in the region. The trench can be described as a long, narrow, and generally steep-sided very deep depression in the ocean floor. The axis of a trench marks, the position of a subduction zone where old oceanic lithospheric plates begin their descent into the earth's interior.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nIn 1987, a study was conducted which reveals that the [[Bicol Region]] particularly the location of San Jose is a part prone to earthquakes of intensify 5 from the above-cited source zones. Based on the frequency of volcanic eruptions that occurred in the region, there are three prominent volcanoes which are considered to be active, namely: [[Mayon Volcano|Mt. Mayon]], [[Mount Bulusan|Mt. Bulusan]], and [[Mount Iriga|Mt. Iriga (Asog)]]. The latter is the nearest to the Municipality of San Jose.\n\n[[Mount Iriga]] (Asog) has a peak of 1,143 meters above sea level and classified to be \"stratovolcanoe\" or it has a composite cone like that of [[Mayon Volcano|Mt. Mayon]] and last record of eruption was in 1628 A.D. which eventually damned the Barit River but consequently created the [[Lake Buhi]], the home of the smallest fish in the world with scientific name ''[[Pandaka pygmaea]]'' locally known as \"tabios.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\"\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of San Jose\n| 1903 = 8314\n| 1918 = 8710\n| 1939 = 10722\n| 1948 = 12788\n| 1960 = 16704\n| 1970 = 20343\n| 1975 = 21859\n| 1980 = 23898\n| 1990 = 27517\n| 1995 = 31362\n| 2000 = 32512\n| 2007 = 35768\n| 2010 = 38523\n| 2015 = 40623\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of San Jose, Camarines Sur, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nThe population projection was computed based on Geometric formula resulting to an average annual increase of 2.62%. Based on projections, the ten most populated barangays will be composed of [[Calalahan]], [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], [[Salogon]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Pugay]], [[Tagas]], [[Danlog]], [[Tambangan]], and [[Mampirao]]. As computed, the population projection by age group 22\u201335 years old registered the highest percentage share at 17.45% followed by 10-14 age cohort by 13.62%; 36\u201345 years old by 10.31%; 46\u201359 years old by 8.99%; and 7\u20139 years old by 8.85%.\n\n===Urban and rural population===\nIn 2010, the municipality has a total household population of 8,029 of which 995 or 12.39% are in the urban while 7,034 or 87.61% are in the rural area. Of the total population of 38,523, about 12.26% or 4,722 are in the urban while majority which is about 87.74% or 33,801 are residing in the rural area. It has an average household size of 5.38 members per household while population density of 691 persons per square kilometers; urban with 3,083 persons and rural with 618 persons per square kilometers, respectively.\n\nThe ten densely populated barangays in the municipality include [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], [[Salogon]], [[Calalahan]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Pugay]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Danlog]], [[Adiangao]], [[Tagas]], and [[Mampirao]] in that order.

Some are employed in the government and private offices and others are engaged in business, trading or are self-employed.\n\nA number of agro-related industries are present in San Jose, including welding shops, manufacturers of threshers, hand tractor, cart and plows, ice making and cold storage facilities, rural banks, and several rice mills.\n\nLocal products include:\n* [[Rice]] is the major agricultural crop grown.

Some stalls have already been occupied/rented while others remained vacant.\n\nThe proximity of the town to [[Goa, Camarines Sur|Goa]] which is considered as the major trading center in the [[Partido District]], and the low population level and the population growth rate of the municipality are considered to be the reasons for the underdevelopment of commerce and trade.

This includes the numerous beaches with crystalline clear water along the coastline of [[Lagonoy Gulf]] and the Adiangao Cave at barangay [[Adiangao]].\n\n==Heritage sites and buildings==\n\n===The municipal building===\n[[File:Main Entrance to the San Jose Municipal Building.png|thumb|Main Entrance to the San Jose Municipal Building]]\nCapitano Municipal Venancio Pe\u00f1as initiated the building of the municipal hall<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\">{{cite book|last1=Nieva|first1=Lourdes Lobis|title=San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride|date=February 2010|publisher=Local  Government of San Jose|location=San Jose, Camarines Sur|edition=1st}}</ref> during his term of office in 1877. His successors contributed to its completion, however, Typhoon \"Uguis\" hit the town in 1898 that caused the eventual destruction of the building. Several years after this calamity, the residence of Gregorio Patrocinio who was the Capital Municipal at that time was utilized as the municipal hall.\n\nIn the early days, the parochial house in the town was also utilized as the municipal tribunal. So that, before the construction of the municipal hall, the old convent could have been the government tribunal. In 1912, the already destroyed municipal hall was rehabilitated when Job Obias took office as the president of the town. The work never ceased until the zealous leader able to see the roof installed with galvanized iron sheets. Meantime, the balcony at the front, right above the main entrance of the municipal building was added during the presidency of Isaias Obias (1920-1922).\n\nDuring the presidency of Jovito Dizon (1923-1925), the wooden stairs and floor was constructed, which until this time the same wooden stairs and floor exist where they were built. An engraved proof of this construction is seen on the Spanish stone wall of the municipal building. This engraved marker always greets everyone who takes the first step in climbing up the historic wooden stairs. It was told that San Jose\u00f1os took the pride of owning the biggest municipal hall in the Bicol Region in 1953.\n\nAt present, the people of San Jose can take the pride and honor of having the only functional centuries-old municipal building still in its admirable strength and durability.\n\n===The Catholic Church===\nThe site<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> of the Catholic Church where it majestically stands until now, including all other church properties, was owned by Laurenciano Barcellano. It was chosen by Fr. Salvador Mendoza who considered the place as the most appropriate part to build the Church. The place was formerly called sitio \"Cabayawasnan\" which means guavas or guava orchard. In the 1880s, the place was known to have been grown with many guava trees particularly in the quadrangle which served as the spacious backyard of the old convent. The front part also served as the usual venue for religious and cultural activities such as the \"cenaculo.\" It was told that once the wooden gates of the quadrangle were opened to the public, the folks or their children would usually take the chance of exploring the whole place even to the most secluded part of this area, of course without the watching eyes of the people in the convent.\n[[File:San Jose Church Partido.jpg|thumb|San Jose Church Partido]]\nThe construction of the church started in 1818 under the strictest rule of the Cura Parocco, Fr. Mendoza. It has a Romansque architectural dimension with lime-plastered walls designed by a certain Felix Paete. The sand and lime used in its construction were taken from barangay [[Dolo]], about 6 kilometers away.\n\nThe parishioners rendered the hard labor and experienced the extent of Polo Method in the construction of the church.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> At dusk time, the workers were already gathered around the designated place before the start of the work. According to old folks account, the workers were parading in the darkness of the night while carrying torches to light their way to reach the starting point of the work before dusk. They endured the rugged, thickly forested and muddy trail to make the very slow and difficult manual transport of the building materials and to make while of their hard labor, they would usually entertain themselves with songs and music as they carried the lime and sand from barangay Dolo to the site.\n\nWhen the church was completed, there were donations received by the parish for its accessories. The belfry<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> at the center of the church<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> facade that holds the big bronze bell donated by Dalmacia Obias. The bell is considered to be the queen of the bells at the center of the belfry. People can find also two other smaller bells hanging at each side of the belfry beside the gigantic bronze bell. Accordingly, these three bells when rang send the intended message to all its parishioners, purportedly summoning them to come to church to attend mass. It would take a master ringer to harmoniously blend the sound of the bells with the queen bronze bell on the central command.\n\nOne can take notice of the church altar<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> which is exactly the same altar that it had when the workers of the church had it constructed. The design of the retablo and the materials used are made from solid hard wood to give it an appropriate care of preservation. The present walnut color of paint applied to the retablo was made really intentional to conform with its original paint upon its construction, and the gold ornaments added are carefully designed to adapt to the centuries-old design that it was.\n\nMeantime, the presidential chair where the parish priest sits is still the original chair used by the very first Cura.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> It was said to have undergone some minor repairs, but its main parts and appearance generally remained almost exactly the same as it was first used by Fr. Salvador Mendoza. Also the altar fence marks the separation of the priest's place from the parishioners. It then upholds the sacredness of the altar. It likewise undergone minors repairs but the original design and materials are preserved.\n\n===Christ the King monument===\nThe gigantic monument of Christ the King (Cristo Rey) can be found at the church patio. It was donated by Primitiva Ortiz Obias and inaugurated on October 27, 1952.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> The monument was mounted on an elevated portal to give it a lordly treatment. It is facing east at the town center. Likewise, the base of the monument portal is also elevated like a low-raised floor. People love to stay by sitting on its floor, playing around, or simply enjoy the peace it offers.\n\n===The convent===\nThe convent was built later than the church.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> Accordingly, before its construction, the first Cura could have stayed in an improvised parochial house made of ca\u00f1a and nipa. It also functioned as the municipal tribunal. During the Spanish time, the residence of the Cura was also the residence of the capitan municipal.\n\nThe old convent as still seen today is made of thick stone walls with wooden floors. It is very spacious and too big for one Cura. It also had many spacious rooms to accommodate visiting priests.\n\nDuring World War II, this old convent was known to have served as the headquarters<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> of the [[United States Volunteers|American Volunteer Soldiers]] while the pavement was used as the jail. In 1988, this old convent was converted into a preparatory seminary. In fact, its size made [[Leonardo Legaspi|Archbishop Leonardo Z. Legaspi]] decide to covert it into a Pre-College Seminary purposely to accommodate the growing need of the Holy Rosary Minor Seminary for a formation house. In the same year, the old convent was made a preparatory seminary in consultation with then Parish Priest, Fr. Eutiquio Infante<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> and it initially accepted seminarians on July 1, 1988 with Fr. Raul S. Pan as the first rector. In 1991, the name was changed to Holy Rosary Preparatory Seminary based on the provisions of the formation manual for the diocesan priestly life and ministry, \"That Christ May Be Formed in Us.\"\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\nThe municipality has a total of 98.046 kilometers road<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> length consisting of the National, Provincial, Municipal and Barangay roads. Approximately 6.730 kilometers or 6.864% of the total road length are classified as National roads, 24.830 kilometers or 25.3248% are provincial roads, 4.920 kilometers or 5.018% are Municipal roads and 61.566 kilometers or 62.793% are barangay roads with varying road conditions.\n\nBased on the standard of 1.000 kilometers of road for every square kilometer of land area, the municipality requires 47 kilometers of road length. The existing road length in the area of 98.046 kilometers actually include all types of roads. Thus, this would only indicate that the existing roads are sufficient to facilitate the efficient transportation of agricultural and fishing products of the municipality.\n\nThere are 18 bridges existing in the area, the longest of which is located in barangay [[Pugay]], a reinforced concrete deck girder (RCDA), one in [[Mampirao]], [[Salogon]], and the rest are Spanish-type bridges that are made of bricks and reinforced concrete, spillways and footbridges.\n\n===Water supply===\nThe ''Partido'' water supply system<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> of the [[Partido Development Administration]] (PWSS-PDA) Level III supplies the potable water. It has its water source from [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur|Lagonoy]]. There are 6 pipe connections from the poblacion area to the barangays of [[Camagong]], [[Danlog]], part of [[Boclod]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]], [[Telegrafo]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], and [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]].

The old [[Parish Priest]] of [[Lagonoy]], Fr. Salvador Mendoza, decided to build a church in a place called \"Cabayawasnan\" because of the presence of so many guava trees in the area. Unfortunately, the place was owned by Laurenciano Barcillano who refused to donate the land to the Church. However, through circumstances beyond his control, ownership was passed to the Church.\n\nThe construction of the church began in 1818 and there were only around thirty houses around the area. So, the priest sought the help of the people of Lagonoy. It was a cooperative effort of the people of [[Lagonoy]] who worked on the northern part and the people of Danlog on the southern part. Most of the materials and labor were either free or as payment for weddings and baptism.\n\nIn 1813, the town of San Jose was officially established under the name \"Patrocinio\" derived from the word \"Patron\", meaning model. Then it was changed to Patrocinio de San Jose in honor of its Patron Saint, San Jose de Patriarca. Later in 1883, it was shortened to \"San Jose\" which is now the official name. Its founders were Fr. Salvador Mendoza, then the Parish Priest of El Pueblo de Lagonoy and Don Macario Agustin, the first Capitan Municipal of the town.\n\nAfter the founding of the town, progress and development became eminent and this could be attributed to the cooperative efforts of the church and the state. In 1887, the foundations of the municipal building were laid when Venancio Obias was the Captain Municipal. His successors continued the work but the structure was completely destroyed by a very strong typhoon called \"Bagyong Ogis\", so named because the back of the trees were shredded of and trunks turned white in 1898. A big house owned by Capitan Gregorio Patrocinio was made the temporary \"tribunal.\"\n\nWhen the people of [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] decided to take up arms against the [[Spaniards]], Elias Angeles, then the leading \"Guard Civil\" of Naga convinced the people of San Jose to join the revolutionary movement. Ariston Prila, a \"cabeza de barangay\" from barangay [[Kinalansan]] heeded the call.\n\nIn the early part of 1903, when the Americans reached the town, there were a handful of revolutionaries led by Jose Valencia and Nicomedes Mata but they fled when they realized that their resistance was futile. The American Government was easily established and continued its pacification campaign while pursuing its goal of effecting changes in various aspects of the lives of the people.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Japanese soldiers reached the town in the latest of 1942. Most of the people had evacuated to the far-flung barangays and up to the mountains of Goa and Lagonoy while some joined the [[guerilla]] movement. Filipino-Japanese government continued with an appointed Mayor. [[Filipinos|Filipino]] volunteers manned the defense of the town hall which served as garrison while the Japanese Imperial Forces had Goa for its headquarters. Schools were ordered opened by the authorities to allay fears and to give confidence of the people.\n\nWith the end of the [[Pacific War]] and the celebration of Independence in 1946, the people slowly rehabilitated their lives from the ravages of the war and returned to their usual milieu with renewed vigor.\n\nMay 19 marks the annual celebration of the feast day of San Jose, the town's patron saint.\n\n==Geography==\nSan Jose has a total land area of 4,702.8146 hectares and is bounded in north by [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur|Lagonoy]], south by [[Tigaon, Camarines Sur|Tigaon]], east by [[Lagonoy Gulf]], and west by [[Goa, Camarines Sur|Goa]]. The whole town is roughly 0.27% of the region's 1.76 million hectares; 0.89% of the total land area of [[Camarines Sur]] with an area of 526.680 square kilometers; and 2.26% of the total land area of the 4th Congressional District of [[Camarines Sur]] with an area of 207,596.71 hectares.<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box|location = San Jose, Camarines Sur\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Mar high C = 30\n| Apr high C = 31\n| May high C = 32\n| Jun high C = 32\n| Jul high C = 31\n| Aug high C = 32\n| Sep high C = 31\n| Oct high C = 31\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Dec high C = 29\n| Jan low C = 23\n| Feb low C = 23\n| Mar low C = 23\n| Apr low C = 24\n| May low C = 25\n| Jun low C = 25\n| Jul low C = 25\n| Aug low C = 25\n| Sep low C = 24\n| Oct low C = 24\n| Nov low C = 24\n| Dec low C = 23\n| Jan precipitation mm = 189.5\n| Jan rain days = 18\n| Feb precipitation mm = 169.4 \n| Feb rain days = 14\n| Mar precipitation mm = 133.1 \n| Mar rain days = 14\n| Apr precipitation mm = 119.4 \n| Apr rain days = 13\n| May precipitation mm = 134.2\n| May rain days = 13\n| Jun precipitation mm = 221.2 \n| Jun rain days = 15\n| Jul precipitation mm = 200.5\n| Jul rain days = 17\n| Aug precipitation mm = 155 \n| Aug rain days = 14\n| Sep precipitation mm = 189 \n| Sep rain days = 16\n| Oct precipitation mm = 314.6 \n| Oct rain days = 22\n| Nov precipitation mm = 369.2 \n| Nov rain days = 23\n| Dec precipitation mm = 444 \n| Dec rain days = 24\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/san-jose-weather-averages/camarines-sur/PH.aspx\n| title = San Jose, Camarines Sur: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 6 December 2015}}</ref>\n| date=December 2015}}\n\nThe municipality belongs to Type II Climate<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> characterized by the absence of a dry season and very pronounced maximum rainfall from November to December. It is during these months that the Northeast monsoon season occurs and the [[cyclones|tropical cyclones]] contribute to the increased rainfall in the area. In January and February, the effect of these air masses on rainfall is considerably radical. In addition to the north-east monsoon during the months of February and March, the trail winds traveling from East to West do not give significant increase of rainfall. Likely, the month of May is the transition period between the monsoon that is prevalent from June to September. During the south-west monsoon season, the linear system called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITZ), brings the largest amount of rainfall to the area. In October, which is the transitive period between the south-west and north-east monsoons, the tropical cyclone brings considerable amount of rain.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe rainfall distribution in the municipality is greatly influenced by the air streams, tropical cyclones, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], shorelines, easterly waves and other rainfall-causing weather patterns.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> The rainfall season occurs from June to December with high rainfall intensity of 285.06mm to 474.22m and less rainfall intensity of 245.30mm to 224.06m from January to the month May which at the same time is the onset of effective rainfall with 75% probability and it would terminate in February of the following year which consequently during this period the mountainous areas receive higher intensity of rainfall. But the trend of monthly rainfall is unimodal (having one peak) and the maximum rain period is from October to December. On the other hand, the monthly average rainfall varies from 125.86mm to 594.56mm with a mean annual rainfall of 298.54mm.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe winds are influenced by the monsoon and the Pacific Trade System with Northeast direction that occurs in November to February; Easterly winds during the months of March, April, May and October; Southwest winds in June to August; and Westerly winds in September.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe maximum [[temperature]] during the month of January reaches about 27.9[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] while 31.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in November. The minimum [[temperature]] from December to June reaches about 20.6&nbsp;\u00b0C to 24.5&nbsp;\u00b0C; and the average monthly [[temperature]] is recorded at 25.0&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to 27.9&nbsp;\u00b0C in June.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\n[[Relative humidity]] is indicative of the amount of [[water vapor]] present in the [[atmosphere]]. [[Humidity]] in the [[Philippines]] as in the municipality of San Jose<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is high because of the warm moist air streams flowing over the [[archipelago]], the surrounding seas, rich vegetation and abundant rainfall. The lowest average [[humidity|relative humidity]] occurs in May with 85.9%; highest in February with 93.4%; and the annual average [[humidity]] is 90% which is higher than the regional and national average of 82%.\n\n====Typhoon and storm surges====\n\nThe [[cyclone|tropical cyclone]] is a climatic control that contributes largely to the rainfall from June to December.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> It was shown to usually cause maximum values of rainfall and winds as exemplified by the highest wind speed of 77 miles per second as recorded in [[Virac, Catanduanes]] areas during the height of [[Typhoon Joan (1970)|Typhoon Sening]] in 1970.\n\nThe tropical cyclones are internationally classified with these depending on their maximum wind speed or peak wind velocities (V) as follows:\n* Tropical Depression, V<33 knots (63 km/h)\n* Tropical Storm, 33 knots < V < 47 k (87 km/h)\n* Tropical Storm, 47 knots < u < 63 knots (116 km/h)\n* Typhoon, u > 63 knots (116 km/h)\n\nThe cyclones affecting the Philippine islands<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> originate from the [[Pacific Ocean]] East of the Islands between latitude 8 degrees North, 10 degrees South, traveling on a Westerly or Northwesterly course over the country. It has the highest sustained wind [[velocity]] of 6 knots in November to April and lowest sustained wind velocity of 4 knots in September. Note that the average cyclone that passes over mainland [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] which include San Jose town is 3 cyclones for every 2 years.<ref>Research Study by PAGASA (1948-1982)</ref>\n\n===Topography===\nThe terrain of the municipality<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is characterized as level to gently rolling and sloping. About 91.96% is characterized as having a generally flat terrain with a slope 0-3% which is described to be level to nearly level. It practically covers the entire land area of the town except barangay [[Adiangao]] which is located along the mountain range of [[Caramoan Peninsula]] which has an undulating to rolling terrain with 8.04% portions of steep slopes.\n\nThe elevation of the municipality<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is roughly 92.55% low to very low with a mean elevation from 0\u2013100 meters above sea level. Hence, low elevation is about 5.72% ranging from 100\u2013300 meters above sea level as well as 1.73% with moderately high elevation ranging from 300\u2013500 meters above sea level.\n\n===Geology===\nThe major part of the municipal area is composed of Alluvium River Terraces<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\">{{cite journal|last1=LGU San Jose|first1=MPDC|title=Brief  Profile of the Municipality of San Jose,  Camarines Sur|date=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which is particularly described as ''fluvicatile lacustrine alluvium'' composed of unsorted loosely consolidated pebbles, gravel, silt, coral debris and clay that can be found in flooded plains, riverbanks, sand bars, beaches, and tidal flats. It is notable that river terraces along the [[Lagonoy]] River and its tributaries which include also the Rangas River that practically originating from the foot of the [[Mount Isarog]] account for about 90.69% or 4,264.9826 hectares of the total land area of the municipality while the rest is of igneous and metamorphic rock origin of which volcanoclast alluvial fans cover about 0.19% or 8.94 hectares. These are specifically found in barangays [[Catalotoan]] and [[Salogon]]. Note that volcanoclast is a thick and extensive pyroclastic material consists of ashes, cinder lapili, tuff agromerate and volcanic debris while alluvial fans consists only of worked pyroclastics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Geological Table\n|-\n!

It is characterized as highly fractured and folded complex consisting of quartzite, quartzatedspathit and mica schists that cover roughly 5.26% or 247.37 hectares. Meanwhile, the lower part of the place is composed of sedimentary rocks known as crystalline limestone which covers about 3.86% or 181.53 hectares. Crystalline limestone is an extensive transgressive rectal carbonated facies including wall preserved bushes of corals, megafossils and algae structure, detritae to fuffacious limestone showing well developed karst landforms or formation that can be found prevalent in the [[Caramoan Peninsula]].<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/>\n\n===Landforms===\nThe many landforms<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> found in the municipality have been the natural production of the different geographical pressures of the different structural land forms such as alluvial lowland, alluvial fans, sedimentary plateau or masses of residual slopes and thick sedimentary landscapes. Most of its territorial areas are best characterized by broad alluvial plans described as level to nearly level, and moderately well-drained terraces. The level to undulating plains are the product of paludal environment or deltaic plains which are usually being flooded during slight and heavy downpours.\n\nOn the other hand, Barangay [[Adiangao]] is characterized by Shale/Sandstone Hills (SSH)<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which is described to be undulating to rolling, slightly to moderately dissected, and moistly top-rounded hills, both are low and high relief. Likewise, steep slopes are dissected closely with each other particularly those with greater than 18<sup>o</sup> inclinations. Meanwhile, V-shaped valleys are noted to have been composed and dominated by sandstone. Likewise, landforms in barangays [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], part of [[Minoro]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]] and [[Tagas]] are noted to be flat with very poorly drained terrains and oftentimes affected by floods caused by high tides. The coastal plains are most commonly swarmed with mangroves, nipa plants, break rides, swales and tidal flats.\n\n====Major Types of Land Management Units====\nThe municipality is composed of 5 major types of Land Management Units (LMUs)<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which are classified into 2 forms, namely: Warm Lowland and Warm Cool Hillyland. They are enumerated and explained below.\n\nWarm Lowland:\n* Tidal Flats (LMU 02) is very deep, fine loamy dark grayish brown but sometimes coarse loamy grayish soil, medium acid to mildly alkaline reaction, low available P an CaMg but adequate with O.M., constant extractable KBSP and CEC; generally moderate fertility level, very low infiltration and moderate to slow permeability rate, submerged and very poorly drained.\n* Beach Ridges and Swales (LMU 03) is shallow to moderately deep, very dark brown, coarse, and loamy underlain by sandy skeletal substratum; slightly acid to mutual moderate CaMg and CEC; available highly extractable K acid; BSP generally moderate fertility level; rapid to very rapid infiltration and rapid to moderate rapid permeability rate, and excessively drained.\n* Estuarin Plain (LMU 04) is deep to very deep clay, predominantly very dark brown, yellowish brown, coarse, loamy underlain by sandy skeletal substratum; medium acid to neutral soil reaction; moderate exchangeable K, high O.M. content, available P, BSP and CEC; generally high fertility level; slow to very slow infiltration and rapid to moderately rapid permeability rate, and moderately well to poorly drained.\n* Broad Plain (LMU 09) is moderately deep and sometimes shallow predominantly brown fine, loamy and sometimes coarse, loamy sub-soil underlain by coarse loamy skeletal stratum; strong acid to slightly acid, moderately available P, extractable K and Ca/Mg; adequate O.M. content CEC and BSP, moderate general fertility level; very slow to very rapid permeability rate, poorly to well drained, none to moderate flooding.\n\nWarm Cool Hillyland:\n* Shale/Sandstones Hills (LMU 70) is moderately shallow to very deep, predominantly dark, yellowish brown, and strong fine loamy and sometimes clayey subsoil underlain by skeletal substratum; medium soil to mildly alkaline reaction, low O.M. content and available P, high extractable K, Ca/Mg, BS and CEC generally moderate fertility level, slow to moderate permeability, moderate to well drained.\n\n===Soil classifications===\nThe soil map reveals that the municipality is composed of 9 soil types, namely:\n* [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]] Sandy clay loan and sandy loam\n* [[Minoro]] Loam\n* Venagre Clay loam and sandy loam\n* Huyon-huyon Sandy loam\n* [[Kinalansan]] Silty clay loam and Clay\n* Magsaysay Sandy Loam\n* San Miguel Silty Loam\n* Porous rocks & clay load\n* Sandy soil\n\nIt is also noted that the soil composition of the low-lying areas is rich loamy characterized as broad alluvial plains. However, the inherent soil fertility is generally moderate because of the moderate levels of calcium and magnesium contents that would be adequate for normal growth of crops. Meanwhile, the solids of the coastal plains are generally deep to poorly drained while beach ridges are shallow, coarse and loamy. These areas are noted to be moderately fertile due to low organic matter content; while some areas are poorly drained and prone to tidal floods usually occurring in barangays [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], and [[Kinalansan]].\n\nOn the other hand, soils that came from shales and sandstones can be found in barangay [[Adiangao]]. These are noted to be moderately shallow to moderately deep, fine loamy to clayey. Generally, it is high in fertility brought about by adequate levels of soil reaction, organic matter content, and permeability. However, soil limitations may include heavy texture, erosion hazard, surface stoniness as well as the presence of rock outcrops and shallow soils.\n\n===Soil Erosion and Landslide Susceptibility===\nThe lands that are prone to erosion account for about 8.04% of the total land area and they have slopes ranging from 30%-50%. However, the erosion map of the municipality revealed that only 8.49% of the total land area are observed to be slightly eroded while no apparent erosion occurred in the rest of the territory.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Erosion Hazard<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

However, there is a slight seasonal flooding or about 1.67% that usually occur in barangay [[Minoro]] and in the northern part of [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]] which covers about 78.54 hectares. The flood reaches a depth of less than 0.5 to 1.0 meter after heavy downpour. It would usually recedes within 12 hours to a maximum of one day. Likewise, seasonal flooding is moderately experienced in some portions of barangays [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Telegrafo]] and [[Calalahan]] with a depth of about 0.75 to 1.50 meters which would usually recedes within a few days only.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Flooding Hazard<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

These rivers and creeks are most frequently being utilized not only for irrigation purposes of existing paddies but also for the day to day human activities such as bathing and washing.\n\n===Marine ecosystem===\nThe municipality has a total length of shoreline along the [[Lagonoy Gulf]] of 11.30&nbsp;km. which is about 3.15% of the 358.70&nbsp;km. of shoreline found within the 4th District of [[Camarines Sur]].<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> The fine beach sand in the area makes it suitable for natural harbors as well as refuge for ships and motorbancas during the peak of weather disturbances. Moreover, a variety of marine life and species are notably abounding in the municipal waters that provided a rich source of livelihood among coastal families. At present, there are two separate municipal ports, one located in barangay [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]] and the San Jose Fishing Port in Sitio Talisay, of barangay [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]]. They most frequently served as docking points for both inter-island passenger motorbancas and fishing vessels operating in [[Lagonoy Gulf]].\n\n===Land classification===\nThe entire land area of San Jose<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> with 4,702.8146 hectares is classified as alienable and disposable.

On the other hand, high quality sand, gravels and boulders are abundantly found along the Rangas River traversing barangays [[Bagacay]], [[Mampirao]], [[Pugay]], [[Calalahan]], [[Tambangan]] and [[Calawit]].\n\n===Volcanoes, Faults, and Earthquake Belt===\nThe  parallel location of the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Volcanic Belt]], or [[Philippine Fault System|Philippine Fault Zone]], to the [[Philippine Trench|Deep Philippine Trench]]<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> practically contributed to the triangulated distribution of events with faults or volcanic abnormalities within the earthquake belts in the Bicol Region. It has been observed that the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Volcanic Belt]] or Chain had a span of 240&nbsp;km. from [[Camarines Norte]] in the North down to [[Sorsogon]] in the South with a total of 16 volcanoes separately spread over by about 24&nbsp;km. apart and rested parallel along the 200&nbsp;km. chain west of the [[Philippine Trench]], which is the major source of earthquake in the region. The trench can be described as a long, narrow, and generally steep-sided very deep depression in the ocean floor. The axis of a trench marks, the position of a subduction zone where old oceanic lithospheric plates begin their descent into the earth's interior.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nIn 1987, a study was conducted which reveals that the [[Bicol Region]] particularly the location of San Jose is a part prone to earthquakes of intensify 5 from the above-cited source zones. Based on the frequency of volcanic eruptions that occurred in the region, there are three prominent volcanoes which are considered to be active, namely: [[Mayon Volcano|Mt. Mayon]], [[Mount Bulusan|Mt. Bulusan]], and [[Mount Iriga|Mt. Iriga (Asog)]]. The latter is the nearest to the Municipality of San Jose.\n\n[[Mount Iriga]] (Asog) has a peak of 1,143 meters above sea level and classified to be \"stratovolcanoe\" or it has a composite cone like that of [[Mayon Volcano|Mt. Mayon]] and last record of eruption was in 1628 A.D. which eventually damned the Barit River but consequently created the [[Lake Buhi]], the home of the smallest fish in the world with scientific name ''[[Pandaka pygmaea]]'' locally known as \"tabios.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\"\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of San Jose\n| 1903 = 8314\n| 1918 = 8710\n| 1939 = 10722\n| 1948 = 12788\n| 1960 = 16704\n| 1970 = 20343\n| 1975 = 21859\n| 1980 = 23898\n| 1990 = 27517\n| 1995 = 31362\n| 2000 = 32512\n| 2007 = 35768\n| 2010 = 38523\n| 2015 = 40623\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of San Jose, Camarines Sur, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nThe population projection was computed based on Geometric formula resulting to an average annual increase of 2.62%.

This includes the numerous beaches with crystalline clear water along the coastline of [[Lagonoy Gulf]] and the Adiangao Cave at barangay [[Adiangao]].\n\n==Heritage sites and buildings==\n\n===The municipal building===\n[[File:Main Entrance to the San Jose Municipal Building.png|thumb|Main Entrance to the San Jose Municipal Building]]\nCapitano Municipal Venancio Pe\u00f1as initiated the building of the municipal hall<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\">{{cite book|last1=Nieva|first1=Lourdes Lobis|title=San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride|date=February 2010|publisher=Local  Government of San Jose|location=San Jose, Camarines Sur|edition=1st}}</ref> during his term of office in 1877. His successors contributed to its completion, however, Typhoon \"Uguis\" hit the town in 1898 that caused the eventual destruction of the building. Several years after this calamity, the residence of Gregorio Patrocinio who was the Capital Municipal at that time was utilized as the municipal hall.\n\nIn the early days, the parochial house in the town was also utilized as the municipal tribunal. So that, before the construction of the municipal hall, the old convent could have been the government tribunal. In 1912, the already destroyed municipal hall was rehabilitated when Job Obias took office as the president of the town. The work never ceased until the zealous leader able to see the roof installed with galvanized iron sheets. Meantime, the balcony at the front, right above the main entrance of the municipal building was added during the presidency of Isaias Obias (1920-1922).\n\nDuring the presidency of Jovito Dizon (1923-1925), the wooden stairs and floor was constructed, which until this time the same wooden stairs and floor exist where they were built. An engraved proof of this construction is seen on the Spanish stone wall of the municipal building. This engraved marker always greets everyone who takes the first step in climbing up the historic wooden stairs. It was told that San Jose\u00f1os took the pride of owning the biggest municipal hall in the Bicol Region in 1953.\n\nAt present, the people of San Jose can take the pride and honor of having the only functional centuries-old municipal building still in its admirable strength and durability.\n\n===The Catholic Church===\nThe site<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> of the Catholic Church where it majestically stands until now, including all other church properties, was owned by Laurenciano Barcellano. It was chosen by Fr. Salvador Mendoza who considered the place as the most appropriate part to build the Church. The place was formerly called sitio \"Cabayawasnan\" which means guavas or guava orchard. In 1880s, the place was known to have been grown with many guava trees particularly in the quadrangle which served as the spacious backyard of the old convent. The front part also served as the usual venue for religious and cultural activities such as the \"cenaculo.\" It was told that once the wooden gates of the quadrangle were opened to the public, the folks or their children would usually take the chance of exploring the whole place even to the most secluded part of this area, of course without the watching eyes of the people in the convent.\n[[File:San Jose Church Partido.jpg|thumb|San Jose Church Partido]]\nThe construction of the church started in 1818 under the strictest rule of the Cura Parocco, Fr. Mendoza. It has a Romansque architectural dimension with lime-plastered walls designed by a certain Felix Paete. The sand and lime used in its construction were taken from barangay [[Dolo]], about 6 kilometers away.\n\nThe parishioners rendered the hard labor and experienced the extent of Polo Method in the construction of the church.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> At dusk time, the workers were already gathered around the designated place before the start of the work. According to old folks account, the workers were parading in the darkness of the night while carrying torches to light their way to reach the starting point of the work before dusk. They endured the rugged, thickly forested and muddy trail to make the very slow and difficult manual transport of the building materials and to make while of their hard labor, they would usually entertain themselves with songs and music as they carried the lime and sand from barangay Dolo to the site.\n\nWhen the church was completed, there were donations received by the parish for its accessories. The belfry<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> at the center of the church<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> facade that holds the big bronze bell donated by Dalmacia Obias. The bell is considered to be the queen of the bells at the center of the belfry. People can find also two other smaller bells hanging at each side of the belfry beside the gigantic bronze bell. Accordingly, these three bells when rang send the intended message to all its parishioners, purportedly summoning them to come to church to attend mass. It would take a master ringer to harmoniously blend the sound of the bells with the queen bronze bell on the central command.\n\nOne can take notice of the church altar<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> which is exactly the same altar that it had when the workers of the church had it constructed. The design of the retablo and the materials used are made from solid hard wood to give it an appropriate care of preservation. The present walnut color of paint applied to the retablo was made really intentional to conform with its original paint upon its construction, and the gold ornaments added are carefully designed to adapt to the centuries-old design that it was.\n\nMeantime, the presidential chair where the parish priest sits is still the original chair used by the very first Cura.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> It was said to have undergone some minor repairs, but its main parts and appearance generally remained almost exactly the same as it was first used by Fr. Salvador Mendoza. Also the altar fence marks the separation of the priest's place from the parishioners. It then upholds the sacredness of the altar. It likewise undergone minors repairs but the original design and materials are preserved.\n\n===Christ the King monument===\nThe gigantic monument of Christ the King (Cristo Rey) can be found at the church patio. It was donated by Primitiva Ortiz Obias and inaugurated on October 27, 1952.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> The monument was mounted on an elevated portal to give it a lordly treatment. It is facing east at the town center. Likewise, the base of the monument portal is also elevated like a low-raised floor. People love to stay by sitting on its floor, playing around, or simply enjoy the peace it offers.\n\n===The convent===\nThe convent was built later than the church.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> Accordingly, before its construction, the first Cura could have stayed in an improvised parochial house made of ca\u00f1a and nipa. It also functioned as the municipal tribunal. During the Spanish time, the residence of the Cura was also the residence of the capitan municipal.\n\nThe old convent as still seen today is made of thick stone walls with wooden floors. It is very spacious and too big for one Cura. It also had many spacious rooms to accommodate visiting priests.\n\nDuring World War II, this old convent was known to have served as the headquarters<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> of the [[United States Volunteers|American Volunteer Soldiers]] while the pavement was used as the jail. In 1988, this old convent was converted into a preparatory seminary. In fact, its size made [[Leonardo Legaspi|Archbishop Leonardo Z. Legaspi]] decide to covert it into a Pre-College Seminary purposely to accommodate the growing need of the Holy Rosary Minor Seminary for a formation house. In the same year, the old convent was made a preparatory seminary in consultation with then Parish Priest, Fr. Eutiquio Infante<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> and it initially accepted seminarians on July 1, 1988 with Fr. Raul S. Pan as the first rector. In 1991, the name was changed to Holy Rosary Preparatory Seminary based on the provisions of the formation manual for the diocesan priestly life and ministry, \"That Christ May Be Formed in Us.\"\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\nThe municipality has a total of 98.046 kilometers road<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> length consisting of the National, Provincial, Municipal and Barangay roads. Approximately 6.730 kilometers or 6.864% of the total road length are classified as National roads, 24.830 kilometers or 25.3248% are provincial roads, 4.920 kilometers or 5.018% are Municipal roads and 61.566 kilometers or 62.793% are barangay roads with varying road conditions.\n\nBased on the standard of 1.000 kilometers of road for every square kilometer of land area, the municipality requires 47 kilometers of road length. The existing road length in the area of 98.046 kilometers actually include all types of roads. Thus, this would only indicate that the existing roads are sufficient to facilitate the efficient transportation of agricultural and fishing products of the municipality.\n\nThere are 18 bridges existing in the area, the longest of which is located in barangay [[Pugay]], a reinforced concrete deck girder (RCDA), one in [[Mampirao]], [[Salogon]], and the rest are Spanish-type bridges that are made of bricks and reinforced concrete, spillways and footbridges.\n\n===Water supply===\nThe ''Partido'' water supply system<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> of the [[Partido Development Administration]] (PWSS-PDA) Level III supplies the potable water. It has its water source from [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur|Lagonoy]]. There are 6 pipe connections from the poblacion area to the barangays of [[Camagong]], [[Danlog]], part of [[Boclod]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]], [[Telegrafo]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], and [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]].
