[[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries gave praise to the album's three singles and \"Give Me a Call\" but felt the rest of the track listing contained \"redundant cuts and overdone party numbers\" with Jones' overused gimmicky catchphrases. He called the record a \"significant step up\" from ''[[The American Dream (Mike Jones album)|The American Dream]]'' EP.<ref name=\"AM\"/> Nathan Slavik of DJBooth highlighted both \"Next to You\" and \"Cuddy Buddy\" as potential radio chart-toppers but found the album going into \"unlistenable territory\" with tracks ranging from a \"half-baked\" dance craze (\"Drop & Gimmie 50\"), butchering of a celebratory anthem (\"Happy Birthday\") and full-on misogyny (\"Scandalous Hoes II\"). Slavik concluded by giving his take on Jones' next project: \"Sadly expectations will be low after ''The Voice'', here's hoping he truly delivers something unexpected.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/> Conversely, Steve 'Flash' Juon from ''RapReviews'' praised Jones for delivering a decently paced album that has catchy beats to invigorate the collaborative tracks while also showcasing both his lyrical and vocal improvements from the past four years, concluding with \"Regardless of the reasons it's clear that Mike Jones is a more seasoned and polished pro of the rap game, and ''The Voice'' is planning to have a long career in hip-hop music.
