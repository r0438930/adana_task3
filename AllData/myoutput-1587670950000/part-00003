Black slaves were attendants to sea captains and ex-colonial officials, as well as traders, plantation owners and military personnel. This caused an increasing black presence in the northern, eastern, and southern areas of London. One of the most famous slaves to attend a sea captain was known as [[Sambo's Grave|Sambo]]. He fell ill shortly after arriving in England and was consequently buried in Lancashire. His plaque and gravestone still stand to this day.

''Black British'' did not come into widespread use until the second generation were born to these post-war migrants to the UK.

By the 1950s, there was a consciousness of black people as a separate group that had not been there between 1932 and 1938.<ref name=\"Writingblack\" /> The increasing consciousness of Black British peoples was deeply informed by the influx of Black American culture imported by Black servicemen during and after World War II, music being a central example of what Jacqueline Nassy-Brown calls \"diasporic resources\".

For many Caribbean immigrants, their first experience of discrimination came when trying to find private accommodation. They were generally ineligible for [[council housing]] because only people who had been resident in the UK for a minimum of five years qualified for it. At the time, there was no anti-discrimination legislation to prevent landlords from refusing to accept black tenants. A survey undertaken in [[Birmingham]] in 1956 found that only 15 of a total of 1,000 white people surveyed would let a room to a black tenant. As a result, many black immigrants were forced to live in [[slum]] areas of cities, where the housing was of poor quality and there were problems of crime, violence and prostitution.<ref name=Cloake>{{cite book|title=Multicultural Britain|first1=J.

The project also notes that the British school system \"has been indicted on numerous occasions for racism, and for undermining the self-confidence of black children and maligning the culture of their parents\".

''Black British'' did not come into widespread use until the second generation were born to these post-war migrants to the UK.

By the 1950s, there was a consciousness of black people as a separate group that had not been there between 1932 and 1938.<ref name=\"Writingblack\" /> The increasing consciousness of Black British peoples was deeply informed by the influx of Black American culture imported by Black servicemen during and after World War II, music being a central example of what Jacqueline Nassy-Brown calls \"diasporic resources\".

For many Caribbean immigrants, their first experience of discrimination came when trying to find private accommodation. They were generally ineligible for [[council housing]] because only people who had been resident in the UK for a minimum of five years qualified for it. At the time, there was no anti-discrimination legislation to prevent landlords from refusing to accept black tenants. A survey undertaken in [[Birmingham]] in 1956 found that only 15 of a total of 1,000 white people surveyed would let a room to a black tenant. As a result, many black immigrants were forced to live in [[slum]] areas of cities, where the housing was of poor quality and there were problems of crime, violence and prostitution.<ref name=Cloake>{{cite book|title=Multicultural Britain|first1=J.

The project also notes that the British school system \"has been indicted on numerous occasions for racism, and for undermining the self-confidence of black children and maligning the culture of their parents\".
