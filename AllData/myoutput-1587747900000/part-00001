This low-budget [[B-movie]] starred Don Sullivan, a veteran of several low budget monster and [[zombie]] films, and Lisa Simone, the French contestant for [[Miss Universe]] of 1957, as well as [[comic relief]] [[Shug Fisher]] and [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]] disc jockey Ken Knox. The effects included a live [[Mexican beaded lizard]] (not an actual [[Gila monster]]) filmed on a scaled-down model landscape. The film is considered a [[cult film|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with a young couple, Pat Wheeler (Grady Vaughn) and Liz Humphries (Yolanda Salas), parked in a bleak, rural locale overlooking a ravine. A giant Gila monster attacks the car, sending it into the ravine and killing the couple. Later, some friends of the couple decide to assist the local sheriff ([[Fred Graham (actor)|Fred Graham]]) in his search for the missing teens. Chase Winstead (Sullivan), a young mechanic and hot rod racer, locates the crashed car in the ravine and finds evidence of the giant lizard. However, it is only when the hungry reptile attacks a train (a model train set substituted as a low-budget effect) that the authorities realize they are dealing with a (roughly) 70-foot long venomous lizard. By this time, emboldened by its attacks and hungry for prey, the creature attacks the town. It heads for the local dance hall, where the town's teenagers are gathered for a [[sock hop]]. However, Chase packs his prized hot rod with [[nitroglycerin]] and rigs it to speed straight into the Gila monster, terminating the lizard in a fiery explosion and heroically saving the town.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* Don Sullivan as Chase Winstead\n* Lisa Simone as Lisa\n* [[Fred Graham (actor)|Fred Graham]] as Sheriff Jeff\n* [[Shug Fisher]] as Old Man Harris\n* Bob Thompson as Mr. Wheeler\n* Janice Stone as Missy Winstead\n* Ken Knox as Horatio Alger \"Steamroller\" Smith\n* Gay McLendon as Mom Winstead\n* Don Flournoy as Gordy\n* Cecil Hunt as Mr. Compton\n* Stormy Meadows as Agatha Humphries\n* Howard Ware as Ed Humphries\n* Pat Reeves as Rick\n* Jan McLendon as Jennie\n* Jerry Cortwright as Bob\n* Beverly Thurman as Gay\n* Clarke Browne as Chuck\n* Grady Vaughn as Pat Wheeler\n* Desmond Doogh as Hitchhiker\n* Ann Sonka as Whila\n* Yolanda Salas as Liz Humphries\n* Patricia Simmons as Sherry (uncredited)\n* Angus G.
