In 1995 the first ever [[Heineken Cup]] match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constan\u0163a.\n\nRomania first got regular international competition when they joined the newly formed [[European Nations Cup (rugby union)|European Nations Cup]] in 2000. As an indication of the decline in standard of the sport in Romania, the national team was defeated 134-0 by England in 2001 and Dinamo Bucharest lost 151-0 to Saracens in the [[European Rugby Shield]].\n\n[[Bucure\u015fti Rugby]] was formed to represent Romania in European club competitions in 2004.

It takes part in international competitions, notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]] and the [[Super Powers Cup]].\n\nRomania has played at every [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] so far and won one game at each World Cup, except for [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]] and [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]] when it lost all its games.\n\nRomania plays in the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]], a second-level competition for second and third-tier European nations. Romania has won the competition on three occasions 2000, 2001\u20132002 and 2005-2006.\n\nThe [[Antim Cup]] is contested between Georgia and Romania. The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches or qualifiers. The holder retains the cup unless the challenger wins the match in normal time.\n\nRomania replaced Russia in the [[Super Powers Cup|Super Cup]] in 2005. Other participants include [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] and [[United States national rugby union team|the United States]].\n\n== Domestic competitions ==\n{{Further|Romanian Rugby Championship}}\n\nThe Romanian Rugby Championship, which has been contested since 1914, is the main domestic competition.\n\n==European club tournaments==\n\nIn 1995 the first ever [[Heineken Cup]] match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constan\u0163a. Since the inaugural season, Romanian teams have not taken part in the Heineken Cup.\n\nA Romanian team has taken part in the [[European Challenge Cup]] in 1996\u221297, 1997\u221298, 1998\u221299, 1999\u22122000, 2001\u221202, 2002\u221203, and each season since 2005\u221206. No Romanian teams took part in 2000\u221201, 2003\u221204 and 2004\u221205.\n\n[[Bucure\u015fti Rugby]] is a team that is formed to play in European competition, consisting of rugby union players playing in the domestic Romanian leagues. They played in the [[European Shield]] in 2004\u221205, and have played in each Challenge Cup since the 2005\u221206 edition.\n\n== Popularity ==\nIn the 1980s the country had more than 12,000 players in 110 clubs.\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, Romanian rugby union suffered a drastic financial shortfall.  Its popularity - which has never been comparable with that of [[association football|football]] or [[Team handball|handball]] - has not diminished, however.\n\nAccording to the [[International Rugby Board]] Romania has 52 rugby union clubs; 142 referees; 1,200 pre-teen male players; 4,100 teen male players; 1,375 senior male players (total male players 6,675) as well as 150 pre-teen female players; 200 teen female players; 125 senior female players (total female players 475).<ref name=IRB2>[http://www.irb.com/en/Home/MemberUnionHomePage?UnionID=86&Tab=3 Romania on IRB.com]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 9 September 2009</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Romania national rugby union team]]\n*[[Romanian Rugby Federation]]\n*[[SuperLiga (rugby)|Romanian SuperLiga Rugby]]\n*[[Sport in Romania]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commons category}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Bath, Richard (ed.)

As an indication of the decline in standard of the sport in Romania, the national team was defeated 134-0 by England in 2001 and Dinamo Bucharest lost 151-0 to Saracens in the [[European Rugby Shield]].\n\n[[Bucure\u015fti Rugby]] was formed to represent Romania in European club competitions in 2004. In recent years they have achieved respectable results, including a win in 2010 against an Italian super 10 side.\n\n== National team ==\n{{Main|Romania national rugby union team}}\n[[File:Romania national rugby union team.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Romania national rugby union team after receiving the Pershing Trophy in 2016 at their home ground, Stadionul Arcul de Triumf after a test match against [[United States national rugby union team|USA]]]]\nThe [[Romania national rugby union team]], nicknamed The Oaks, has long been one of the stronger European teams outside the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] tournament. It takes part in international competitions, notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]] and the [[Super Powers Cup]].\n\nRomania has played at every [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] so far and won one game at each World Cup, except for [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]] and [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]] when it lost all its games.\n\nRomania plays in the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]], a second-level competition for second and third-tier European nations. Romania has won the competition on three occasions 2000, 2001\u20132002 and 2005-2006.\n\nThe [[Antim Cup]] is contested between Georgia and Romania. The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches or qualifiers. The holder retains the cup unless the challenger wins the match in normal time.\n\nRomania replaced Russia in the [[Super Powers Cup|Super Cup]] in 2005. Other participants include [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] and [[United States national rugby union team|the United States]].\n\n== Domestic competitions ==\n{{Further|Romanian Rugby Championship}}\n\nThe Romanian Rugby Championship, which has been contested since 1914, is the main domestic competition.\n\n==European club tournaments==\n\nIn 1995 the first ever [[Heineken Cup]] match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constan\u0163a. Since the inaugural season, Romanian teams have not taken part in the Heineken Cup.\n\nA Romanian team has taken part in the [[European Challenge Cup]] in 1996\u221297, 1997\u221298, 1998\u221299, 1999\u22122000, 2001\u221202, 2002\u221203, and each season since 2005\u221206. No Romanian teams took part in 2000\u221201, 2003\u221204 and 2004\u221205.\n\n[[Bucure\u015fti Rugby]] is a team that is formed to play in European competition, consisting of rugby union players playing in the domestic Romanian leagues. They played in the [[European Shield]] in 2004\u221205, and have played in each Challenge Cup since the 2005\u221206 edition.\n\n== Popularity ==\nIn the 1980s the country had more than 12,000 players in 110 clubs.\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, Romanian rugby union suffered a drastic financial shortfall.  Its popularity - which has never been comparable with that of [[association football|football]] or [[Team handball|handball]] - has not diminished, however.\n\nAccording to the [[International Rugby Board]] Romania has 52 rugby union clubs; 142 referees; 1,200 pre-teen male players; 4,100 teen male players; 1,375 senior male players (total male players 6,675) as well as 150 pre-teen female players; 200 teen female players; 125 senior female players (total female players 475).<ref name=IRB2>[http://www.irb.com/en/Home/MemberUnionHomePage?UnionID=86&Tab=3 Romania on IRB.com]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 9 September 2009</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Romania national rugby union team]]\n*[[Romanian Rugby Federation]]\n*[[SuperLiga (rugby)|Romanian SuperLiga Rugby]]\n*[[Sport in Romania]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commons category}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Bath, Richard (ed.)
