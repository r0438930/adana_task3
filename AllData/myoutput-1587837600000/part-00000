Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[File:Earless seal (Puerto Madryn, Argentina).jpg|thumb|left|Southern elephant seals in Argentina|alt=Photo of seven adult and juvenile southern elephant seals packed closely on beach]]\n\nPhocids spend most of their time at sea, although they return to land or pack ice to breed and give birth. Pregnant females spend long periods foraging at sea, building up fat reserves, and then return to the breeding site to use their stored energy to nurse pups. However, the common seal displays a reproductive strategy similar to that used by otariids, in which the mother makes short foraging trips between nursing bouts.\n\nBecause a phocid mother's feeding grounds are often hundreds of kilometers from the breeding site, she must [[fasting|fast]] while [[lactation|lactating]]. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup at a time when she is not eating (and often, not drinking). Mothers must supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the [[humpback whale]]s' strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.\n\nPhocids produce thick, fat-rich milk that allows them to provide their pups with large amounts of energy in a short period. This allows the mother to return to the sea in time to replenish her reserves. Lactation ranges from five to seven weeks in the [[monk seal]] to just three to five days in the [[hooded seal]]. The mother ends nursing by leaving her pup at the breeding site to search for food (pups continue to nurse if given the opportunity). \"Milk stealers\" that suckle from unrelated, sleeping females are not uncommon; this often results in the death of the mother's pup, since a female can only feed one pup.\n\n===Growth and maturation===\nThe pup's diet is so high in calories, it builds up a fat store. Before the pup is ready to forage, the mother abandons it, and the pup consumes its own fat for weeks or even months while it matures. Seals, like all marine mammals, need time to develop the oxygen stores, swimming muscles, and neural pathways necessary for effective diving and foraging. Seal pups typically eat no food and drink no water during the period, although some polar species eat snow. The postweaning fast ranges from two weeks in the hooded seal to 9\u201312 weeks in the northern elephant seal.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The energetics of lactation in the Northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris|journal = Journal of Zoology|date = 1986-03-01|issn = 1469-7998|pages = 21\u201333|volume = 209|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb03563.x|first = D.

L.|last4 = Ortiz}}</ref> The physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow phocid pups to endure these remarkable fasts, which are among the longest for any mammal, remain an area of active study and research.\n\n=== Feeding strategy ===\nPhocids make use of at least four different feeding strategies: suction feeding, grip, and tear feeding, filter feeding, and pierce feeding. Each of these feeding strategies is aided by a specialized skull, mandible, and tooth morphology. However, despite morphological specialization, most phocids are opportunistic and employ multiple strategies to capture and eat prey. For example, the leopard seal, ''Hydrurga leptonyx'', uses grip and tear feeding to prey on penguins, suction feeding to consume small fish, and filter feeding to catch krill.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kienle|first=Sarah S.|last2=Berta|first2=Annalisa|date=2016|title=The better to eat you with: the comparative feeding morphology of phocid seals (Pinnipedia, Phocidae)|journal=Journal of Anatomy|volume=228|issue=3|pages=396\u2013413|doi=10.1111/joa.12410|issn=1469-7580|pmc=5341551|pmid=26646351}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mammals|Animals|Marine life}}\n* [[Eared seal]]\n* [[Marine mammals as food]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Phocidae}}\n{{Commons and category|Phocidae|Phocidae}}\n\n{{Crowned and Stemmed Genera of Pinnipeds}}\n{{Carnivora|C1.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q25587}}\n\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Pinnipeds]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray]]\n", "text_old": "{{Automatic taxobox\n| name = Earless seals<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Wozencraft | pages = | id = 14001028}}</ref>\n| image = Seehund.jpg\n| image_caption = [[Harbor seal]], ''Phoca vitulina''\n| fossil_range = {{Fossil range|earliest=Chattian|Aquitanian|present}}<small>Early [[Miocene]] \u2013 [[Holocene]], possible late [[Oligocene]] record<ref name=Noriphoca>{{Cite journal|author1=Leonard Dewaele |author2=Olivier Lambert |author3=Stephen Louwye |year=2018 |title=A critical revision of the fossil record, stratigraphy and diversity of the Neogene seal genus ''Monotherium'' (Carnivora, Phocidae) |journal=Royal Society Open Science |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=171669 |doi=10.1098/rsos.171669 |pmid=29892365 |pmc=5990722 |bibcode=2018RSOS....571669D }}</ref></small>\n| taxon = Phocidae\n| authority = [[John Edward Gray|Gray]], 1821\n| subdivision_ranks = Subfamilies\n| subdivision = \n*\u2020[[Devinophoca|Devinophocinae]]\n*[[Monachinae]]\n*[[Phocinae]]\n\nRefer to the article's text about the interrelationships among the phocid subfamilies.\n}}\n[[File:Harbor seal with skeleton GS.jpg|thumb|Skeletal anatomy of a harbor seal. 1.

Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[File:Earless seal (Puerto Madryn, Argentina).jpg|thumb|left|Southern elephant seals in Argentina|alt=Photo of seven adult and juvenile southern elephant seals packed closely on beach]]\n\nPhocids spend most of their time at sea, although they return to land or pack ice to breed and give birth. Pregnant females spend long periods foraging at sea, building up fat reserves, and then return to the breeding site to use their stored energy to nurse pups. However, the common seal displays a reproductive strategy similar to that used by otariids, in which the mother makes short foraging trips between nursing bouts.\n\nBecause a phocid mother's feeding grounds are often hundreds of kilometers from the breeding site, she must [[fasting|fast]] while [[lactation|lactating]]. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup at a time when she is not eating (and often, not drinking). Mothers must supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the [[humpback whale]]s' strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.\n\nPhocids produce thick, fat-rich milk that allows them to provide their pups with large amounts of energy in a short period. This allows the mother to return to the sea in time to replenish her reserves. Lactation ranges from five to seven weeks in the [[monk seal]] to just three to five days in the [[hooded seal]]. The mother ends nursing by leaving her pup at the breeding site to search for food (pups continue to nurse if given the opportunity). \"Milk stealers\" that suckle from unrelated, sleeping females are not uncommon; this often results in the death of the mother's pup, since a female can only feed one pup.\n\n===Growth and maturation===\nThe pup's diet is so high in calories, it builds up a fat store. Before the pup is ready to forage, the mother abandons it, and the pup consumes its own fat for weeks or even  months while it matures. Seals, like all marine mammals, need time to develop the oxygen stores, swimming muscles, and neural pathways necessary for effective diving and foraging. Seal pups typically eat no food and drink no water during the period, although some polar species eat snow. The postweaning fast ranges from two weeks in the hooded seal to 9\u201312 weeks in the northern elephant seal.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The energetics of lactation in the Northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris|journal = Journal of Zoology|date = 1986-03-01|issn = 1469-7998|pages = 21\u201333|volume = 209|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb03563.x|first = D.

L.|last4 = Ortiz}}</ref> The physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow phocid pups to endure these remarkable fasts, which are among the longest for any mammal, remain an area of active study and research.\n\n=== Feeding strategy ===\nPhocids make use of at least four different feeding strategies: suction feeding, grip and tear feeding, filter feeding, and pierce feeding. Each of these feeding strategies is aided by specialized skull, mandible, and tooth morphology. However, despite morphological specialization most phocids are opportunistic, and employ multiple strategies to capture and eat prey. For example, the leopard seal, ''Hydrurga leptonyx'', uses grip and tear feeding to prey on penguins, suction feeding to consume small fish, and filter feeding to catch krill.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kienle|first=Sarah S.|last2=Berta|first2=Annalisa|date=2016|title=The better to eat you with: the comparative feeding morphology of phocid seals (Pinnipedia, Phocidae)|journal=Journal of Anatomy|volume=228|issue=3|pages=396\u2013413|doi=10.1111/joa.12410|issn=1469-7580|pmc=5341551|pmid=26646351}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mammals|Animals|Marine life}}\n* [[Eared seal]]\n* [[Marine mammals as food]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Phocidae}}\n{{Commons and category|Phocidae|Phocidae}}\n\n{{Crowned and Stemmed Genera of Pinnipeds}}\n{{Carnivora|C1.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q25587}}\n\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Pinnipeds]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray]]\n", "name_user": "Lukasisgooder", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammar fixes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earless_seal"}
