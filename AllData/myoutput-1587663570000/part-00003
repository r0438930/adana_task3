It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles by Apple's roster of artists, marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the year's top-selling single in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. Its nine-week run at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\n\nThe writing and recording of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. The [[ballad]] evolved from \"Hey Jules\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort [[John Lennon]]'s son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], after Lennon had left his wife for the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]]. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation, while also encouraging \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a [[Coda (music)|coda]] featuring a \"Na-na-na na\" refrain that lasts for over four minutes.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song to be recorded on [[eight-track recording]] equipment. The sessions took place at [[Trident Studios]] in central London, midway through the recording of the group's [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"), and led to an argument between McCartney and [[George Harrison]] over the song's guitar part. [[Ringo Starr]] later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip was directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] and first aired on [[David Frost]]'s UK television show. Contrasting with the problems afflicting the band, this performance captured the song's theme of optimism and togetherness by featuring the studio audience joining the Beatles as they sang the coda.\n\nAt more than seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was the longest single ever to top the British charts.{{sfn|Lowry|2002|p=44}} Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite magazine|first= Fred |last= Bronson |title= Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 2 August 2012 |accessdate= 9 August 2013 |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170710144317/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archivedate= 10 July 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref> McCartney has continued to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's death in 1980]], leading audiences in singing the coda.

Tim Riley writes that, with the \"restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill\" that introduces the drum part, \"the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the ''pain''{{'}}).\"{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=252}} At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na \u2026\"), supported by an electric guitar fill,{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=194}} before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to \"reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside\". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=253}}\n\nThe verse-bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda, consisting of nineteen rounds of the song's double [[plagal cadence]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=192}} During this coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed by the words \"hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out.{{refn|group=nb|Author [[John Kruth]] writes that McCartney might have taken the idea for the closing refrain from [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]]' 1965 hit \"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\", the main [[Hook (music)|hook]] of which is a series of \"extended 'nah nah nah nah nahs'\". This band, whom McCartney nicknamed \"the Nah Nah Boys\", were his choice for the Beatles' support act on their [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour|1965 US tour]].{{sfn|Kruth|2015|pp=22\u201323}}}} In his analysis of the composition, musicologist [[Alan W. Pollack|Alan Pollack]] comments on the unusual structure of \"Hey Jude\", in that it uses a \"binary form that combines a fully developed, hymn-like song together with an extended, [[mantra]]-like jam on a simple chord progression\".<ref name=\"Pollack\"/>\n\nRiley considers that the coda's repeated chord sequence (I\u2013{{music|flat}}VII\u2013IV\u2013I) \"answers all the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges\", since \"The flat seventh that posed dominant turns into bridges now has an entire chord built on it.\" This three-chord refrain allows McCartney \"a bedding ... to leap about on vocally\",{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=254}} so he ad-libs his vocal performance for the rest of the song. In Riley's estimation, the song \"becomes a tour of Paul's vocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through the mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the coda\".{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=255}}\n\n==Release==\n{{quote box|quote=[The Beatles] are confident and cheerful and the human condition will be thrilled by the coming results of their willing and enduring Beatle bondage \u2026 they will give all of us new wonders to soothe our pain.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=49, 359}}|source=\u2013 [[Derek Taylor]], \"Hey Jude\" press release, August 1968|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\"Hey Jude\" was released on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom,{{sfn|Castleman|Podrazik|1976|pp=67\u201368}} backed with \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of a 7-inch single.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}} It was one of four singles issued simultaneously to launch Apple Records \u2013 the others being Mary Hopkin's \"[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]\", Jackie Lomax's \"[[Sour Milk Sea]]\", and the Black Dyke Mills Band's \"Thingumybob\".{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=306}} In advance of the release date, Apple declared 11\u201318 August to be \"National Apple Week\" in the UK,{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=306}}<ref>Black, Johnny. \"A Slice of History\".

band [[the Beatles]] that was released as a non-album single in August 1968. It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles by Apple's roster of artists, marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the year's top-selling single in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. Its nine-week run at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\n\nThe writing and recording of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. The [[ballad]] evolved from \"Hey Jules\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort [[John Lennon]]'s son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], after Lennon had left his wife for the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]]. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation, while also encouraging \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a [[Coda (music)|coda]] featuring a \"Na-na-na na\" refrain that lasts for over four minutes.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song to be recorded on [[eight-track recording]] equipment. The sessions took place at [[Trident Studios]] in central London, midway through the recording of the group's [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"), and led to an argument between McCartney and [[George Harrison]] over the song's guitar part. [[Ringo Starr]] later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip was directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] and first aired on [[David Frost]]'s UK television show. Contrasting with the problems afflicting the band, this performance captured the song's theme of optimism and togetherness by featuring the studio audience joining the Beatles as they sang the coda.\n\nAt more than seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was the longest single ever to top the British charts.{{sfn|Lowry|2002|p=44}} Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite magazine|first= Fred |last= Bronson |title= Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 2 August 2012 |accessdate= 9 August 2013 |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170710144317/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archivedate= 10 July 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref> McCartney has continued to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's death in 1980]], leading audiences in singing the coda.

Tim Riley writes that, with the \"restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill\" that introduces the drum part, \"the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the ''pain''{{'}}).\"{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=252}} At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na \u2026\"), supported by an electric guitar fill,{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=194}} before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to \"reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside\". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=253}}\n\nThe verse-bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda, consisting of nineteen rounds of the song's double [[plagal cadence]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=192}} During this coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed by the words \"hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out.{{refn|group=nb|Author [[John Kruth]] writes that McCartney might have taken the idea for the closing refrain from [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]]' 1965 hit \"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\", the main [[Hook (music)|hook]] of which is a series of \"extended 'nah nah nah nah nahs'\".
