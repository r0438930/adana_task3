Australia also won the 1902 series, which was memorable for exciting cricket, including [[Gilbert Jessop]] scoring a Test century in just 70 minutes. England regained the Ashes in 1904 under the captaincy of [[Pelham Warner]]. [[R. E. Foster]] scored 287 on his debut and [[Wilfred Rhodes]] took 15 wickets in a match. In 1905\u201306, England lost 4\u20131 against South Africa. England avenged the defeat in 1907, when they won the series 1\u20130 under the captaincy of Foster. However, they lost the 1909 Ashes series against Australia, suing 25 players in the process. England also lost to South Africa, with [[Jack Hobbs]] scoring his first of 15 centuries on the tour.\n\n===1910s===\nEngland toured Australia in 1911\u201312 and beat their opponents 4\u20131. The team included the likes of Rhodes, Hobbs, [[Frank Woolley]] and [[Sydney Barnes]]. England lost the first match of the series but bounced back and won the next four Tests. This proved to be the last Ashes series before the war.\n\nThe 1912 season saw England take part in a unique experiment. A nine-Test triangular tournament involving England, South Africa and Australia was set up. The series was hampered by a very wet summer and player disputes however and the tournament was considered a failure with the ''Daily Telegraph'' stating:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/260677.html|title=England v Australia 1890&nbsp;\u2013 1914|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=5 February 2008|date=27 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008035811/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/260677.html|archive-date=8 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Nine Tests provide a surfeit of cricket, and contests between Australia and South Africa are not a great attraction to the British public.}}\n\nWith Australia sending a weakened team and the South African bowlers being ineffective England dominated the tournament winning four of their six matches.

Still feeling the effects of the war England went down to a series of crushing defeats and suffered their first whitewash losing the series 5\u20130. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better in the next few Ashes series losing the 1921 Ashes series 3\u20130 and the 1924\u201325 Ashes 4\u20131. England's fortunes were to change in 1926 as they regained the Ashes and were a formidable team during this period dispatching Australia 4\u20131 in the 1928\u201329 Ashes tour.\n\nOn the same year the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] became the fourth nation to be granted [[Test cricket#Test status|Test status]] and played their first game against England. England won each of these three Tests by an innings, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although [[Learie Constantine]] did [[Double (cricket)|the double]] on the tour. In the 1929\u201330 season England went on two concurrent tours with one team going to New Zealand (who were granted Test status earlier that year) and the other to the West Indies. Despite sending two separate teams England won both tours beating New Zealand 1\u20130 and the West Indies 2\u20131.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a Bodyline ball. Note the number of leg-side fielders.]]\nThe 1930 Ashes series saw a young [[Don Bradman]] dominate the tour, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] and 232 at [[The Oval]]. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 3\u20131. As a result of Bradman's prolific run-scoring the England captain [[Douglas Jardine]] chose to develop the already existing [[leg theory]] into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side.\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 233112 English cricket team at the test match held in Brisbane, 1928.jpg|right|thumb|English cricket team at the Test match held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]]. England won the match by a record margin of 675 runs.]]\nUsing Jardine's fast leg theory, England won the next Ashes series 4\u20131, but complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]], which during the tour sent the following cable to the MCC in London:\n\n{{quote|Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations existing between Australia and England.}}\n\nLater, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the [[Laws of Cricket]] changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg was banned.\n\nEngland's following tour of India in the 1933\u201334 season was the first Test match to be staged in the subcontinent. The series was also notable for [[Stan Nichols]] and [[Nobby Clark (cricketer)|Nobby Clark]] bowling so many bouncers that the Indian batsman wore solar toup\u00e9es instead of caps to protect themselves.\n\nAustralia won the 1934 Ashes series 2\u20131 and kept the urn for the following 19 years. Many of the wickets of the time were friendly to batsmen resulting in a large proportion of matches ending in high scoring draws and many batting records being set.\n\nEngland drew the 1938 Ashes, meaning Australia retained the urn. England went into the final match of the series at The Oval 1\u20130 down, but won the final game by an innings and 579 runs. [[Len Hutton]] made the highest ever Test score by an Englishman, making 364 in England first innings to help them reach 903, their highest ever score against Australia.\n\nThe 1938\u201339 tour of South Africa saw another experiment with the deciding Test being a [[timeless Test]] that was played to a finish. England lead 1\u20130 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite the final Test being 'timeless', the game ended in a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. England went on one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before the [[World War II|Second World War]], although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played.\n\n===1940s===\nTest cricket resumed after the war in 1946, and England won their first match back against India. However, they struggled in the 1946\u201347 Ashes series, losing 3\u20130 in Australia under [[Wally Hammond]]'s captaincy. England beat South Africa 3\u20130 in 1947 with [[Denis Compton]] scoring 1,187 runs in the series.\n\nThe 1947\u201348 series against the West Indies was another disappointment for England, with the side losing 2\u20130 following injuries to several key players. England suffered further humiliation against Bradman's invincible side in the 1948 Ashes series. Hutton was controversially dropped for the third Test, and England were bowled out for just 52 at The Oval. The series proved to be Bradman's final Ashes series.\n\nIn 1948\u201349, England beat South Africa 2\u20130 under the captaincy of George Mann. The series included a record breaking stand of 359 between Hutton and [[Cyril Washbrook]]. The decade ended with England drawing the Test series against New Zealand, with every match ending in a draw.\n\n===1950s===\nTheir fortunes changed on the 1953 Ashes tour as they won the series 1\u20130. England did not lose a series between their 1950\u201351 and 1958\u201359 tours of Australia and secured famous victory in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] under the captaincy of [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], thanks to [[Frank Tyson]] whose 6/85 at Sydney and 7/27 at Melbourne are remembered as the fastest bowling ever seen in Australia. The 1956 series was remembered for the bowling of [[Jim Laker]] who took 46 wickets at an average of 9.62, including figures of 19/90 at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]]. After drawing to South Africa, England defeated the West Indies and New Zealand comfortably.\n\nThe England team then left for Australia in the 1958\u201359 season with a team that had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but lost the series 4\u20130 as [[Richie Benaud]]'s revitalised Australians were too strong, with England struggling with the bat throughout the series.\n\nOn 24 August 1959, England inflicted its only 5\u20130 whitewash over [[India national cricket team|India]]. All out for 194 at The Oval, India lost the last test by an innings. England's batsman [[Ken Barrington]] and [[Colin Cowdrey]] both had an excellent series with the bat, with Barrington scoring 357 runs across the series and Cowdrey scoring 344.\n\n===1960s===\nThe early and middle 1960s were poor periods for English cricket. Despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes and the West Indies dominated England in the early part of the decade. May stood down as captain in 1961 following the 1961 Ashes defeat.\n\n[[Ted Dexter]] succeeded him as captain but England continued to suffer indifferent results. In 1961\u201362, they beat Pakistan, but also lost to India. The following year saw England and Australia tie the 1962\u201363 Ashes series 1\u20131, meaning Australia retained the urn. Despite beating New Zealand 3\u20130, England went on to lose to the West Indies, and again failed in the 1964 Ashes, losing the home series 1\u20130, which marked the end of Dexter's captaincy.\n\nHowever, from 1968 to 1971 they played 27 consecutive Test matches without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned Test at Melbourne in 1970\u201371). The sequence began when they drew with Australia at Lord's in the Second Test of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1968|1968 Ashes series]] and ended in 1971 when [[Indian cricket team in England in 1971|India]] won the Third Test at The Oval by four wickets. They played 13 Tests with only one defeat immediately beforehand and so played a total of 40 consecutive Tests with only one defeat, dating from their innings victory over the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. During this period they beat New Zealand, India, the West Indies, and Pakistan, and under [[Ray Illingworth]]'s leadership, regained [[The Ashes]] from Australia in 1970\u201371.\n\n===1970s===\nThe 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into three parts. Early in the decade, Illingworth's side dominated world cricket, winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining them at home in 1972. The same side beat Pakistan at home in 1971 and played by far the better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1\u20130 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with the likes of Illingworth, [[Geoffrey Boycott]], [[John Edrich]], [[Basil D'Oliveira]], [[Dennis Amiss]], [[Alan Knott]], [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]] and [[Derek Underwood]] at its core.\n\nThe mid-1970s were more turbulent. Illingworth and several others had refused to tour India in 1972\u201373 which led to a clamour for Illingworth's job by the end of that summer&nbsp;\u2013 England had just been beaten 2\u20130 by a flamboyant West Indies side&nbsp;\u2013 with several England players well over 35. [[Mike Denness]] was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against poor opposition were good, but England were badly exposed as ageing and lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974\u201375 Australians, losing that series 4\u20131 to lose the Ashes.\n\nDenness was replaced in 1975 by [[Tony Greig]]. While he managed to avoid losing to Australia, his side were largely thrashed the following year by the young and very much upcoming West Indies for whom Greig's infamous \"grovel\" remark acted as motivation. Greig's finest hour was probably the 1976\u201377 win over India in India. When Greig was discovered as being instrumental in World Series Cricket, he was sacked, and replaced by [[Mike Brearley]].\n\nBrearley's side showed again the hyperbole that is often spoken when one side dominates in cricket. While his side of 1977\u201380 contained some young players who went on to become England greats, most notably future captains [[Ian Botham]], [[David Gower]] and [[Graham Gooch]], their opponents were often very much weakened by the absence of their World Series players, especially in 1978, when England beat New Zealand 3\u20130 and Pakistan 2\u20130 before thrashing what was effectively Australia's 2nd XI 5\u20131 in 1978\u201379.\n\n===1980s===\nThe England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, was never truly settled throughout the 1980s, which will probably be remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990.\n\nBotham took over the captaincy in 1980 and they put up a good fight against the West Indies, losing a five match Test series 1\u20130, although England were humbled in the return series. After scoring a pair in the first Test against Australia, Botham lost the captaincy due to his poor form, and was replaced by Brearley. Botham returned to form and played exceptionally in the remainder of the series, being named man of the match in the third, fourth and fifth Tests. The series became known as Botham's Ashes as England recorded a 3\u20131 victory.\n\n[[Keith Fletcher]] took over as captain in 1981, but England lost his first series in charge against India. [[Bob Willis]] took over as captain in 1982 and enjoyed victories over India and Pakistan, but lost the Ashes after Australia clinched the series 2\u20131. England hosted the World Cup in 1983 and reached the semi-finals, but their Test form remained poor, as they suffered defeats against New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies.\n\nGower took over as skipper in 1984 and led the team to a 2\u20131 victory over India. They went on to win the 1985 Ashes 3\u20131, although after this came a poor run of form. Defeat to the West Indies dented the team's confidence, and they went on to lose to India 2\u20130. In 1986, [[Micky Stewart]] was appointed the first full-time England coach. England beat New Zealand, but there was little hope of them retaining the Ashes in 1986\u201387. However, despite being described as a team that 'can't bat, can't bowl and can't field', they went on to win the series 2\u20131.\n\nAfter losing consecutive series against Pakistan, England drew a three match Test series against New Zealand 0\u20130. They reached the final of the 1987 World Cup, but lost by seven runs against Australia. After losing 4\u20130 to the West Indies, England lost the Ashes to a resurgent Australia led by Allan Border. With the likes of Gooch banned following a rebel tour to South Africa, a new look England side suffered defeat again against the West Indies, although this time by a margin of 2\u20131.\n\n===1990s===\nIf the 1980s were a low point for English Test cricket, then the 1990s were only a slight improvement. The arrival of Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and especially fitness though it took some time for old habits to die. Even in 2011, one or two successful county players have been shown up as physically unfit for international cricket. Creditable performances against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard-fought draw against the 1991 West Indies and a strong performance in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] in which the England team finished as runners-up for the second consecutive World Cup, but landmark losses against Australia in 1990\u201391 and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of bowling. So bad was England's bowling in 1993 that [[Rod Marsh]] described England's pace attack at one point as \"pie throwers\". Having lost three of the first four Tests played in England in 1993, Gooch resigned to be replaced by [[Michael Atherton]].\n\nMore selectorial problems abounded during Atherton's reign as new chairman of selectors and coach Ray Illingworth (then into his 60s) assumed almost sole responsibility for the team off the field. The youth policy which had seen England emerge from the West Indies tour of 1993\u201394 with some credit (though losing to a seasoned Windies team) was abandoned and players such as Gatting and Gooch were persisted with when well into their 30s and 40s. England continued to do well at home against weaker opponents such as India, New Zealand and a West Indies side beginning to fade but struggled badly against improving sides like Pakistan and South Africa. Atherton had offered his resignation after losing the 1997 Ashes series 3\u20132 having been 1\u20130 up after two matches&nbsp;\u2013 eventually to resign one series later in early 1998. England, looking for talent, went through a whole raft of new players during this period, such as [[Ronnie Irani]], [[Adam Hollioake]], [[Craig White]], [[Graeme Hick]] and [[Mark Ramprakash]]. At this time, there were two main problems:\n* The lack of a genuine all-rounder to bat at 6, Botham having left a huge gap in the batting order when he retired from Tests in 1992.\n* [[Alec Stewart]], a sound wicket-keeper and an excellent player of quick bowling, could not open and keep wicket, hence his batting down the order, where he was often exposed to spin which he did not play as well.\n\nStewart took the reins as captain in 1998, but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him Test and ODI captaincy in 1999. This should not detract from the 1998 home Test series where England showed great fortitude to beat a powerful South African side 2\u20131.\n\nAnother reason for their poor performances were the demands of [[County Championship|County Cricket]] teams on their players, meaning that England could rarely field a full-strength team on their tours. This eventually led to the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] taking over from the MCC as the governing body of England and the implementation of central contracts. 1992 also saw Scotland sever ties with the England and Wales team, and begin to compete as the [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland national team]].\n\nBy 1999, with coach David Lloyd resigning after the World Cup exit and new captain [[Nasser Hussain]] just appointed, England hit rock bottom (literally ranked as the lowest-rated Test nation) after losing 2\u20131 to New Zealand in shambolic fashion. Hussain was booed on the Oval balcony as the crowd jeered \"We've got the worst team in the world\" to the tune of \"[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]\".\n\n===2000s===\nCentral contracts were installed \u2013 reducing players workloads \u2013 and following the arrival of Zimbabwean coach [[Duncan Fletcher]], England thrashed the fallen West Indies [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2000|3\u20131]]. England's results in Asia improved that winter with series wins against both [[History of cricket in Pakistan from 2001#England 2000\u201301|Pakistan]] and [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2000\u201301|Sri Lanka]]. Hussain's side had a far harder edge to it, avoiding the anticipated \"Greenwash\" in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 2001|2001 Ashes series]] against the all-powerful Australian team. The nucleus the side was slowly coming together as players such as Hussain himself, [[Graham Thorpe]], [[Darren Gough]] and [[Ashley Giles]] began to be regularly selected. By 2003 though, having endured [[English cricket team in Australia in 2002\u201303|another Ashes drubbing]] as well as another first-round exit from the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]], Hussain resigned as captain after one Test against [[South African cricket team in England in 2003|South Africa]].\n\n[[Michael Vaughan]] took over, with players encouraged to express themselves. England won five consecutive Test series prior to facing Australia in the [[2005 Ashes series]], [[International cricket in 2005#ICC Championship tables in May 2005|taking the team to second place]] in the [[ICC Test Championship]] table. During this period England defeated the West Indies [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2004|home]] and [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2003\u201304|away]], [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2004|New Zealand]], and [[Bangladeshi cricket team in England in 2005|Bangladesh]] at home, and [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2004\u201305|South Africa]] in South Africa. In June 2005, England played its first ever [[Twenty20 International|T20 international match]], [[Australian cricket team in England in 2005#England v Australia (13 June)|defeating Australia by 100 runs]]. Later that year, England defeated Australia 2\u20131 in a thrilling series to regain the Ashes for the first time in 16 years, having lost them in 1989. Following the 2005 Ashes win, the team suffered from a spate of serious injuries to key players such as Vaughan, Giles, [[Andrew Flintoff]] and [[Simon Jones (cricketer)|Simon Jones]]. As a result, the team underwent an enforced period of transition. A [[English cricket team in Pakistan in 2005\u201306|2\u20130 defeat in Pakistan]] was followed by two drawn away series with [[English cricket team in India in 2005\u201306|India]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006|Sri Lanka]].\n\nIn the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2006|home Test series victory against Pakistan]] in July and August 2006, several promising new players emerged. Most notable were the left-arm orthodox spin bowler [[Monty Panesar]], the first [[Sikh]] to play Test cricket for England, and left-handed opening batsman [[Alastair Cook]]. The [[2006\u201307 Ashes series]] was keenly anticipated and was expected to provide a level of competition comparable to the 2005 series. In the event, England, captained by Flintoff who was deputising for the injured Vaughan, lost all five Tests to concede the first Ashes whitewash in 86 years.\n\nIn the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], England lost to most of the Test playing nations they faced, beating only the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]], although they also avoided defeat by any of the non-Test playing nations. Even so, the unimpressive nature of most of their victories in the tournament, combined with heavy defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, left many commentators criticising the manner in which the England team approached the one-day game. Coach Duncan Fletcher resigned after eight years in the job as a result and was succeeded by former [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] coach [[Peter Moores (cricketer)|Peter Moores]].\n\nIn 2007\u201308, England toured [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2007\u201308|Sri Lanka]] and [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 2007\u201308|New Zealand]], losing the first series 1\u20130 and winning the second 2\u20131. These series were followed up at home in May 2008 with a [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2008|2\u20130 home series win against New Zealand]], with the results easing pressure on Moores \u2013 who was not at ease with his team, particularly star batsman [[Kevin Pietersen]]. Pietersen succeeded Vaughan as captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by [[South African cricket team in England in 2008|South Africa at home]]. The poor relationship between the two came to a head on the [[English cricket team in India in 2008\u201309|2008\u201309 tour to India]]. England lost the series 1\u20130 and both men resigned their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team. Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean [[Andy Flower]]. Against this background, England toured the [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2008\u201309|West Indies]] under the captaincy of [[Andrew Strauss]] and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1\u20130.\n\nThe [[2009 Ashes series]] featured the first Test match played in Wales, at [[Sophia Gardens (cricket ground)|Sophia Gardens]], Cardiff. England drew the match thanks to a last-wicket stand by bowlers [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and Panesar. A victory for each team followed before the series was decided at The Oval. Thanks to fine bowling by [[Stuart Broad]] and [[Graeme Swann]] and a debut century by [[Jonathan Trott]], England regained the Ashes.\n\n===2010s===\nAfter a drawn [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2009\u201310|Test series in South Africa]], England won their first ever ICC world championship, the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|2010 World Twenty20]], with a seven-wicket win over Australia in Barbados. The following winter in the [[2010\u201311 Ashes series|2010\u201311 Ashes]], they beat Australia 3\u20131 to retain the urn and record their first series win in Australia for 24 years. Furthermore, all three of their wins were by an innings \u2013 the first time a touring side had ever recorded three innings victories in a single Test series. Cook earned Man of the Series with 766 runs.\n\nEngland struggled to match their Test form in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]]. Despite beating South Africa and tying with eventual winners India, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh before losing in the quarter-finals to Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka vs England, 4th quarter-final ICC World Cup 2011|url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/4th-quarter-final-sri-lanka-vs-england.html|date=26 March 2011|access-date=26 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818070122/http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/4th-quarter-final-sri-lanka-vs-england.html|archive-date=18 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> However the team's excellent form in the Test match arena continued and on 13 August 2011, they became the world's top-ranked Test team after [[Indian cricket team in England in 2011|comfortably whitewashing India 4\u20130]], their sixth consecutive series victory and eighth in the past nine series. However, this status only lasted a year \u2013 having [[England cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2011\u201312|lost 3\u20130 to Pakistan]] over the winter, England were [[South African cricket team in England in 2012|beaten 2\u20130 by South Africa]], who replaced them at the top of the rankings. It was their first home series loss since 2008, against the same opposition.\n\nThis loss saw the resignation of Strauss as captain (and his retirement from cricket). Cook, who was already in charge of the ODI side, replaced Strauss and led England to a [[English cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|2\u20131 victory in India]] \u2013 their first in the country since 1984\u201385. In doing so, he became the first captain to score centuries in his first five Tests as captain and became England's leading century-maker with 23 centuries to his name.\n[[File:The England Cricket Team Ashes 2015.jpg|thumbnail|right|The England team celebrate victory over Australia in the [[2015 Ashes series]]]]\nAfter finishing as runners-up in the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy|ICC Champions Trophy]], England faced Australia in back-to-back Ashes series. A [[2013 Ashes series|3\u20130 home win]] secured England the urn for the fourth time in five series. However, in [[2013\u201314 Ashes series|the return series]], they found themselves utterly demolished in a 5\u20130 defeat, their second Ashes whitewash in under a decade. Their misery was compounded by batsman Jonathan Trott leaving the tour early due to a stress-related illness and the mid-series retirement of spinner Graeme Swann. Following the tour, head coach Flower resigned his post while Pietersen was dropped indefinitely from the England team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26040475 |title=Kevin Pietersen: Batsman's England career over |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 February 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606010906/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26040475 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Flower was replaced by his predecessor, Moores, but he was sacked for a second time after a string of disappointing results including failing to advance from the group stage at the [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/moores-leaves-role-england-head-coach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175138/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/moores-leaves-role-england-head-coach |archivedate=5 November 2015 }}</ref> He was replaced by Australian [[Trevor Bayliss]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-names-trevor-bayliss-englands-new-head-coach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129101453/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-names-trevor-bayliss-englands-new-head-coach |archivedate=29 January 2016 }}</ref> who oversaw an upturn of form in the ODI side, including series victories against [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2015#ODI series|New Zealand]] and [[English cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2015\u201316#ODI series|Pakistan]].

In addition, [[Chris Jordan (cricketer)|Chris Jordan]], [[Ben Stokes]] and Tom Curran have British citizenship, having lived in England since their youth, while [[Eoin Morgan]] also holds Irish citizenship. Curran's younger brother, Sam, was born in the UK, so did not have to have to undergo a qualification period. Jofra Archer, though born in Barbados to a Barbadian mother, qualifies through his English father.\n\nICC regulations also allow cricketers who represent [[List of International Cricket Council members#Top Associate/Affiliate Members|associate]] (i.e. non-Test-playing) nations to switch to a Test-playing nation, provided nationality requirements are fulfilled.

The match, starting on 15 March 1877 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] came to be regarded as the inaugural Test match. The combined Australian XI won this Test match by 45 runs with [[Charles Bannerman]] of Australia scoring the first Test century.

Australia also won the 1902 series, which was memorable for exciting cricket, including [[Gilbert Jessop]] scoring a Test century in just 70 minutes. England regained the Ashes in 1904 under the captaincy of [[Pelham Warner]]. [[R. E. Foster]] scored 287 on his debut and [[Wilfred Rhodes]] took 15 wickets in a match. In 1905\u201306, England lost 4\u20131 against South Africa. England avenged the defeat in 1907, when they won the series 1\u20130 under the captaincy of Foster. However, they lost the 1909 Ashes series against Australia, suing 25 players in the process. England also lost to South Africa, with [[Jack Hobbs]] scoring his first of 15 centuries on the tour.\n\n===1910s===\nEngland toured Australia in 1911\u201312 and beat their opponents 4\u20131. The team included the likes of Rhodes, Hobbs, [[Frank Woolley]] and [[Sydney Barnes]]. England lost the first match of the series but bounced back and won the next four Tests. This proved to be the last Ashes series before the war.\n\nThe 1912 season saw England take part in a unique experiment. A nine-Test triangular tournament involving England, South Africa and Australia was set up. The series was hampered by a very wet summer and player disputes however and the tournament was considered a failure with the ''Daily Telegraph'' stating:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/260677.html|title=England v Australia 1890&nbsp;\u2013 1914|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=5 February 2008|date=27 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008035811/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/260677.html|archive-date=8 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Nine Tests provide a surfeit of cricket, and contests between Australia and South Africa are not a great attraction to the British public.}}\n\nWith Australia sending a weakened team and the South African bowlers being ineffective England dominated the tournament winning four of their six matches.

Still feeling the effects of the war England went down to a series of crushing defeats and suffered their first whitewash losing the series 5\u20130. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better in the next few Ashes series losing the 1921 Ashes series 3\u20130 and the 1924\u201325 Ashes 4\u20131. England's fortunes were to change in 1926 as they regained the Ashes and were a formidable team during this period dispatching Australia 4\u20131 in the 1928\u201329 Ashes tour.\n\nOn the same year the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] became the fourth nation to be granted [[Test cricket#Test status|Test status]] and played their first game against England. England won each of these three Tests by an innings, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although [[Learie Constantine]] did [[Double (cricket)|the double]] on the tour. In the 1929\u201330 season England went on two concurrent tours with one team going to New Zealand (who were granted Test status earlier that year) and the other to the West Indies. Despite sending two separate teams England won both tours beating New Zealand 1\u20130 and the West Indies 2\u20131.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a Bodyline ball. Note the number of leg-side fielders.]]\nThe 1930 Ashes series saw a young [[Don Bradman]] dominate the tour, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] and 232 at [[The Oval]]. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 3\u20131. As a result of Bradman's prolific run-scoring the England captain [[Douglas Jardine]] chose to develop the already existing [[leg theory]] into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side.\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 233112 English cricket team at the test match held in Brisbane, 1928.jpg|right|thumb|English cricket team at the Test match held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]]. England won the match by a record margin of 675 runs.]]\nUsing Jardine's fast leg theory, England won the next Ashes series 4\u20131, but complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]], which during the tour sent the following cable to the MCC in London:\n\n{{quote|Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations existing between Australia and England.}}\n\nLater, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the [[Laws of Cricket]] changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg was banned.\n\nEngland's following tour of India in the 1933\u201334 season was the first Test match to be staged in the subcontinent. The series was also notable for [[Stan Nichols]] and [[Nobby Clark (cricketer)|Nobby Clark]] bowling so many bouncers that the Indian batsman wore solar toup\u00e9es instead of caps to protect themselves.\n\nAustralia won the 1934 Ashes series 2\u20131 and kept the urn for the following 19 years. Many of the wickets of the time were friendly to batsmen resulting in a large proportion of matches ending in high scoring draws and many batting records being set.\n\nEngland drew the 1938 Ashes, meaning Australia retained the urn. England went into the final match of the series at The Oval 1\u20130 down, but won the final game by an innings and 579 runs. [[Len Hutton]] made the highest ever Test score by an Englishman, making 364 in England first innings to help them reach 903, their highest ever score against Australia.\n\nThe 1938\u201339 tour of South Africa saw another experiment with the deciding Test being a [[timeless Test]] that was played to a finish. England lead 1\u20130 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite the final Test being 'timeless', the game ended in a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. England went on one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before the [[World War II|Second World War]], although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played.\n\n===1940s===\nTest cricket resumed after the war in 1946, and England won their first match back against India. However, they struggled in the 1946\u201347 Ashes series, losing 3\u20130 in Australia under [[Wally Hammond]]'s captaincy. England beat South Africa 3\u20130 in 1947 with [[Denis Compton]] scoring 1,187 runs in the series.\n\nThe 1947\u201348 series against the West Indies was another disappointment for England, with the side losing 2\u20130 following injuries to several key players. England suffered further humiliation against Bradman's invincible side in the 1948 Ashes series. Hutton was controversially dropped for the third Test, and England were bowled out for just 52 at The Oval. The series proved to be Bradman's final Ashes series.\n\nIn 1948\u201349, England beat South Africa 2\u20130 under the captaincy of George Mann. The series included a record breaking stand of 359 between Hutton and [[Cyril Washbrook]]. The decade ended with England drawing the Test series against New Zealand, with every match ending in a draw.\n\n===1950s===\nTheir fortunes changed on the 1953 Ashes tour as they won the series 1\u20130. England did not lose a series between their 1950\u201351 and 1958\u201359 tours of Australia and secured famous victory in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] under the captaincy of [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], thanks to [[Frank Tyson]] whose 6/85 at Sydney and 7/27 at Melbourne are remembered as the fastest bowling ever seen in Australia. The 1956 series was remembered for the bowling of [[Jim Laker]] who took 46 wickets at an average of 9.62, including figures of 19/90 at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]]. After drawing to South Africa, England defeated the West Indies and New Zealand comfortably.\n\nThe England team then left for Australia in the 1958\u201359 season with a team that had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but lost the series 4\u20130 as [[Richie Benaud]]'s revitalised Australians were too strong, with England struggling with the bat throughout the series.\n\nOn 24 August 1959, England inflicted its only 5\u20130 whitewash over [[India national cricket team|India]]. All out for 194 at The Oval, India lost the last test by an innings. England's batsman [[Ken Barrington]] and [[Colin Cowdrey]] both had an excellent series with the bat, with Barrington scoring 357 runs across the series and Cowdrey scoring 344.\n\n===1960s===\nThe early and middle 1960s were poor periods for English cricket. Despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes and the West Indies dominated England in the early part of the decade. May stood down as captain in 1961 following the 1961 Ashes defeat.\n\n[[Ted Dexter]] succeeded him as captain but England continued to suffer indifferent results. In 1961\u201362, they beat Pakistan, but also lost to India. The following year saw England and Australia tie the 1962\u201363 Ashes series 1\u20131, meaning Australia retained the urn. Despite beating New Zealand 3\u20130, England went on to lose to the West Indies, and again failed in the 1964 Ashes, losing the home series 1\u20130, which marked the end of Dexter's captaincy.\n\nHowever, from 1968 to 1971 they played 27 consecutive Test matches without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned Test at Melbourne in 1970\u201371). The sequence began when they drew with Australia at Lord's in the Second Test of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1968|1968 Ashes series]] and ended in 1971 when [[Indian cricket team in England in 1971|India]] won the Third Test at The Oval by four wickets. They played 13 Tests with only one defeat immediately beforehand and so played a total of 40 consecutive Tests with only one defeat, dating from their innings victory over the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. During this period they beat New Zealand, India, the West Indies, and Pakistan, and under [[Ray Illingworth]]'s leadership, regained [[The Ashes]] from Australia in 1970\u201371.\n\n===1970s===\nThe 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into three parts. Early in the decade, Illingworth's side dominated world cricket, winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining them at home in 1972. The same side beat Pakistan at home in 1971 and played by far the better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1\u20130 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with the likes of Illingworth, [[Geoffrey Boycott]], [[John Edrich]], [[Basil D'Oliveira]], [[Dennis Amiss]], [[Alan Knott]], [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]] and [[Derek Underwood]] at its core.\n\nThe mid-1970s were more turbulent. Illingworth and several others had refused to tour India in 1972\u201373 which led to a clamour for Illingworth's job by the end of that summer&nbsp;\u2013 England had just been beaten 2\u20130 by a flamboyant West Indies side&nbsp;\u2013 with several England players well over 35. [[Mike Denness]] was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against poor opposition were good, but England were badly exposed as ageing and lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974\u201375 Australians, losing that series 4\u20131 to lose the Ashes.\n\nDenness was replaced in 1975 by [[Tony Greig]]. While he managed to avoid losing to Australia, his side were largely thrashed the following year by the young and very much upcoming West Indies for whom Greig's infamous \"grovel\" remark acted as motivation. Greig's finest hour was probably the 1976\u201377 win over India in India. When Greig was discovered as being instrumental in World Series Cricket, he was sacked, and replaced by [[Mike Brearley]].\n\nBrearley's side showed again the hyperbole that is often spoken when one side dominates in cricket. While his side of 1977\u201380 contained some young players who went on to become England greats, most notably future captains [[Ian Botham]], [[David Gower]] and [[Graham Gooch]], their opponents were often very much weakened by the absence of their World Series players, especially in 1978, when England beat New Zealand 3\u20130 and Pakistan 2\u20130 before thrashing what was effectively Australia's 2nd XI 5\u20131 in 1978\u201379.\n\n===1980s===\nThe England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, was never truly settled throughout the 1980s, which will probably be remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990.\n\nBotham took over the captaincy in 1980 and they put up a good fight against the West Indies, losing a five match Test series 1\u20130, although England were humbled in the return series. After scoring a pair in the first Test against Australia, Botham lost the captaincy due to his poor form, and was replaced by Brearley. Botham returned to form and played exceptionally in the remainder of the series, being named man of the match in the third, fourth and fifth Tests. The series became known as Botham's Ashes as England recorded a 3\u20131 victory.\n\n[[Keith Fletcher]] took over as captain in 1981, but England lost his first series in charge against India. [[Bob Willis]] took over as captain in 1982 and enjoyed victories over India and Pakistan, but lost the Ashes after Australia clinched the series 2\u20131. England hosted the World Cup in 1983 and reached the semi-finals, but their Test form remained poor, as they suffered defeats against New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies.\n\nGower took over as skipper in 1984 and led the team to a 2\u20131 victory over India. They went on to win the 1985 Ashes 3\u20131, although after this came a poor run of form. Defeat to the West Indies dented the team's confidence, and they went on to lose to India 2\u20130. In 1986, [[Micky Stewart]] was appointed the first full-time England coach. England beat New Zealand, but there was little hope of them retaining the Ashes in 1986\u201387. However, despite being described as a team that 'can't bat, can't bowl and can't field', they went on to win the series 2\u20131.\n\nAfter losing consecutive series against Pakistan, England drew a three match Test series against New Zealand 0\u20130. They reached the final of the 1987 World Cup, but lost by seven runs against Australia. After losing 4\u20130 to the West Indies, England lost the Ashes to a resurgent Australia led by Allan Border. With the likes of Gooch banned following a rebel tour to South Africa, a new look England side suffered defeat again against the West Indies, although this time by a margin of 2\u20131.\n\n===1990s===\nIf the 1980s were a low point for English Test cricket, then the 1990s were only a slight improvement. The arrival of Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and especially fitness though it took some time for old habits to die. Even in 2011, one or two successful county players have been shown up as physically unfit for international cricket. Creditable performances against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard-fought draw against the 1991 West Indies and a strong performance in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] in which the England team finished as runners-up for the second consecutive World Cup, but landmark losses against Australia in 1990\u201391 and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of bowling. So bad was England's bowling in 1993 that [[Rod Marsh]] described England's pace attack at one point as \"pie throwers\". Having lost three of the first four Tests played in England in 1993, Gooch resigned to be replaced by [[Michael Atherton]].\n\nMore selectorial problems abounded during Atherton's reign as new chairman of selectors and coach Ray Illingworth (then into his 60s) assumed almost sole responsibility for the team off the field. The youth policy which had seen England emerge from the West Indies tour of 1993\u201394 with some credit (though losing to a seasoned Windies team) was abandoned and players such as Gatting and Gooch were persisted with when well into their 30s and 40s. England continued to do well at home against weaker opponents such as India, New Zealand and a West Indies side beginning to fade but struggled badly against improving sides like Pakistan and South Africa. Atherton had offered his resignation after losing the 1997 Ashes series 3\u20132 having been 1\u20130 up after two matches&nbsp;\u2013 eventually to resign one series later in early 1998. England, looking for talent, went through a whole raft of new players during this period, such as [[Ronnie Irani]], [[Adam Hollioake]], [[Craig White]], [[Graeme Hick]] and [[Mark Ramprakash]]. At this time, there were two main problems:\n* The lack of a genuine all-rounder to bat at 6, Botham having left a huge gap in the batting order when he retired from Tests in 1992.\n* [[Alec Stewart]], a sound wicket-keeper and an excellent player of quick bowling, could not open and keep wicket, hence his batting down the order, where he was often exposed to spin which he did not play as well.\n\nStewart took the reins as captain in 1998, but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him Test and ODI captaincy in 1999. This should not detract from the 1998 home Test series where England showed great fortitude to beat a powerful South African side 2\u20131.\n\nAnother reason for their poor performances were the demands of [[County Championship|County Cricket]] teams on their players, meaning that England could rarely field a full-strength team on their tours. This eventually led to the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] taking over from the MCC as the governing body of England and the implementation of central contracts. 1992 also saw Scotland sever ties with the England and Wales team, and begin to compete as the [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland national team]].\n\nBy 1999, with coach David Lloyd resigning after the World Cup exit and new captain [[Nasser Hussain]] just appointed, England hit rock bottom (literally ranked as the lowest-rated Test nation) after losing 2\u20131 to New Zealand in shambolic fashion. Hussain was booed on the Oval balcony as the crowd jeered \"We've got the worst team in the world\" to the tune of \"[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]\".\n\n===2000s===\nCentral contracts were installed \u2013 reducing players workloads \u2013 and following the arrival of Zimbabwean coach [[Duncan Fletcher]], England thrashed the fallen West Indies [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2000|3\u20131]]. England's results in Asia improved that winter with series wins against both [[History of cricket in Pakistan from 2001#England 2000\u201301|Pakistan]] and [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2000\u201301|Sri Lanka]]. Hussain's side had a far harder edge to it, avoiding the anticipated \"Greenwash\" in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 2001|2001 Ashes series]] against the all-powerful Australian team. The nucleus the side was slowly coming together as players such as Hussain himself, [[Graham Thorpe]], [[Darren Gough]] and [[Ashley Giles]] began to be regularly selected. By 2003 though, having endured [[English cricket team in Australia in 2002\u201303|another Ashes drubbing]] as well as another first-round exit from the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]], Hussain resigned as captain after one Test against [[South African cricket team in England in 2003|South Africa]].\n\n[[Michael Vaughan]] took over, with players encouraged to express themselves. England won five consecutive Test series prior to facing Australia in the [[2005 Ashes series]], [[International cricket in 2005#ICC Championship tables in May 2005|taking the team to second place]] in the [[ICC Test Championship]] table. During this period England defeated the West Indies [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2004|home]] and [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2003\u201304|away]], [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2004|New Zealand]], and [[Bangladeshi cricket team in England in 2005|Bangladesh]] at home, and [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2004\u201305|South Africa]] in South Africa. In June 2005, England played its first ever [[Twenty20 International|T20 international match]], [[Australian cricket team in England in 2005#England v Australia (13 June)|defeating Australia by 100 runs]]. Later that year, England defeated Australia 2\u20131 in a thrilling series to regain the Ashes for the first time in 16 years, having lost them in 1989. Following the 2005 Ashes win, the team suffered from a spate of serious injuries to key players such as Vaughan, Giles, [[Andrew Flintoff]] and [[Simon Jones (cricketer)|Simon Jones]]. As a result, the team underwent an enforced period of transition. A [[English cricket team in Pakistan in 2005\u201306|2\u20130 defeat in Pakistan]] was followed by two drawn away series with [[English cricket team in India in 2005\u201306|India]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006|Sri Lanka]].\n\nIn the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2006|home Test series victory against Pakistan]] in July and August 2006, several promising new players emerged. Most notable were the left-arm orthodox spin bowler [[Monty Panesar]], the first [[Sikh]] to play Test cricket for England, and left-handed opening batsman [[Alastair Cook]]. The [[2006\u201307 Ashes series]] was keenly anticipated and was expected to provide a level of competition comparable to the 2005 series. In the event, England, captained by Flintoff who was deputising for the injured Vaughan, lost all five Tests to concede the first Ashes whitewash in 86 years.\n\nIn the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], England lost to most of the Test playing nations they faced, beating only the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]], although they also avoided defeat by any of the non-Test playing nations. Even so, the unimpressive nature of most of their victories in the tournament, combined with heavy defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, left many commentators criticising the manner in which the England team approached the one-day game. Coach Duncan Fletcher resigned after eight years in the job as a result and was succeeded by former [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] coach [[Peter Moores (cricketer)|Peter Moores]].\n\nIn 2007\u201308, England toured [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2007\u201308|Sri Lanka]] and [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 2007\u201308|New Zealand]], losing the first series 1\u20130 and winning the second 2\u20131. These series were followed up at home in May 2008 with a [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2008|2\u20130 home series win against New Zealand]], with the results easing pressure on Moores \u2013 who was not at ease with his team, particularly star batsman [[Kevin Pietersen]]. Pietersen succeeded Vaughan as captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by [[South African cricket team in England in 2008|South Africa at home]]. The poor relationship between the two came to a head on the [[English cricket team in India in 2008\u201309|2008\u201309 tour to India]]. England lost the series 1\u20130 and both men resigned their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team. Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean [[Andy Flower]]. Against this background, England toured the [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2008\u201309|West Indies]] under the captaincy of [[Andrew Strauss]] and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1\u20130.\n\nThe [[2009 Ashes series]] featured the first Test match played in Wales, at [[Sophia Gardens (cricket ground)|Sophia Gardens]], Cardiff. England drew the match thanks to a last-wicket stand by bowlers [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and Panesar. A victory for each team followed before the series was decided at The Oval. Thanks to fine bowling by [[Stuart Broad]] and [[Graeme Swann]] and a debut century by [[Jonathan Trott]], England regained the Ashes.\n\n===2010s===\nAfter a drawn [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2009\u201310|Test series in South Africa]], England won their first ever ICC world championship, the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|2010 World Twenty20]], with a seven-wicket win over Australia in Barbados. The following winter in the [[2010\u201311 Ashes series|2010\u201311 Ashes]], they beat Australia 3\u20131 to retain the urn and record their first series win in Australia for 24 years. Furthermore, all three of their wins were by an innings \u2013 the first time a touring side had ever recorded three innings victories in a single Test series. Cook earned Man of the Series with 766 runs.\n\nEngland struggled to match their Test form in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]]. Despite beating South Africa and tying with eventual winners India, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh before losing in the quarter-finals to Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka vs England, 4th quarter-final ICC World Cup 2011|url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/4th-quarter-final-sri-lanka-vs-england.html|date=26 March 2011|access-date=26 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818070122/http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/4th-quarter-final-sri-lanka-vs-england.html|archive-date=18 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> However the team's excellent form in the Test match arena continued and on 13 August 2011, they became the world's top-ranked Test team after [[Indian cricket team in England in 2011|comfortably whitewashing India 4\u20130]], their sixth consecutive series victory and eighth in the past nine series. However, this status only lasted a year \u2013 having [[England cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2011\u201312|lost 3\u20130 to Pakistan]] over the winter, England were [[South African cricket team in England in 2012|beaten 2\u20130 by South Africa]], who replaced them at the top of the rankings. It was their first home series loss since 2008, against the same opposition.\n\nThis loss saw the resignation of Strauss as captain (and his retirement from cricket). Cook, who was already in charge of the ODI side, replaced Strauss and led England to a [[English cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|2\u20131 victory in India]] \u2013 their first in the country since 1984\u201385. In doing so, he became the first captain to score centuries in his first five Tests as captain and became England's leading century-maker with 23 centuries to his name.\n[[File:The England Cricket Team Ashes 2015.jpg|thumbnail|right|The England team celebrate victory over Australia in the [[2015 Ashes series]]]]\nAfter finishing as runners-up in the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy|ICC Champions Trophy]], England faced Australia in back-to-back Ashes series. A [[2013 Ashes series|3\u20130 home win]] secured England the urn for the fourth time in five series. However, in [[2013\u201314 Ashes series|the return series]], they found themselves utterly demolished in a 5\u20130 defeat, their second Ashes whitewash in under a decade. Their misery was compounded by batsman Jonathan Trott leaving the tour early due to a stress-related illness and the mid-series retirement of spinner Graeme Swann. Following the tour, head coach Flower resigned his post while Pietersen was dropped indefinitely from the England team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26040475 |title=Kevin Pietersen: Batsman's England career over |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 February 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606010906/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26040475 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Flower was replaced by his predecessor, Moores, but he was sacked for a second time after a string of disappointing results including failing to advance from the group stage at the [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/moores-leaves-role-england-head-coach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175138/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/moores-leaves-role-england-head-coach |archivedate=5 November 2015 }}</ref> He was replaced by Australian [[Trevor Bayliss]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-names-trevor-bayliss-englands-new-head-coach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129101453/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-names-trevor-bayliss-englands-new-head-coach |archivedate=29 January 2016 }}</ref> who oversaw an upturn of form in the ODI side, including series victories against [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2015#ODI series|New Zealand]] and [[English cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2015\u201316#ODI series|Pakistan]].

However, under [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] regulations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icc-live.s3.amazonaws.com/cms/media/about_docs/523af0cd4a1db-Player%20Eligibility%20Rules%20-%20effective%2018%20September%202013.pdf|title=The International Cricket Council Player Eligibility Regulations|date=18 September 2013|accessdate=22 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721114235/http://icc-live.s3.amazonaws.com/cms/media/about_docs/523af0cd4a1db-Player%20Eligibility%20Rules%20-%20effective%2018%20September%202013.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> players can qualify to play for a country by nationality, place of birth or residence, so (as with any national sports team) some people are eligible to play for more than one team. [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] regulations<ref>https://pulse-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ecb/document/2018/03/18/3c8ad1be-06f8-468a-86a3-96e20f2fe00b/FCC_KSL_RegistrationRegs_2018.pdf</ref> state that to play for England, a player must be a [[British citizenship|British citizen]], and have either been born in England or Wales, or have lived in England or Wales for three years. This has led to players who also held other nationalities becoming eligible to play for England. The qualification period for those born outside England and Wales has varied in the past, but in November 2018 the ECB announced that the period would be reduced to three years in all circumstances, in line with ICC regulations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25407156/jofra-archer-play-england-world-cup-ecb-amend-eligibility-rules|title=Jofra Archer could play for England at World Cup after ECB amend eligibility rules|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129160629/http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25407156/jofra-archer-play-england-world-cup-ecb-amend-eligibility-rules|archive-date=29 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOf the current squad (see above), [[Jason Roy]] was born to British parents in South Africa and Keaton Jennings was born in South Africa to a British mother \u2013 both had to fulfil residency requirements. In addition, [[Chris Jordan (cricketer)|Chris Jordan]], [[Ben Stokes]] and Tom Curran have British citizenship, having lived in England since their youth, while [[Eoin Morgan]] also holds Irish citizenship. Curran's younger brother, Sam, was born in the UK, so did not have to have to undergo a qualification period. Jofra Archer, though born in Barbados to a Barbadian mother, qualifies through his English father.\n\nICC regulations also allow cricketers who represent [[List of International Cricket Council members#Top Associate/Affiliate Members|associate]] (i.e. non-Test-playing) nations to switch to a Test-playing nation, provided nationality requirements are fulfilled. In recent years, this has seen Irish internationals [[Ed Joyce]], [[Boyd Rankin]] and Eoin Morgan switch to represent England, whilst [[Gavin Hamilton (cricketer)|Gavin Hamilton]] previously played for Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 though Joyce, Rankin and Hamilton were later able to re-qualify for and represent the countries of their birth.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal bar|Cricket}}\n* [[List of England cricket captains]]\n* [[List of England cricket team coaches]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Waghorn|first=H.
