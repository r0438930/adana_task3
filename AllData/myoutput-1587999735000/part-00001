In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. Earning the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}}, he is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite this reputation, Vash shows a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and becoming friends with civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as strong gunner who would stand out due to his [[pacifist]] ways, something he believed was strange in action films as he aimed to explore more the characters he clashes with. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by  [[Masaya Onosaka]] in Japanese and [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] in English. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity. \n\nCritical reception to Vash has been positive because he avoids common cliches in narrative such due to how despite his kind and goofy personality, he is still a serious person. His ideals of pacifism were praised for how seriously it was taken although it was also criticized for being repetitive. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch received praise for their performances; however, critics favored Onosaka over Bosch.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede]]\n\nVash was created by [[manga author]] [[Yasuhiro Nightow]].<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite web |url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |title=Dark Horse Interview |publisher=Dark Horse Comics|date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-03-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011185649/http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |archivedate=2013-10-11 }}</ref> His name, Vash, was an original creation.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |title=Anime Expo 2009 |publisher=Anime Expo |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2012-03-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150426/http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 }}</ref> Nightow made the character a pacifist because he felt it strange people are always dying in action movies and wondered why they died so quickly.

Having previously worked on the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' television series, Bosch tried to use a quiet tone to fit his character. Bosch came to like his character, especially the line \"This world is made of Love and Peace!\". His character and [[Nicholas D. Wolfwood]] are Bosch's favorites from ''Trigun''.

In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. Earning the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}}, he is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite this reputation, Vash shows a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and becoming friends with civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as strong gunner who would stand out due to his [[pacifist]] ways, something he believed was strange in action films as he aimed to explore more the characters he clashes with. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by  [[Masaya Onosaka]] in Japanese and [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] in English. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity. \n\nCritical reception to Vash has been positive because he avoids common cliches in narrative such due to how despite his kind and goofy personality, he is still a serious person. His ideals of pacifism were praised for how seriously it was taken although it was also criticized for being repetitive. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch received praise for their performances; however, critics favored Onosaka over Bosch.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede]]\n\nVash was created by [[manga author]] [[Yasuhiro Nightow]].<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite web |url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |title=Dark Horse Interview |publisher=Dark Horse Comics|date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-03-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011185649/http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |archivedate=2013-10-11 }}</ref> His name, Vash, was an original creation.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |title=Anime Expo 2009 |publisher=Anime Expo |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2012-03-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150426/http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 }}</ref> Nightow made the character a pacifist because he felt it strange people are always dying in action movies and wondered why they died so quickly.
