Hungarian politics and foreign policy had become more stridently nationalistic by 1938, and Hungary adopted an [[Irredentism|irredentist]] policy similar to Germany's, attempting to incorporate ethnic Hungarian areas in neighboring countries into Hungary. Hungary benefited territorially from its relationship with the Axis. Settlements were negotiated regarding territorial disputes with the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak Republic]], and the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis powers. The following year, Hungarian forces participated in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Their participation was noted by German observers for its particular cruelty, with occupied peoples subjected to arbitrary violence. Hungarian volunteers were sometimes referred to as engaging in \"murder tourism.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ungv\u00e1ry|first=Kriszti\u00e1n|date=2007-03-23|title=Hungarian Occupation Forces in the Ukraine 1941\u20131942: The Historiographical Context|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=81\u2013120|doi=10.1080/13518040701205480|issn=1351-8046}}</ref>\n\nWhile waging war against the [[Soviet Union]], Hungary engaged in [[armistice]] negotiations with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Hitler discovered this betrayal, and in March 1944, [[Operation Margarethe|German forces occupied Hungary]]. When Soviet forces began threatening Hungary, an armistice was signed between Hungary and the USSR by Regent [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Soon afterward, Horthy's son was kidnapped by German commandos and Horthy was forced to revoke the armistice. The Regent was then deposed from power, while Hungarian fascist leader [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] established a new government, with German backing. In 1945, Hungarian and German forces in Hungary were defeated by advancing Soviet armies.\n\nApproximately 300,000 Hungarian soldiers and more than 600,000 civilians died during World War II, including among them more than 400,000 [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jews]] and 28,000 [[Roma in Hungary|Roma]]. Many cities were damaged, most notably the capital [[Budapest]]. Most Jews in Hungary were protected from deportation to German [[extermination camp]]s for the first few years of the war, although they had for a longer period been subjected to a series of anti-Jewish laws which imposed limits on Jewish participation in Hungary's public and economic life.<ref>Pogany, Istvan, ''Righting Wrongs in Eastern Europe'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pp.26\u201339, 80\u201394.</ref> From the start of the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, Jews and Roma were deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

This unwelcome political division dominated the political life of Hungary during the [[Interwar period|period]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]]]\nIn [[Hungary]], the joint effect of the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] resulted in shifting the political mood of the country towards the [[Right-wing politics|right]]. In 1932, the regent [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] appointed a new Prime Minister, [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]]. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s was identified with the [[Hungarian National Defence Association]] (''Magyar Orsz\u00e1gos V\u00e9der\u0151 Egylet'', or MOVE). He led Hungarian international policy towards closer cooperation with Germany, and started an [[Magyarization|effort to assimilate minorities]] in Hungary. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s signed a trade agreement with Germany (21 February 1934)<ref>'2.

Although he assembled a strong political machine, his efforts to achieve his vision and reforms were frustrated by a parliament composed mostly of [[Istv\u00e1n Bethlen]]'s supporters and by Hungary's creditors, who forced G\u00f6mb\u00f6s to follow conventional policies in dealing with the economic and financial crisis. The result of the 1935 elections gave G\u00f6mb\u00f6s more solid support in [[Parliament of Hungary|parliament]]. He succeeded in gaining control of the ministries of finance, industry, and defense and in replacing several key military officers with his supporters. In October 1936, he died due to kidney problems without realizing his goals.\n\nHungary used its relationship with Germany to attempt to revise the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, Hungary openly repudiated the treaty's restrictions on its armed forces. [[Adolf Hitler]] gave promises to return lost territories and threats of military intervention and economic pressure to encourage the Hungarian Government to support the policies and goals of Nazi Germany. In 1935, a Hungarian fascist party, the [[Arrow Cross Party]], led by [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] was founded. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s' successor, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Dar\u00e1nyi]], attempted to appease both Nazis and Hungarian [[antisemitism|antisemites]] by passing the First Jewish Law, which set quotas limiting Jews to 20% of positions in several professions. The law satisfied neither the Nazis nor Hungary's own radicals, and when Dar\u00e1nyi resigned in May 1938 [[B\u00e9la Imr\u00e9dy]] was appointed Prime Minister.\n\n[[File:P\u00e1l Teleki 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[P\u00e1l Teleki]], prime minister of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131921 and 1939\u20131941)]]\nImr\u00e9dy's attempts to improve Hungary's diplomatic relations with the [[United Kingdom]] initially made him very unpopular with Germany and Italy. Aware of Germany's [[Anschluss]] with Austria in March, he realized that he could not afford to alienate Germany and Italy on a long term basis: in the autumn of 1938 his foreign policy became very much pro-German and pro-Italian.<ref name=\"Montgomery\" /> Intent on amassing a powerbase in Hungarian right wing politics, Imr\u00e9dy started to suppress political rivals, so the increasingly influential Arrow Cross Party was harassed, and eventually banned by Imr\u00e9dy's administration. As Imr\u00e9dy drifted further to the right, he proposed that the government be reorganized along [[totalitarian]] lines and drafted a harsher Second Jewish Law. Imr\u00e9dy's political opponents, however, forced his resignation in February 1939 by presenting documents showing that his grandfather was a Jew. Nevertheless, the new government of Count [[P\u00e1l Teleki]] approved the Second Jewish Law, which cut the quotas on Jews permitted in the professions and in business. Furthermore, the new law defined Jews by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] instead of just religion, thus altering the status of those who had formerly [[religious conversion|converted]] from [[Judaism]] to [[Christianity]].\n\n==Territorial expansion==\n[[File:TeritorialGainsHungary1920-41.svg|235px|thumb|Territories that Hungary gained back with the Vienna Awards and military occupation (1938\u20131941)]]\n[[File:Hungary 1941 ethnic.svg|thumb|235px|Ethnic make-up of post-1941 Hungary]]\n[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]] sought to peacefully enforce the claims of Hungarians on territories Hungary had lost with the signing of the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Two significant territorial awards were made. These awards were known as the [[First Vienna Award]] and the [[Second Vienna Award]].\n\nIn October 1938, the [[Munich Agreement]] caused the dissolution of the [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938)|Czechoslovak Republic]] and the creation of the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czech-Slovak Republic]] (also known as the \"Second Czechoslovak Republic\"). Some autonomy was granted to Slovakia and to [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] in the new republic. On 5 October, about 500 members of the Hungarian [[Rongyos G\u00e1rda|Ragged Guard]] infiltrated Slovakia and Ruthenia as \"[[guerrillas]]\". On 9 October, the Kingdom of Hungary started talks with the Czecho-Slovak Republic over Magyar-populated regions of southern Slovakia and southern Ruthenia. On 11 October, the Hungarian guards were defeated by Czecho-Slovak troops at [[Berehove|Berehovo]] and Borzsava in Ruthenia. The Hungarians suffered approximately 350 casualties and, by 29 October, the talks were deadlocked.<ref name=\"Thomas, pg. 11\">Thomas, ''The Royal Hungarian Army in World War II'', pg. 11</ref>\n\n===First Vienna Award===\nOn 2 November 1938, the [[First Vienna Award]] transferred to Hungary parts of southern Slovakia and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] from Czechoslovakia, an area amounting to 11,927&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 869,299 (86.5% of which were Hungarians<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/2vhSzakkonyv-magyarok-a-ii-vilaghaboruban-2/a-delvideki-hadmuvelet-1941-aprilis-874/tendenciak-a-ket-vilaghaboru-kozott-88B/az-elso-becsi-dontes-szovege-8AB/ |title=AZ ELS\u0150 B\u00c9CSI D\u00d6NT\u00c9S SZ\u00d6VEGE |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.arcanum.hu |publisher=Arcanum Adatb\u00e1zis Kft. |language=hu}}</ref>). Between 5 and 10 November, Hungarian armed forces occupied the newly transferred territories.<ref name=\"Thomas, pg. 11\"/>\n\n===Occupation of Carpatho-Ukraine===\nIn March 1939, the Czecho-Slovak Republic was dissolved, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded it]], and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was established. On 14 March, [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovakia]] declared itself to be an independent state. On 15 March, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] declared itself to be an independent state. Hungary rejected the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine and, between 14 and 18 March, Hungarian armed forces occupied the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia and ousted the government of [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]. By contrast, Hungary recognized the German [[puppet state]] of Slovakia led by the [[Clerical fascism|Clerical Fascist]] [[Jozef Tiso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3430.htm|title=Slovakia|work=U.S. Department of State|df=}}</ref> But on 23 March 1939, Hungarian attacks Slovakia on the east claiming a border dispute, led to a localized armed conflict between the two countries. The [[Slovak\u2013Hungarian War]], also known as the \"Little War\", ended with Hungary gaining the easternmost strip of Slovakia, 1697&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\n===Second Vienna Award===\nIn September 1940, with troops massing on both sides of the Hungarian-Romanian border, war was averted by the [[Second Vienna Award]]. This award transferred to Hungary the northern half of [[Transylvania]], with a total area of 43,492&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a total population of 2,578,100 divided more or less evenly between Hungarians and Romanians (depending on the census, cf. [[Second Vienna Award#Statistics|Second Vienna Award]]). By dividing Transylvania between Romania and Hungary, Hitler was able to ease tensions in both countries.\n\n===Occupation and annexation of Yugoslav territories===\n{{main article|Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories}}\nAfter [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invading Yugoslavia]] on 11 April 1941, Hungary annexed sections of [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]], [[Ba\u010dka]], [[Me\u0111imurje]], and [[Prekmurje]].<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html Hungary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203003152/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html |date=3 February 2007 }} \u2013 Shoah Foundation Institute Visual History Archive</ref> The returned territories \u2013 11417&nbsp;km\u00b2 \u2013 had a population of 1,025,508 which comprised 36.6 % Hungarians, 19 % Germans, 16% Serbs and 28.4% others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Lexikonok-magyarorszag-a-masodik-vilaghaboruban-lexikon-a-zs-F062E/d-F088D/delvidek-visszacsatolasa-F08AB/ |title=D\u00e9lvid\u00e9k visszacsatol\u00e1sa |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.arcanum.hu |publisher=Arcanum Adatb\u00e1zis Kft. |language=hu }}</ref>\n\n==Administration of Greater Hungary==\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary (1941\u201344)}}\n[[File:Kingdom of Hungary 1944 44 Varmegye.png|right|thumb|320px|Kingdom of Hungary 1941\u201344]]\nFollowing the two Vienna awards, a number of counties that had been lost in whole or part by the [[Trianon peace treaty|Treaty of Trianon]] were restored to Hungary.

This was prepared and billed in the Hungarian Parliament, but in the end, after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] it never passed through.<ref>G\u00e9za Vasas \u2013 A ruszin auton\u00f3mia v\u00e1lasz\u00fatjain (1939. m\u00e1rcius-szeptember) \u2013 On  the crossroads of Ruthenian autonomy (March\u2013September 1939), [http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/40971/1/aetas_2000_004_064-088.pdf]</ref> However, in the corresponding territory the Governorate of Subcarpathia was formed which was divided into three, the ''administrative branch offices'' of Ung ({{lang-hu|Ungi k\u00f6zigazgat\u00e1si kirendelts\u00e9g}}), Bereg ({{lang-hu|Beregi k\u00f6zigazgat\u00e1si kirendelts\u00e9g}}) and M\u00e1ramaros ({{lang-hu|M\u00e1ramarosi k\u00f6zigazgat\u00e1si kirendelts\u00e9g}}), having [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Rusyn language]] as official languages.\n\n==Military campaigns==\n===Invasion of Yugoslavia===\n{{Main article|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nOn 20 November 1940, under pressure from Germany, Hungarian prime Minister [[P\u00e1l Teleki]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. In December 1940, Teleki also signed an ephemeral \"[[Treaty of Eternal Friendship (1940)|Treaty of Eternal Friendship]]\" with the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. At that time, Yugoslavia was under a [[Regent]], [[Pavle Karadjordjevic|Prince Paul]] who was also under German pressure.\n\nOn 25 March 1941, Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact on behalf of Yugoslavia. Two days later, a Yugoslavian ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' removed Prince Paul, replaced him with pro-[[United Kingdom|British]] [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]], and threatened the success of the planned [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]].\n\nHitler asked the Hungarians to support his invasion of Yugoslavia. He promised to return some territory to Hungary in exchange for military cooperation. On 3 April 1941, unable to prevent Hungary's participation in the war alongside Germany, Teleki committed suicide. The right-wing radical [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e1rdossy]] succeeded him as Prime Minister.\n\nThree days after Teleki's death, the [[Luftwaffe]] [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|bombed Belgrade]] without warning. The German Army invaded Yugoslavia and quickly crushed Yugoslavian armed resistance. Horthy dispatched the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]] to [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|occupy Vojvodina]].\n\n===Invasion of the Soviet Union===\n[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank used during the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.]]\nHungary did not immediately participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. The invasion began on 22 June 1941, but Hitler did not directly ask for Hungarian assistance. Nonetheless, many Hungarian officials argued for participation in the war in order to encourage Hitler not to favour Romania in the event of border revisions in Transylvania. On 26 June 1941, the Soviet air force [[Bombing of Kassa|bombed Ko\u0161ice]] (Kassa).

Attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]], the Karpat Group advanced far into Soviet Ukraine, and, later, southern Russia. At the [[Battle of Uman]], fought between 3 and 8 August, the Karpat Group's mechanized corps acted as one half of a pincer that encircled the [[6th Army (Soviet Union)|6th Soviet Army]] and the 12th Soviet Army. Twenty Soviet divisions were captured or destroyed in this action.\n\nIn July 1941, the Hungarian government transferred responsibility for 18,000 Jews from Carpato-Ruthenian Hungary to the German armed forces. These Jews, without Hungarian citizenship, were sent to a location near [[Kamenets-Podolski]], where in one of the first acts of mass killing of Jews during World War II, all but [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre|two thousand of these individuals were shot]] by [[Einsatzgruppe|Nazi mobile killing units]].<ref name=\"HDKE\">[http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070101&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=b39689db307eea957accaa1d04e4c330The Holocaust in Hungary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609154602/http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070101&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=b39689db307eea957accaa1d04e4c330The |date=9 June 2011 }} Holocaust Memorial Centre.</ref><ref name=holocaust>{{cite web|title=Hungary Before the German Occupation|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005457|accessdate=22 September 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65s7Q60Wf?url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005457|archivedate=2 March 2012}}</ref> B\u00e1rdossy then passed the \"Third Jewish Law\" in August 1941, prohibiting marriage and sexual intercourse of Hungarians with Jews.\n\nSix months after the mass murder at Kamianets-Podilskyi in January 1942, Hungarian troops [[Novi Sad raid|massacred]] 3,000 Serbian and Jewish hostages near [[Novi Sad]], Yugoslavia.\n\nWorried about Hungary's increasing reliance on Germany, Admiral Horthy forced B\u00e1rdossy to resign and replaced him with [[Mikl\u00f3s K\u00e1llay]], a veteran conservative of Bethlen's government. K\u00e1llay continued B\u00e1rdossy's policy of supporting Germany against the Red Army while also initiating negotiations with the Western Allies. Hungarian participation in Operation Barbarossa during 1941 was limited in part because the country had no real large army before 1939, and time to train and equip troops had been short. But by 1942, tens of thousands of Hungarians were fighting on the eastern front in the [[Royal Hungarian Army]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8283A-12A, Budapest, marschierende Pfeilkreuzler und Panzer VI.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hungarian Arrow Cross army/militia and a German [[Tiger II]] tank in Budapest, October 1944.]]\nDuring the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]] suffered terrible losses. The Soviet breakthrough at the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] sliced directly through the Hungarian units. Shortly after the fall of Stalingrad in January 1943, the Hungarian 2nd Army was crushed by the Soviets at the [[Battle of Voronezh (1943)|Battle of Voronezh]]. Ignoring German orders to stand and fight to the death, the bewildered Hungarian troops, fighting without antitank weaponry or armored support, turned and fled. Harassed by partisan groups and Soviet air attacks, and having to endure the Russian winter weather, they tried in vain to retreat. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner by the Soviet army, and total casualties numbered more than 100,000 men. The [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian army]] ceased to exist as an effective fighting force, and the Germans pulled them from the front.\n\nWhile K\u00e1llay was Prime Minister, the Jews endured increased economic and [[political repression]], although many, particularly those in Budapest, were temporarily protected from the [[final solution]]. For most of the war, the Hungarian Jews lived an uneasy existence. They were deprived of most freedoms, but were not subjected to physical harm, and Horthy tried to contain anti-Semitic groups like the Arrow Cross. Secret negotiations with the British and Americans continued. As per the request of the Western Allies, there were no connections made with the Soviets.\n\n===German occupation of Hungary===\n[[File:Hungary, Budapest Fortepan 72907.jpg|thumb|Propaganda posters in Budapest, 1944]]\nAware of K\u00e1llay's deceit and fearing that Hungary might conclude a separate peace, in March 1944, Hitler launched [[Operation Margarethe]] and ordered Nazi troops to occupy Hungary. Horthy was confined to a castle, in essence, placed under [[house arrest]]. [[D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay]], an avid supporter of the National Socialists, became the new Prime Minister.  Szt\u00f3jay governed with the aid of a National Socialist military governor, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]]. The Hungarian populace was not happy with their nation being reduced in effect to a German protectorate, but Berlin threatened to occupy Hungary with [[Slovak Republic (1939\u201345)|Slovak]], [[NDH|Croat]], and Romanian troops if they did not comply. The thought of these ancestral enemies on Hungarian soil was seen as far worse than German control. Ironically, Hungary still kept whole divisions on the border with Romania even as the troops of both nations were fighting and dying together in the Russian winter.\n\nAs the Soviets pushed westward, Sztojay's government proceeded to muster new armies. The Hungarian troops again suffered terrible losses, but now had a motive to protect their homeland from Soviet occupation.\n\nIn August 1944, Horthy replaced Szt\u00f3jay with the anti-Fascist General [[G\u00e9za Lakatos]]. Under the Lakatos regime, acting Interior Minister [[B\u00e9la Horv\u00e1th]] ordered Hungarian [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] to prevent any Hungarian citizens from being deported. The Germans were unhappy with the situation, but could not do a great deal about it. Horthy's actions thus bought the Jews of Budapest a few months of time.\n\n===Soviet occupation of Hungary===\n[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|right|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in 1944.]]\n{{details|Siege of Budapest}}\nIn September 1944, Soviet forces crossed the Hungarian border. On 15 October, Horthy announced that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. The Hungarian army ignored the armistice, fighting desperately to keep the Soviets out. The Germans launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and, by kidnapping his son [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy Jr.]], forced Horthy to abrogate the armistice, depose the Lakatos government, and name the leader of the [[Arrow Cross Party]], [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], as Prime Minister.  Horthy resigned and Sz\u00e1lasi became Prime Minister of a new \"[[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]]\" (''Nemzeti \u00d6sszefog\u00e1s Korm\u00e1nya'') controlled by the Germans. Horthy himself was taken to Germany as a prisoner. He ultimately survived the war and spent his last years exiled in Portugal, dying in 1957.\n\nIn cooperation with the Nazis, Sz\u00e1lasi attempted to resume deportations of Jews, but Germany's fast-disintegrating communications largely prevented this from happening. Nonetheless, the Arrow Cross launched a reign of terror against the Jews of Budapest. Thousands were tortured, raped and murdered in the last months of the war, and their property looted or destroyed. Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] saved thousands of Budapest Jews using Swedish protective passports. He was ultimately taken prisoner by the Soviets and died some years later in a labor camp. Other foreign diplomats like [[Nuncio]] [[Angelo Rotta]], [[Giorgio Perlasca]], [[Carl Lutz]], [[Friedrich Born]], [[Harald Feller]], [[Angel Sanz Briz]] and [[George Mandel-Mantello]] also organized false papers and safe houses for Jews in Budapest. Of the approximately 800,000 Jews residing within Hungary's expanded borders of 1941, only 200,000 (about 25%) survived [[the Holocaust]].<ref>[http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070102&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=41e4d6b481e6ac01d487afa1b38b615c Victims of Holocaust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311005711/http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070102&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=41e4d6b481e6ac01d487afa1b38b615c |date=11 March 2008 }} \u2013 Holocaust Memorial Centre. </ref> An estimated 28,000 Hungarian Roma were also killed as part of the [[Porajmos]].\n\nSoon Hungary itself became a battlefield. Sz\u00e1lasi promised [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|a Greater Hungary]] and prosperity for the peasants, but in reality Hungary was crumbling and its armies were slowly being destroyed. As an integral part of German General [[Maximilian Fretter-Pico]]'s ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'', the re-formed [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]] enjoyed a modest level of combat success.  From 6 to 29 October 1944, during the [[Battle of Debrecen]], ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'' managed to achieve a major win on the battlefield. Avoiding encirclement itself, ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'' encircled and severely mauled three Soviet tank corps serving under the Mobile Group of [[Issa Pliyev]]. Earlier in the same battle, Mobile Group Pliyev had sliced through the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]]. But success was costly and, unable to replace lost armor and heavy artillery munitions, the Hungarian Second Army was defeated on 1 December 1944.  The remnants of the Second Army were incorporated into the Third Army.\n\n[[File:Azertis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"Despite it all..!\", a propaganda poster of the banned fascist Arrow Cross party which took power when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary in 1944.]]\nIn October 1944, the [[First Army (Hungary)|Hungarian First Army]] was attached to the German [[1st Panzer Army]], participating defensively against the Red Army's advance towards [[Budapest]]. On 28 December 1944, a provisional government was formed in Hungary under acting Prime Minister [[B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s]]. Mikl\u00f3s and Sz\u00e1lasi each claimed to be the legitimate Head of government. The Germans and pro-German Hungarians loyal to Sz\u00e1lasi fought on.\n\nThe Soviets and Romanians completed the encirclement of Budapest on 29 December 1944. The battle for the city turned into the [[Siege of Budapest]]. During the fight, most of what remained of the Hungarian First Army was destroyed about {{convert|200|km}} north of Budapest in a running battle from 1 January to 16 February 1945. On 20 January 1945, representatives of the Mikl\u00f3s provisional government signed an armistice in Moscow. In January 1945, 32,000 ethnic Germans from within Hungary were arrested and transported to the Soviet Union as forced laborers.

In July 1943 the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Smallholders Party]] adopted [[Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky]]'s policy of working more closely with [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]]\nand the Communists and on 31 July demanded from the government an end to hostilities and joining the Allies even at the price of armed conflict with Germany. At the beginning of August 1943 a programme of action was formally concluded with the Social Democrats and on 11 September they issued a joint declaration against the war on the side of Germany.\n\nVarious opposition groups deprived of their leaders most of whom had been arrested by the [[Gestapo]] after the German occupation in March 1944 joined forces in May 1944 in the Communist-inspired [[Hungarian Front]] (Magyar Front). They demanded a \"new struggle of liberation\" against the German occupation forces and their collaborators and called for the creation of a new democratic Hungary after the war. The representatives of the Hungarian Front, being informed by Horthy of plans for an armistice on 11 October, founded the [[Committee of Liberation of the Hungarian National Uprising]] on 11 November 1944.

Hungarian politics and foreign policy had become more stridently nationalistic by 1938, and Hungary adopted an [[Irredentism|irredentist]] policy similar to Germany's, attempting to incorporate ethnic Hungarian areas in neighboring countries into Hungary. Hungary benefited territorially from its relationship with the Axis. Settlements were negotiated regarding territorial disputes with the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak Republic]], and the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis powers. The following year, Hungarian forces participated in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Their participation was noted by German observers for its particular cruelty, with occupied peoples subjected to arbitrary violence. Hungarian volunteers were sometimes referred to as engaging in \"murder tourism.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ungv\u00e1ry|first=Kriszti\u00e1n|date=2007-03-23|title=Hungarian Occupation Forces in the Ukraine 1941\u20131942: The Historiographical Context|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=81\u2013120|doi=10.1080/13518040701205480|issn=1351-8046}}</ref>\n\nWhile waging war against the [[Soviet Union]], Hungary engaged in [[armistice]] negotiations with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Hitler discovered this betrayal, and in March 1944, [[Operation Margarethe|German forces occupied Hungary]]. When Soviet forces began threatening Hungary, an armistice was signed between Hungary and the USSR by Regent [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Soon afterward, Horthy's son was kidnapped by German commandos and Horthy was forced to revoke the armistice. The Regent was then deposed from power, while Hungarian fascist leader [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] established a new government, with German backing. In 1945, Hungarian and German forces in Hungary were defeated by advancing Soviet armies.\n\nApproximately 300,000 Hungarian soldiers and more than 600,000 civilians died during World War II, including among them more than 400,000 [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jews]] and 28,000 [[Roma in Hungary|Roma]]. Many cities were damaged, most notably the capital [[Budapest]]. Most Jews in Hungary were protected from deportation to German [[extermination camp]]s for the first few years of the war, although they had for a longer period been subjected to a series of anti-Jewish laws which imposed limits on Jewish participation in Hungary's public and economic life.<ref>Pogany, Istvan, ''Righting Wrongs in Eastern Europe'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pp.26\u201339, 80\u201394.</ref> From the start of the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, Jews and Roma were deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

This unwelcome political division dominated the political life of Hungary during the [[Interwar period|period]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]]]\nIn [[Hungary]], the joint effect of the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] resulted in shifting the political mood of the country towards the [[Right-wing politics|right]]. In 1932, the regent [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] appointed a new Prime Minister, [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]]. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s was identified with the [[Hungarian National Defence Association]] (''Magyar Orsz\u00e1gos V\u00e9der\u0151 Egylet'', or MOVE). He led Hungarian international policy towards closer cooperation with Germany, and started an [[Magyarization|effort to assimilate minorities]] in Hungary. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s signed a trade agreement with Germany (21 February 1934)<ref>'2. Zusatzvertrag zum deutsch-ungarischen Wirtschaftsabkommen von 1931 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=lefKBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155 Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104081226/https://books.google.de/books?id=lefKBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155 |date=4 November 2016 }})</ref> that led to fast expansion of the economy, drawing Hungary out of the Great Depression but making the country dependent on the German economy for both raw materials<!--which ?--> and export revenues.\n\nG\u00f6mb\u00f6s advocated a number of social reforms, [[One-party state|one-party government]]{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, revision of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], and Hungary's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]. Although he assembled a strong political machine, his efforts to achieve his vision and reforms were frustrated by a parliament composed mostly of [[Istv\u00e1n Bethlen]]'s supporters and by Hungary's creditors, who forced G\u00f6mb\u00f6s to follow conventional policies in dealing with the economic and financial crisis. The result of the 1935 elections gave G\u00f6mb\u00f6s more solid support in [[Parliament of Hungary|parliament]]. He succeeded in gaining control of the ministries of finance, industry, and defense and in replacing several key military officers with his supporters. In October 1936, he died due to kidney problems without realizing his goals.\n\nHungary used its relationship with Germany to attempt to revise the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, Hungary openly repudiated the treaty's restrictions on its armed forces. [[Adolf Hitler]] gave promises to return lost territories and threats of military intervention and economic pressure to encourage the Hungarian Government to support the policies and goals of Nazi Germany. In 1935, a Hungarian fascist party, the [[Arrow Cross Party]], led by [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] was founded. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s' successor, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Dar\u00e1nyi]], attempted to appease both Nazis and Hungarian [[antisemitism|antisemites]] by passing the First Jewish Law, which set quotas limiting Jews to 20% of positions in several professions. The law satisfied neither the Nazis nor Hungary's own radicals, and when Dar\u00e1nyi resigned in May 1938 [[B\u00e9la Imr\u00e9dy]] was appointed Prime Minister.\n\n[[File:P\u00e1l Teleki 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[P\u00e1l Teleki]], prime minister of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131921 and 1939\u20131941)]]\nImr\u00e9dy's attempts to improve Hungary's diplomatic relations with the [[United Kingdom]] initially made him very unpopular with Germany and Italy. Aware of Germany's [[Anschluss]] with Austria in March, he realized that he could not afford to alienate Germany and Italy on a long term basis: in the autumn of 1938 his foreign policy became very much pro-German and pro-Italian.<ref name=\"Montgomery\" /> Intent on amassing a powerbase in Hungarian right wing politics, Imr\u00e9dy started to suppress political rivals, so the increasingly influential Arrow Cross Party was harassed, and eventually banned by Imr\u00e9dy's administration. As Imr\u00e9dy drifted further to the right, he proposed that the government be reorganized along [[totalitarian]] lines and drafted a harsher Second Jewish Law. Imr\u00e9dy's political opponents, however, forced his resignation in February 1939 by presenting documents showing that his grandfather was a Jew. Nevertheless, the new government of Count [[P\u00e1l Teleki]] approved the Second Jewish Law, which cut the quotas on Jews permitted in the professions and in business. Furthermore, the new law defined Jews by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] instead of just religion, thus altering the status of those who had formerly [[religious conversion|converted]] from [[Judaism]] to [[Christianity]].\n\n==Territorial expansion==\n[[File:TeritorialGainsHungary1920-41.svg|235px|thumb|Territories that Hungary gained back with the Vienna Awards and military occupation (1938\u20131941)]]\n[[File:Hungary 1941 ethnic.svg|thumb|235px|Ethnic make-up of post-1941 Hungary]]\n[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]] sought to peacefully enforce the claims of Hungarians on territories Hungary had lost with the signing of the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Two significant territorial awards were made. These awards were known as the [[First Vienna Award]] and the [[Second Vienna Award]].\n\nIn October 1938, the [[Munich Agreement]] caused the dissolution of the [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938)|Czechoslovak Republic]] and the creation of the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czech-Slovak Republic]] (also known as the \"Second Czechoslovak Republic\"). Some autonomy was granted to Slovakia and to [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] in the new republic. On 5 October, about 500 members of the Hungarian [[Rongyos G\u00e1rda|Ragged Guard]] infiltrated Slovakia and Ruthenia as \"[[guerrillas]]\". On 9 October, the Kingdom of Hungary started talks with the Czecho-Slovak Republic over Magyar-populated regions of southern Slovakia and southern Ruthenia. On 11 October, the Hungarian guards were defeated by Czecho-Slovak troops at [[Berehove|Berehovo]] and Borzsava in Ruthenia. The Hungarians suffered approximately 350 casualties and, by 29 October, the talks were deadlocked.<ref name=\"Thomas, pg. 11\">Thomas, ''The Royal Hungarian Army in World War II'', pg. 11</ref>\n\n===First Vienna Award===\nOn 2 November 1938, the [[First Vienna Award]] transferred to Hungary parts of southern Slovakia and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] from Czechoslovakia, an area amounting to 11,927&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 869,299 (86.5% of which were Hungarians<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/2vhSzakkonyv-magyarok-a-ii-vilaghaboruban-2/a-delvideki-hadmuvelet-1941-aprilis-874/tendenciak-a-ket-vilaghaboru-kozott-88B/az-elso-becsi-dontes-szovege-8AB/ |title=AZ ELS\u0150 B\u00c9CSI D\u00d6NT\u00c9S SZ\u00d6VEGE |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.arcanum.hu |publisher=Arcanum Adatb\u00e1zis Kft. |language=hu}}</ref>). Between 5 and 10 November, Hungarian armed forces occupied the newly transferred territories.<ref name=\"Thomas, pg. 11\"/>\n\n===Occupation of Carpatho-Ukraine===\nIn March 1939, the Czecho-Slovak Republic was dissolved, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded it]], and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was established. On 14 March, [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovakia]] declared itself to be an independent state. On 15 March, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] declared itself to be an independent state. Hungary rejected the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine and, between 14 and 18 March, Hungarian armed forces occupied the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia and ousted the government of [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]. By contrast, Hungary recognized the German [[puppet state]] of Slovakia led by the [[Clerical fascism|Clerical Fascist]] [[Jozef Tiso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3430.htm|title=Slovakia|work=U.S. Department of State|df=}}</ref> But on 23 March 1939, Hungarian attacks Slovakia on the east claiming a border dispute, led to a localized armed conflict between the two countries. The [[Slovak\u2013Hungarian War]], also known as the \"Little War\", ended with Hungary gaining the easternmost strip of Slovakia, 1697&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\n===Second Vienna Award===\nIn September 1940, with troops massing on both sides of the Hungarian-Romanian border, war was averted by the [[Second Vienna Award]]. This award transferred to Hungary the northern half of [[Transylvania]], with a total area of 43,492&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a total population of 2,578,100 divided more or less evenly between Hungarians and Romanians (depending on the census, cf. [[Second Vienna Award#Statistics|Second Vienna Award]]). By dividing Transylvania between Romania and Hungary, Hitler was able to ease tensions in both countries.\n\n===Occupation and annexation of Yugoslav territories===\n{{main article|Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories}}\nAfter [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invading Yugoslavia]] on 11 April 1941, Hungary annexed sections of [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]], [[Ba\u010dka]], [[Me\u0111imurje]], and [[Prekmurje]].<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html Hungary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203003152/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html |date=3 February 2007 }} \u2013 Shoah Foundation Institute Visual History Archive</ref> The returned territories \u2013 11417&nbsp;km\u00b2 \u2013 had a population of 1,025,508 which comprised 36.6 % Hungarians, 19 % Germans, 16% Serbs and 28.4% others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Lexikonok-magyarorszag-a-masodik-vilaghaboruban-lexikon-a-zs-F062E/d-F088D/delvidek-visszacsatolasa-F08AB/ |title=D\u00e9lvid\u00e9k visszacsatol\u00e1sa |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.arcanum.hu |publisher=Arcanum Adatb\u00e1zis Kft. |language=hu }}</ref>\n\n==Administration of Greater Hungary==\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary (1941\u201344)}}\n[[File:Kingdom of Hungary 1944 44 Varmegye.png|right|thumb|320px|Kingdom of Hungary 1941\u201344]]\nFollowing the two Vienna awards, a number of counties that had been lost in whole or part by the [[Trianon peace treaty|Treaty of Trianon]] were restored to Hungary.

This was prepared and billed in the Hungarian Parliament, but in the end, after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] it never passed through.<ref>G\u00e9za Vasas \u2013 A ruszin auton\u00f3mia v\u00e1lasz\u00fatjain (1939. m\u00e1rcius-szeptember) \u2013 On  the crossroads of Ruthenian autonomy (March\u2013September 1939), [http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/40971/1/aetas_2000_004_064-088.pdf]</ref> However, in the corresponding territory the Governorate of Subcarpathia was formed which was divided into three, the ''administrative branch offices'' of Ung ({{lang-hu|Ungi k\u00f6zigazgat\u00e1si kirendelts\u00e9g}}), Bereg ({{lang-hu|Beregi k\u00f6zigazgat\u00e1si kirendelts\u00e9g}}) and M\u00e1ramaros ({{lang-hu|M\u00e1ramarosi k\u00f6zigazgat\u00e1si kirendelts\u00e9g}}), having [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Rusyn language]] as official languages.\n\n==Military campaigns==\n===Invasion of Yugoslavia===\n{{Main article|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nOn 20 November 1940, under pressure from Germany, Hungarian prime Minister [[P\u00e1l Teleki]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. In December 1940, Teleki also signed an ephemeral \"[[Treaty of Eternal Friendship (1940)|Treaty of Eternal Friendship]]\" with the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. At that time, Yugoslavia was under a [[Regent]], [[Pavle Karadjordjevic|Prince Paul]] who was also under German pressure.\n\nOn 25 March 1941, Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact on behalf of Yugoslavia. Two days later, a Yugoslavian ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' removed Prince Paul, replaced him with pro-[[United Kingdom|British]] [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]], and threatened the success of the planned [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]].\n\nHitler asked the Hungarians to support his invasion of Yugoslavia. He promised to return some territory to Hungary in exchange for military cooperation. On 3 April 1941, unable to prevent Hungary's participation in the war alongside Germany, Teleki committed suicide. The right-wing radical [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e1rdossy]] succeeded him as Prime Minister.\n\nThree days after Teleki's death, the [[Luftwaffe]] [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|bombed Belgrade]] without warning. The German Army invaded Yugoslavia and quickly crushed Yugoslavian armed resistance. Horthy dispatched the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]] to [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|occupy Vojvodina]].\n\n===Invasion of the Soviet Union===\n[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank used during the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.]]\nHungary did not immediately participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. The invasion began on 22 June 1941, but Hitler did not directly ask for Hungarian assistance. Nonetheless, many Hungarian officials argued for participation in the war in order to encourage Hitler not to favour Romania in the event of border revisions in Transylvania. On 26 June 1941, the Soviet air force [[Bombing of Kassa|bombed Ko\u0161ice]] (Kassa).

Attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]], the Karpat Group advanced far into Soviet Ukraine, and, later, southern Russia. At the [[Battle of Uman]], fought between 3 and 8 August, the Karpat Group's mechanized corps acted as one half of a pincer that encircled the [[6th Army (Soviet Union)|6th Soviet Army]] and the 12th Soviet Army. Twenty Soviet divisions were captured or destroyed in this action.\n\nIn July 1941, the Hungarian government transferred responsibility for 18,000 Jews from Carpato-Ruthenian Hungary to the German armed forces. These Jews, without Hungarian citizenship, were sent to a location near [[Kamenets-Podolski]], where in one of the first acts of mass killing of Jews during World War II, all but [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre|two thousand of these individuals were shot]] by [[Einsatzgruppe|Nazi mobile killing units]].<ref name=\"HDKE\">[http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070101&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=b39689db307eea957accaa1d04e4c330The Holocaust in Hungary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609154602/http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070101&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=b39689db307eea957accaa1d04e4c330The |date=9 June 2011 }} Holocaust Memorial Centre.</ref><ref name=holocaust>{{cite web|title=Hungary Before the German Occupation|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005457|accessdate=22 September 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65s7Q60Wf?url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005457|archivedate=2 March 2012}}</ref> B\u00e1rdossy then passed the \"Third Jewish Law\" in August 1941, prohibiting marriage and sexual intercourse of Hungarians with Jews.\n\nSix months after the mass murder at Kamianets-Podilskyi in January 1942, Hungarian troops [[Novi Sad raid|massacred]] 3,000 Serbian and Jewish hostages near [[Novi Sad]], Yugoslavia.\n\nWorried about Hungary's increasing reliance on Germany, Admiral Horthy forced B\u00e1rdossy to resign and replaced him with [[Mikl\u00f3s K\u00e1llay]], a veteran conservative of Bethlen's government. K\u00e1llay continued B\u00e1rdossy's policy of supporting Germany against the Red Army while also initiating negotiations with the Western Allies. Hungarian participation in Operation Barbarossa during 1941 was limited in part because the country had no real large army before 1939, and time to train and equip troops had been short. But by 1942, tens of thousands of Hungarians were fighting on the eastern front in the [[Royal Hungarian Army]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8283A-12A, Budapest, marschierende Pfeilkreuzler und Panzer VI.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hungarian Arrow Cross army/militia and a German [[Tiger II]] tank in Budapest, October 1944.]]\nDuring the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]] suffered terrible losses. The Soviet breakthrough at the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] sliced directly through the Hungarian units. Shortly after the fall of Stalingrad in January 1943, the Hungarian 2nd Army was crushed by the Soviets at the [[Battle of Voronezh (1943)|Battle of Voronezh]]. Ignoring German orders to stand and fight to the death, the bewildered Hungarian troops, fighting without antitank weaponry or armored support, turned and fled. Harassed by partisan groups and Soviet air attacks, and having to endure the Russian winter weather, they tried in vain to retreat. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner by the Soviet army, and total casualties numbered more than 100,000 men. The [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian army]] ceased to exist as an effective fighting force, and the Germans pulled them from the front.\n\nWhile K\u00e1llay was Prime Minister, the Jews endured increased economic and [[political repression]], although many, particularly those in Budapest, were temporarily protected from the [[final solution]]. For most of the war, the Hungarian Jews lived an uneasy existence. They were deprived of most freedoms, but were not subjected to physical harm, and Horthy tried to contain anti-Semitic groups like the Arrow Cross. Secret negotiations with the British and Americans continued. As per the request of the Western Allies, there were no connections made with the Soviets.\n\n===German occupation of Hungary===\n[[File:Hungary, Budapest Fortepan 72907.jpg|thumb|Propaganda posters in Budapest, 1944]]\nAware of K\u00e1llay's deceit and fearing that Hungary might conclude a separate peace, in March 1944, Hitler launched [[Operation Margarethe]] and ordered Nazi troops to occupy Hungary. Horthy was confined to a castle, in essence, placed under [[house arrest]]. [[D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay]], an avid supporter of the National Socialists, became the new Prime Minister.  Szt\u00f3jay governed with the aid of a National Socialist military governor, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]]. The Hungarian populace was not happy with their nation being reduced in effect to a German protectorate, but Berlin threatened to occupy Hungary with [[Slovak Republic (1939\u201345)|Slovak]], [[NDH|Croat]], and Romanian troops if they did not comply. The thought of these ancestral enemies on Hungarian soil was seen as far worse than German control. Ironically, Hungary still kept whole divisions on the border with Romania even as the troops of both nations were fighting and dying together in the Russian winter.\n\nAs the Soviets pushed westward, Sztojay's government proceeded to muster new armies. The Hungarian troops again suffered terrible losses, but now had a motive to protect their homeland from Soviet occupation.\n\nIn August 1944, Horthy replaced Szt\u00f3jay with the anti-Fascist General [[G\u00e9za Lakatos]]. Under the Lakatos regime, acting Interior Minister [[B\u00e9la Horv\u00e1th]] ordered Hungarian [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] to prevent any Hungarian citizens from being deported. The Germans were unhappy with the situation, but could not do a great deal about it. Horthy's actions thus bought the Jews of Budapest a few months of time.\n\n===Soviet occupation of Hungary===\n[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|right|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in 1944.]]\n{{details|Siege of Budapest}}\nIn September 1944, Soviet forces crossed the Hungarian border. On 15 October, Horthy announced that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. The Hungarian army ignored the armistice, fighting desperately to keep the Soviets out. The Germans launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and, by kidnapping his son [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy Jr.]], forced Horthy to abrogate the armistice, depose the Lakatos government, and name the leader of the [[Arrow Cross Party]], [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], as Prime Minister.  Horthy resigned and Sz\u00e1lasi became Prime Minister of a new \"[[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]]\" (''Nemzeti \u00d6sszefog\u00e1s Korm\u00e1nya'') controlled by the Germans. Horthy himself was taken to Germany as a prisoner. He ultimately survived the war and spent his last years exiled in Portugal, dying in 1957.\n\nIn cooperation with the Nazis, Sz\u00e1lasi attempted to resume deportations of Jews, but Germany's fast-disintegrating communications largely prevented this from happening. Nonetheless, the Arrow Cross launched a reign of terror against the Jews of Budapest. Thousands were tortured, raped and murdered in the last months of the war, and their property looted or destroyed. Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] saved thousands of Budapest Jews using Swedish protective passports. He was ultimately taken prisoner by the Soviets and died some years later in a labor camp. Other foreign diplomats like [[Nuncio]] [[Angelo Rotta]], [[Giorgio Perlasca]], [[Carl Lutz]], [[Friedrich Born]], [[Harald Feller]], [[Angel Sanz Briz]] and [[George Mandel-Mantello]] also organized false papers and safe houses for Jews in Budapest. Of the approximately 800,000 Jews residing within Hungary's expanded borders of 1941, only 200,000 (about 25%) survived [[the Holocaust]].<ref>[http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070102&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=41e4d6b481e6ac01d487afa1b38b615c Victims of Holocaust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311005711/http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070102&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=41e4d6b481e6ac01d487afa1b38b615c |date=11 March 2008 }} \u2013 Holocaust Memorial Centre. </ref> An estimated 28,000 Hungarian Roma were also killed as part of the [[Porajmos]].\n\nSoon Hungary itself became a battlefield. Sz\u00e1lasi promised [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|a Greater Hungary]] and prosperity for the peasants, but in reality Hungary was crumbling and its armies were slowly being destroyed. As an integral part of German General [[Maximilian Fretter-Pico]]'s ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'', the re-formed [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]] enjoyed a modest level of combat success.  From 6 to 29 October 1944, during the [[Battle of Debrecen]], ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'' managed to achieve a major win on the battlefield. Avoiding encirclement itself, ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'' encircled and severely mauled three Soviet tank corps serving under the Mobile Group of [[Issa Pliyev]]. Earlier in the same battle, Mobile Group Pliyev had sliced through the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]]. But success was costly and, unable to replace lost armor and heavy artillery munitions, the Hungarian Second Army was defeated on 1 December 1944.  The remnants of the Second Army were incorporated into the Third Army.\n\n[[File:Azertis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"Despite it all..!\", a propaganda poster of the banned fascist Arrow Cross party which took power when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary in 1944.]]\nIn October 1944, the [[First Army (Hungary)|Hungarian First Army]] was attached to the German [[1st Panzer Army]], participating defensively against the Red Army's advance towards [[Budapest]]. On 28 December 1944, a provisional government was formed in Hungary under acting Prime Minister [[B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s]]. Mikl\u00f3s and Sz\u00e1lasi each claimed to be the legitimate Head of government. The Germans and pro-German Hungarians loyal to Sz\u00e1lasi fought on.\n\nThe Soviets and Romanians completed the encirclement of Budapest on 29 December 1944. The battle for the city turned into the [[Siege of Budapest]]. During the fight, most of what remained of the Hungarian First Army was destroyed about {{convert|200|km}} north of Budapest in a running battle from 1 January to 16 February 1945. On 20 January 1945, representatives of the Mikl\u00f3s provisional government signed an armistice in Moscow. In January 1945, 32,000 ethnic Germans from within Hungary were arrested and transported to the Soviet Union as forced laborers. In some villages, the entire adult population were taken to labor camps in the [[Donets Basin]].<ref name=Wasserstein>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/refugees_01.shtml#two |title=European Refugee Movements After World War Two |last=Wasserstein |first=Bernard |date=17 February 2011 |website=[[BBC]]history |accessdate=5 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719052812/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/refugees_01.shtml#two |archivedate=19 July 2013 }}\n</ref><ref name=\"Ther\">{{cite book|first=Philipp|last=Ther|title=Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene: Gesellschaft und Vertriebenenpolitik in SBZ/ddr und in Polen 1945\u20131956|year=1998|isbn=3-525-35790-7}}</ref>{{rp|21}} Many died there as a result of hardships and ill-treatment.

Although the German forces in Hungary were generally defeated, the Germans had one more surprise for the Soviets. On 6 March 1945, the Germans launched the [[Operation Fr\u00fchlingserwachen|Lake Balaton Offensive]], attempting to hold on to the Axis' last source of oil. It was their final operation of the war and it quickly failed. By 19 March 1945, Soviet troops had recaptured all the territory lost during the 13-day German offensive.<ref name=\"dollinger\">''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan'', Hans Dollinger, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 67-27047</ref>{{rp|182}}\n\nAfter the failed offensive, the Germans in Hungary were eliminated. Most of what remained of the Hungarian Third Army was destroyed about {{convert|50|km}} west of Budapest between 16 and 25 March 1945. From 26 March and 15 April, the Soviets and Bulgarians launched the [[Nagykanizsa\u2013K\u00f6rmend Offensive]] and more Hungarian remnants were destroyed as part of [[Army Group South]] fighting alongside the [[2nd Panzer Army]]. By the start of April, the Germans, with the Arrow Cross in tow, had completely vacated Hungarian soil.\n\n===Retreat into Germany===\n[[File:Hungarian soldies in Denmark 2.

They demanded a \"new struggle of liberation\" against the German occupation forces and their collaborators and called for the creation of a new democratic Hungary after the war. The representatives of the Hungarian Front, being informed by Horthy of plans for an armistice on 11 October, founded the [[Committee of Liberation of the Hungarian National Uprising]] on 11 November 1944.
