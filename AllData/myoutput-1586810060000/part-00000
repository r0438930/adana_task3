The flag was first used as an ensign for Russian merchant ships and became official as the flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1696. It remained in use until 1858, when the first official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] was decreed by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], which was a tricolor consisting of three horizontal fields: [[black]] on the top, [[yellow]] in the middle, and [[white]] on the bottom. A decree in 1896 made the original white, blue, and red tricolor the official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] until its eventual capitulation in 1917. Following the creation of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], the Russian tricolor was abolished, and its usage was preserved by the [[White Movement]] and the [[Russian state]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nDuring the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence, the Russian SFSR (a constituent republic of the USSR), used a defaced variant of the State [[Flag of the Soviet Union]] with a vertical blue bar at the hoist, with a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and a golden bordered [[red star]] on top. Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on November 1st, 1991, the Russian SFSR adopted a new flag design that looked almost identical to the pre-revolutionary tricolour that was previously abolished in 1917. The ratio of the new flag was 1:2, and the flag colors consisted of [[white]] on the top, [[azure (color)|azure]] in the middle, and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] on the bottom. The Russian SFSR officially renamed itself as the \"Russian Federation\" after the dissolution of the USSR, and the flag design remained the same until 1993, when the original Russian tricolour was fully restored as the current flag after the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]].\n\n== Origin ==\nTwo accounts of the flag's origin connect it to the [[Tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] used by the [[Dutch Republic]] (the [[flag of the Netherlands]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt450XgGd1kC|title=The Flags of the World: Their History, Blazonry and Associations|last=Hulme|first=Frederick Edward|date=1 January 1897|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465543110|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWdOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA228|title=Foreign Correspondent: A Memoir|last=Greenway|first=H.

The choice of colors is significant in that they represent in order of priority, white for God, Blue for king, and Red for people and/or country. These colors of the flag of Russia inspired the choice of the \"[[Pan-Slavic colours]]\" by the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848]]. Two other Slavic countries, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official ''National flag'' before the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896.\n\nThe flag continued to be used by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] was toppled in the [[February Revolution]] and was not replaced until the [[October Revolution]] which established the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].\n\n===Flags of the Russian SFSR===\n{{See also|Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic}}\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1918\u20131937).svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (17 June 1918 \u2013 21 January 1937)]]\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian SFSR (1954\u201391)]]\n\nOn 8 April 1918, the flag of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] was discussed at a meeting of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic''. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the color, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.\n\nOn 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR]] by the graphic artist [[Sergey Chekhonin]]. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription ''RSFSR'' in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.\n\nOn 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] to form the [[Soviet Union]]. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with a blue stripe along the mast.\n\nContrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).<ref>\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420.&nbsp;\u2014 1925, \u2116&nbsp;20, \u0446\u0438\u0442. \u043f\u043e: \u0412\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420, \u0422.1/\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0412. \u0410.&nbsp;\u2014 \u041c.: \u041c\u0413\u0418\u0423, 2002, {{ISBN|5-276-00240-1}}, \u0421\u0421.487\u2013488</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the white-blue-red tricolor has been used by the collaborationist [[Anti-communism|anti-Stalinist]] troops of [[Andrey Vlasov]], who was allied with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Lilia Shevtsova: ''Putin's Russia.''

It was never made the official state flag.\n\nWhen the [[Bolshevik]]s took power in 1917, the tricolor design was discarded, and a definitive new flag of the SFSR (one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]]) was introduced in 1954 (see [[flag of Russian SFSR]]), and this remained the republic's flag until the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. All of the Soviet Republics' flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the \"RSFSR\" abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].\n\nThe tricolor was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the [[White movement]]. It was continued to be used by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolor was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. It, as well as the naval ensign of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] was used by anticommunist Russian troops under German command during the [[Second World War]]. Both flags can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, this flag was used in films set in the prerevolutionary period and was seen as an historical flag, especially after the 1940s.\n\nIt, rather than the black-yellow-white color combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe [[President of Russia]] uses a Presidential Standard ({{lang-ru|\u0428\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430}}), which, since 1994, is officially defined as the square tricolor with the coat of arms (in this case the two-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.<ref>per [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/5502 Decree No. 319 of 15 February 1994]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Victory Day (9 May)|annual Victory Day]] celebrations in Moscow, a variant of the Soviet flag that was used during the [[raising a flag over the Reichstag]] has the grey hammer and sickle, referred to as the [[Victory Banner]].

The flag was first used as an ensign for Russian merchant ships and became official as the flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1696. It remained in use until 1858, when the first official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] was decreed by [[ Alexander II]], which was a tricolor consisting of three horizontal fields: [[black]] on the top, [[yellow]] in the middle, and [[white]] on the bottom. A decree in 1896 made the original white, blue, and red tricolor the official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] until its eventual capitulation in 1917. Following the creation of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], the Russian tricolor was abolished, and its usage was preserved by the [[White Movement]] and the [[Russian state]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nDuring the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence, the Russian SFSR (a constituent republic of the USSR), used a defaced variant of the State [[Flag of the Soviet Union]] with a vertical blue bar at the hoist, with a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and a golden bordered [[red star]] on top. Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on November 1st, 1991, the Russian SFSR adopted a new flag design that looked almost identical to the pre-revolutionary tricolour that was previously abolished in 1917. The ratio of the new flag was 1:2, and the flag colors consisted of [[white]] on the top, [[azure (color)|azure]] in the middle, and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] on the bottom. The Russian SFSR officially renamed itself as the \"Russian Federation\" after the dissolution of the USSR, and the flag design remained the same until 1993, when the original Russian tricolour was fully restored as the current flag after the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]].\n\n== Origin ==\nTwo accounts of the flag's origin connect it to the [[Tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] used by the [[Dutch Republic]] (the [[flag of the Netherlands]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt450XgGd1kC|title=The Flags of the World: Their History, Blazonry and Associations|last=Hulme|first=Frederick Edward|date=1 January 1897|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465543110|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWdOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA228|title=Foreign Correspondent: A Memoir|last=Greenway|first=H.

The official response merely indicated that, as such issue is as yet unprecedented, even though the land forces do use (apparently different) flags, the tsar ordered that his (Butler's) opinion be sought about the matter, asking specifically as to the custom existing in his country.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=scHXHTkRmZcC&pg=PA21&dq=european+flag&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=hek3U5mTDcu7ygOF54D4Dg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dutch&f=false Flag T.H.

The choice of colors is significant in that they represent in order of priority, white for God, Blue for king, and Red for people and/or country. These colors of the flag of Russia inspired the choice of the \"[[Pan-Slavic colours]]\" by the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848]]. Two other Slavic countries, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official ''National flag'' before the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896.\n\nThe flag continued to be used by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] was toppled in the [[February Revolution]] and was not replaced until the [[October Revolution]] which established the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].\n\n===Flags of the Russian SFSR===\n{{See also|Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic}}\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1918\u20131937).svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (17 June 1918 \u2013 21 January 1937)]]\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian SFSR (1954\u201391)]]\n\nOn 8 April 1918, the flag of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] was discussed at a meeting of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic''. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the color, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.\n\nOn 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR]] by the graphic artist [[Sergey Chekhonin]]. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription ''RSFSR'' in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.\n\nOn 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] to form the [[Soviet Union]]. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with a blue stripe along the mast.\n\nContrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).<ref>\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420.&nbsp;\u2014 1925, \u2116&nbsp;20, \u0446\u0438\u0442. \u043f\u043e: \u0412\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420, \u0422.1/\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0412. \u0410.&nbsp;\u2014 \u041c.: \u041c\u0413\u0418\u0423, 2002, {{ISBN|5-276-00240-1}}, \u0421\u0421.487\u2013488</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the white-blue-red tricolor has been used by the collaborationist [[Anti-communism|anti-Stalinist]] troops of [[Andrey Vlasov]], who was allied with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Lilia Shevtsova: ''Putin's Russia.''

It was never made the official state flag.\n\nWhen the [[Bolshevik]]s took power in 1917, the tricolor design was discarded, and a definitive new flag of the SFSR (one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]]) was introduced in 1954 (see [[flag of Russian SFSR]]), and this remained the republic's flag until the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. All of the Soviet Republics' flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the \"RSFSR\" abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].\n\nThe tricolor was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the [[White movement]]. It was continued to be used by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolor was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. It, as well as the naval ensign of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] was used by anticommunist Russian troops under German command during the [[Second World War]]. Both flags can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, this flag was used in films set in the prerevolutionary period and was seen as an historical flag, especially after the 1940s.\n\nIt, rather than the black-yellow-white color combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe [[President of Russia]] uses a Presidential Standard ({{lang-ru|\u0428\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430}}), which, since 1994, is officially defined as the square tricolor with the coat of arms (in this case the two-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.<ref>per [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/5502 Decree No. 319 of 15 February 1994]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Victory Day (9 May)|annual Victory Day]] celebrations in Moscow, a variant of the Soviet flag that was used during the [[raising a flag over the Reichstag]] has the grey hammer and sickle, referred to as the [[Victory Banner]].
