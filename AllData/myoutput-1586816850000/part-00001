With a budget of over $27 billion, USAID is one of the [[List of development aid country donors|largest official aid agencies]] in the world, and accounts for more than half of all U.S. foreign assistance\u2014the highest in the world in absolute dollar terms.\n\nCongress passed the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] on September 4, 1961, which reorganized U.S. foreign assistance programs and mandated the creation of an agency to administer economic aid. USAID was subsequently established by the [[executive order]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], who sought to unite several existing foreign assistance organizations and programs under one agency.<ref>{{cite web|title=USAID HISTORY|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/usaid-history|website=usaid.gov|publisher=USAID|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> USAID became the first U.S. foreign assistance organization whose primary focus was long-term socioeconomic development.\n\nUSAID's programs are authorized by Congress in the [[Foreign Assistance Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/400/fsa.pdf |title=USAID: Automated Directives System 400 |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> which Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation. As an official component of U.S. foreign policy, USAID operates subject to the guidance of the [[President of the United States|President]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].<ref name=\"USAID\">{{cite web|last=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 101.2 Agency Programs and Functions|url=http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/100/101.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> USAID has missions in over 100 countries, primarily in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Eastern Europe]].\n\n==Goals==\nUSAID's mission statement, adopted in February 2018, is:<blockquote>\"On behalf of the American people, we promote and demonstrate democratic values abroad, and advance a free, peaceful, and prosperous world. \n\nIn support of America's foreign policy, the U.S. Agency for International Development leads the U.S. Government's international development and disaster assistance through partnerships and investments that save lives, reduce poverty, strengthen democratic governance, and help people emerge from humanitarian crises and progress beyond assistance.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/mission-vision-values|title=Mission, Vision and Values {{!}} U.S. Agency for International Development|date=2018-02-16|website=usaid.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref><ref>[https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/JSP_FY_2018_-_2022_FINAL.pdf USAID-State Joint Strategic Plan 2018-2020] (PDF).

The best official statement relevant to the most recent era is contained in USAID's 2004 \"White Paper,\" which was reaffirmed in high-level USAID policy documents in 2006 and 2011.  (See the references authored by USAID, at the end of this article.)\n\nTo give a perspective of USAID's goals that is as general as possible, the list of goals in this article subsumes one of the goals from the 2004 White Paper, \"Strengthen fragile states,\" whose emphasis as understood at the time was on Iraq and Afghanistan, into a more general goal, \"U.S. national interests,\" together with one of the White Paper's other goals, \"Support strategic states.\"  State fragility is understood to be one of the development issues addressed under this article's \"Socioeconomic development\" goal.\n\nOn the other hand, the White Paper's goal, \"Provide humanitarian relief,\" is divided in this article into two goals, both of which are humanitarian: \"Disaster relief\" (which may assist victims at various income levels) and \"Poverty relief\" (which targets proverty that is chronic, not just the result of a disaster, and which does not necessarily have to be justified by developmental impact).</ref>\n\n* Disaster relief\n* Poverty relief\n* Technical cooperation on [[global issue]]s, including the environment\n* U.S. bilateral interests\n* Socioeconomic development\n\n===Disaster relief===\n[[File:USAID.jpg|thumb|right|USAID Packages are delivered by [[United States Coast Guard]] personnel]]\n\nSome of the U.S. Government's earliest foreign aid programs provided relief in crises created by war. In 1915, USG assistance through the Commission for Relief of Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover prevented starvation in Belgium after the German invasion.  After 1945, the European Recovery Program championed by Secretary of State George Marshall (the \"[[Marshall Plan]]\") helped rebuild war-torn Western Europe.\n\nUSAID manages relief efforts after wars and natural disasters through its Office of U.S Foreign Disaster Assistance in Washington D.C. Privately funded U.S. NGOs and the U.S. military also play major roles in disaster relief overseas.\n\n===Poverty relief===\n[[File:Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development (7269588282).jpg|thumb|right|Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development, USAID [[Nigeria]]]]\nAfter 1945, many newly independent countries needed assistance to relieve the chronic deprivation afflicting their low-income populations.  USAID and its predecessor agencies have continuously provided poverty relief in many forms, including assistance to public health and education services targeted at the poorest.  USAID has also helped manage food aid provided by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].  In addition, USAID provides funding to NGOs to supplement private donations in relieving chronic poverty.\n\n===Global issues===\nTechnical cooperation between nations is essential for addressing a range of cross-border concerns like communicable diseases, environmental issues, trade and investment cooperation, safety standards for traded products, money laundering, and so forth.  The USG has specialized agencies dealing with such areas, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency.  USAID's special ability to administer programs in low-income countries supports these and other USG agencies' international work on global concerns.\n\n====Environment====\n\nAmong these global interests, environmental issues attract high attention.  USAID assists projects that conserve and protect threatened land, water, forests, and wildlife.  USAID also assists projects to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to build resilience to the risks associated with global [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Global Climate Change: Capacity Building | publisher = [[USAID]] | url = http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | accessdate = 2014-08-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120113701/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | archivedate = 2012-01-20 }}</ref>  U.S. environmental regulation laws require that programs sponsored by USAID should be both economically and environmentally [[sustainable]].\n\n===U.S. national interests===\nTo support U.S. geopolitical interests, Congress appropriates exceptional financial assistance to allies, largely in the form of \"Economic Support Funds\" (ESF).  USAID is called on to administer the bulk (90%) of ESF<ref>Tarnoff (2015), p. 13.</ref> and is instructed \"To the maximum extent feasible, [to] provide [ESF] assistance ... consistent with the policy directions, purposes, and programs of [development assistance].\"<ref>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended), Section 531.</ref>\n\nAlso, when U.S. troops are in the field, USAID can supplement the \"[[Civil Affairs]]\" programs that the U.S. military conducts to win the friendship of local populations.  In these circumstances, USAID may be directed by specially appointed diplomatic officials of the State Department, as has been done in Afghanistan and Pakistan during operations against al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stabilization: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan |url=https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/stabilization/index.html |publisher=SIGAR |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nU.S. commercial interests are served by U.S. law's requirement that most goods and services financed by USAID must be sourced from U.S. vendors.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 310: Source and Nationality Requirements for Procurement of Commodities and Services Financed by USAID |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/310.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic development===\nTo help low-income nations achieve self-sustaining socioeconomic development, USAID assists them in improving management of their own resources.  USAID's assistance for socioeconomic development mainly provides technical advice, training, scholarships, commodities, and financial assistance.  Through grants and contracts, USAID mobilizes the technical resources of the private sector, other USG agencies, universities, and NGOs to participate in this assistance.\n\nPrograms of the various types above frequently reinforce one another.  For example, the Foreign Assistance Act requires USAID to use funds appropriated for geopolitical purposes (\"Economic Support Funds\") to support socioeconomic development to the maximum extent possible.\n\n==Modes of assistance==\nUSAID delivers both technical assistance and financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/primer.html |title=USAID Primer: What We Do and How We Do It |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>\n\n===Technical assistance===\nTechnical assistance includes technical advice, training, scholarships, construction, and commodities.  Technical assistance is contracted or procured by USAID and provided in-kind to recipients.  For technical advisory services, USAID draws on experts from the private sector, mainly from the assisted country's own pool of expertise, as well as from specialized USG agencies.  Many host-government leaders have drawn on USAID's technical assistance for development of IT systems and computer hardware procurement to strengthen their institutions.\n\nTo build indigenous expertise and leadership, USAID finances scholarships to U.S. universities and assists the strengthening of developing countries' own universities.  Local universities' programs in developmentally important sectors are assisted directly and through USAID support for forming partnerships with U.S. universities.\n\nThe various forms of technical assistance are frequently coordinated as capacity building packages for development of local institutions.\n\n===Financial assistance===\n[[File:National Open Source Software Competition - USAID.jpg|thumb|National Open Source Software Competition \u2013 USAID financial assistance for groups developing technology in Indonesia]]\n\nFinancial assistance supplies cash to developing country organizations to supplement their budgets.  USAID also provides financial assistance to local and international [[NGOs]] who in turn give technical assistance in developing countries.  Although USAID formerly provided loans, all financial assistance is now provided in the form of nonreimbursable grants.\n\nIn recent years, the USG has increased its emphasis on financial rather than technical assistance.  In 2004, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration created the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] as a new foreign aid agency that is mainly restricted to providing financial assistance. In 2009, the Obama Administration initiated a major realignment of USAID's own programs to emphasize financial assistance, referring to it as \"government-to-government\" or \"G2G\" assistance.\n\n==Organization==\n\nUSAID is organized around country development programs managed by resident USAID offices in developing countries (\"USAID missions\"), supported by USAID's global headquarters in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |title=USAID: Organization |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423111526/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |archive-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Country development programs===\nUSAID plans its work in each country around an individual country development program managed by a resident office called a \"mission.\"  The USAID mission and its U.S. staff are guests in the country, with a status that is usually defined by a \"framework bilateral agreement\" between the USG and the host government.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 349|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/349.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 349.3.1.1|date=2003}}</ref> Framework bilaterals give the mission and its U.S. staff privileges similar to (but not necessarily the same as) those accorded to the U.S. embassy and diplomats by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 155|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/155.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 155.3.1.1.c|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nUSAID missions work in over fifty countries, consulting with their governments and non-governmental organizations to identify programs that will receive USAID's assistance. As part of this process, USAID missions conduct socioeconomic analysis, discuss projects with host-country leaders, design assistance to those projects, award contracts and grants, administer assistance (including evaluation and reporting), and manage flows of funds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tarnoff|first1=Curt|title=U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID): Background, Operations, and Issues|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44117.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=July 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs countries develop and need less assistance, USAID shrinks and ultimately closes its resident missions.  USAID has closed missions in a number of countries that had achieved a substantial level of prosperity, including South Korea,<ref>{{cite web |title=South Korea: From Aid Recipient to Donor |url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/korea/115197/kimnamhee/Korea%20case%20study%2020110615%20_corrected%2020111027%20TU_%20-%2050th.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> Turkey,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission Directory |url=https://www.usaid.gov/mission-directory |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> and Costa Rica.<ref>{{cite web |title=Costa Rica-United States Relations |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica%E2%80%93United_States_relations |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=December 2019}}\n\nUSAID also closes missions when requested by host countries for political reasons.

Its mission in [[Moscow]] had been in operation for two decades.<ref>{{cite news |title=USAID mission in Russia to close following Moscow decision |first=Arshad |last=Mohammed |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/18/us-usa-russia-aid-idUSBRE88H11E20120918 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref>  On May 1, 2013, the President of [[Bolivia]], [[Evo Morales]], asked USAID to close its mission, which had worked in the country for 49 years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bolivia's President Morales expels USAID, accused it of working against him |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/bolivias-president-morales-expels-usaid-accused-it-of-working-against-him/2013/05/01/00e1ce28-b263-11e2-9fb1-62de9581c946_story.html |agency=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 1, 2013}}</ref>  The closure was completed on September 20, 2013.\n\nUSAID missions are led by Mission Directors and are staffed both by USAID [[Foreign Service Officers]] and by development professionals from the country itself, with the host-country professionals forming the majority of the staff.  The length of a Foreign Service Officer's \"tour\" in most countries is four years, to provide enough time to develop in-depth knowledge about the country.  (Shorter tours of one or two years are usual in countries of exceptional hardship or danger.)<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 436: Foreign Service Assignments and Tours of Duty |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1877/436.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Mission Director is a member of the U.S. Embassy's \"Country Team\" under the direction of the U.S. Ambassador.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dorman |first1=Shawn |title=Foreign Service Work and Life: Embassy, Employee, Family |url=http://afsa.org/sites/default/files/iuse_country_team_local_staff_role.pdf |publisher=American Foreign Service Association |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>  As a USAID mission works in an unclassified environment with relative frequent public interaction, most missions were initially located in independent offices in the business districts of capital cities.

However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>  The technical offices that are frequently found in USAID missions include Health and Family Planning, Education, Environment, Democracy, and Economic Growth.\n\n====Health and Family Planning====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by missions' Health and Family Planning offices are projects for eradication of communicable diseases, strengthening of public health systems focusing on maternal-child health including family planning services, [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-AIDS]] monitoring, delivery of medical supplies including contraceptives and [[HIV]] vaccines, and coordination of Demographic and Health Surveys. This assistance is primarily targeted to the poor majority of the population and corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as strengthening the basis for socioeconomic development.\n\n====Education====\n\nUSAID's Education offices mainly assist the national school system, emphasizing broadening coverage of quality basic education to reach the entire population. Examples of projects often assisted by Education offices are projects for curriculum development, teacher training, and provision of improved textbooks and materials.  Larger programs have included school construction.  Education offices often manage scholarship programs for training in the U.S., while assistance to the country's universities and professional education institutions may be provided by Economic Growth and Health offices.  The Education office's emphasis on school access for the poor majority of the population corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as to the socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Environment====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by Environment offices are projects for tropical forest conservation, protection of indigenous people's lands, regulation of marine fishing industries, pollution control, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and helping communities adapt to climate change.  Environment assistance corresponds to USAID's objective of technical cooperation on global issues, as well as laying a sustainable basis for USAID's socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Democracy====\nExamples of projects assisted by Democracy offices are projects for the country's political institutions, including elections, political parties, legislatures, and human rights organizations.  Counterparts include the judicial sector and civil-society organizations that monitor government performance.  Democracy assistance received its greatest impetus at the time of the creation of the successor states to the USSR starting in about 1990, corresponding both to USAID's objective of supporting U.S. bilateral interests and to USAID's socioeconomic development objective.\n\n====Economic Growth====\n\nExamples of projects often assisted by Economic Growth offices are projects for improvements in agricultural techniques and marketing (the mission may have a specialized \"Agriculture\" office), development of microfinance industries, streamlining of Customs administrations (to accelerate growth of exporting industries), and modernization of government regulatory frameworks for industry in various sectors (telecommunications, agriculture, and so forth). [[File:USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms.jpg|thumb|USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms]] In USAID's early years and in some larger programs, Economic Growth offices have financed economic infrastructure like roads and electrical power plants.  Economic Growth assistance is thus quite diverse in terms of the range of sectors where it may work.  It corresponds to USAID's socioeconomic development objective and is the source of sustainable poverty reduction.  Economic Growth offices also occasionally manage assistance to poverty relief projects, such as to government programs that provide \"cash transfer\" payments to low-income families.\n\n====Special assistance offices====\n\nSome USAID missions have specialized technical offices for areas like counter-narcotics assistance or assistance in conflict zones.\n\nDisaster assistance on a large scale is provided through USAID's [[Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance|Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance]].  Rather than having a permanent presence in country missions, this office has supplies pre-positioned in strategic locations to respond quickly to disasters when and where they occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-us|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Office of the Mission Director and the Program Office===\nThe Mission Director's signature authorizes technical offices to provide assistance according to the designs and budgets they propose.  With the help of the Program Office, the Mission Director ensures that designs are consistent with USAID policy for the country, including budgetary earmarks by which Washington directs that funds be used for certain general purposes such as public health or environmental conservation.  The Program Office compiles combined reports to Washington to support budget requests to Congress and to verify that budgets were used as planned.\n\n===Contracting, financial management and management offices===\nWhile the Mission Director is the public face and key decision-maker for an impressive array of USAID technical capabilities, arguably the offices that make USAID preeminent among U.S. government agencies in the ability to follow through on assistance agreements in low-income countries are the \"support\" offices.\n\n====Contracting offices====\n\nCommitments of U.S. government funds to NGOs and firms that implement USAID's assistance programs can only be made in compliance with carefully designed contracts and grant agreements executed by warranted Contracting and Agreement Officers.  The Mission Director is authorized to commit financial assistance directly to the country's government agencies.\n\n====Financial management offices====\n\nFunds can be committed only when the Mission's Controller certifies their availability for the stated purpose.  \"FM\" offices assist technical offices in financial analysis and in developing detailed budgets for inputs needed by projects assisted.  They evaluate potential recipients' management abilities before financial assistance can be authorized and then review implementers' expenditure reports with great care.  This office often has the largest number of staff of any office in the mission.\n\n====Management offices====\n\nCalled the \"Executive Office\" in USAID (sometimes leading to confusion with the Embassy's Executive Office, which is the office of the Ambassador), \"EXO\" provides operational support for mission offices, including human resources, information systems management, transportation, property and procurement services. Increasing integration into Embassies' chancery complexes, and the State Department's recently increased role in providing support services to USAID, is expanding the importance of coordination between USAID's EXO and the Embassy's Management section.\n\n==Assistance projects==\nWhile the terms \"assistance project\" and \"development project\" might sometimes be used indiscriminately, it helps in understanding USAID's work to make a distinction.  (1) Development is what developing countries do.  Development projects are projects of local government agencies and NGOs, such as projects to improve public services or business regulations, etc.  (2) Assistance is what USAID does.  USAID's assistance projects support local development projects.\n\nThe key to a successful development project is the institutional capacity of local organizations, including the professional ability of their staff members.  The key to successful assistance is how well it fits the needs of local development projects, including institutional capacity building and supporting professional education and training for staff.\n\nWhen a local development project's assistance needs have been identified, USAID arranges the agreed assistance through funding agreements with implementing organizations, referred to by USAID staff as \"implementing partners.\"  USAID finances several types of implementers using a variety of funding agreements.\n\nTo illustrate, USAID might assist a development project with inputs provided through several different funding agreements:\n\n# A budget-support grant to a government agency.\n# A contract with a firm for support to the agency.\n# A grant to a local NGO serving the beneficiary group.\n# A grant to an international NGO to strengthen the operations of the local NGO.\n\nEach of these types of USAID funding agreements is profiled below.\n\n===Budget support to a government agency===\nThis funding agreement would take the form of a letter from USAID's Mission Director, countersigned by the recipient agency, explaining the agency's objectives, the amount of USAID's financial commitment, the specific expenditures to be financed by USAID's grant, and other operational aspects of the agreement.\n\nUSAID's technical office would assign a staff member (U.S. or local) to oversee progress in the agency's implementation.  USAID's financial management office would transfer funds to the agency, in tranches as needed.  Audit under this kind of government-to-government (G2G) financial assistance is usually performed by the host government's own audit agency.\n\n===Contract for technical assistance to a government agency===\nAs a government agency is usually specialized in services to the beneficiary population (medical services, for example), its staff may not be equipped to undertake planning and evaluation, construction, acquisition of equipment, or management of training and study tours.  The government agency might, therefore, request USAID's assistance in these areas, and USAID could respond by contracting with a firm to supply the services or technical assistance requested.\n\nUSAID's technical office would collaborate with the government agency in drafting the specifications for what is needed (generally referred to as a \"Statement of Work\" for the contract) and in conducting market research for available sources and potential bidders.  USAID's Contracting Officer would then advertise for bids, manage the selection of a contractor from among the competing bidders, sign the contract, and assign a technical-office staff member as the Contracting Officer's Representative to oversee the performance under the contract.  (If the workload permits, this staff member might be the same person who oversees USAID's financial assistance to the government agency.)\n\nThe contractor supplies technical assistance directly to the government agency, so that in monitoring contractor performance USAID relies substantially on the agency's evaluation of the contractor's work.\n\n===Grant to finance NGO services to a beneficiary group===\nNon-governmental organizations are, like their government counterparts, usually already engaged in service provision in areas where USAID wants to assist, and they often have unique abilities that complement public programs.  Therefore, USAID technical-office staff might set aside a budget and, with the help of the mission's contracting office, publish a solicitation for applications from NGOs for financial assistance to their programs.  One or several grants could be made to selected NGOs by the contracting office's \"Agreement Officer.\"  Similar to the case of a contract, a USAID technical-office staff member would be assigned as the Agreement Officer's Representative to monitor progress in the NGOs' implementation and to arrange for external evaluations.  USAID grants require recipient NGOs to contract for external audits.\n\nAs some local NGOs may be small and young organizations with no prior experience in receiving awards from USAID, the USAID mission's financial management office reviews grant applicants' administrative systems to ensure that they are capable of managing USG funds.  Where necessary, USAID can devote part of the grant to the NGO's internal strengthening to help the NGO qualify for USAID's financing and build the capacity of the organization in the process.  Following completion of the NGO's internal strengthening, USAID would disburse financing for the NGO's service project.\n\n===Grant to international NGOs for technical assistance===\nInternational NGOs have their own development projects and capabilities.  If USAID and its counterparts determine that development objectives can best be met by supporting an NGO project, and if local NGO capacity is not yet sufficient, the relevant USAID technical office will draft a program description and the contracting office will issue as a request for applications to solicit responses from the international NGO community.  USAID manages the award and implementation processes in the same way as for local NGOs.\n\nAlso, international NGOs frequently make unsolicited proposals to USAID, requesting funding for their own planned assistance activities.  Where NGOs or business enterprises are dedicating a substantial amount of non-USG resources to their projects, they can receive USAID funding through \"Global Development Alliance\" grants, provided that the non-USG resources are at least equal in value to USAID's grant.\n\nIn general, USAID provides financial assistance to support other organizations' programs when those programs correspond to the areas that USAID wants to support, while USAID uses contracts to procure products or services requested by the leaders of local development projects.\n\n===Other mechanisms===\nIn addition to the types of projects described above, USAID uses various other assistance mechanisms for different U.S. objectives.  Budget agreements with other USG agencies are common in supporting collaboration between the U.S. and other countries on global issues.  Large budget-support grants, referred to as \"non-project\" assistance, may be made to recipient governments to pursue U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\n==History==\nWhen the USG created USAID in November 1961, it built on a legacy of previous development-assistance agencies and their people, budgets, and operating procedures. USAID's predecessor agency was already substantial, with 6,400 U.S. staff in developing-country field missions in 1961.  Except for the peak years of the Vietnam War, 1965\u201370, that was more U.S. field staff than USAID would have in the future, and triple the number USAID has had in field missions in the years since 2000.<ref>Data from USAID reports, \"Distribution of Personnel as of June 30, 1949 thru 1976,\" \"Supporting the USAID Mission, and the \"USAID Staffing Report to Congress\" of 2016.  See full citations in \"References,\" below.</ref>\n\nAlthough the size of the development-assistance effort was not new, the 1961 decision to reorganize the USG's main development-assistance agency was a landmark in terms of institutional evolution, representing the culmination of twenty years' experience with different organizational forms and procedures, in changing foreign-policy environments.\n\nThe new structure created in 1961 \"proved to be sturdy and durable.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=60}}</ref> In particular, the USG has maintained since then \"the unique American pattern of placing strong resident aid missions in countries that [the U.S. was] helping.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=37}}</ref>\n\nThe story of how the base for USAID's structure was built is described below, along with an account of changes that have been made since 1961.<ref>A history of all the programs that USAID has supported since 1961, in scores of countries, plus the evolution of USG policies and academic theories about development and development assistance, to say nothing of the development in the low-income countries themselves, would require enough books to fill a library.  For a start, see Samuel Butterfield's ''U.S. Development Aid'' (2004).</ref>\n\n=== Before World War II ===\nThe realization that early industrializers like the United States could provide technical assistance to other countries' development efforts spread gradually in the late 1800s, leading to a substantial number of visits to other countries by U.S. technical experts, generally with official support by the U.S. Government even when the missions were unofficial. [[Japan]], China, Turkey, and several Latin American countries requested missions on subjects like fiscal management, monetary institutions, election management, mining, schooling, roads, flood control, and urban sanitation.  The U.S. Government also initiated missions, particularly to Central America and the Caribbean, when it felt that U.S. interests might be affected by crises like failed elections, debt defaults, or spread of infectious disease.<ref>Merle Curti and Kendall Birr, \"Prelude to Point Four: American Technical Missions Overseas, 1838\u20131938\" (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1954).</ref>\n\nU.S. technical missions in this era were not, however, part of a systematic, USG-supported program.  Possibly the closest approximation to what USG development assistance would become was the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinafound.org.tw/ec99/eshop1387/e_profile.asp | title=China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture}}</ref> established by the USG in 1924 using funds provided by China as reparations following the \"Boxer\" conflict.  The Foundation's activities ranged widely and included support for development of a leading Chinese university, [[Tsinghua University]].\n\nA notable early example of U.S. Government foreign assistance for disaster relief was its contribution to the 1915 [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]] headed by [[Herbert Hoover]], to prevent starvation in [[Belgium]] after the German invasion.  After World War I in 1919, the USG created the American Relief Administration, also headed by Hoover, which provided food primarily in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween the two world wars, however,  U.S. assistance in low-income countries was often the product of private initiative, including the work of private foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Near East Foundation.<ref>For information on the Near East Foundation, see {{cite web|title=Near East Foundation|url=http://www.neareast.org/}}  Also {{cite book|last1=Badeau|first1=John S.|last2=Stevens|first2=G.

Since countries in the region were regularly requesting expert assistance from USG cabinet departments, an Interdepartmental Committee on Cooperation with the American Republics was established in 1938, with the State Department in the chair, to ensure systematic responses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records of Interdepartmental Committees|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/353.html|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Glick|first1=Philip|title=The Administration of Technical Assistance|date=1957|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|pages=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nMore ambitiously, the U.S. subsequently created an institution that for the first time would take an active role in development assistance programming: the Institute of Inter-American Affairs (IIAA), chartered in March 1942. The Institute was the initiative of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller, the future Vice President of the United States, whose family financed the Rockefeller Foundation. IIAA's 1,400 employees provided technical assistance across Central and South America for economic stabilization, food supply, health, and sanitation. U.S. benefits included development of sources for raw materials that had been disrupted by the war.<ref>Erb, Claude (1985). \"Prelude to Point Four: The Institute of Inter-American Affairs\".

On the basis of positive evaluations from the U.S. Ambassadors in Latin America, the State Department succeeded in getting Congressional authorization to extend IIAA, initially through 1950 and then through 1955.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 26\u201328</ref> Some existing USG technical-assistance agencies continued work in parallel with IIAA.  In particular, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations (OFAR) continued to operate separately until 1954.<ref>OFAR was an office in USDA between 1939 and 1953.  In this period, the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] reported to the Department of State rather than to USDA.

The revised operating procedure was modeled on reforms that had been pioneered by IIAA in March 1951.]</ref>\n\n=== Maturation of American development assistance institutions ===\n\nWhile USG development assistance was institutionalized on a nearly global scale by TCA, strong currents of change in U.S. foreign economic policy during the 1950s affected how development assistance worked and at times called its continued existence into question.  When this process finally resulted in the creation USAID in 1961, USAID continued to use TCA's core mechanism \u2014 providing technical assistance led by in-country resident offices \u2014 and supplemented it with substantial amounts of financial assistance.\n\n==== Post-war foreign aid ====\n\nPoint Four and TCA had been established in the context of a number of other programs in the large-scale U.S. foreign aid effort of the 1940s.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953).</ref> Already during the war, in 1943, the U.S. (jointly with its wartime allies, referred to collectively as \"the United Nations\") established the \"United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\" ([[UNRRA]]) for war-affected parts of Europe, China, the Philippines, Korea, and Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ninth and Final Financial Report of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration |date=March 1949 |publisher=UNRRA |location=Washington, D.C. |page=25 |hdl=2027/nnc1.cu03384870 }}</ref> Immediately after the war, the USG supplied relief in Germany and Japan, funded by appropriations for \"Government and Relief in Occupied Areas\" ([[GARIOA]]).<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nRelief was quickly followed by reconstruction assistance.  In 1946, the U.S. created a special financial-assistance program for rehabilitation of war damages in its former possession, the Philippines.<ref>By the program's completion in March 1951, the U.S. had provided $388 million for private property claims and $55 million for public property reconstruction.  (See {{cite book |last1=Waring |first1=Frank A. |last2=Delgado |first2=Francisco A. |last3=O'Donnell |first3=John A. |title=Rehabilitation of the Philippines: Final and Ninth Semiannual Report of the United States Philippine War Damage Commission |date=March 31, 1951 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington D.C. |hdl=2027/mdp.39015039449130 }})  The following month, in April 1951, the U.S. and the Philippines signed an agreement for the U.S. to open an aid office (a Special Technical and Economic Mission). (See {{cite book |title=Thirteenth Report to Congress of the Economic Cooperation Administration: Supplement |pages=58\u201365 |hdl=2027/umn.31951d03727992c }})</ref> In 1948, reconstruction assistance was expanded through the [[Marshall Plan]], implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), mainly for Western Europe. In the same year, the U.S. and China established the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]],<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 341\u2013342.</ref> which, starting on the mainland and continuing for two decades in Taiwan, provided sustained development assistance.\n\nAlso, the [[Fulbright Program]] of academic exchanges was established in 1946, globalizing the wartime program of exchange visits between professionals from Latin America and the United States.\n\nIn contrast to the [[Marshall Plan]], Point Four focussed on technical assistance and provided financial assistance only in limited amounts to support its technical initiatives. In terms of geographic focus, while the two programs mainly operated in different countries, the Marshall Plan also expanded into developing nations.  In particular, the Marshall Plan financed activities in parts of the Middle East, in overseas territories of European allies (principally in Africa), and in \"the general area of China\" (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines), where it operated through Special Technical and Economic Missions (STEMs).  The STEMs were set up in 1950 and 1951, and had a \"Point Four character\" in the sense that they emphasized services by technical experts.<ref>Hayes (1971), pp. 44\u201352.</ref>  Minimizing overlaps with the Marshall Plan, Point Four managed assistance mainly in Latin America (via IIAA), in North Africa and Eritrea, in parts of the Middle East, and in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 412\u2013414.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also participated in post-1945 UN initiatives for technical assistance to developing countries.  Through a series of actions in 1948 and 1949, the UN's General Assembly and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) created the [[Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance]] (EPTA).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jolly|first1=Richard|last2=Emmerji|first2=Louis|last3=Ghai|first3=Dharam|last4=Lapeyre|first4=Frederic|title=UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice|date=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=68\u201373}}</ref>  The U.S. provided 60% of EPTA's financing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirdar|first1=\u00dcner|title=The Structure of United Nations Economic-Aid to Underdeveloped Countries|url=https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird|url-access=registration|date=1966|publisher=M. Nijhoff|location=The Hague|page=[https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird/page/60 60]}}</ref> By 1955, EPTA adopted a country-led approach where the UN's TA in each country was programmed according to a plan drawn up by the receiving country in consultation with the UN.  ECOSOC also created a new Technical Assistance Board, which (similarly to the USG's wartime Interdepartmental Committee) coordinated the TA being provided to low-income countries by various individual UN agencies.\n\n==== Korean War ====\n\nCoordination between development assistance and the Marshall Plan was tightened in response to the 1950\u201351 war in Korea.  In October 1951 Congress passed the [[Mutual Security Act]], creating the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), which reported directly to the President and supervised both civilian and military assistance. MSA increased the emphasis on large-scale financial assistance to U.S. allies, which was provided as civilian \"economic assistance\" but was intended to help the allies to make greater military efforts and was therefore often called \"defense support.\"<ref>The name under which Congress appropriates these funds has changed over time, becoming \"Supporting Assistance\" in 1961, \"Security Supporting Assistance\" in 1971, and finally \"Economic Support Funds\" from 1978 to the present. See Nowels (1987), pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Mutual Security Agency absorbed the Marshall Plan (the ECA), which otherwise had been scheduled to end in 1952.  The Technical Cooperation Administration remained a semi-autonomous agency in the State Department to administer Point Four, but after 1951 under the supervision of MSA.<ref>Butterfield (2004), p. 37.</ref> Under this coordinated approach, the policy was adopted that ECA and TCA would not both operate in the same country (\"one country \u2014 one agency\").  Accordingly, each agency transferred programs to the other and closed down in some countries.<ref>Bingham (2004), pp. 262\u2013263.</ref> For example, in Indonesia and Burma, ECA closed its financial-assistance programs, while TCA initiated technical assistance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral History Interview with Stanley Andrews |url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/andrewss.htm |publisher=Harry S.

The 1953 amendment to the Mutual Security Act and the much larger Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, known as \"PL-480,\" allowed the U.S. Government to buy U.S. farm surpluses and sell them in developing countries for inconvertible local currencies.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 26\u201329.  Sen. Hubert Humphrey was a prominent supporter of the PL-480 concept.</ref><ref>A currency is \"inconvertible\" when the government forbids it to be used to buy foreign exchange, so that it can only be spent in the country that issues it.</ref> Much of PL-480's foreign-currency revenue was returned to developing countries as a supplement to U.S. development assistance.  PL-480 revenues in the first twenty years were sometimes huge and although PL-480 has become smaller it continues to provide resources to USAID for nutrition and disaster relief programs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Food Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/food-assistance|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=2017}}</ref>\n \nSecond, several factors arose that favored large-scale economic assistance to developing countries, especially in Asia. [[South Korea]] needed massive economic assistance after an armistice was finally signed in July 1953,<ref>Mason, Kim ''et al''. (1980), chapter 6.</ref> and U.S. economic assistance to South Vietnam increased after the retreat of France in 1954.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 259\u2013260.</ref>  On a global scale, the Cold War after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 evolved in the direction of rivalry over influence in low-income countries who were seeking financing for their development initiatives. India was a particular case of a country where the U.S. felt it needed to provide economic assistance to balance the USSR's influence, even though India was not a U.S. military ally.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>  These considerations led to advocacy of expanded economic assistance by several voices within the Eisenhower administration: the FOA Director, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen; C.D. Jackson, from the Time-Life publishing business (who draw on advice from MIT economists Millikan and Rostow); the State Department; and the National Security Council.\n \nAs a result, the USG took several steps in the course of 1954 and 1955 to raise the profile of development assistance.\n\nIn June 1954, the USG raised the ExIm Bank's lending authority from $4.5 billion to $5 billion.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 32.</ref>  Pres. Eisenhower also created in December 1954 a Cabinet-level Council on Foreign Economic Policy,<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 37.</ref> which in March 1955 recommended expanded soft loans for development.

See Ruttan (1996), pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Personnel changes soon reflected this change in the administration's view: Christian Herter succeeded Herbert Hoover Jr. as Under Secretary of State in February 1957, Robert Anderson succeeded George Humphrey as Treasury Secretary in July 1957, and James H. Smith Jr. replaced John Hollister as ICA Director in September 1957.<ref>Haviland (1958), pp. 690, 691, 696.</ref>\n \nPres. Eisenhower summarized the conclusions in his May 21, 1957 message to Congress: \"This past year ... Congressional Committees, the Executive Branch and distinguished private citizens have just examined these programs anew. ... I recommend the following legislative actions: ... economic development assistance should be provided primarily through loans, on a continuing basis, and related closely to technical assistance. ... I recommend a clear separation of military and defense support assistance on the one hand, from economic development assistance on the other. ... I recommend that longterm [sic] development assistance be provided from a Development Loan Fund. ... Such loans should not compete with or replace such existing sources of credit as private investors, the International Bank [the World Bank], or the Export-Import Bank. ... I believe the Fund should be established and administered in the International Cooperation Administration. ... The technical cooperation program is one of the most valuable elements of our entire mutual security effort. It also should be continued on a long-term basis and must be closely related to the work of the Fund.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Mutual Security Programs |date=May 21, 1957 |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-mutual-security-programs |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC-\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n \nAs a result, the Development Loan Fund was established in August 1957.

Eisenhower's years in office from 1953 to 1961 rose from 2,839 to 6,387.<ref name=\"USAID 1976\">Data from USAID, \"Distribution of Personnel as of June 30, 1949 thru 1976.\"</ref>\n\n==== Multilateral Initiatives ====\n\nAs the U.S. expanded its development-assistance efforts in the course of the 1950s, other industrial countries were recovering economically from World War II and were increasingly able to engage in development assistance.  The U.S. supported their involvement through several multilateral initiatives.\n\nThree of these initiatives expanded World Bank facilities.\n\nIn November 1954, the U.S. decided to endorse the World Bank's proposed International Finance Corporation, which would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 46\u201349.</ref> The IFC was finally established in 1956.\n\nWith Senator [[Mike Monroney]] playing a prominent role, Congress approved in July 1958 another new World Bank facility, the International Development Association (IDA).  Funded by grants from industrialized countries, the IDA would make low-interest credits to developing countries for projects like public works.  The IDA formally came into being in September 1960, with the U.S. contributing 42% of its initial resources.<ref>Mason, Edward; Asher, Robert (1973). ''The World Bank Since Bretton Woods''. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution. pp. 381\u2013389.</ref><ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/ida-articlesofagreement.pdf International Development Association. \"Articles of Agreement, Schedule A\"]\nIDA-articlesofagreement.pdf.

P, & Webb, R. Charles. (1997). ''The World Bank : its first half century'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution), p. 929.</ref>\n\nWhile the U.S. supported expanded World Bank facilities, it did not support the proposal for a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED). The UN did create a \"Special Fund\" in 1957, but it was limited to designing projects for the UN's technical assistance program, EPTA, and could not finance public works.<ref>Jolly ''et al.'' (2004), pp. 73\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also adopted a regional initiative with [[Latin America]].  Through most of the 1950s, the U.S. concentrated on technical assistance in the region.  Financial assistance sources were limited to the Eximbank and the World Bank, with the U.S. opposing proposals for a regional development bank.  However, events in 1958 \u2014 notably a riot during Vice President Nixon's visit to [[Caracas, Venezuela]] in May 1958 \u2014 resulted in a reversal of the U.S. position in August 1958.  With U.S. support, the Organization of American States created in April 1959 the Inter-American Development Bank, most of whose capital was contributed by the borrowing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 161-162.</ref>\n\nTo further engage other wealthy countries in development assistance, the USG supported the creation of the Aid India Consortium in August 1958. This was the first of several informal groupings of donors focussing on particular countries.\n\nThe USG also supported the Organization of European Economic Co-operation (the European Marshall Plan organization) in creating a Development Assistance Group in January 1960.<ref>{{cite web |last1=OECD |title=DAC in Dates: The History of OECD's Development Assistance Committee |url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896808.pdf |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=2006}} As the organization broadened its membership and became the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]) in 1961, the Development Assistance Group was re-named the [[Development Assistance Committee]], or DAC.</ref>\n\n=== Creation of USAID and the Development Decade ===\nAt the end of the 1950s, the momentum in favor of development assistance\u2014as represented by PL-480, new mechanisms for financial assistance, larger U.S. budgets and staffing, and multilateral initiatives\u2014picked up support from Senator John F. Kennedy, who was preparing to be a candidate for the presidency. In 1957, JFK proposed, in bipartisan collaboration with Sen. John Sherman Cooper (a former U.S. Ambassador to India), a major expansion of U.S. economic support for India. As a candidate in 1960, he supported the emphasis on humanitarian goals for PL-480 set by Sen. Hubert Humphrey's \"Food for Peace\" Act of 1959<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 156\u2013159.</ref> and supported the idea of a [[Peace Corps]] that was under development thanks to the initiatives of Sen. Humphrey, Rep. Reuss, and Sen. Neuberger.  {{Crossreference| (See the \"History\" section of [[Peace Corps]].)}}<ref>Until 1973, USAID and its predecessors also supported [[International Voluntary Services]], which was founded in 1953.

On March 22, he sent a special message to Congress on foreign aid, asserting that the 1960s should be a \"Decade of Development\" and proposing to unify U.S. development assistance administration into a single agency.  He sent a proposed \"Act for International Development\" to Congress in May and the resulting \"Foreign Assistance Act\" was approved in September, repealing the Mutual Security Act.  In November, Pres. Kennedy signed the act and issued an Executive Order tasking the Secretary of State to create, within the State Department, the \"Agency for International Development\" (or A.I.D.: subsequently re-branded as USAID),<ref>The names of predecessor agencies often continued in popular usage.  In Vietnam in the 1960s, it was common to refer to A.I.D.'s office as \"USOM,\" while in Peru A.I.D. telephone operators continued in the 1960s to answer calls saying \"Punto Cuatro\" (Point Four).</ref> as the successor to both ICA and the Development Loan Fund.<ref>In 1966, the UN would also integrate its EPTA and the Special Fund into a new agency, the UN Development Program, or UNDP.</ref>\n\nWith these actions, the U.S. created a permanent agency working with administrative autonomy under the policy guidance of the State Department to implement, through resident field missions, a global program of both technical and financial development assistance for low-income countries. This structure has continued to date.<ref>The Fulbright educational and cultural exchange program was also strengthened by the Fulbright-Hays Act in September 1961.</ref>\n\nTaking this momentum onto the world stage via an address to the UN General Assembly in September 1961, Pres. Kennedy called for a \"United Nations Decade of Development.\" This initiative was endorsed by a General Assembly resolution in December, establishing the concepts of development and development assistance as global priorities.\n\n=== \"New Directions\" in the 1970s ===\nIn the late 1960s, foreign aid became one of the focal points in Legislative-Executive differences over the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Ruttan (1996). pp. 107\u2013108.</ref>  In September 1970, [[Richard M.

Specifically, USAID's budget would be reformed to account for expenditures for each of these Basic Human Needs, a system referred to as \"functional accounts.\" (Previously, budgets had been divided between categories such as \"development loans, technical assistance, [[Alliance for Progress]] [for Latin America], loans and grants, and population.\")<ref>Ruttan (1996).  pp. 94, 98\u2013100, 543 fn. 2.</ref> The new system was based on a proposal developed by a bipartisan group of House members and staff working with USAID management and outside advisors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=177\u2013179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pastor|first1=Robert A.|title=Congress and the Politics of U.S. Foreign Economic Policy 1929\u20131976|date=1980|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-520-03904-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/congresspolitics0000past/page/278 278\u2013279]|url=https://archive.org/details/congresspolitics0000past/page/278}}</ref> President Nixon signed the New Directions act into law (PL 93-189) in December 1973.\n\nAlso in 1973, the \"Percy Amendment\" of the Foreign Assistance Act required U.S. development assistance to integrate women into its programs, leading to USAID's creation of its Women in Development (WID) office in 1974. However, the [[Helms Amendment]] of 1973 banned use of U.S. Government funds for abortion as a method of family planning, which effectively required USAID to eliminate all support for abortion.<ref name=\"usaidweb1\">USAID Public website [http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html USAID's Family Planning Guiding Principles and U.S. Legislative and Policy Requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329101241/http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html |date=2013-03-29 }} Retrieved September 10, 2012</ref>\n\nA further amendment of the Foreign Assistance Act in 1974 prohibited assistance for police, thus ending USAID's involvement in Public Safety programs in Latin America, which in the 1960s were, along with the Vietnam War, part of the U.S. Government's anti-Communist strategy.\n\nThe reforms also ended the practice of the 1960s and 1970s in which many USAID officers in Latin America and Southeast Asia had worked in joint offices led by State Department diplomats or in units with U.S. military personnel.\n\nThe Basic Human Needs reforms largely cut off USAID's assistance to higher education.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guither |first1=Harold D. |title=The Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger Amendment: Issues and Compromises in International Development Policymaking |journal=Illinois Agricultural Economics |date=July 1977 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.2307/1348954 |jstor=1348954 }}</ref><ref>See also Congressional Research Service (1981), material found via search string \"higher education\".</ref>  A large part of that assistance had gone to agricultural universities in hungry developing countries, as illustrated by a 1974 book by a University of Illinois professor, Hadley Read, describing USAID-supported U.S. land-grant universities' work in building India's agricultural universities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Read |first1=Hadley |title=Partners With India: Building Agricultural Universities |date=1974 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana-Champaign}}</ref> Read's book inspired an Illinois Member of Congress concerned with famine prevention, Paul Findley, to draft a bill authorizing more support for programs like the ones Read described.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Findley |first1=Paul |title=Interview with Paul Findley: Transcript |url=https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/general/Documents/FindleyPaul/Findley_Pau_4FNL.pdf |publisher=Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library |accessdate=13 June 2018 |pages=158\u2013161 |date=2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115133153/https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/general/Documents/FindleyPaul/Findley_Pau_4FNL.pdf |archive-date=2017-11-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a legislative process involving USAID staff, the association of state universities and land-grant colleges (NASULGC), and Sen.

Title XII created the [[Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD)]], with seven members representing U.S. universities and agricultural technology institutions who advise USAID on Title XII implementation.\n\nThe impact of all these actions of the early 1970s on the overall scale of U.S. development assistance is indicated by the change in the number of U.S. staff in field missions.  In 1969, the year when Pres. Nixon took office, the number was already decreasing from its Vietnam War high of 8,717 and had reached 7,701.

However, although IDCA was established by Executive Order in September 1979, it did not in practice make USAID independent.\n\nIn 1995, legislation to abolish USAID was introduced by Senator [[Jesse Helms]], the Chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], who aimed to replace USAID with a grant-making foundation.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/16/world/helms-seeks-to-merge-foreign-policy-agencies.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Greenhouse | title=Helms Seeks to Merge Foreign Policy Agencies | date=March 16, 1995}}</ref>  Although the House of Representatives passed a bill abolishing USAID, the measure did not become law.  In order to gain Congressional cooperation for his foreign affairs agenda, however, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] adopted in 1997 a State Department proposal to integrate more foreign affairs agencies into the Department.

Debates of this kind are arbitrated in Washington by Congress and the Administration before budgets are decided and before USAID staff undertake detailed programming in the field.  The result is normally that USAID's programs in a given country pursue a mix of goals.\n\n===Modes of assistance===\nSome feel that USAID overemphasizes technical assistance and should instead provide more financial assistance (budget support, or debt relief).  They argue that financial assistance allows recipients to spend as they like with less influence from donors.  Others feel that financial assistance does not result in durable improvements and that person-to-person technical assistance has the advantage of sharing knowledge and experience, leading to permanent improvements.\n\nIn practice, many USAID missions find that their counterparts appreciate having both forms of aid: an assistance package that includes some financial assistance for things that can simply be bought and some technical assistance to confront problems and issues whose solutions are not so clear.\n\n===Cost of delivering assistance===\nUSAID is frequently criticized for providing expensive expert services to counterparts.  The majority of the staff that USAID finances are from the country itself, but USAID is also able to recruit internationally when necessary to meet the counterpart's needs.  USAID uses competition to arrive at market rates for the staff it recruits, and has experimented with volunteer programs for expertise from high paid professions.\n\n===Non-career contracts===\nUSAID frequently contracts with private firms or individuals for specialist services lasting from a few weeks to several years.  It has long been asked whether USAID should more often assign such tasks to career U.S. Government employees instead.  USG staff directly performed technical assistance in the earliest days of the program in the 1940s.  However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  By 1955, observers commented on a perceived shift towards more use of shorter-term contracts (rather than using employees with career-length contracts).<ref>See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-government programs===\nIn situations where the U.S. is hostile to the government of a country, USAID may be asked to undertake programs that the government would not accept and thus to operate without the government's knowledge.  This might include USAID support for opposition political movements that seek to remove the government.  Such \"political aid\" is criticized by some as being incompatible with USAID's role as an assistance or cooperation agency and as exposing USAID staff worldwide to the suspicion of being covertly engaged in subversion.  Similarly, USAID's participation in actions against foreign governments led by the U.S. military is criticized by some as inappropriate and as exposing USAID civilian staff to the dangers of military combat.  However, such political aid and joint civilian-military programs are supported by others as necessary to support U.S. geopolitical interests and to build democracy.\n\n===Economic interests===\nUSAID states that \"U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world.\" However, non-government organization watch groups have noted that as much as 40% of aid to Afghanistan has found its way back to donor countries through awarding contracts at inflated costs.<ref>Richard Norton-Taylor [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/25/afghanistan.internationalaidanddevelopment1 40% of Afghan aid returns to donor countries, says report] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 March 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough USAID officially selects contractors on a competitive and objective basis, watch dog groups, politicians, foreign governments and corporations have occasionally accused the agency of allowing its bidding process to be unduly influenced by the political and financial interests of its current Presidential administration.

After 1945, the European Recovery Program championed by Secretary of State George Marshall (the \"[[Marshall Plan]]\") helped rebuild war-torn Western Europe.\n\nUSAID manages relief efforts after wars and natural disasters through its Office of U.S Foreign Disaster Assistance in Washington D.C. Privately funded U.S. NGOs and the U.S. military also play major roles in disaster relief overseas.\n\n===Poverty relief===\n[[File:Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development (7269588282).jpg|thumb|right|Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development, USAID [[Nigeria]]]]\nAfter 1945, many newly independent countries needed assistance to relieve the chronic deprivation afflicting their low-income populations.  USAID and its predecessor agencies have continuously provided poverty relief in many forms, including assistance to public health and education services targeted at the poorest.  USAID has also helped manage food aid provided by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].  In addition, USAID provides funding to NGOs to supplement private donations in relieving chronic poverty.\n\n===Global issues===\nTechnical cooperation between nations is essential for addressing a range of cross-border concerns like communicable diseases, environmental issues, trade and investment cooperation, safety standards for traded products, money laundering, and so forth.  The USG has specialized agencies dealing with such areas, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency.  USAID's special ability to administer programs in low-income countries supports these and other USG agencies' international work on global concerns.\n\n====Environment====\n\nAmong these global interests, environmental issues attract high attention.  USAID assists projects that conserve and protect threatened land, water, forests, and wildlife.  USAID also assists projects to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to build resilience to the risks associated with global [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Global Climate Change: Capacity Building | publisher = [[USAID]] | url = http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | accessdate = 2014-08-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120113701/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | archivedate = 2012-01-20 }}</ref>  U.S. environmental regulation laws require that programs sponsored by USAID should be both economically and environmentally [[sustainable]].\n\n===U.S. national interests===\nTo support U.S. geopolitical interests, Congress appropriates exceptional financial assistance to allies, largely in the form of \"Economic Support Funds\" (ESF).  USAID is called on to administer the bulk (90%) of ESF<ref>Tarnoff (2015), p. 13.</ref> and is instructed \"To the maximum extent feasible, [to] provide [ESF] assistance ... consistent with the policy directions, purposes, and programs of [development assistance].\"<ref>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended), Section 531.</ref>\n\nAlso, when U.S. troops are in the field, USAID can supplement the \"[[Civil Affairs]]\" programs that the U.S. military conducts to win the friendship of local populations.  In these circumstances, USAID may be directed by specially appointed diplomatic officials of the State Department, as has been done in Afghanistan and Pakistan during operations against al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stabilization: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan |url=https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/stabilization/index.html |publisher=SIGAR |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nU.S. commercial interests are served by U.S. law's requirement that most goods and services financed by USAID must be sourced from U.S. vendors.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 310: Source and Nationality Requirements for Procurement of Commodities and Services Financed by USAID |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/310.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic development===\nTo help low-income nations achieve self-sustaining socioeconomic development, USAID assists them in improving management of their own resources.  USAID's assistance for socioeconomic development mainly provides technical advice, training, scholarships, commodities, and financial assistance.  Through grants and contracts, USAID mobilizes the technical resources of the private sector, other USG agencies, universities, and NGOs to participate in this assistance.\n\nPrograms of the various types above frequently reinforce one another.  For example, the Foreign Assistance Act requires USAID to use funds appropriated for geopolitical purposes (\"Economic Support Funds\") to support socioeconomic development to the maximum extent possible.\n\n==Modes of assistance==\nUSAID delivers both technical assistance and financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/primer.html |title=USAID Primer: What We Do and How We Do It |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>\n\n===Technical assistance===\nTechnical assistance includes technical advice, training, scholarships, construction, and commodities.  Technical assistance is contracted or procured by USAID and provided in-kind to recipients.  For technical advisory services, USAID draws on experts from the private sector, mainly from the assisted country's own pool of expertise, as well as from specialized USG agencies.  Many host-government leaders have drawn on USAID's technical assistance for development of IT systems and computer hardware procurement to strengthen their institutions.\n\nTo build indigenous expertise and leadership, USAID finances scholarships to U.S. universities and assists the strengthening of developing countries' own universities.  Local universities' programs in developmentally important sectors are assisted directly and through USAID support for forming partnerships with U.S. universities.\n\nThe various forms of technical assistance are frequently coordinated as capacity building packages for development of local institutions.\n\n===Financial assistance===\n[[File:National Open Source Software Competition - USAID.jpg|thumb|National Open Source Software Competition \u2013 USAID financial assistance for groups developing technology in Indonesia]]\n\nFinancial assistance supplies cash to developing country organizations to supplement their budgets.  USAID also provides financial assistance to local and international [[NGOs]] who in turn give technical assistance in developing countries.  Although USAID formerly provided loans, all financial assistance is now provided in the form of nonreimbursable grants.\n\nIn recent years, the USG has increased its emphasis on financial rather than technical assistance.  In 2004, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration created the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] as a new foreign aid agency that is mainly restricted to providing financial assistance. In 2009, the Obama Administration initiated a major realignment of USAID's own programs to emphasize financial assistance, referring to it as \"government-to-government\" or \"G2G\" assistance.\n\n==Organization==\n\nUSAID is organized around country development programs managed by resident USAID offices in developing countries (\"USAID missions\"), supported by USAID's global headquarters in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |title=USAID: Organization |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423111526/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |archive-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Country development programs===\nUSAID plans its work in each country around an individual country development program managed by a resident office called a \"mission.\"  The USAID mission and its U.S. staff are guests in the country, with a status that is usually defined by a \"framework bilateral agreement\" between the USG and the host government.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 349|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/349.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 349.3.1.1|date=2003}}</ref> Framework bilaterals give the mission and its U.S. staff privileges similar to (but not necessarily the same as) those accorded to the U.S. embassy and diplomats by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 155|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/155.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 155.3.1.1.c|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nUSAID missions work in over fifty countries, consulting with their governments and non-governmental organizations to identify programs that will receive USAID's assistance. As part of this process, USAID missions conduct socioeconomic analysis, discuss projects with host-country leaders, design assistance to those projects, award contracts and grants, administer assistance (including evaluation and reporting), and manage flows of funds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tarnoff|first1=Curt|title=U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID): Background, Operations, and Issues|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44117.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=July 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs countries develop and need less assistance, USAID shrinks and ultimately closes its resident missions.

(Shorter tours of one or two years are usual in countries of exceptional hardship or danger.)<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 436: Foreign Service Assignments and Tours of Duty |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1877/436.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Mission Director is a member of the U.S. Embassy's \"Country Team\" under the direction of the U.S. Ambassador.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dorman |first1=Shawn |title=Foreign Service Work and Life: Embassy, Employee, Family |url=http://afsa.org/sites/default/files/iuse_country_team_local_staff_role.pdf |publisher=American Foreign Service Association |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>  As a USAID mission works in an unclassified environment with relative frequent public interaction, most missions were initially located in independent offices in the business districts of capital cities.

However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>  The technical offices that are frequently found in USAID missions include Health and Family Planning, Education, Environment, Democracy, and Economic Growth.\n\n====Health and Family Planning====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by missions' Health and Family Planning offices are projects for eradication of communicable diseases, strengthening of public health systems focusing on maternal-child health including family planning services, [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-AIDS]] monitoring, delivery of medical supplies including contraceptives and [[HIV]] vaccines, and coordination of Demographic and Health Surveys. This assistance is primarily targeted to the poor majority of the population and corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as strengthening the basis for socioeconomic development.\n\n====Education====\n\nUSAID's Education offices mainly assist the national school system, emphasizing broadening coverage of quality basic education to reach the entire population. Examples of projects often assisted by Education offices are projects for curriculum development, teacher training, and provision of improved textbooks and materials.  Larger programs have included school construction.  Education offices often manage scholarship programs for training in the U.S., while assistance to the country's universities and professional education institutions may be provided by Economic Growth and Health offices.  The Education office's emphasis on school access for the poor majority of the population corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as to the socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Environment====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by Environment offices are projects for tropical forest conservation, protection of indigenous people's lands, regulation of marine fishing industries, pollution control, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and helping communities adapt to climate change.  Environment assistance corresponds to USAID's objective of technical cooperation on global issues, as well as laying a sustainable basis for USAID's socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Democracy====\nExamples of projects assisted by Democracy offices are projects for the country's political institutions, including elections, political parties, legislatures, and human rights organizations.  Counterparts include the judicial sector and civil-society organizations that monitor government performance.  Democracy assistance received its greatest impetus at the time of the creation of the successor states to the USSR starting in about 1990, corresponding both to USAID's objective of supporting U.S. bilateral interests and to USAID's socioeconomic development objective.\n\n====Economic Growth====\n\nExamples of projects often assisted by Economic Growth offices are projects for improvements in agricultural techniques and marketing (the mission may have a specialized \"Agriculture\" office), development of microfinance industries, streamlining of Customs administrations (to accelerate growth of exporting industries), and modernization of government regulatory frameworks for industry in various sectors (telecommunications, agriculture, and so forth). [[File:USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms.jpg|thumb|USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms]] In USAID's early years and in some larger programs, Economic Growth offices have financed economic infrastructure like roads and electrical power plants.  Economic Growth assistance is thus quite diverse in terms of the range of sectors where it may work.  It corresponds to USAID's socioeconomic development objective and is the source of sustainable poverty reduction.  Economic Growth offices also occasionally manage assistance to poverty relief projects, such as to government programs that provide \"cash transfer\" payments to low-income families.\n\n====Special assistance offices====\n\nSome USAID missions have specialized technical offices for areas like counter-narcotics assistance or assistance in conflict zones.\n\nDisaster assistance on a large scale is provided through USAID's [[Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance|Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance]].  Rather than having a permanent presence in country missions, this office has supplies pre-positioned in strategic locations to respond quickly to disasters when and where they occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-us|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Office of the Mission Director and the Program Office===\nThe Mission Director's signature authorizes technical offices to provide assistance according to the designs and budgets they propose.  With the help of the Program Office, the Mission Director ensures that designs are consistent with USAID policy for the country, including budgetary earmarks by which Washington directs that funds be used for certain general purposes such as public health or environmental conservation.  The Program Office compiles combined reports to Washington to support budget requests to Congress and to verify that budgets were used as planned.\n\n===Contracting, financial management and management offices===\nWhile the Mission Director is the public face and key decision-maker for an impressive array of USAID technical capabilities, arguably the offices that make USAID preeminent among U.S. government agencies in the ability to follow through on assistance agreements in low-income countries are the \"support\" offices.\n\n====Contracting offices====\n\nCommitments of U.S. government funds to NGOs and firms that implement USAID's assistance programs can only be made in compliance with carefully designed contracts and grant agreements executed by warranted Contracting and Agreement Officers.  The Mission Director is authorized to commit financial assistance directly to the country's government agencies.\n\n====Financial management offices====\n\nFunds can be committed only when the Mission's Controller certifies their availability for the stated purpose.  \"FM\" offices assist technical offices in financial analysis and in developing detailed budgets for inputs needed by projects assisted.  They evaluate potential recipients' management abilities before financial assistance can be authorized and then review implementers' expenditure reports with great care.  This office often has the largest number of staff of any office in the mission.\n\n====Management offices====\n\nCalled the \"Executive Office\" in USAID (sometimes leading to confusion with the Embassy's Executive Office, which is the office of the Ambassador), \"EXO\" provides operational support for mission offices, including human resources, information systems management, transportation, property and procurement services. Increasing integration into Embassies' chancery complexes, and the State Department's recently increased role in providing support services to USAID, is expanding the importance of coordination between USAID's EXO and the Embassy's Management section.\n\n==Assistance projects==\nWhile the terms \"assistance project\" and \"development project\" might sometimes be used indiscriminately, it helps in understanding USAID's work to make a distinction.  (1) Development is what developing countries do.  Development projects are projects of local government agencies and NGOs, such as projects to improve public services or business regulations, etc.  (2) Assistance is what USAID does.  USAID's assistance projects support local development projects.\n\nThe key to a successful development project is the institutional capacity of local organizations, including the professional ability of their staff members.  The key to successful assistance is how well it fits the needs of local development projects, including institutional capacity building and supporting professional education and training for staff.\n\nWhen a local development project's assistance needs have been identified, USAID arranges the agreed assistance through funding agreements with implementing organizations, referred to by USAID staff as \"implementing partners.\"  USAID finances several types of implementers using a variety of funding agreements.\n\nTo illustrate, USAID might assist a development project with inputs provided through several different funding agreements:\n\n# A budget-support grant to a government agency.\n# A contract with a firm for support to the agency.\n# A grant to a local NGO serving the beneficiary group.\n# A grant to an international NGO to strengthen the operations of the local NGO.\n\nEach of these types of USAID funding agreements is profiled below.\n\n===Budget support to a government agency===\nThis funding agreement would take the form of a letter from USAID's Mission Director, countersigned by the recipient agency, explaining the agency's objectives, the amount of USAID's financial commitment, the specific expenditures to be financed by USAID's grant, and other operational aspects of the agreement.\n\nUSAID's technical office would assign a staff member (U.S. or local) to oversee progress in the agency's implementation.  USAID's financial management office would transfer funds to the agency, in tranches as needed.  Audit under this kind of government-to-government (G2G) financial assistance is usually performed by the host government's own audit agency.\n\n===Contract for technical assistance to a government agency===\nAs a government agency is usually specialized in services to the beneficiary population (medical services, for example), its staff may not be equipped to undertake planning and evaluation, construction, acquisition of equipment, or management of training and study tours.  The government agency might, therefore, request USAID's assistance in these areas, and USAID could respond by contracting with a firm to supply the services or technical assistance requested.\n\nUSAID's technical office would collaborate with the government agency in drafting the specifications for what is needed (generally referred to as a \"Statement of Work\" for the contract) and in conducting market research for available sources and potential bidders.  USAID's Contracting Officer would then advertise for bids, manage the selection of a contractor from among the competing bidders, sign the contract, and assign a technical-office staff member as the Contracting Officer's Representative to oversee the performance under the contract.  (If the workload permits, this staff member might be the same person who oversees USAID's financial assistance to the government agency.)\n\nThe contractor supplies technical assistance directly to the government agency, so that in monitoring contractor performance USAID relies substantially on the agency's evaluation of the contractor's work.\n\n===Grant to finance NGO services to a beneficiary group===\nNon-governmental organizations are, like their government counterparts, usually already engaged in service provision in areas where USAID wants to assist, and they often have unique abilities that complement public programs.  Therefore, USAID technical-office staff might set aside a budget and, with the help of the mission's contracting office, publish a solicitation for applications from NGOs for financial assistance to their programs.  One or several grants could be made to selected NGOs by the contracting office's \"Agreement Officer.\"  Similar to the case of a contract, a USAID technical-office staff member would be assigned as the Agreement Officer's Representative to monitor progress in the NGOs' implementation and to arrange for external evaluations.  USAID grants require recipient NGOs to contract for external audits.\n\nAs some local NGOs may be small and young organizations with no prior experience in receiving awards from USAID, the USAID mission's financial management office reviews grant applicants' administrative systems to ensure that they are capable of managing USG funds.  Where necessary, USAID can devote part of the grant to the NGO's internal strengthening to help the NGO qualify for USAID's financing and build the capacity of the organization in the process.  Following completion of the NGO's internal strengthening, USAID would disburse financing for the NGO's service project.\n\n===Grant to international NGOs for technical assistance===\nInternational NGOs have their own development projects and capabilities.  If USAID and its counterparts determine that development objectives can best be met by supporting an NGO project, and if local NGO capacity is not yet sufficient, the relevant USAID technical office will draft a program description and the contracting office will issue as a request for applications to solicit responses from the international NGO community.  USAID manages the award and implementation processes in the same way as for local NGOs.\n\nAlso, international NGOs frequently make unsolicited proposals to USAID, requesting funding for their own planned assistance activities.  Where NGOs or business enterprises are dedicating a substantial amount of non-USG resources to their projects, they can receive USAID funding through \"Global Development Alliance\" grants, provided that the non-USG resources are at least equal in value to USAID's grant.\n\nIn general, USAID provides financial assistance to support other organizations' programs when those programs correspond to the areas that USAID wants to support, while USAID uses contracts to procure products or services requested by the leaders of local development projects.\n\n===Other mechanisms===\nIn addition to the types of projects described above, USAID uses various other assistance mechanisms for different U.S. objectives.  Budget agreements with other USG agencies are common in supporting collaboration between the U.S. and other countries on global issues.  Large budget-support grants, referred to as \"non-project\" assistance, may be made to recipient governments to pursue U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\n==History==\nWhen the USG created USAID in November 1961, it built on a legacy of previous development-assistance agencies and their people, budgets, and operating procedures. USAID's predecessor agency was already substantial, with 6,400 U.S. staff in developing-country field missions in 1961.  Except for the peak years of the Vietnam War, 1965\u201370, that was more U.S. field staff than USAID would have in the future, and triple the number USAID has had in field missions in the years since 2000.<ref>Data from USAID reports, \"Distribution of Personnel as of June 30, 1949 thru 1976,\" \"Supporting the USAID Mission, and the \"USAID Staffing Report to Congress\" of 2016.  See full citations in \"References,\" below.</ref>\n\nAlthough the size of the development-assistance effort was not new, the 1961 decision to reorganize the USG's main development-assistance agency was a landmark in terms of institutional evolution, representing the culmination of twenty years' experience with different organizational forms and procedures, in changing foreign-policy environments.\n\nThe new structure created in 1961 \"proved to be sturdy and durable.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=60}}</ref> In particular, the USG has maintained since then \"the unique American pattern of placing strong resident aid missions in countries that [the U.S. was] helping.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=37}}</ref>\n\nThe story of how the base for USAID's structure was built is described below, along with an account of changes that have been made since 1961.<ref>A history of all the programs that USAID has supported since 1961, in scores of countries, plus the evolution of USG policies and academic theories about development and development assistance, to say nothing of the development in the low-income countries themselves, would require enough books to fill a library.  For a start, see Samuel Butterfield's ''U.S. Development Aid'' (2004).</ref>\n\n=== Before World War II ===\nThe realization that early industrializers like the United States could provide technical assistance to other countries' development efforts spread gradually in the late 1800s, leading to a substantial number of visits to other countries by U.S. technical experts, generally with official support by the U.S. Government even when the missions were unofficial. [[Japan]], China, Turkey, and several Latin American countries requested missions on subjects like fiscal management, monetary institutions, election management, mining, schooling, roads, flood control, and urban sanitation.  The U.S. Government also initiated missions, particularly to Central America and the Caribbean, when it felt that U.S. interests might be affected by crises like failed elections, debt defaults, or spread of infectious disease.<ref>Merle Curti and Kendall Birr, \"Prelude to Point Four: American Technical Missions Overseas, 1838\u20131938\" (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1954).</ref>\n\nU.S. technical missions in this era were not, however, part of a systematic, USG-supported program.  Possibly the closest approximation to what USG development assistance would become was the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinafound.org.tw/ec99/eshop1387/e_profile.asp | title=China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture}}</ref> established by the USG in 1924 using funds provided by China as reparations following the \"Boxer\" conflict.  The Foundation's activities ranged widely and included support for development of a leading Chinese university, [[Tsinghua University]].\n\nA notable early example of U.S. Government foreign assistance for disaster relief was its contribution to the 1915 [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]] headed by [[Herbert Hoover]], to prevent starvation in [[Belgium]] after the German invasion.  After World War I in 1919, the USG created the American Relief Administration, also headed by Hoover, which provided food primarily in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween the two world wars, however,  U.S. assistance in low-income countries was often the product of private initiative, including the work of private foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Near East Foundation.<ref>For information on the Near East Foundation, see {{cite web|title=Near East Foundation|url=http://www.neareast.org/}}  Also {{cite book|last1=Badeau|first1=John S.|last2=Stevens|first2=G.

Since countries in the region were regularly requesting expert assistance from USG cabinet departments, an Interdepartmental Committee on Cooperation with the American Republics was established in 1938, with the State Department in the chair, to ensure systematic responses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records of Interdepartmental Committees|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/353.html|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Glick|first1=Philip|title=The Administration of Technical Assistance|date=1957|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|pages=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nMore ambitiously, the U.S. subsequently created an institution that for the first time would take an active role in development assistance programming: the Institute of Inter-American Affairs (IIAA), chartered in March 1942. The Institute was the initiative of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller, the future Vice President of the United States, whose family financed the Rockefeller Foundation. IIAA's 1,400 employees provided technical assistance across Central and South America for economic stabilization, food supply, health, and sanitation. U.S. benefits included development of sources for raw materials that had been disrupted by the war.<ref>Erb, Claude (1985). \"Prelude to Point Four: The Institute of Inter-American Affairs\".

On the basis of positive evaluations from the U.S. Ambassadors in Latin America, the State Department succeeded in getting Congressional authorization to extend IIAA, initially through 1950 and then through 1955.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 26\u201328</ref> Some existing USG technical-assistance agencies continued work in parallel with IIAA.  In particular, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations (OFAR) continued to operate separately until 1954.<ref>OFAR was an office in USDA between 1939 and 1953.  In this period, the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] reported to the Department of State rather than to USDA.

The revised operating procedure was modeled on reforms that had been pioneered by IIAA in March 1951.]</ref>\n\n=== Maturation of American development assistance institutions ===\n\nWhile USG development assistance was institutionalized on a nearly global scale by TCA, strong currents of change in U.S. foreign economic policy during the 1950s affected how development assistance worked and at times called its continued existence into question.  When this process finally resulted in the creation USAID in 1961, USAID continued to use TCA's core mechanism \u2014 providing technical assistance led by in-country resident offices \u2014 and supplemented it with substantial amounts of financial assistance.\n\n==== Post-war foreign aid ====\n\nPoint Four and TCA had been established in the context of a number of other programs in the large-scale U.S. foreign aid effort of the 1940s.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953).</ref> Already during the war, in 1943, the U.S. (jointly with its wartime allies, referred to collectively as \"the United Nations\") established the \"United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\" ([[UNRRA]]) for war-affected parts of Europe, China, the Philippines, Korea, and Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ninth and Final Financial Report of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration |date=March 1949 |publisher=UNRRA |location=Washington, D.C. |page=25 |hdl=2027/nnc1.cu03384870 }}</ref> Immediately after the war, the USG supplied relief in Germany and Japan, funded by appropriations for \"Government and Relief in Occupied Areas\" ([[GARIOA]]).<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nRelief was quickly followed by reconstruction assistance.  In 1946, the U.S. created a special financial-assistance program for rehabilitation of war damages in its former possession, the Philippines.<ref>By the program's completion in March 1951, the U.S. had provided $388 million for private property claims and $55 million for public property reconstruction.  (See {{cite book |last1=Waring |first1=Frank A. |last2=Delgado |first2=Francisco A. |last3=O'Donnell |first3=John A. |title=Rehabilitation of the Philippines: Final and Ninth Semiannual Report of the United States Philippine War Damage Commission |date=March 31, 1951 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington D.C. |hdl=2027/mdp.39015039449130 }})  The following month, in April 1951, the U.S. and the Philippines signed an agreement for the U.S. to open an aid office (a Special Technical and Economic Mission). (See {{cite book |title=Thirteenth Report to Congress of the Economic Cooperation Administration: Supplement |pages=58\u201365 |hdl=2027/umn.31951d03727992c }})</ref> In 1948, reconstruction assistance was expanded through the [[Marshall Plan]], implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), mainly for Western Europe. In the same year, the U.S. and China established the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]],<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 341\u2013342.</ref> which, starting on the mainland and continuing for two decades in Taiwan, provided sustained development assistance.\n\nAlso, the [[Fulbright Program]] of academic exchanges was established in 1946, globalizing the wartime program of exchange visits between professionals from Latin America and the United States.\n\nIn contrast to the [[Marshall Plan]], Point Four focussed on technical assistance and provided financial assistance only in limited amounts to support its technical initiatives. In terms of geographic focus, while the two programs mainly operated in different countries, the Marshall Plan also expanded into developing nations.  In particular, the Marshall Plan financed activities in parts of the Middle East, in overseas territories of European allies (principally in Africa), and in \"the general area of China\" (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines), where it operated through Special Technical and Economic Missions (STEMs).  The STEMs were set up in 1950 and 1951, and had a \"Point Four character\" in the sense that they emphasized services by technical experts.<ref>Hayes (1971), pp. 44\u201352.</ref>  Minimizing overlaps with the Marshall Plan, Point Four managed assistance mainly in Latin America (via IIAA), in North Africa and Eritrea, in parts of the Middle East, and in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 412\u2013414.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also participated in post-1945 UN initiatives for technical assistance to developing countries.  Through a series of actions in 1948 and 1949, the UN's General Assembly and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) created the [[Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance]] (EPTA).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jolly|first1=Richard|last2=Emmerji|first2=Louis|last3=Ghai|first3=Dharam|last4=Lapeyre|first4=Frederic|title=UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice|date=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=68\u201373}}</ref>  The U.S. provided 60% of EPTA's financing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirdar|first1=\u00dcner|title=The Structure of United Nations Economic-Aid to Underdeveloped Countries|url=https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird|url-access=registration|date=1966|publisher=M. Nijhoff|location=The Hague|page=[https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird/page/60 60]}}</ref> By 1955, EPTA adopted a country-led approach where the UN's TA in each country was programmed according to a plan drawn up by the receiving country in consultation with the UN.  ECOSOC also created a new Technical Assistance Board, which (similarly to the USG's wartime Interdepartmental Committee) coordinated the TA being provided to low-income countries by various individual UN agencies.\n\n==== Korean War ====\n\nCoordination between development assistance and the Marshall Plan was tightened in response to the 1950\u201351 war in Korea.  In October 1951 Congress passed the [[Mutual Security Act]], creating the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), which reported directly to the President and supervised both civilian and military assistance. MSA increased the emphasis on large-scale financial assistance to U.S. allies, which was provided as civilian \"economic assistance\" but was intended to help the allies to make greater military efforts and was therefore often called \"defense support.\"<ref>The name under which Congress appropriates these funds has changed over time, becoming \"Supporting Assistance\" in 1961, \"Security Supporting Assistance\" in 1971, and finally \"Economic Support Funds\" from 1978 to the present. See Nowels (1987), pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Mutual Security Agency absorbed the Marshall Plan (the ECA), which otherwise had been scheduled to end in 1952.  The Technical Cooperation Administration remained a semi-autonomous agency in the State Department to administer Point Four, but after 1951 under the supervision of MSA.<ref>Butterfield (2004), p. 37.</ref> Under this coordinated approach, the policy was adopted that ECA and TCA would not both operate in the same country (\"one country \u2014 one agency\").  Accordingly, each agency transferred programs to the other and closed down in some countries.<ref>Bingham (2004), pp. 262\u2013263.</ref> For example, in Indonesia and Burma, ECA closed its financial-assistance programs, while TCA initiated technical assistance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral History Interview with Stanley Andrews |url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/andrewss.htm |publisher=Harry S.

The President's party, which had been out of the White House since 1933,<ref>The only times the Republican Party had a majority in either house in the 48-year span from 1933 to 1981 was when it enjoyed small majorities in both houses of the 80th Congress in 1947\u20131949 under Pres. Truman and both houses of the 83rd Congress 1953\u20131955 under Pres. Eisenhower.</ref> took a critical view of the previous administrations' policies, including both the globalizing policies of the 1940s and the New Deal initiatives of the 1930s.<ref>The New Deal's Tennessee Valley Authority was the model for some major development assistance projects. See Ekbladh (2002).</ref>\n \nAn overall goal of the new administration was to administer the government efficiently and cut spending.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 14.</ref> While TCA's technical assistance to developing countries was a small budget item and was considered a long-term program (although fresh funds were appropriated annually), \"economic assistance\" (or \"defense support\") was considered an inherently short-term measure.<ref>Bingham (1953), p. 38.</ref> In place of U.S. economic assistance, the Eisenhower administration proposed that U.S. allies should increasingly finance themselves through their own exports: in other words, through \"trade not aid.\"<ref>Kaufman (1982), ch. 2, pp. 12\u201333.</ref>  With respect to financial assistance for developing countries, the policy was maintained that it should be provided primarily by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and by the World Bank,<ref>U.S. documents of the 1950s usually referred to the World Bank as \"the International Bank.\"</ref> and that it should be available only on commercial terms and primarily to finance private investment.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 130\u2013136: \"The Relation of Technical Co-operation to Economic Aid.\"</ref>\n\nTo administer the foreign assistance more efficiently, President Eisenhower integrated management into a single agency, the newly created Foreign Operations Administration (FOA).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Organization of the Executive Branch for the Conduct of Foreign Affairs |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-organization-the-executive-branch-for-the-conduct-foreign |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=26 April 2019 |date=June 1, 1953}}</ref> MSA, TCA (which had been under MSA's direction), and IIAA (which had been part of TCA) were all abolished as of August 1953 and their country offices became \"United States Operations Missions\" (USOMs) under FOA.<ref>Bingham (2004), p. 240.</ref> The President directed other USG agencies to put their technical assistance in developing countries under FOA's management as well. USDA in particular transferred OFAR's programs to FOA, while reconstituting the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] for the task of building global markets for U.S. farm products.<ref>Glick (1957) p. 49.</ref>\n\nAdministrative functions were consolidated as the various agencies came into FOA, and the Mutual Security Act of July 1953 instructed FOA to reduce personnel by at least 10% within 120 days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Government|title=Mutual Security Act of 1953|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg152.pdf|at=Section 706(a)|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=July 16, 1953}}</ref> A large number of TCA's senior professionals were summarily dismissed, and FOA's administrator mounted an effort to compensate for lower USG staffing by drawing on experts from U.S. universities and private voluntary organizations.<ref>Ruttan (1996), p. 205.</ref>  The ExIm Bank's lending volume in developing countries was also cut dramatically in 1953.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 29\u201333.</ref>\n\nChanging world events and differences of opinion within the [[Eisenhower]] administration soon altered the administration's cutbacks, however.\n \nFirst, while a \"trade not aid\" strategy required the U.S. to import more goods from its allies, the administration was unable to convince Congress to liberalize import policy.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 37\u201346.</ref>  On the contrary, the main foreign commercial measure taken at this time went in the other direction: the U.S. ramped up subsidies for exports of U.S. agricultural products.  The 1953 amendment to the Mutual Security Act and the much larger Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, known as \"PL-480,\" allowed the U.S. Government to buy U.S. farm surpluses and sell them in developing countries for inconvertible local currencies.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 26\u201329.  Sen. Hubert Humphrey was a prominent supporter of the PL-480 concept.</ref><ref>A currency is \"inconvertible\" when the government forbids it to be used to buy foreign exchange, so that it can only be spent in the country that issues it.</ref> Much of PL-480's foreign-currency revenue was returned to developing countries as a supplement to U.S. development assistance.  PL-480 revenues in the first twenty years were sometimes huge and although PL-480 has become smaller it continues to provide resources to USAID for nutrition and disaster relief programs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Food Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/food-assistance|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=2017}}</ref>\n \nSecond, several factors arose that favored large-scale economic assistance to developing countries, especially in Asia. [[South Korea]] needed massive economic assistance after an armistice was finally signed in July 1953,<ref>Mason, Kim ''et al''. (1980), chapter 6.</ref> and U.S. economic assistance to South Vietnam increased after the retreat of France in 1954.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 259\u2013260.</ref>  On a global scale, the Cold War after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 evolved in the direction of rivalry over influence in low-income countries who were seeking financing for their development initiatives. India was a particular case of a country where the U.S. felt it needed to provide economic assistance to balance the USSR's influence, even though India was not a U.S. military ally.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>  These considerations led to advocacy of expanded economic assistance by several voices within the Eisenhower administration: the FOA Director, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen; C.D. Jackson, from the Time-Life publishing business (who draw on advice from MIT economists Millikan and Rostow); the State Department; and the National Security Council.\n \nAs a result, the USG took several steps in the course of 1954 and 1955 to raise the profile of development assistance.\n\nIn June 1954, the USG raised the ExIm Bank's lending authority from $4.5 billion to $5 billion.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 32.</ref>  Pres.

See Ruttan (1996), pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Personnel changes soon reflected this change in the administration's view: Christian Herter succeeded Herbert Hoover Jr. as Under Secretary of State in February 1957, Robert Anderson succeeded George Humphrey as Treasury Secretary in July 1957, and James H.

Eisenhower summarized the conclusions in his May 21, 1957 message to Congress: \"This past year ... Congressional Committees, the Executive Branch and distinguished private citizens have just examined these programs anew. ... I recommend the following legislative actions: ... economic development assistance should be provided primarily through loans, on a continuing basis, and related closely to technical assistance. ... I recommend a clear separation of military and defense support assistance on the one hand, from economic development assistance on the other. ... I recommend that longterm [sic] development assistance be provided from a Development Loan Fund. ... Such loans should not compete with or replace such existing sources of credit as private investors, the International Bank [the World Bank], or the Export-Import Bank. ... I believe the Fund should be established and administered in the International Cooperation Administration. ... The technical cooperation program is one of the most valuable elements of our entire mutual security effort. It also should be continued on a long-term basis and must be closely related to the work of the Fund.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Mutual Security Programs |date=May 21, 1957 |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-mutual-security-programs |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC-\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n \nAs a result, the Development Loan Fund was established in August 1957.

Eisenhower's years in office from 1953 to 1961 rose from 2,839 to 6,387.<ref name=\"USAID 1976\">Data from USAID, \"Distribution of Personnel as of June 30, 1949 thru 1976.\"</ref>\n\n==== Multilateral Initiatives ====\n\nAs the U.S. expanded its development-assistance efforts in the course of the 1950s, other industrial countries were recovering economically from World War II and were increasingly able to engage in development assistance.  The U.S. supported their involvement through several multilateral initiatives.\n\nThree of these initiatives expanded World Bank facilities.\n\nIn November 1954, the U.S. decided to endorse the World Bank's proposed International Finance Corporation, which would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 46\u201349.</ref> The IFC was finally established in 1956.\n\nWith Senator [[Mike Monroney]] playing a prominent role, Congress approved in July 1958 another new World Bank facility, the International Development Association (IDA).  Funded by grants from industrialized countries, the IDA would make low-interest credits to developing countries for projects like public works.  The IDA formally came into being in September 1960, with the U.S. contributing 42% of its initial resources.<ref>Mason, Edward; Asher, Robert (1973). ''The World Bank Since Bretton Woods''. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution. pp. 381\u2013389.</ref><ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/ida-articlesofagreement.pdf International Development Association. \"Articles of Agreement, Schedule A\"]\nIDA-articlesofagreement.pdf.

P, & Webb, R. Charles. (1997). ''The World Bank : its first half century'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution), p. 929.</ref>\n\nWhile the U.S. supported expanded World Bank facilities, it did not support the proposal for a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED). The UN did create a \"Special Fund\" in 1957, but it was limited to designing projects for the UN's technical assistance program, EPTA, and could not finance public works.<ref>Jolly ''et al.'' (2004), pp. 73\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also adopted a regional initiative with [[Latin America]].  Through most of the 1950s, the U.S. concentrated on technical assistance in the region.  Financial assistance sources were limited to the Eximbank and the World Bank, with the U.S. opposing proposals for a regional development bank.  However, events in 1958 \u2014 notably a riot during Vice President Nixon's visit to [[Caracas, Venezuela]] in May 1958 \u2014 resulted in a reversal of the U.S. position in August 1958.  With U.S. support, the Organization of American States created in April 1959 the Inter-American Development Bank, most of whose capital was contributed by the borrowing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 161-162.</ref>\n\nTo further engage other wealthy countries in development assistance, the USG supported the creation of the Aid India Consortium in August 1958. This was the first of several informal groupings of donors focussing on particular countries.\n\nThe USG also supported the Organization of European Economic Co-operation (the European Marshall Plan organization) in creating a Development Assistance Group in January 1960.<ref>{{cite web |last1=OECD |title=DAC in Dates: The History of OECD's Development Assistance Committee |url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896808.pdf |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=2006}} As the organization broadened its membership and became the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]) in 1961, the Development Assistance Group was re-named the [[Development Assistance Committee]], or DAC.</ref>\n\n=== Creation of USAID and the Development Decade ===\nAt the end of the 1950s, the momentum in favor of development assistance\u2014as represented by PL-480, new mechanisms for financial assistance, larger U.S. budgets and staffing, and multilateral initiatives\u2014picked up support from Senator John F. Kennedy, who was preparing to be a candidate for the presidency. In 1957, JFK proposed, in bipartisan collaboration with Sen. John Sherman Cooper (a former U.S. Ambassador to India), a major expansion of U.S. economic support for India. As a candidate in 1960, he supported the emphasis on humanitarian goals for PL-480 set by Sen. Hubert Humphrey's \"Food for Peace\" Act of 1959<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 156\u2013159.</ref> and supported the idea of a [[Peace Corps]] that was under development thanks to the initiatives of Sen. Humphrey, Rep. Reuss, and Sen. Neuberger.  {{Crossreference| (See the \"History\" section of [[Peace Corps]].)}}<ref>Until 1973, USAID and its predecessors also supported [[International Voluntary Services]], which was founded in 1953.

On March 22, he sent a special message to Congress on foreign aid, asserting that the 1960s should be a \"Decade of Development\" and proposing to unify U.S. development assistance administration into a single agency.  He sent a proposed \"Act for International Development\" to Congress in May and the resulting \"Foreign Assistance Act\" was approved in September, repealing the Mutual Security Act.  In November, Pres. Kennedy signed the act and issued an Executive Order tasking the Secretary of State to create, within the State Department, the \"Agency for International Development\" (or A.I.D.: subsequently re-branded as USAID),<ref>The names of predecessor agencies often continued in popular usage.  In Vietnam in the 1960s, it was common to refer to A.I.D.'s office as \"USOM,\" while in Peru A.I.D. telephone operators continued in the 1960s to answer calls saying \"Punto Cuatro\" (Point Four).</ref> as the successor to both ICA and the Development Loan Fund.<ref>In 1966, the UN would also integrate its EPTA and the Special Fund into a new agency, the UN Development Program, or UNDP.</ref>\n\nWith these actions, the U.S. created a permanent agency working with administrative autonomy under the policy guidance of the State Department to implement, through resident field missions, a global program of both technical and financial development assistance for low-income countries. This structure has continued to date.<ref>The Fulbright educational and cultural exchange program was also strengthened by the Fulbright-Hays Act in September 1961.</ref>\n\nTaking this momentum onto the world stage via an address to the UN General Assembly in September 1961, Pres. Kennedy called for a \"United Nations Decade of Development.\" This initiative was endorsed by a General Assembly resolution in December, establishing the concepts of development and development assistance as global priorities.\n\n=== \"New Directions\" in the 1970s ===\nIn the late 1960s, foreign aid became one of the focal points in Legislative-Executive differences over the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Ruttan (1996). pp. 107\u2013108.</ref>  In September 1970, [[Richard M.

Specifically, USAID's budget would be reformed to account for expenditures for each of these Basic Human Needs, a system referred to as \"functional accounts.\" (Previously, budgets had been divided between categories such as \"development loans, technical assistance, [[Alliance for Progress]] [for Latin America], loans and grants, and population.\")<ref>Ruttan (1996).  pp. 94, 98\u2013100, 543 fn. 2.</ref> The new system was based on a proposal developed by a bipartisan group of House members and staff working with USAID management and outside advisors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=177\u2013179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pastor|first1=Robert A.|title=Congress and the Politics of U.S. Foreign Economic Policy 1929\u20131976|date=1980|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-520-03904-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/congresspolitics0000past/page/278 278\u2013279]|url=https://archive.org/details/congresspolitics0000past/page/278}}</ref> President Nixon signed the New Directions act into law (PL 93-189) in December 1973.\n\nAlso in 1973, the \"Percy Amendment\" of the Foreign Assistance Act required U.S. development assistance to integrate women into its programs, leading to USAID's creation of its Women in Development (WID) office in 1974. However, the [[Helms Amendment]] of 1973 banned use of U.S. Government funds for abortion as a method of family planning, which effectively required USAID to eliminate all support for abortion.<ref name=\"usaidweb1\">USAID Public website [http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html USAID's Family Planning Guiding Principles and U.S. Legislative and Policy Requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329101241/http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html |date=2013-03-29 }} Retrieved September 10, 2012</ref>\n\nA further amendment of the Foreign Assistance Act in 1974 prohibited assistance for police, thus ending USAID's involvement in Public Safety programs in Latin America, which in the 1960s were, along with the Vietnam War, part of the U.S. Government's anti-Communist strategy.\n\nThe reforms also ended the practice of the 1960s and 1970s in which many USAID officers in Latin America and Southeast Asia had worked in joint offices led by State Department diplomats or in units with U.S. military personnel.\n\nThe Basic Human Needs reforms largely cut off USAID's assistance to higher education.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guither |first1=Harold D. |title=The Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger Amendment: Issues and Compromises in International Development Policymaking |journal=Illinois Agricultural Economics |date=July 1977 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.2307/1348954 |jstor=1348954 }}</ref><ref>See also Congressional Research Service (1981), material found via search string \"higher education\".</ref>  A large part of that assistance had gone to agricultural universities in hungry developing countries, as illustrated by a 1974 book by a University of Illinois professor, Hadley Read, describing USAID-supported U.S. land-grant universities' work in building India's agricultural universities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Read |first1=Hadley |title=Partners With India: Building Agricultural Universities |date=1974 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana-Champaign}}</ref> Read's book inspired an Illinois Member of Congress concerned with famine prevention, Paul Findley, to draft a bill authorizing more support for programs like the ones Read described.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Findley |first1=Paul |title=Interview with Paul Findley: Transcript |url=https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/general/Documents/FindleyPaul/Findley_Pau_4FNL.pdf |publisher=Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library |accessdate=13 June 2018 |pages=158\u2013161 |date=2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115133153/https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/general/Documents/FindleyPaul/Findley_Pau_4FNL.pdf |archive-date=2017-11-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a legislative process involving USAID staff, the association of state universities and land-grant colleges (NASULGC), and Sen.

Title XII created the [[Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD)]], with seven members representing U.S. universities and agricultural technology institutions who advise USAID on Title XII implementation.\n\nThe impact of all these actions of the early 1970s on the overall scale of U.S. development assistance is indicated by the change in the number of U.S. staff in field missions.  In 1969, the year when Pres. Nixon took office, the number was already decreasing from its Vietnam War high of 8,717 and had reached 7,701.

Once a critical mass of users was reached they would change the content to spark political dissent and mobilize the users into organized political gatherings called 'smart mobs' that would trigger an uprising against the Cuban government.<ref name=\"Associated Press\"/>\n\nThe messaging service was launched in 2010 and gained 40,000 followers at its peak.

After [[Alan Gross]], a development specialist and USAID subcontractor was arrested in Cuba, the US government warned USAID about the safety of covert operatives.

Debates of this kind are arbitrated in Washington by Congress and the Administration before budgets are decided and before USAID staff undertake detailed programming in the field.  The result is normally that USAID's programs in a given country pursue a mix of goals.\n\n===Modes of assistance===\nSome feel that USAID overemphasizes technical assistance and should instead provide more financial assistance (budget support, or debt relief).  They argue that financial assistance allows recipients to spend as they like with less influence from donors.  Others feel that financial assistance does not result in durable improvements and that person-to-person technical assistance has the advantage of sharing knowledge and experience, leading to permanent improvements.\n\nIn practice, many USAID missions find that their counterparts appreciate having both forms of aid: an assistance package that includes some financial assistance for things that can simply be bought and some technical assistance to confront problems and issues whose solutions are not so clear.\n\n===Cost of delivering assistance===\nUSAID is frequently criticized for providing expensive expert services to counterparts.  The majority of the staff that USAID finances are from the country itself, but USAID is also able to recruit internationally when necessary to meet the counterpart's needs.  USAID uses competition to arrive at market rates for the staff it recruits, and has experimented with volunteer programs for expertise from high paid professions.\n\n===Non-career contracts===\nUSAID frequently contracts with private firms or individuals for specialist services lasting from a few weeks to several years.  It has long been asked whether USAID should more often assign such tasks to career U.S. Government employees instead.  USG staff directly performed technical assistance in the earliest days of the program in the 1940s.  However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  By 1955, observers commented on a perceived shift towards more use of shorter-term contracts (rather than using employees with career-length contracts).<ref>See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-government programs===\nIn situations where the U.S. is hostile to the government of a country, USAID may be asked to undertake programs that the government would not accept and thus to operate without the government's knowledge.  This might include USAID support for opposition political movements that seek to remove the government.  Such \"political aid\" is criticized by some as being incompatible with USAID's role as an assistance or cooperation agency and as exposing USAID staff worldwide to the suspicion of being covertly engaged in subversion.  Similarly, USAID's participation in actions against foreign governments led by the U.S. military is criticized by some as inappropriate and as exposing USAID civilian staff to the dangers of military combat.  However, such political aid and joint civilian-military programs are supported by others as necessary to support U.S. geopolitical interests and to build democracy.\n\n===Economic interests===\nUSAID states that \"U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world.\" However, non-government organization watch groups have noted that as much as 40% of aid to Afghanistan has found its way back to donor countries through awarding contracts at inflated costs.<ref>Richard Norton-Taylor [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/25/afghanistan.internationalaidanddevelopment1 40% of Afghan aid returns to donor countries, says report] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 March 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough USAID officially selects contractors on a competitive and objective basis, watch dog groups, politicians, foreign governments and corporations have occasionally accused the agency of allowing its bidding process to be unduly influenced by the political and financial interests of its current Presidential administration.

The papers read that although the \"pattern of weak party discipline is found across the political spectrum, it is somewhat less true of parties on the liberal left, such as the [ruling] [[Worker's Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]].\" The papers also expressed a concern about the \"'indigenization' of the conference so that it is not viewed as providing a U.S. perspective.\" The event's main sponsor was the [[International Republican Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u424786.shtml |title=''EUA tentaram influenciar reforma pol\u00edtica do Brasil'' |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2012, [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]] countries (Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia,  Nicaragua, San Vicente y Las Granadinas, Dominica, Antigua y Barbuda) called on its members to expel USAID from their countries.<ref>[http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/7069 ALBA Expels USAID from Member Countries] Retrieved 2012-09-16</ref>\n\n===Influence on the United Nations===\nSeveral studies{{Which|date=April 2016}} suggest that foreign aid is used as a political weapon for the U.S. to elicit desired actions from other nations.
