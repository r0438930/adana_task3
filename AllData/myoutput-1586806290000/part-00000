He called for a nation of laws wherein nothing is outside the law and no one is above the law. He said the security services would be reformed so that no one was spied upon and religion, ideas, and the right to descent would be respected. AMLO called for a true democracy guaranteeing free elections and prison for electoral fraud. He called for an end of corruption and said the law should apply not only to government officials but also to their families. He said he would reform the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]] so that even the [[Desafuero of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador|president could be prosecuted]] for corruption. He called for a [[popular consultation]] process after three years to determine whether the president should be recalled. He insisted that luxuries, such as high salaries for government officials, the presidential airplane and [[Los Pinos|official residence]], bodyguards, and presidential pensions should be cut or eliminated.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/>\n\nAMLO also called for increased attention to the needs of rural communities, revitalization of the construction industry, improvements in the energy sector, pensions for elderly Mexicans, free medicine, and improved education with access for all.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/>\n\n''[[Forbes|Forbes Mexico]],'' in a September 2018 article said that the Fourth Transformation presents an opportunity for Mexico to move forward as a true democracy. It could not depend on one political party and must move beyond campaign slogans. The authors, Nicola Morfini and Bernardo Sainz Mart\u00ednez of the [[Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci\u00f3n de Empresa|Pan American Institute for High Business Management (IPADE)]], argue that Mexico is at a crossroads: the large margin of victory by ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' in the 2018 election makes true change possible while also highlighting the possibility of regression. They warn that if decision-making depends exclusively on [[National Regeneration Movement|National Regeneration Movement (Morena)]], the legislature could lose power as it did under the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)]]. Given the high poverty levels in the country, the authors suggest that popular democracy may be easily manipulated. They point out that many members of Morena were once members of PRI, which should have a moderating effect on political changes. Finally, they conclude that the future of Mexico depends on everyone.<ref>{{cite web|website=Forbes M\u00e9xico|title=L\u00f3pez Obrador hacia la cuarta transformaci\u00f3n|author1= Nicola Morfini|author2= Bernardo Sainz Mart\u00ednez|date=Sep 19, 2018|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020|language=es|trans-title= L\u00f3pez Obrador towards the fourth transformation|url= https://www.forbes.com.mx/lopez-obrador-hacia-la-cuarta-transformacion/}}</ref>\n\n==The first three transformations==\nPresident Lopez Obrador cites three previous periods of transformation in [[history of Mexico]]: the Independence Movement (1810-1821), ''La Reforma'' (1858-1861), and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1917).

In 30 years of rule, Diaz had modernized the country and established a growing economy, but he had done so by granting numerous concessions to British and American investors while denying basic liberties to peasant farmers, miners, and workers. In a bad year, such as 1908\u20131909, the peasants were reduced to virtual slavery. Within six months of Madero's call to arms, Diaz had resigned and the moderate, middle-class Madero became president.<ref name=\"today\">{{cite web|website=History Today.com|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/mexican-revolution|title=The Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, was one of the great revolutionary upheavals of the twentieth century.|author=Alan Knight|date=May 5, 1980 |volume=30|issue=5|accessdate=Jan 23, 2020}}</ref>\n \nMadero's moderate reforms were not satisfactory to peasant leaders such as [[Poncho Villa]] in the north and [[Emiliano Zapata]] in the south.

He called for a nation of laws wherein nothing is outside the law and no one is above the law. He said the security services would be reformed so that no one was spied upon and religion, ideas, and the right to descent would be respected. AMLO called for a true democracy guaranteeing free elections and prison for electoral fraud. He called for an end of corruption and said the law should apply not only to government officials but also to their families. He said he would reform the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]] so that even the [[Desafuero of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador|president could be prosecuted]] for corruption. He called for a [[popular consultation]] process after three years to determine whether the president should be recalled.

The authors, Nicola Morfini and Bernardo Sainz Mart\u00ednez of the [[Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci\u00f3n de Empresa|Pan American Institute for High Business Management (IPADE)]], argue that Mexico is at a crossroads: the large margin of victory by ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' in the 2018 election makes true change possible while also highlighting the possibility of regression. They warn that if decision-making depends exclusively on [[National Regeneration Movement|National Regeneration Movement (Morena)]], the legislature could lose power as it did under the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)]]. Given the high poverty levels in the country, the authors suggest that popular democracy may be easily manipulated. They point out that many members of Morena were once members of PRI, which should have a moderating effect on political changes.
