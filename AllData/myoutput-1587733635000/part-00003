Bacteria can increase in number very quickly, which enables them to [[evolution|evolve]] rapidly. Should some bacteria survive a chemical attack, they give rise to new generations composed completely of bacteria that have resistance to the particular chemical used. Under a sustained chemical attack, the surviving bacteria in successive generations are increasingly resistant to the chemical used, and ultimately the chemical is rendered ineffective. For this reason, some question the wisdom of impregnating cloths, [[cutting board]]s and worktops in the home with [[bactericidal]] chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Types==\n\n===Air disinfectants===\nAir disinfectants are typically chemical substances capable of disinfecting microorganisms suspended in the air. Disinfectants are generally assumed to be limited to use on surfaces, but that is not the case.  In 1928, a study found that airborne microorganisms could be killed using mists of dilute bleach.<ref name=\"bacterialaction\">For a review of the early work in this field, see: {{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson OH, Bigg E, Puck TT, Miller BF |title= The bactericidal action of propylene glycol vapor on microorganisms suspended in air. i |journal= Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=75 |pages=593\u2013610 |date=June 1942  |pmid=19871209 |doi=10.1084/jem.75.6.593 |issue= 6 |pmc= 2135271}}</ref> An air disinfectant must be dispersed either as an [[aerosol]] or [[vapour]]<!--WP:ENGVAR: please WP:RETAIN--> at a sufficient concentration in the air to cause the number of viable infectious microorganisms to be significantly reduced.\n\nIn the 1940s and early 1950s, further studies showed inactivation of diverse [[bacteria]], [[influenza virus]], and ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'' (previously ''P. notatum'') [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] [[fungus]] using various glycols, principally [[propylene glycol]] and [[triethylene glycol]].<ref name=\"bactericidaleffects\">For a review through 1952 see: {{cite journal |vauthors=Lester W, Dunklin E, Robertson OH |title= Bactericidal effects of propylene and triethylene glycol vapors on airborne Escherichia coli |journal= Science |volume=115 |pages=379\u2013382 |date=April 1952 |pmid= 17770126 |doi=10.1126/Science.115.2988.379 |issue= 2988|bibcode=1952Sci...115..379L }}</ref>  In principle, these chemical substances are ideal air disinfectants because they have both high lethality to microorganisms and low mammalian toxicity.<ref name=\"propyleneglycol\">For a review of the toxicity of propylene glycol, see:  {{cite journal |author= United States Environmental Protection Agency |title= Reregistration eligibility decision for propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol |volume= EPA 739-R-06-002 |date=September 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"triethyleneglycol\">For a review of the toxicity of triethylene glycol, see:  {{cite journal |author= United States Environmental Protection Agency |title= Reregistration eligibility decision for triethylene glycol |volume= EPA 739-R-05-002 |date=September 2005}}</ref>\n\nAlthough glycols are effective air disinfectants in controlled laboratory environments, it is more difficult to use them effectively in real-world environments because the disinfection of air is sensitive to continuous action.  Continuous action in real-world environments with outside air exchanges at door, HVAC, and window interfaces, and in the presence of materials that adsorb and remove glycols from the air, poses engineering challenges that are not critical for surface disinfection.

A large number of disinfectants operate in this way. [[Chlorine]] and [[oxygen]] are strong oxidizers, so their compounds figure heavily here.\n\n*[[Electrolyzed water]] or \"Anolyte\" is an oxidizing, acidic hypochlorite solution made by [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium chloride]] into [[sodium hypochlorite]] and hypochlorous acid. Anolyte has an oxidation-reduction potential of +600 to +1200 mV and a typical pH range of 3.5\u2013\u20138.5, but the most potent solution is produced at a controlled pH 5.0\u20136.3 where the predominant oxychlorine species is [[hypochlorous acid]].\n*[[Hydrogen peroxide]] is used in [[hospital]]s to disinfect surfaces and it is used in solution alone or in combination with other chemicals as a high level disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes mixed with [[colloidal silver]]. It is often preferred because it causes far fewer [[allergic]] reactions than alternative disinfectants. Also used in the food packaging industry to disinfect foil containers. A 3% solution is also used as an antiseptic.\n* [[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide|Hydrogen peroxide vapor]] is used as a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|medical sterilant]] and as room disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values - NIOSH Publications and Products |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012820/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is one of the chemicals approved for decontamination of anthrax spores from contaminated buildings, such as occurred during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the U.S. It has also been shown to be effective in removing exotic animal viruses, such as avian influenza and [[Newcastle disease]] from equipment and surfaces.\n* The antimicrobial action of hydrogen peroxide can be enhanced by [[surfactant]]s and organic acids. The resulting chemistry is known as Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide. A 2% solution, stabilized for extended use, achieves high-level disinfection in 5 minutes, and is suitable for disinfecting medical equipment made from hard plastic, such as in [[endoscope]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Omidbakhsh|title= A new peroxide-based flexible endoscope-compatible high-level disinfectant |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages=571\u2013577 |year=2006 | pmid=17097451 |doi= 10.1016/j.ajic.2006.02.003|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  The evidence available suggests that products based on Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide, apart from being good germicides, are safer for humans and benign to the environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sattar|title= A product based on accelerated hydrogen peroxide: Evidence for broad-spectrum activity |journal=Canadian Journal of Infection Control |pages=123\u2013130 |date=Winter 1998 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n*[[Ozone]] is a gas used for disinfecting water, laundry, foods, air, and surfaces. It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid decolorization and deodorization in addition to disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, it is used to remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of [[organochloride]]s if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity. \n*[[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is a purplish-black crystalline powder that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining \"stainless\" steel, which somehow limits its use and makes it necessary to use plastic or glass containers.  It is used to disinfect [[aquarium]]s and is  used in some community swimming pools as a foot disinfectant before entering the pool. Typically, a large shallow basin of KMnO<sub>4</sub> / water solution is kept near the pool ladder. Participants are required to step in the basin and then go into the pool. Additionally, it is widely used to disinfect community water ponds and wells in tropical countries, as well as to disinfect the mouth before pulling out teeth. It can be applied to wounds in dilute solution.\n\n=== Peroxy and peroxo acids ===\n[[Peroxy acid|Peroxycarboxylic acids and inorganic peroxo acids]] are strong oxidants and extremely effective disinfectants.\n\n* [[Peroxyformic acid]]\n* [[Peracetic acid]]\n* [[Peroxypropionic acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxyglutaric acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxysuccinic acid]]\n* [[Peroxybenzoic acid]]\n* [[Peroxyanisic acid]]\n* [[meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|Chloroperbenzoic acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxyphthalic acid]]\n* [[Peroxymonosulfuric acid]]\n\n===Phenolics===\n[[Phenols|Phenolics]] are active ingredients in some household disinfectants.

Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values - NIOSH Publications and Products |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012820/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace.

It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid decolorization and deodorization in addition to disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, it is used to remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of [[organochloride]]s if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity. \n*[[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is a purplish-black crystalline powder that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining \"stainless\" steel, which somehow limits its use and makes it necessary to use plastic or glass containers.  It is used to disinfect [[aquarium]]s and is  used in some community swimming pools as a foot disinfectant before entering the pool.

Phenol is the standard, and the corresponding rating system is called the \"[[Phenol coefficient]]\". The disinfectant to be tested is compared with phenol on a standard microbe (usually ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'' or ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''). Disinfectants that are more effective than phenol have a coefficient &gt; 1. Those that are less effective have a coefficient &lt; 1.\n\nThe standard European approach for disinfectant validation consists of a basic suspension test, a quantitative suspension test (with low and high levels of organic material added to act as \u2018interfering substances\u2019) and a two part simulated-use surface test.<ref name=Sandle>{{cite book | editor = Sandle T | title = The CDC Handbook: A Guide to Cleaning and Disinfecting Cleanrooms  | edition = 1st | publisher = Grosvenor House Publishing Limited | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1781487686}}</ref>\n\nA less specific measurement of effectiveness is the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) classification into either ''high'', ''intermediate'' or ''low'' levels of disinfection. \"High-level disinfection kills all organisms, except high levels of bacterial spores\" and is done with a chemical germicide marketed as a sterilant by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). \"Intermediate-level disinfection kills mycobacteria, most viruses, and bacteria with a chemical germicide registered as a 'tuberculocide' by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The best practice is not to add anything to household bleach except water. As with most disinfectants, the area requiring disinfection should be cleaned before the application of the chlorine bleach, as the presence of organic materials may inactivate chlorine bleach.\n\nThe use of some antimicrobials such as [[triclosan]], is controversial because it may lead to [[antimicrobial resistance]].
