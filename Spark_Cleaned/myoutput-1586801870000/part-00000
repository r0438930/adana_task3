O'Neill''' is an American author and attorney, best known for ''[[Half a Wing, Three Engines and a Prayer]]'', a book about the U.S. Eighth Air Force and [[B-17]] crews and missions in [[World War II]].  He is also the author of ''303rd Bombardment Group'', about the same subject.\n\nBorn into a U.S. Air Force family in 1949, O'Neill's growing up years were spent on many Air Force bases throughout the United States, at a time when piston-engined aircraft a generation or two behind the B-17 were still in wide use.  His Air Force upbringing fostered a lifelong interest in World War II aviation history.  After graduating from the University of Maryland in 1971, O'Neill served with the [[U.S. Navy]] for three years, first as a [[destroyer]] gunnery officer and then as a shipyard repair officer at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.  Upon leaving military service he became an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] and the General Counsel of [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation]], the aviation company that had manufactured the P-40 Warhawk fighter and the [[Wright Cyclone series|Cyclone]] B-17 engines during World War II.  In 2001 O'Neill left corporate life to enter the private practice of law.   As of 2013 he manages a very active immigration and employment law firm based in Morristown, New Jersey.<ref>{{cite book | title=Half a Wing, Three Engines and a Prayer | publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies | author=O'Neill, Brian D. | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-07-134145-5}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Half a Wing, Three Engines and a Prayer]].
