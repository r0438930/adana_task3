[[Horseshoe Southern Indiana]] is the largest employer, followed by [[Tyson Foods]] and the Harrison County Hospital. Tourism plays a significant role in the economy and is centered on the county's many historic sites. County government is divided among several bodies including the boards of the county's three school districts, three elected commissioners who exercise legislative and executive powers, an elected county council that controls the county budget, a circuit and superior court, and township trustees in the county's 12 townships. The county has 10 [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] towns with a total population of over 5,000, as well as many small unincorporated towns. One Interstate highway and one U. S. Route run through the county, as do eight Indiana State Roads and two railroad lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/files/StateTransportationMap.pdf|title=Indiana Transportation Map 2009\u20132010|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|year=2009|format=PDF|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"indiana-railroad-map\">{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/files/MAIN-RR-11_V1.pdf|title=State of Indiana 2011 Rail System Map|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|year=2011|format=PDF|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMigratory groups of Native Americans inhabited the area for thousands of years, but the first permanent settlements in what would become Harrison County were created by American settlers in the years after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The population grew rapidly during first decade of the 19th&nbsp;century. Corydon was officially platted in 1808 and became the capital of the [[Indiana Territory]] in 1813. Many of the state's early important historic events occurred in the county, including the writing of Indiana's first constitution. Corydon was the state capital until 1825, but in the years afterward remained an important hub for southern Indiana.

This region was of particular value to the early humans because of the abundance of [[flint]]. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000&nbsp;BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools.

[[Daniel Boone]] and his brother [[Squire Boone]] were early explorers of the county, entering from Kentucky in the 1780s. [[Harvey Heth]], [[Spier Spencer]], and Edward Smith were among the first to settle in the county beginning in the 1790s.

He died in 1815 and is buried in a cave near his home, [[Squire Boone Caverns]]. James, Isaiah, and Daniel (son of Squire) Boone settled in Harrison County's Heth Township during the first decade of the 1800s.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 6.</ref> The county's first church was built by Boone east of present-day [[Laconia, Indiana|Laconia]].<ref name=d8/> The church, which has been reconstructed, is known as Old Goshen.

A tow-and-ferry line was operated there by the Mauck family bringing settlers into the county from [[Kentucky]]. This road and ferry greatly expanded the county's economic viability and ease of access to the outside world, leading to a rapid settlement of the area. The county's population more than doubled in the following decade.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 7.</ref>\n\n[[Dennis Pennington]], who lived near [[Lanesville, Indiana|Lanesville]], became one of the county's early leading citizens and speaker of the territory's legislature.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 12.</ref> Corydon began competing with other southern Indiana settlements to become the new capital of the territory after its reorganization in 1809. Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May 1, 1813, after Pennington suggested that it would be safer than Vincennes.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 16.</ref> For the next twelve years, Corydon was the political center of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.<ref name=IHI/>\n\nThe first division of the county occurred in 1814 when the northern portion of the county was separated to become Washington County. In 1818 with the western part of the county was partitioned off to become Crawford County.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 124.</ref> In 1819 Floyd County was created out of the eastern part of the county.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 129.</ref> Since that time, Harrison County's eastern border has had minor adjustments through land transactions with Floyd County; the last change occurred in 1968.\n\nThe northern part of the county is known as the barrens, named by the early settlers for its scarce timber. At first, settlers preferred the southern areas where wood was available.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 16.</ref> The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest barren ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The [[Central Barren, Indiana|Central Barren]] covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19th&nbsp;century, settlers found the barrens to be fertile farmland, and they were quickly settled. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20th&nbsp;century the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.<ref>Roose 1911, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nA large [[Meteorite fall|meteorite]] fell near Buena Vista on March 28, 1859.

Confederate artillery returned fire from the opposite shore, and the Legion retreated towards Corydon. The citizens of Mauckport fled the town carrying their valuables.<ref name=f86/> Morgan landed on the east side of Mauckport with two thousand cavalry and marched north burning homes, farms, and mills.<ref name=f86/> The county militia made a stand to block his advance on the county seat and the resulting conflict is known as the [[Battle of Corydon]]. The battle was won by the Confederates and the town of Corydon was then sacked and stores were looted and ransomed. The battle left 4&nbsp;dead, 12&nbsp;wounded, and 355&nbsp;captured.<ref name=f87>Funk 1969, p. 87.</ref> After the battle Morgan continued into northern Harrison County where he looted the New Salisbury area with the main body of troops. Crandall and Palmyra were robbed and sacked by detachments. His forces left the county the following day; they were eventually defeated and captured by Union Army forces.<ref name=f87/>\n[[File:Corydonwarmememorial.jpg|left|thumb|The Harrison County memorial to the county's war casualties]]\n\nThe railroad reached Harrison County in 1869. A line was completed across the northern half of county in 1874 running from Floyd County connecting Crandall and then continuing west into Crawford County.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 11.</ref> A southward extension connecting Corydon to Crandall was completed in 1882. A train wreck killed three in 1902.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 12.</ref> The southern extension connecting Corydon was purchased by the [[Corydon Scenic Railroad Company]] in 1989. It operated as a tourist attraction until its 2003 closing, which ended passenger service in the county.<ref>Longest 2005, p. 91.</ref>\n\nThe first county courthouse was a small log building. When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County Courthouse and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed to make way for a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the [[Indiana first capitol building|first state capitol building]]. The new courthouse was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000.{{#tag:ref|A $250,000 capital expense in 1928 would be roughly equivalent to $14,500,000 in 2010.<ref name=\"Williamson\">Williamson, Samuel H.

The [[Ohio River]] defines the county's southern border; across the river lies the state of [[Kentucky]] and the city of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. The [[Blue River (Indiana)|Blue River]] runs along the county's western border. According to the 2010&nbsp;census, the county has a total area of {{convert|486.52|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|484.52|sqmi}} (or 99.59%) is land and {{convert|2.00|sqmi}} (or 0.41%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n[[Harrison Spring]] is located west of Corydon; it is {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter and is over {{convert|40|ft|m}} deep, making it the largest and deepest spring in Indiana. It rises from a solid rock in a level spot of land, and it outputs enough water to have turned flour mills in the past. Is the largest spring by volume in Indiana producing over 3 million gallons (11 million liters) of water daily. The name recognizes William Henry Harrison, who owned this area.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 23.</ref>\n\nHarrison County is hilly in parts. The [[Knobstone Escarpment]] begins in the southeastern part of the county, rises sharply at the Ohio River, and runs along the eastern edge of the county. The \"knobs\" are the most significant series of hills in Indiana, with the highest knobs near the Ohio River towering {{convert|610|ft|m}} over the surrounding valley.<ref>Logan 1922, p. 90.</ref> This is the greatest local relief difference in the state.<ref>Logan 1922, p. 91.</ref> The Ohio River borders the entire southeastern, southern, and southwestern part of the county.

In 1818 with the western part of the county was partitioned off to become Crawford County.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 124.</ref> In 1819 Floyd County was created out of the eastern part of the county.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 129.</ref> Since that time, Harrison County's eastern border has had minor adjustments through land transactions with Floyd County; the last change occurred in 1968.\n\nThe northern part of the county is known as the barrens, named by the early settlers for its scarce timber. At first, settlers preferred the southern areas where wood was available.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 16.</ref> The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest barren ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The [[Central Barren, Indiana|Central Barren]] covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19th&nbsp;century, settlers found the barrens to be fertile farmland, and they were quickly settled. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20th&nbsp;century the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.<ref>Roose 1911, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nA large [[Meteorite fall|meteorite]] fell near Buena Vista on March 28, 1859.

Confederate artillery returned fire from the opposite shore, and the Legion retreated towards Corydon. The citizens of Mauckport fled the town carrying their valuables.<ref name=f86/> Morgan landed on the east side of Mauckport with two thousand cavalry and marched north burning homes, farms, and mills.<ref name=f86/> The county militia made a stand to block his advance on the county seat and the resulting conflict is known as the [[Battle of Corydon]]. The battle was won by the Confederates and the town of Corydon was then sacked and stores were looted and ransomed. The battle left 4&nbsp;dead, 12&nbsp;wounded, and 355&nbsp;captured.<ref name=f87>Funk 1969, p. 87.</ref> After the battle Morgan continued into northern Harrison County where he looted the New Salisbury area with the main body of troops. Crandall and Palmyra were robbed and sacked by detachments. His forces left the county the following day; they were eventually defeated and captured by Union Army forces.<ref name=f87/>\n[[File:Corydonwarmememorial.jpg|left|thumb|The Harrison County memorial to the county's war casualties]]\n\nThe railroad reached Harrison County in 1869. A line was completed across the northern half of county in 1874 running from Floyd County connecting Crandall and then continuing west into Crawford County.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 11.</ref> A southward extension connecting Corydon to Crandall was completed in 1882. A train wreck killed three in 1902.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 12.</ref> The southern extension connecting Corydon was purchased by the [[Corydon Scenic Railroad Company]] in 1989. It operated as a tourist attraction until its 2003 closing, which ended passenger service in the county.<ref>Longest 2005, p. 91.</ref>\n\nThe first county courthouse was a small log building. When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County Courthouse and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed to make way for a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the [[Indiana first capitol building|first state capitol building]]. The new courthouse was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000.{{#tag:ref|A $250,000 capital expense in 1928 would be roughly equivalent to $14,500,000 in 2010.<ref name=\"Williamson\">Williamson, Samuel H.

The [[Ohio River]] defines the county's southern border; across the river lies the state of [[Kentucky]] and the city of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. The [[Blue River (Indiana)|Blue River]] runs along the county's western border. According to the 2010&nbsp;census, the county has a total area of {{convert|486.52|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|484.52|sqmi}} (or 99.59%) is land and {{convert|2.00|sqmi}} (or 0.41%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n[[Harrison Spring]] is located west of Corydon; it is {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter and is over {{convert|40|ft|m}} deep, making it the largest and deepest spring in Indiana. It rises from a solid rock in a level spot of land, and it outputs enough water to have turned flour mills in the past. Is the largest spring by volume in Indiana producing over 3 million gallons (11 million liters) of water daily. The name recognizes William Henry Harrison, who owned this area.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 23.</ref>\n\nHarrison County is hilly in parts. The [[Knobstone Escarpment]] begins in the southeastern part of the county, rises sharply at the Ohio River, and runs along the eastern edge of the county. The \"knobs\" are the most significant series of hills in Indiana, with the highest knobs near the Ohio River towering {{convert|610|ft|m}} over the surrounding valley.<ref>Logan 1922, p. 90.</ref> This is the greatest local relief difference in the state.<ref>Logan 1922, p. 91.</ref> The Ohio River borders the entire southeastern, southern, and southwestern part of the county. Blue River forms the western border with Indian Creek and Buck Creek as the primary internal drainage systems.\n\nThe western part of the county is preserved as the [[Harrison-Crawford State Forest]] and the [[O'Bannon Woods State Park]]. The county has extensive cave systems including Squire Boone Caverns, the Binkley Cave System ([[Indiana Caverns]]) and smaller, highly decorated caves such as Jewel Box and Devil's Graveyard caves.\n\n==Adjacent counties==\n*[[Crawford County, Indiana|Crawford County]] (west)\n*[[Floyd County, Indiana|Floyd County]] (east)\n*[[Hardin County, Kentucky]] (southeast)\n*[[Jefferson County, Kentucky]] (southeast)\n*[[Meade County, Kentucky]] (south)\n*[[Washington County, Indiana|Washington County]] (north)\n\n===Towns and incorporated communities===\n{{col div|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]]\n*[[Crandall, Indiana|Crandall]]\n*[[Elizabeth, Indiana|Elizabeth]]\n*[[Laconia, Indiana|Laconia]]\n*[[Lanesville, Indiana|Lanesville]]\n*[[Mauckport, Indiana|Mauckport]]\n*[[Milltown, Indiana|Milltown]]\n*[[New Amsterdam, Indiana|New Amsterdam]]\n*[[New Middletown, Indiana|New Middletown]]\n*[[Palmyra, Indiana|Palmyra]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n{{col div|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Bradford, Indiana|Bradford]]\n*[[Breckenridge, Indiana|Breckenridge]]\n*[[Bridgeport, Harrison County, Indiana|Bridgeport]]\n*[[Buena Vista, Harrison County, Indiana|Buena Vista]]\n*[[Byrneville, Indiana|Byrneville]]\n*[[Central, Indiana|Central]]\n*[[Central Barren, Indiana|Central Barren]]\n*[[Corydon Junction, Indiana|Corydon Junction]]\n*[[Davidson, Indiana|Davidson]]\n*[[Depauw, Indiana|Depauw]]\n*[[Dixie, Indiana|Dixie]]\n*[[Dogwood, Indiana|Dogwood]]\n*[[Evans Landing, Indiana|Evans Landing]]\n*[[Fairdale, Indiana|Fairdale]]\n*[[Fishtown, Indiana|Fishtown]]\n*[[Frenchtown, Indiana|Frenchtown]]\n*[[Glidas, Indiana|Glidas]]\n*[[Hancock Chapel, Indiana|Hancock Chapel]]\n*[[Macedonia, Indiana|Macedonia]]\n*[[Moberly, Indiana|Moberly]]\n*[[Mott Station, Indiana|Mott]]\n*[[New Boston, Harrison County, Indiana|New Boston]]\n*[[New Salisbury, Indiana|New Salisbury (Census-designated place)]]\n*[[Ramsey, Indiana|Ramsey]]\n*[[Rosewood, Indiana|Rosewood]]\n*[[Sugar Grove, Indiana|Sugar Grove]]\n*[[Titus, Indiana|Titus]]\n*[[Tobacco Landing, Indiana|Tobacco Landing]]\n*[[Valley City, Indiana|Valley City]]\n*[[White Cloud, Indiana|White Cloud]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Townships===\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Blue River Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Blue River]]\n*[[Boone Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Boone]]\n*[[Franklin Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Franklin]]\n*[[Harrison Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Harrison]]\n*[[Heth Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Heth]]\n*[[Jackson Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Jackson]]\n*[[Morgan Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Morgan]]\n*[[Posey Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Posey]]\n*[[Spencer Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Spencer]]\n*[[Taylor Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Taylor]]\n*[[Washington Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Washington]]\n*[[Webster Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Webster]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Incorporated communities by population===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Town!!Township!!Population!!Founded\n|-\n|[[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]]\n|[[Harrison Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Harrison]]\n|2,715\n|1808\n|-\n|[[Crandall, Indiana|Crandall]]\n|[[Jackson Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Jackson]]\n|131\n|1872\n|-\n|[[Elizabeth, Indiana|Elizabeth]]\n|[[Posey Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Posey]]\n|137\n|1812\n|-\n|[[Laconia, Indiana|Laconia]]\n|[[Boone Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Boone]]\n|29\n|1837\n|-\n|[[Lanesville, Indiana|Lanesville]]\n|[[Franklin Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Franklin]]\n|614\n|1817\n|-\n|[[Mauckport, Indiana|Mauckport]]\n|[[Heth Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Heth]]\n|83\n|1827\n|-\n|[[Milltown, Indiana|Milltown]]\n|[[Blue River Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Blue River]]\n|932*\n|1827\n|-\n|[[New Amsterdam, Indiana|New Amsterdam]]\n|[[Washington Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Washington]]\n|27\n|1815\n|-\n|[[New Middletown, Indiana|New Middletown]]\n|[[Webster Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Webster]]\n|77\n|1860\n|-\n|[[Palmyra, Indiana|Palmyra]]\n|[[Morgan Township, Harrison County, Indiana|Morgan]]\n|930\n|1810\n|}\n\n==Climate and weather==\n{{climate chart\n|[[Corydon, Indiana]]\n|21|41|3.68\n|24|48|3.50\n|33|59|4.79\n|41|69|4.73\n|49|77|5.06\n|59|85|4.80\n|63|88|4.24\n|61|87|3.89\n|53|81|3.56\n|41|70|3.13\n|34|57|4.35\n|25|46|3.99\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIN0133|title=Monthly Averages for Corydon IN|accessdate=January 27, 2011|publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nHarrison County is in the [[humid subtropical climate]] region of the United States along with most of Southern Indiana.
