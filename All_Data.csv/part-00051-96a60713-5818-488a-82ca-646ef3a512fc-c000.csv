'''Hiram Page''' ({{circa}} 1800{{ndash}}August 12, 1852) was an early member of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and one of the [[Eight Witnesses]] to the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon's]] [[golden plates]].

Page was born in [[Vermont]]. Earlier in his life, he studied medicine which he practiced during his travels throughout New York and [[Canada]]. On November 10, 1825, Page married Catherine Whitmer, daughter of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] and [[Mary Whitmer|Mary Musselman]]. The two had nine children together: John, Elizabeth, Philander, Mary, Peter, Nancy, Hiram, Oliver, and Kate.

Page became one of the [[Eight Witnesses]] during June 1829.<ref>[http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/the-testimony-of-eight-witnesses-circa-june–august-1829 Testimony of Eight Witnesses] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120709080112/http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/the-testimony-of-eight-witnesses-circa-june%E2%80%93august-1829 |date=July 9, 2012 }}, The Joseph Smith Papers (accessed May 1, 2012)</ref> He and Catherine were baptized into in the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] (later renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints)<ref name = 1838name1>''Manuscript History of the Church'', LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in Dean C.

Page was living with his in-laws the [[Peter Whitmer Sr.|Whitmers]] in [[Fayette, New York]]. Smith arrived in August 1830 to discover Page using a black \"[[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seerstone]]\" to produce revelations for the church. The revelations were regarding the organization and location of [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. Cowdery and the Whitmer family believed the revelations were authentic. In response, Smith announced in a new revelation during the church's September conference that Page's revelations were of the devil (Doctrine and Covenants, {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 28|verse=11}}). At the conference there was considerable discussion on the topic. Page agreed to discard the stone and the revelations and join in following Smith as the sole [[prophet, seer, and revelator|revelator]] for the church. The members present confirmed this unanimously [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|with a vote]]. The fate of the stone and revelations was not recorded by contemporary sources and has been the subject of interest ever since.<ref name=MacKay2016>{{cite book

In January 1831, Page accompanied [[Lucy Mack Smith]] and a company of saints from [[Waterloo, New York]], to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] on the [[Erie Canal]], on their way to [[Fairport Harbor, Ohio|Fairport]] and [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. In May 1831, Page moved his family to [[Thompson Township, Geauga County, Ohio|Thompson, Ohio]], under [[Lucy Mack Smith]]'s direction. He again moved his family to [[Jackson County, Missouri]], in 1832 and joined the Latter Day Saints gathering there. With the other Whitmers, they formed a cluster of ten or twelve homes called the \"Whitmer Settlement\". Hiram owned {{convert|120|acre|m2}} of land in the area.

During the growing [[anti-Mormon]] hostilities in  Jackson County, Page was severely beaten by a group of non-Mormon vigilantes on October 31, 1833. On July 31 and August 6, 1834, he testified to the facts of the beatings. By 1834, Page and his family were expelled along with the other Latter Day Saints, and lived for a time in neighboring [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], before moving to [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]].

When the members of the Whitmer family were excommunicated from the church in 1838 Page withdrew from church fellowship. <ref>https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/5142/</ref>He later bought a farm in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri|Excelsior Springs]], back in Clay County.

On September 6, 1847, [[William E. McLellin]] baptized Page, [[David Whitmer]], [[John Whitmer]], and [[Jacob Whitmer]] into his newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)]]. McLellin ordained Page a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] in the church. Page participated in the subsequent ordinations of the others.

Page died on his farm in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]], still affirming his testimony of the Book of Mormon. His death was caused when his wagon overturned, crushing him underneath.

'''Daniel Skinner''' was an [[amanuensis]] of [[John Milton]]. He is best known for his role in the posthumous attempts to publish, and then for trying to suppress, several of Milton's State Papers, including ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De Doctrina Christiana]]''.

==Biography==
Skinner is presumed to have been a relative of [[Cyriack Skinner]]. Biographer [[Henry John Todd]] believed him to be probably Cyriack's nephew.<ref name=QuarterlyReview1827 /> He was educated at [[Westminster School]] until 1670,<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> and was a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /><ref name=Sumner1825 /> The College's register records him as ''2 October 1674. Daniel Skinner juratus et admissus in socium minorem.''<ref name=Sumner1825 /><ref name=Campbell2007 /> and as ''May 23d, 1679. Daniel Skinner juratus et admissis in socium majorem.'' These dates, the normal date of admission for major Fellows being July not May and the normal interval between minor and major Fellowship being a year and a half, indicate the extraordinary circumstances that surround Skinner's Fellowship at Trinity.<ref name=Sumner1825 />

Skinner attempted to arrange for the posthumous printing and publication, outside England, of some of Milton's state papers, which were at the time unlikely to be publishable in England.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> In 1675, via Symon Heere, who is presumed to be a Dutch boat skipper, he contacted a printer in Amsterdam, Daniel Elzevir of the [[House of Elzevir]], and attempted to have Elzevir publish Milton's Letters.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /><ref name=Campbell2007 /> However, Elzevir was reluctant to do so, and (as he later reported in a letter, dated 1676-11-20, to Sir [[Joseph Williamson (English politician)|Joseph Williamson]], then Secretary of State) after he had received the manuscripts contacted Skinner in Cambridge to tell him that he was unwilling to publish them, given their contents.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> Elzevir had sent the manuscripts on for review by [[Philipp van Limborch]], at the time a professor at [[Remonstrant College]].<ref name=Campbell2007 />

In the meantime, Skinner was approaching [[Samuel Pepys]], whose resident mistress was Mary Skinner, Daniel's sister, about the possibility of patronage. He wrote an ornate and lengthy letter in Latin, which has since been lost, to Pepys on 1676-07-05, in which he noted that after four years he had still not been fully elected Fellow of Trinity.<ref name=Campbell2007 />

Elzevir reported to Williamson that Skinner came to Amsterdam to retrieve the manuscripts from Elzevir, and told Elzevir that he was glad that Elzevir had not published anything, and that he would have bought up and destroyed all copies if Elzevir had.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> Skinner afterwards stayed out of England, with the manuscripts, but was subjected to official reprimand and recall. [[Isaac Barrow]], Master of Trinity College, wrote to Skinner, ordering him:<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 />
{{quote|text=To repair immediately to the College; no further allowance to discontinue being granted to you: this you are to doe upon penalty of the Statute, which is expulsion from the College if you disobey. We do also warn you, ''that if you shall publish any writing {{sic|mischeivous}} to the Church or State'', you will thence incurre a forfeiture of your interest here. I hope God will give you the wisdom and grace to take warning.|sign=[[Isaac Barrow]]|source=''Life and Writings of John Milton'', [[Henry John Todd]], pp. 297<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 />}}

Skinner followed the order, and in 1679 obtained his major Fellowship.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> In a letter to Williamson, W. Perwich, the government agent who had conveyed Barrow's instruction to Skinner, who at the time was in Paris, records Skinner's reaction to the order thus:<ref name=Sumner1825 />
{{quote|text=I have (delivered) Dr. Barrow's letter to Mr. Skinner, before witnesse, as you desired. I found him much surprised, and yet at the same time slighting any constraining orders from the Superior of his Colledge, or any benefit he expected hence, but as to Milton's Workes he intended to have printed, (though he saith that part which he had in M.S.S. are no wat to be objected ag<sup>t</sup>, either with regard to Royalty and Government) he hath desisted from the causing them to be printed, having left them in Holland, and that he intends, notwithstanding the College summons, to goe for Italy this summer.|sign=W. Perwich|source=Letter to Wm. Bridgman, secretary to the Right Honourable Mr Secretary Williamson, 1677-03-15.<ref name=Sumner1825 />}}

Skinner's supplication for his M.A. and subscription to the Three Articles was done via proxy. His supplicat, in the University Archives, is dated 1677-01-30. At that time, Skinner was still in Paris, and the supplicat itself is signed by the Proctor on his behalf.<ref name=Campbell2007 />

Skinner's return to Trinity College in 1679 follows the calling of his religious beliefs into question. Although the signing of a supplicat implied (at the time) that one intended to be a Protestant; because Skinner's was signed by the Proctor, possibly not with Skinner's authorisation, it is not necessarily the case that Skinner intended to be one. The Master and Senior Fellows of the College, in March of that year, had issued a further order to Skinner, that he \"come home to the College to clear himself of suspicion of being a papist\". What is unusual about this request is that such suspicion usually arose from a person's unwillingness to sign the [[oath of supremacy]], a necessary part of the M.A. degree that in turn was a requirement for Major Fellowship of the College. However, by that point, Skinner had already received his M.A. (almost two years earlier, in 1677). Whatever the difficulty may actually have been, for which documentary evidence does not survive, it was overcome. (Campbell advances the hypothesis that Skinner was elected by Royal Mandate, under the patronage of Williamson, against the opposition of the College Seniors.)<ref name=Campbell2007 />

After becoming a Major Fellow, Skinner once gain left Cambridge. On 1679-06-04 \"Mr Daniel Skinner a protestant\" was issued with a passport. He is identified with the \"young mister Skinner\", discussed in a 1680-07-08 letter by Pepys, who was resident in Barbados and Mevis in 1680&ndash;1681. William Howe, Pepys' correspondent, replied on 1681-06-15 telling Pepys that he had attempted to place Skinner in the employment of Edwin Stede of the [[Royal Africa Company]] upon Skinner's arrival at Barbados, but that Stede declined to employ Skinner. Thereupon Howe placed Skinner with a friend who was a lawyer. Skinner's legal career lasted roughly one week, and had left for Mevis.<ref name=Campbell2007 />

Skinner returned again to Trinity College that same year, and his religious beliefs were still doubted at the college.<ref name=Campbell2007 />

==Writing style==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}
Skinner's writing style, in particular his abilities with Latin, are of particular concern to scholars, in that they shed light on his presumed rôle as amanuensis.

Gordon Campbell observes that the Latin that Skinner used in his letter to Pepys \"contains small touches which would have been condemned by Milton or any purist\", and that Skinner's mistakes \"while fairly rare, seem to point to a limited competence in Latin rather than carelessness\". Campbell notes that Skinner's occasional slips in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew render suspect the oft-made assertion that Skinner was one of Milton's pupils; pointing out that whilst the Latin of Picard's portion of ''De doctrina Christiana'' is \"virtually perfect\", Skinner's chapters of the same contain \"a light sprinkling of errors\".

'''Daniel Skinner''' was an [[amanuensis]] of [[John Milton]]. He is best known for his role in the posthumous attempts to publish, and then for trying to suppress, several of Milton's State Papers, including ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De Doctrina Christiana]]''.

==Biography==
Skinner is presumed to have been a relative of [[Cyriack Skinner]]. Biographer [[Henry John Todd]] believed him to be probably Cyriack's nephew.<ref name=QuarterlyReview1827 /> He was educated at [[Westminster School]] until 1670,<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> and was a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /><ref name=Sumner1825 /> The College's register records him as ''2 October 1674. Daniel Skinner juratus et admissus in socium minorem.''<ref name=Sumner1825 /><ref name=Campbell2007 /> and as ''May 23d, 1679. Daniel Skinner juratus et admissis in socium majorem.'' These dates, the normal date of admission for major Fellows being July not May and the normal interval between minor and major Fellowship being a year and a half, indicate the extraordinary circumstances that surround Skinner's Fellowship at Trinity.<ref name=Sumner1825 />

Skinner attempted to arrange for the posthumous printing and publication, outside England, of some of Milton's state papers, which were at the time unlikely to be publishable in England.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> In 1675, via Symon Heere, who is presumed to be a Dutch boat skipper, he contacted a printer in Amsterdam, Daniel Elzevir of the [[House of Elzevir]], and attempted to have Elzevir publish Milton's Letters.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /><ref name=Campbell2007 /> However, Elzevir was reluctant to do so, and (as he later reported in a letter, dated 1676-11-20, to Sir [[Joseph Williamson (English politician)|Joseph Williamson]], then Secretary of State) after he had received the manuscripts contacted Skinner in Cambridge to tell him that he was unwilling to publish them, given their contents.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> Elzevir had sent the manuscripts on for review by [[Philipp van Limborch]], at the time a professor at [[Remonstrant College]].<ref name=Campbell2007 />

In the meantime, Skinner was approaching [[Samuel Pepys]], whose resident mistress was Mary Skinner, Daniel's sister, about the possibility of patronage. He wrote an ornate and lengthy letter in Latin, which has since been lost, to Pepys on 1676-07-05, in which he noted that after four years he had still not been fully elected Fellow of Trinity.<ref name=Campbell2007 />

Elzevir reported to Williamson that Skinner came to Amsterdam to retrieve the manuscripts from Elzevir, and told Elzevir that he was glad that Elzevir had not published anything, and that he would have bought up and destroyed all copies if Elzevir had.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> Skinner afterwards stayed out of England, with the manuscripts, but was subjected to official reprimand and recall. [[Isaac Barrow]], Master of Trinity College, wrote to Skinner, ordering him:<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 />
{{quote|text=To repair immediately to the College; no further allowance to discontinue being granted to you: this you are to doe upon penalty of the Statute, which is expulsion from the College if you disobey. We do also warn you, ''that if you shall publish any writing {{sic|mischeivous}} to the Church or State'', you will thence incurre a forfeiture of your interest here. I hope God will give you the wisdom and grace to take warning.|sign=[[Isaac Barrow]]|source=''Life and Writings of John Milton'', [[Henry John Todd]], pp. 297<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 />}}

Skinner followed the order, and in 1679 obtained his major Fellowship.<ref name=MonthlyReview1827 /> In a letter to Williamson, W. Perwich, the government agent who had conveyed Barrow's instruction to Skinner, who at the time was in Paris, records Skinner's reaction to the order thus:<ref name=Sumner1825 />
{{quote|text=I have (delivered) Dr. Barrow's letter to Mr. Skinner, before witnesse, as you desired. I found him much surprised, and yet at the same time slighting any constraining orders from the Superior of his Colledge, or any benefit he expected hence, but as to Milton's Workes he intended to have printed, (though he saith that part which he had in M.S.S. are no wat to be objected ag<sup>t</sup>, either with regard to Royalty and Government) he hath desisted from the causing them to be printed, having left them in Holland, and that he intends, notwithstanding the College summons, to goe for Italy this summer.|sign=W. Perwich|source=Letter to Wm. Bridgman, secretary to the Right Honourable Mr Secretary Williamson, 1677-03-15.<ref name=Sumner1825 />}}

Skinner's supplication for his M.A. and subscription to the Three Articles was done via proxy. His supplicat, in the University Archives, is dated 1677-01-30. At that time, Skinner was still in Paris, and the supplicat itself is signed by the Proctor on his behalf.<ref name=Campbell2007 />

Skinner's return to Trinity College in 1679 follows the calling of his religious beliefs into question. Although the signing of a supplicat implied (at the time) that one intended to be a Protestant; because Skinner's was signed by the Proctor, possibly not with Skinner's authorisation, it is not necessarily the case that Skinner intended to be one. The Master and Senior Fellows of the College, in March of that year, had issued a further order to Skinner, that he \"come home to the College to clear himself of suspicion of being a papist\". What is unusual about this request is that such suspicion usually arose from a person's unwillingness to sign the [[oath of supremacy]], a necessary part of the M.A. degree that in turn was a requirement for Major Fellowship of the College. However, by that point, Skinner had already received his M.A. (almost two years earlier, in 1677). Whatever the difficulty may actually have been, for which documentary evidence does not survive, it was overcome. (Campbell advances the hypothesis that Skinner was elected by Royal Mandate, under the patronage of Williamson, against the opposition of the College Seniors.)<ref name=Campbell2007 />

After becoming a Major Fellow, Skinner once gain left Cambridge. On 1679-06-04 \"Mr Daniel Skinner a protestant\" was issued with a passport. He is identified with the \"young mister Skinner\", discussed in a 1680-07-08 letter by Pepys, who was resident in Barbados and Mevis in 1680&ndash;1681. William Howe, Pepys' correspondent, replied on 1681-06-15 telling Pepys that he had attempted to place Skinner in the employment of Edwin Stede of the [[Royal Africa Company]] upon Skinner's arrival at Barbados, but that Stede declined to employ Skinner. Thereupon Howe placed Skinner with a friend who was a lawyer. Skinner's legal career lasted roughly one week, and had left for Mevis.<ref name=Campbell2007 />

Skinner returned again to Trinity College that same year, and his religious beliefs were still doubted at the college.<ref name=Campbell2007 />

==Writing style==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}
Skinner's writing style, in particular his abilities with Latin, are of particular concern to scholars, in that they shed light on his presumed rôle as amanuensis.

Gordon Campbell observes that the Latin that Skinner used in his letter to Pepys \"contains small touches which would have been condemned by Milton or any purist\", and that Skinner's mistakes \"while fairly rare, seem to point to a limited competence in Latin rather than carelessness\". Campbell notes that Skinner's occasional slips in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew render suspect the oft-made assertion that Skinner was one of Milton's pupils; pointing out that whilst the Latin of Picard's portion of ''De doctrina Christiana'' is \"virtually perfect\", Skinner's chapters of the same contain \"a light sprinkling of errors\". (Dr Charles Richard Sumner records 27 errors in Skinner's work, but only four in Picard's, which is longer than Skinner's.)<ref name=Campbell2007 />

\"'''Bisclavret'''\" (\"The Werewolf\") is one of the twelve [[The Lais of Marie de France|Lais]] of [[Marie de France]] written in the 12th century. Originally written in French, it tells the story of a [[werewolf]] who is trapped in lupine form by the treachery of his wife. The tale was popular and was reworked as ''[[Melion|The Lay of Melion]]'', and is probably referenced in Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' with the tale of Sir Marrok, who has a similar story.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scudder|first=Vida|title=Le Morte D'Arthur of Sir Thomas Malory & its Sources|year=1917|publisher=E.P.

==Background==
Marie de France claimed that she translated this lay, as well as the other eleven she wrote, from the Breton language, in which she claimed to have heard them performed.<ref>David, Alfred and James Simpson, ed. ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume A.'' New York: W. W. Norton, 2006. 141.

==Synopsis==
Bisclavret, a baron in [[Brittany]] who is well loved by the king, vanishes every week for three full days. No one in his household, not even his wife, knows where he goes. His wife finally begs him to tell her his secret and he explains that he is a werewolf. He also says that while in werewolf form he needs to [[Shapeshifting#Needed items|hide his clothing in a safe place so he can return to human form]]. The baron's wife is so shocked by this news that she tries to think of ways she can escape her husband. She no longer wants to \"lie beside him any more\".<ref>Black, Joseph. \"Bisclavret.\" ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature. 2nd ed. Vol. 1.'' Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2009. 183. Print.</ref> She conspires with a knight who has loved her for a long time. The following week, the baron's wife sends the knight to steal her husband's clothing. When her husband fails to return, she marries the knight. The baron's people search for him but finally relent, feeling that their absentee ruler has left for good.

A year later, the king goes hunting and his dogs corner Bisclavret, now fixed in wolf form. As soon as he sees the king, Bisclavret runs to him to beg for mercy by taking the king's stirrup and kissing his foot and leg. This behavior so astounds the king that he has his companions drive back the dogs and everyone marvels at the wolf's nobility and gentleness. The king takes Bisclavret, still in wolf form, back to the castle to live with him.

The knight who had married Bisclavret's wife is invited to the castle for a celebration along with all the other barons. As soon as Bisclavret sees the man he attacks him. The king calls to Bisclavret and threatens him with his staff. Because the wolf had never acted so violently before, all in the court think that the knight must somehow have wronged him. Soon after, the king visits the area where the baron used to live and brings the werewolf along with him. Bisclavret's wife learns of the king's arrival and takes many gifts for him. When Bisclavret sees his former wife, none can restrain him. He attacks her, tearing off her nose.

A wise man points out that the wolf had never acted so before and that this woman was the wife of the knight whom Bisclavret had recently attacked. The wise man also tells the king that this woman is the former wife of the missing baron. The king has the wife questioned under torture. She confesses all and yields up the stolen clothing. The king's men put the clothing before the wolf, but he ignores it. The wise man advises them to take the wolf and the clothing into a bedchamber and let Bisclavret change in privacy. Bisclavret does so and when the king sees again his beloved baron, he runs to him and embraces him, giving him many kisses. The king restores Bisclavret's lands to him and exiles the baroness and her knight. Many of the wife's female progeny were afterwards born without noses and all of her children were \"quite recognizable in face and appearance.\"<ref>Black, Joseph. \"Bisclavret.\" ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature. 2nd ed. Vol. 1.'' Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2009. 188. Print.</ref>

==The word \"Bisclavret\"==

In the first part of the poem, Marie de France seems to use the Norman French word for werewolf, ''garwaf'', interchangeably with the Breton term, ''bisclavret''.<ref name=Sconduto>Sconduto, Leslie A. ''Metamorphoses of the Werewolf: A Literary Study from Antiquity through the Renaissance.'' Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2008. 40. Print.</ref> However, she draws a distinction between ordinary werewolves and Bisclavret. One scholar specifies three evidences for this. \"First, [Marie de France's] statement implies that he is unlike the violent werewolves that she has just described; second, her use of the definite article combined with the fact that Bisclavret is capitalized also implies that he is unique, that he is perhaps the only Bisclavret. Finally it is also noteworthy that Marie uses the term \"garwalf\" when describing the traditional werewolf. She thus once again distinguishes it from Bisclavret.\"<ref name=Sconduto />

''Bisclavret'' was translated into [[Old Norse]] as ''Bisclaretz ljóð'', one of the ''[[Strengleikar]]''.<ref>''Strengleikar: An Old Norse Translation of Twenty-one Old French Lais'', ed. and trans. by Robert Cook and Mattias Tveitane, Norrøne tekster, 3 (Oslo: Norsk historisk kjeldeskrift-institutt, 1979).</ref> Circulating in Iceland, it was much adapted, becoming ''[[Tiódels saga]]''.<ref>''Tiodielis saga'', ed. by Tove Hown Ohlsson, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar í íslenskum fræðum.

Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari, Lieutenant Rocha and the station's [[Shuttlecraft (Star Trek)|shuttlecraft]] are missing. While searching the station, the away team finds the dog that belongs to Lieutenant Uhnari. The away team also finds a substance on the floor, which ''Enterprise'' Chief Medical Officer [[Beverly Crusher|Dr. Crusher]] determines is a type of cellular residue.

The crew uncover evidence that a Klingon had been on the station leading Crusher and First Officer [[William Riker|Riker]] to suspect that Uhnari and Rocha may have been the victims of a Klingon attack. Commander [[Geordi La Forge|La Forge]] backs up this theory when he examines Uhnari's personal logs. He finds an entry in which Aquiel relays her fears to her sister Shianna about a Klingon named Morag. Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] contacts the local Klingon governor, Torak, and learns that Morag is commander of one of the Klingon ships that patrols that section of the Klingon Empire's border. At this point, Torak refuses to cooperate further. Picard threatens to take his case to Chancellor [[Gowron]], a threat scoffed at by Torak until Picard casually mentions that he served as Gowron's Arbiter of Succession.<ref group=\"note\">See the episodes \"[[Reunion (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Reunion]]\" and \"[[Redemption (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Redemption]]\".</ref> Knowing Gowron would be in Picard's debt and how the former might frown upon the disrespect shown to the latter, a nervous Torak agrees to cooperate fully.

The senior staff meets with Torak, and he produces Aquiel alive. She explains that Rocha attacked her and that her last memory was escaping from him. She doesn't remember precisely what happened. To help clarify what really occurred, Picard requests to speak with Commander Morag, the Klingon who was allegedly harassing the station. Attracted to her, La Forge befriends Aquiel, and takes her to the [[Ten-Forward]] lounge. He reveals to her that he surveyed her logs and personal correspondence as part of their investigation. Aquiel says she didn't like Rocha but did not wish to hurt him. She realizes she is a suspect in his death.

Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher continues to examine the cellular residue found on the deckplate. Riker and Lt. [[Worf]], who are examining the shuttlecraft, come across a [[Weapons in Star Trek#Phaser|phaser]] set to kill. La Forge gives moral support to Aquiel as she is questioned again.

Commander Morag then arrives aboard the ''Enterprise'' and meets with the senior staff. He admits that he was present on the station, and that he took priority [[Starfleet]] messages from its computer. La Forge returns to the station and discovers that Rocha's personal log has been tampered with. He confronts Aquiel who admits deleting messages from Rocha's log, because Rocha, as the senior officer, was going to declare her insubordinate and belligerent to Starfleet. Scared that this new evidence will condemn her as Rocha's killer, she agrees to stay aboard the ''Enterprise'' because La Forge has faith in her. He and Aquiel use an ancient method of her people to bond and share their thoughts.

While Dr. Crusher examines the DNA found on the deck plate yet again, the material moves and touches her hand. It then withdraws and forms a perfect replica of her hand. Due to this, she suspects that the real Rocha may have been killed by this strange coalescent organism, and a replica of him may have attacked Aquiel in search of a new body. Believing that the organism now has Aquiel's body, Riker and Worf race to Aquiel's quarters and stop the ritual she is conducting with La Forge, believing she was about to attack him. Morag is also arrested, as it is just as likely he is the organism.

With Aquiel and Morag in the brig, the ''Enterprise'' proceeds to the nearest starbase as the crew keep a close watch on them both - the organism may need a new body soon. La Forge is in his quarters along with Aquiel's dog reminiscing about her. The dog transforms and attacks him, but he is able to kill it. Later, he explains to Aquiel, who has been released, that Rocha was replaced by the organism. When it attacked her, it began the takeover process (hence her lapse in memory); however, she managed to get away in time. The creature then turned to the only other life form on the station, her dog.

The episode ends with Aquiel and La Forge in Ten-Forward, where she turns down his offer to help her join the Enterprise crew. She tells him she wants to earn her way there on her own merits.

Montepulciano d'Abruzzo was first classified as ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) in 1968. The ''Colline Teramane'' subzone, established in 1995 as a DOC in the [[province of Teramo]], was promoted to separate ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata e Garantita]]'' (DOCG) status in 2003 and is now known as ''Colline Teramane Montepulciano d'Abruzzo''.<ref name=\"Saunders\">P.

[[File:Regione Abruzzo Mappa.png|left|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Abruzzo]] region and its four provinces where Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is produced.]]
The DOC region for Montepulciano d'Abruzzo covers a vast expanse of land in the Abruzzo region between the [[Apennines]] foothills down to the [[Adriatic coast]].<ref name=\"Clarke encyclopedia\"/> The region is one of Italy's most mountainous with more than 65% of all Abruzzo being considered mountainous terrain, reaching up to {{convert|2750|m|sigfig=2}} above sea level. The hillside vineyards, particularly in the northern areas, are planted on [[calcareous]] [[clay]] and benefit from warm and significant sun exposure, ventilated by dry breezes from the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref name=\"Dummies\">M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 188-190 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}</ref>

Several subzones have been defined in the DOC rules that delineate small areas producing higher quality wines, and impose stricter requirements. These are Alto Tirino, Casauria, Teate, Terre dei Peligni, and Terre dei Vestini.<ref name=\"iwc\">{{Cite web

Montepulciano is produced in all four provinces of Abruzzo—[[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]], [[Province of Pescara|Pescara]] and [[Province of Teramo|Teramo]]—with the southern fertile province of Chieti producing the largest total quantity of wine.

The mountainous province of L'Aquila is noted mainly for the dry ''[[rosé|rosato]]'' wine labeled as ''[[#Cerasuolo |Cerasuolo]]'' and now a separate DOC. The most favorable vineyards are planted in the northern provinces of Pescara and Teramo, the latter now a separate DOCG designation.<ref name=\"Dummies\" /> These northern provinces benefit from having less fertile soils with more [[ferrous]] clay and [[limestone]], and higher elevations as the Apennines draw closer to the Adriatic. This creates cooler [[micro-climates (wine)|micro-climates]] that tend to produce more concentrated wines.<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\" />

In 2014 there were approximately {{convert|8718|ha}} planted in the DOC producing {{convert|857500|hl}} of wine, with more than two thirds of it being produced in the [[province of Chieti|Chieti province]].<ref name=\"iwc\"/><ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/>

==DOC requirements==

[[File:Montepulciano d'abruzzo wine.jpg|right|thumb|A Montepulciano d'Abruzzo wine labelled as being made from old vines.]]
Under Italian [[wine laws]], a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo DOC wine must be composed of a minimum of 85% Montepulciano with up to 15% of Sangiovese permitted to fill out the remainder of the wine. Grapes are [[harvest (wine)|harvest]]ed to a [[yield (wine)|yield]] no greater than 14 [[tonnes]] per [[hectare]].<ref name=\"Saunders\"/> The wine must be aged for a minimum of 5 months prior to release, and bottles labeled ''Riserva'' must be aged at least two years, including a minimum of 9 months in wood [[barrel]]s. Additionally, the alcohol level must be no lower than 12%, or 12.5% for ''Riserva''.<ref name=\"iwc\"/>

The DOC subzones have stricter requirements: a higher proportion of Montepulciano, higher minimum alcohol levels, lower cropping yields and longer ageing. For instance, the ''Casauria'' subzone requires wine made only from 100% Montepulciano, a 13% minimum alcohol level (13.5% for ''Riserva''), and 18 months aging (24 for ''Riserva'') including a minimum of 9 months in barrels.<ref name=\"iwc\"/>

The lighter ''rosato'' style wine previously covered by this DOC was separated in 2010 into a new DOC called [[Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo]].

===Colline Teramane DOCG===

Within the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo DOC region is the smaller Colline Teramane ([[Teramo]] hills) DOCG that is produced in the [[province of Teramo]] from vineyards planted in [[Teramo]] and 30 surrounding communes. Established first as a DOC in 1995, the region was promoted to DOCG status in 2003.<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/> The regulations for the wine are similar to Montepulciano d'Abruzzo except that the wine needs to be made from a minimum of 90% Montepulciano with a maximum of 10% Sangiovese permitted.<ref name=\"Dummies\"/>

==Wine styles==

[[File:Montepulciano d Abruzzo bruschetta.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is often paired with food.]]
According to wine expert [[Oz Clarke]], Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is often a [[deeply colored wine]] with pepper and spice notes. It can be described as \"rustic\" which Clarke says is less pronounced when the [[wine is paired with food]].<ref name=\"Clarke encyclopedia\">O. Clarke ''Oz Clarke's Encyclopedia of Wine'' pg 251 Time Warner Books, London 2003 {{ISBN|0-316-72654-0}}</ref> [[Master of Wine]] [[Mary Ewing-Mulligan]] describes the wines as [[aromatic (wine)|aromatic]], [[tannic (wine)|tannic]] and with low [[acidity (wine)|acidity]].<ref name=\"Dummies\"/> According to Italian wine expert [[Joe Bastianich]], Montepulciano d'Abruzzo's can be highly aromatic with earthy notes and black berries and have inky-purple color with a thick, almost syrupy [[mouthfeel]].<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/>


===Cerasuolo===
<!--linked section: redirect \"Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo\"-->
[[File:Montepulciano_d'Abruzzo_Cerasuolo_2007.jpg | thumb | Cerasuolo, a rosato (rosé) wine made from Montepulciano ]]
A separate DOC since 2010, the [[rosé]] (''rosato'') style of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is labeled as ''Cerasuolo'' which means \"cherry-red\" and relates to the deep color the wine gets even with very brief [[maceration (wine)|skin-contact]] with the highly pigmented skins of the Montepulciano grape. According to Bastianich, Cerasuolo tend to be medium-bodied and rather hearty for an Italian ''rosato'' with aromas of orange peel, [[cinnamon]], strawberry and dried cherries.<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/>
In 2010 the DOC classification was created for the wine, now known as [[Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo]].<ref name=\"ws-cerasuolo-abruzzo\">{{Cite web|publisher=[[Wine-Searcher]]|url=https://www.wine-searcher.com/regions-cerasuolo+d'abruzzo|title=Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo Wine|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> The term ''Cerasuolo'' can also refer to [[Cerasuolo di Vittoria]], an unrelated [[DOCG]] dry red wine from [[Sicily]] made from [[Nero d'Avola]] and [[Frappato]].<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[Wine-Searcher]]|url=https://www.wine-searcher.com/regions-cerasuolo+di+vittoria|title=Cerasuolo di Vittoria wine|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>

Montepulciano d'Abruzzo was first classified as ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) in 1968. The ''Colline Teramane'' subzone, established in 1995 as a DOC in the [[province of Teramo]], was promoted to separate ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata e Garantita]]'' (DOCG) status in 2003 and is now known as ''Colline Teramane Montepulciano d'Abruzzo''.<ref name=\"Saunders\">P.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as one of the most widely exported DOC wines in Italy.<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/>
It is typically [[dry wine|dry]] with soft [[tannins (wine)|tannins]] and often [[consumed young (wine)|consumed young]].

In addition to Montepulciano, up to 15% Sangiovese is permitted in the blend. Wines aged by the maker for more than two years may be labeled ''Riserva''.<ref name=\"Robinson pg 212\">Robinson, Jancis,  ''Vines, Grapes & Wines'', p.212, Mitchell Beazley 1986, {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}</ref>

==Wine region==

[[File:Regione Abruzzo Mappa.png|left|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Abruzzo]] region and its four provinces where Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is produced.]]
The DOC region for Montepulciano d'Abruzzo covers a vast expanse of land in the Abruzzo region between the [[Apennines]] foothills down to the [[Adriatic coast]].<ref name=\"Clarke encyclopedia\"/> The region is one of Italy's most mountainous with more than 65% of all Abruzzo being considered mountainous terrain, reaching up to {{convert|2750|m|sigfig=2}} above sea level. The hillside vineyards, particularly in the northern areas, are planted on [[calcareous]] [[clay]] and benefit from warm and significant sun exposure, ventilated by dry breezes from the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref name=\"Dummies\">M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 188-190 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}</ref>

Several subzones have been defined in the DOC rules that delineate small areas producing higher quality wines, and impose stricter requirements. These are Alto Tirino, Casauria, Teate, Terre dei Peligni, and Terre dei Vestini.<ref name=\"iwc\">{{Cite web

Montepulciano is produced in all four provinces of Abruzzo—[[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]], [[Province of Pescara|Pescara]] and [[Province of Teramo|Teramo]]—with the southern fertile province of Chieti producing the largest total quantity of wine. The mountainous province of L'Aquila is noted mainly for the dry ''[[rosé|rosato]]'' wine labeled as ''[[#Cerasuolo |Cerasuolo]]'' and now a separate DOC. The most favorable vineyards are planted in the northern provinces of Pescara and Teramo, the latter now a separate DOCG designation.<ref name=\"Dummies\"/> These northern provinces benefit from having less fertile soils with more [[ferrous]] clay and [[limestone]], and higher elevations as the Apennines draw closer to the Adriatic. This creates cooler [[micro-climates (wine)|micro-climates]] that tend to produce more concentrated wines.<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/>

In 2014 there were approximately {{convert|8718|ha}} planted in the DOC producing {{convert|857500|hl}} of wine, with more than two thirds of it being produced in the [[province of Chieti|Chieti province]].<ref name=\"iwc\"/><ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/>

==DOC requirements==

[[File:Montepulciano d'abruzzo wine.jpg|right|thumb|A Montepulciano d'Abruzzo wine labelled as being made from old vines.]]
Under Italian [[wine laws]], a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo DOC wine must be composed of a minimum of 85% Montepulciano with up to 15% of Sangiovese permitted to fill out the remainder of the wine. Grapes are [[harvest (wine)|harvest]]ed to a [[yield (wine)|yield]] no greater than 14 [[tonnes]] per [[hectare]].<ref name=\"Saunders\"/> The wine must be aged for a minimum of 5 months prior to release, and bottles labeled ''Riserva'' must be aged at least two years, including a minimum of 9 months in wood [[barrel]]s. Additionally, the alcohol level must be no lower than 12%, or 12.5% for ''Riserva''.<ref name=\"iwc\"/>

The DOC subzones have stricter requirements: a higher proportion of Montepulciano, higher minimum alcohol levels, lower cropping yields and longer ageing. For instance, the ''Casauria'' subzone requires wine made only from 100% Montepulciano, a 13% minimum alcohol level (13.5% for ''Riserva''), and 18 months aging (24 for ''Riserva'') including a minimum of 9 months in barrels.<ref name=\"iwc\"/>

The lighter ''rosato'' style wine previously covered by this DOC was separated in 2010 into a new DOC called [[Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo]].

===Colline Teramane DOCG===

Within the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo DOC region is the smaller Colline Teramane ([[Teramo]] hills) DOCG that is produced in the [[province of Teramo]] from vineyards planted in [[Teramo]] and 30 surrounding communes. Established first as a DOC in 1995, the region was promoted to DOCG status in 2003.<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/> The regulations for the wine are similar to Montepulciano d'Abruzzo except that the wine needs to be made from a minimum of 90% Montepulciano with a maximum of 10% Sangiovese permitted.<ref name=\"Dummies\"/>

==Wine styles==

[[File:Montepulciano d Abruzzo bruschetta.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is often paired with food.]]
According to wine expert [[Oz Clarke]], Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is often a [[deeply colored wine]] with pepper and spice notes. It can be described as \"rustic\" which Clarke says is less pronounced when the [[wine is paired with food]].<ref name=\"Clarke encyclopedia\">O. Clarke ''Oz Clarke's Encyclopedia of Wine'' pg 251 Time Warner Books, London 2003 {{ISBN|0-316-72654-0}}</ref> [[Master of Wine]] [[Mary Ewing-Mulligan]] describes the wines as [[aromatic (wine)|aromatic]], [[tannic (wine)|tannic]] and with low [[acidity (wine)|acidity]].<ref name=\"Dummies\"/> According to Italian wine expert [[Joe Bastianich]], Montepulciano d'Abruzzo's can be highly aromatic with earthy notes and black berries and have inky-purple color with a thick, almost syrupy [[mouthfeel]].<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/>


===Cerasuolo===
<!--linked section: redirect \"Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo\"-->
[[File:Montepulciano_d'Abruzzo_Cerasuolo_2007.jpg | thumb | Cerasuolo, a rosato (rosé) wine made from Montepulciano ]]
A separate DOC since 2010, the [[rosé]] (''rosato'') style of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is labeled as ''Cerasuolo'' which means \"cherry-red\" and relates to the deep color the wine gets even with very brief [[maceration (wine)|skin-contact]] with the highly pigmented skins of the Montepulciano grape. According to Bastianich, Cerasuolo tend to be medium-bodied and rather hearty for an Italian ''rosato'' with aromas of orange peel, [[cinnamon]], strawberry and dried cherries.<ref name=\"Vino Italiano\"/>
In 2010 the DOC classification was created for the wine, now known as [[Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo]].<ref name=\"ws-cerasuolo-abruzzo\">{{Cite web|publisher=[[Wine-Searcher]]|url=https://www.wine-searcher.com/regions-cerasuolo+d'abruzzo|title=Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo Wine|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> The term ''Cerasuolo'' can also refer to [[Cerasuolo di Vittoria]], an unrelated [[DOCG]] dry red wine from [[Sicily]] made from [[Nero d'Avola]] and [[Frappato]].<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[Wine-Searcher]]|url=https://www.wine-searcher.com/regions-cerasuolo+di+vittoria|title=Cerasuolo di Vittoria wine|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>

'''Giles Martin''' (born 9 October 1969) is an English record producer, songwriter, composer and multi-instrumentalist. His studio recordings, stage shows, TV and film works have been critically acclaimed and commercially successful around the globe. He is the son of [[The Beatles|Beatles]] producer [[George Martin]] and half-brother of actor [[Gregory Paul Martin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/30/books.guardianreview1|title=Sounds and vision|first=Mark|last=Espiner|work =The Guardian|location=London|date=27 November 2001}}</ref>

==Education==
Martin was educated at [[Stowe School]],<ref name=Stowe>{{cite web|url=https://www.stowe.co.uk/getmedia/93b1ccaf-186b-4c6f-9a3a-578cbef46b1e/The_Column_Issue7|title=The Column - Issue 7 (page 11 - Giles Martin)|work=[[Stowe School]], Buckinghamshire|date=2008|accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> a boarding [[independent school]] in the [[civil parish]] of [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], leaving its boarding house, Lyttelton, in 1988,<ref name=Stowe/> followed by the [[University of Manchester]].

==Life and career==
Giles Martin grew up without much awareness of [[The Beatles]], and was discouraged by his father from pursuing a career in music lest the inevitable comparisons should be made between father and son.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} However, Giles carried on, first playing in the band Velvet Jones, then writing [[jingle]]s in college. In 1995, he was appointed music co-director for the television and radio music countdown show, ''[[The Great Music Experience]]''. He worked on the [[Party at the Palace]] concert to celebrate [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Golden Jubilee]], for which he also produced the subsequent album and DVD.

In 2004 he produced [[Hayley Westenra]]'s multi-platinum album ''[[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]]'', the UK's fastest-selling [[European classical music|classical]] album of all time. Other acts Martin produced include [[Kula Shaker]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[INXS]], and [[Kate Bush]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 2006 Martin collaborated with his father to remix, rearrange, and recombine the music of the Beatles into a soundscape for ''[[Love (Cirque du Soleil)|Love]]'', a theatrical production of [[Cirque du Soleil]], which opened at [[The Mirage]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. His use of digital music production and manipulation techniques allowed him to create ''Love'''s musical [[Mashup (music)|mash-ups]] which he updated in 2016 for the show's 10th Anniversary. He produced the music for the final Broadway performance of ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and worked with [[Martin Scorsese]] on his [[George Harrison]] film documentary ''[[George Harrison: Living in the Material World|Living in the Material World]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  Further film collaboration includes working with [[Ron Howard]] on his Beatles documentary feature ''[[Eight Days A Week]]'' and the British action franchise [[Kingsman (franchise)|''Kingsman'']]. Martin was music director for the [[Elton John]] bio-pic ''[[Rocketman (film)|Rocketman]]''.

In 2009 Martin returned to the Beatles' catalogue with ''[[The Beatles: Rock Band]]'', a video game that allows players to simulate performing Beatles songs with plastic instruments. Martin produced the title's music, cleaning and reworking the audio to suit the game's mechanics. In 2013, Martin produced tracks and served as executive producer on [[Paul McCartney|Paul McCartney's]] ''[[New (album)|New]]'' album. He was the producer in charge of the 50th anniversary Beatles remix/deluxe reissue packages of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', [[The Beatles (album)|the White Album]], and ''[[Abbey Road]]'', released respectively in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

Martin has served as Head of Sound Experience since 2014 at [[Sonos]] Inc., a company that builds wireless home audio systems. In late 2018, Martin was appointed as Head of Audio & Sound of the [[Universal Music Group]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/universal-music-group-appoints-giles-martin-head-audio-sound/|title=Universal Music Group Appoints Giles Martin as Head of Audio & Sound - UMG|date=22 October 2018|work=UMG|access-date=25 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The role was specifically created for Martin where he is based at UMG's [[Abbey Road Studios]].

==Personal life==

Since 2016, the party is part of the [[PDP–Laban|PDP-LABAN]]-led coalition in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], the [[Coalition for Change (Philippines)|Coalition for Change]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/135104-national-unity-party-nup-signs-agreement-pdp-laban|title=NUP seals alliance with PDP-Laban|work=Rappler|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/788816/nup-dutertes-pdp-laban-formalize-alliance|title=NUP, Duterte’s PDP-Laban formalize alliance|last=Ager|first=Maila|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en}}</ref>

'''Samuel Emery Chamberlain''' (November 27, 1829 – November 10, 1908) was an American soldier, painter, and author who traveled throughout the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] and [[Mexico]] during the mid-19th century.

==Early life==

Chamberlain was born in [[Center Harbor, New Hampshire]], to Ephraim Chamberlain<ref>Massachusetts, Town and Vital Records, 1620-1988</ref> and soon afterward moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he spent most of his childhood. In 1844, at age 15, he left home without permission to go to [[Illinois]]. Two years later he joined the 2nd Illinois Volunteer Regiment and headed to [[Republic of Texas|Texas]] to participate in the [[Mexican–American War]]. In [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Chamberlain joined the [[regular army]] and became part of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st U.S. Dragoons]]. He fought at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] in February 1847 as well as several other operations in Mexico. In 1849, he was declared a [[desertion|deserter]] and by 1854 he had returned home to Boston to raise a family. He married Mary Keith on July 4, 1855, and they had three children.<ref name=tsha/> 

By his own account, Chamberlain was also involved in some less savory aspects of the Texas–Mexico border disputes. Most notably, he rode for a time with the infamous Glanton gang under the command of [[John Glanton]], which was contracted by Mexican authorities to track and kill hostile [[Apache]]s following the war. The gang became notorious for taking [[scalping|scalps]] under highly questionable circumstances to claim the bounties, and its members were eventually declared outlaws by the Mexican government. Chamberlain's memoirs regarding this period are the only known primary source attesting to the existence of the [[Texian]] known as [[Judge Holden]], Glanton's second-in-command. While Chamberlain and some others escaped, Glanton and a number of his gang were massacred by [[Quechan|Yuma]] Indians near what is now [[Yuma, Arizona]], in April 1850.

==Civil War==

During the [[American Civil War]], after being chief of staff to Brigadier General [[William W. Averell]] and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] of the [[1st Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry|1st Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment]], Chamberlain commanded Camp Parole at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], for a time and also commanded the [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry|5th Massachusetts Colored Cavalry]], an all African-American unit, with the rank of colonel. He was wounded on six different occasions during the war.<ref>Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J., ''Civil War High Commands'', p. 169. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}.</ref> On February 24, 1865, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] nominated Chamberlain for the award of the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] brigadier general, [[U.S. Volunteers]], to rank from February 24, 1865, and the [[U.S. Senate]] confirmed the award on March 3.<ref>Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 742</ref> Chamberlain was mustered out of the U.S. Volunteers on September 16, 1865.<ref>Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 169</ref>

==Later life==

After the war, Chamberlain was a warden of state prisons in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]].<ref>Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R., ''Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue'', p. 206. Gaithersburg, MD: Olde Soldier Books, Inc., 1990. {{ISBN|1-56013-002-4}}.</ref> Settling in Massachusetts with his family, Chamberlain became well-known for his charming paintings, which consist largely of [[landscape]]s and battle scenes depicting the Mexican–American War. A large collection is held at the [[San Jacinto Museum of History]].

Chamberlain also authored and illustrated a harrowing autobiographical account of his travels during the 1840s, especially his service in the Mexican–American War and his adventures with the Glanton gang, entitled ''My Confession: The Recollections of a Rogue'', which he wrote between 1855 and 1861. Though many of its stories are exaggerated in the romantic literary style popular at the time, research has corroborated most of them as true. Noted for its authentic descriptions of the experiences of the typical American soldier during the Mexican–American War, Chamberlain's account continues to serve as a valuable primary source text for historians studying the war and the era as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1094401.My_Confession|title=My Confession: Recollections of a Rogue by Samuel E.

Chamberlain died on November 10, 1908 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], and was buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].<ref name=tsha>Goetzmann, William H., [https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fchah CHAMBERLAIN, SAMUEL EMERY], Texas State Historical Association</ref>

[[File:Advance to Myitkyina 21 April - 3 August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Advance to Myitkyina]]

The '''Siege of Myitkyina''' was an engagement during the [[Burma Campaign]] of [[World War II]].  The Allied victory was part of the larger [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|operation of North Burma & Yunnan]] which succeeded in opening the [[Ledo Road]].

==Background==
[[Joseph Stilwell]] intended to make a rapid march against Myitkyina prophesying it to be a \"feat which will live in military history\", wanting the town for the nearby airstrip, strategically vital to the campaign as it would be an invaluable source of supplies and aerial support in the notoriously difficult jungle fighting in the China-Burma-India theater. Chinese Expeditionary Force commander Wei Lihuang also played a fundamental role in striking the Imperial Japanese Army. Sun li-Jen, as the second commander of the new Chinese 1st Army,  one of the best of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. The 1st Army has since changed their equipment from old, unsuitable-for-combat caps into US-supplied M1 helmets, and had exchanged their bolt-action Type Zhongzheng rifles for newer American and British weaponry. In addition to that, the Chinese Expeditionary Force (CEF) had finally received artillery and air support from the US and British forces as well, giving them a distinct advantage against the now-malnourished, low-morale Japanese forces around Myitkyina. The US and British played a relatively minor role during the battle, although they also had combat units, such as the famed 'Merrill's Marauders', active in the fighting.

==Siege==
Stilwell gave the Chinese 22nd Division orders to advance against the bridges held by the Japanese on March 15. After two months of fighting, Myitkyina was now in reach. With the arrival of the rainy season, the incessant rain didn't stop until May 17. On that day, at 10:00&nbsp;p.m., the Chinese Expeditionary Force launched an attack with the U.S. Army's 'Merrill's Marauders' unit against the Japanese airstrip at Myitkyina, supported by artillery. Eight Japanese planes were quickly destroyed as the battle escalated. The Japanese were caught by surprise, and, not knowing where their enemies were, poured gasoline onto the airfield in an attempt to disable it and retreated into Myitkyina proper, intending to fight the Chinese and Americans on more favorable terms there. The Chinese and the Americans quickly overran the field relatively intact, whereupon U.S. Army Air Forces  and Royal Air Force C-47 transport aircraft moved the Chinese 89th Regiment of the 30th Division to the battlefield to supplement the exhausted C.E.F. and Marauder units already at Myitkyina.

Afterward, some Chinese units attacked the town itself, but the attack was soon called off when two Chinese battalions, in the confusion and excitement of the battle, mistakenly engaged each other in a fierce firefight, and when two other battalions were moved in, they too repeated the mistake.

A stalemate ensued throughout June, but the [[Battle of Mogaung|capture of Mogaung]] by the British [[Chindits]] under [[Mike Calvert]] later that month was the beginning of the end for the Japanese garrison at Myitkyina. With supply lines cut, infighting grew between the two local Japanese commanders over their orders regarding the defence of the town. Stillwell had demanded that the Chindits join them but they were whittled down by disease and combat. Stillwell nevertheless was reinforced by the arrival of elements of [[Francis Festing]]'s [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Division]] from 15 July Myitkyina airfield. On hearing of the weakening Japanese garrison in Myitkyina, Stillwell sent that Division not to take Myitkyina but to advance on the 'Railway Corridor' from Mogaung towards [[Indaw]] on the right flank of [[Northern Combat Area Command|NCAC]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pitt |first1=Barrie |editor1-last=Hart |editor1-first=Basil Henry Liddell |title=History of the Second World War, Volume 6 History of the Second World War |date=1966 |publisher=Purnell |page=2584 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VZhd6Wyp9jUC&q=}}</ref>

On 26 Jul, the American 3rd Battalion of the Marauders made a significant gain by capturing the northern air field at Myitkyina and over the next week Japanese resistance was noticeably weaker.<ref>{{cite book |last1=United States Department of State |title=Newsletter |date=1961 |publisher=Bureau of Administration |page=13 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3ZyHm0bkYy4C&dq=}}</ref>

On August 3, General Genzo Mizukami ordered the town abandoned and took his life in a literal compliance to \"defend Myitkyina to the death\" as the Chinese and US forces gradually cleared the city and the surrounding area of Japanese troops.<ref>[http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/M/y/Myitkyina.htm Pacific War Online]</ref>

==Aftermath==
The operations against Myitkyina was particularly hard on the Chinese Expeditionary Force, due to the hard fighting, lack of supplies, difficult terrain, and disease. Owing to excessive casualties, the unit effectively ceased to exist as a fighting force and was therefore disbanded. The long-awaited taking of Myitkyina and its airfield allowed for the opening of the [[Ledo Road]], connecting the old [[Burma Road]] with China. The Chinese forces' casualties were the highest among all the battles during the Chinese-intervention of Burma Campaign.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Advance to Myitkyina 21 April - 3 August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Advance to Myitkyina]]

The '''Siege of Myitkyina''' was an engagement during the [[Burma Campaign]] of [[World War II]].  The Allied victory was part of the larger [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|operation of North Burma & Yunnan]] which succeeded in opening the [[Ledo Road]].

==Background==
[[Joseph Stilwell]] intended to make a rapid march against Myitkyina prophesying it to be a \"feat which will live in military history\", wanting the town for the nearby airstrip, strategically vital to the campaign as it would be an invaluable source of supplies and aerial support in the notoriously difficult jungle fighting in the China-Burma-India theater. Chinese Expeditionary Force commander Wei Lihuang also played a fundamental role in striking the Imperial Japanese Army. Sun li-Jen, as the second commander of the new Chinese 1st Army,  one of the best of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. The 1st Army has since changed their equipment from old, unsuitable-for-combat caps into US-supplied M1 helmets, and had exchanged their bolt-action Type Zhongzheng rifles for newer American and British weaponry. In addition to that, the Chinese Expeditionary Force (CEF) had finally received artillery and air support from the US and British forces as well, giving them a distinct advantage against the now-malnourished, low-morale Japanese forces around Myitkyina. The US and British played a relatively minor role during the battle, although they also had combat units, such as the famed 'Merrill's Marauders', active in the fighting.

==Siege==
Stilwell gave the Chinese 22nd Division orders to advance against the bridges held by the Japanese on March 15. After two months of fighting, Myitkyina was now in reach. With the arrival of the rainy season, the incessant rain didn't stop until May 17. On that day, at 10:00&nbsp;p.m., the Chinese Expeditionary Force launched an attack with the U.S. Army's 'Merrill's Marauders' unit against the Japanese airstrip at Myitkyina, supported by artillery. Eight Japanese planes were quickly destroyed as the battle escalated. The Japanese were caught by surprise, and, not knowing where their enemies were, poured gasoline onto the airfield in an attempt to disable it and retreated into Myitkyina proper, intending to fight the Chinese and Americans on more favorable terms there. The Chinese and the Americans quickly overran the field relatively intact, whereupon U.S. Army Air Forces  and Royal Air Force C-47 transport aircraft moved the Chinese 89th Regiment of the 30th Division to the battlefield to supplement the exhausted C.E.F. and Marauder units already at Myitkyina.

Afterward, some Chinese units attacked the town itself, but the attack was soon called off when two Chinese battalions, in the confusion and excitement of the battle, mistakenly engaged each other in a fierce firefight, and when two other battalions were moved in, they too repeated the mistake.

A stalemate ensued throughout June, but the capture of [[Mogaung]] by the British [[Chindits]] under [[Mike Calvert]] later that month was the beginning of the end for the Japanese garrison at Myitkyina. With supply lines cut, infighting grew between the two local Japanese commanders over their orders regarding the defence of the town. Stillwell had demanded that the Chindits join them but they were whittled down by disease and combat. Stillwell nevertheless was reinforced by the arrival of elements of [[Francis Festing]]'s [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Division]] from 15 July Myitkyina airfield. On hearing of the weakening Japanese garrison in Myitkyina, Stillwell sent that Division not to take Myitkyina but to advance on the 'Railway Corridor' from Mogaung towards [[Indaw]] on the right flank of [[Northern Combat Area Command|NCAC]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pitt |first1=Barrie |editor1-last=Hart |editor1-first=Basil Henry Liddell |title=History of the Second World War, Volume 6 History of the Second World War |date=1966 |publisher=Purnell |page=2584 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VZhd6Wyp9jUC&q=}}</ref>

On 26 Jul, the American 3rd Battalion of the Marauders made a significant gain by capturing the northern air field at Myitkyina and over the next week Japanese resistance was noticeably weaker.<ref>{{cite book |last1=United States Department of State |title=Newsletter |date=1961 |publisher=Bureau of Administration |page=13 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3ZyHm0bkYy4C&dq=}}</ref>

On August 3, General Genzo Mizukami ordered the town abandoned and took his life in a literal compliance to \"defend Myitkyina to the death\" as the Chinese and US forces gradually cleared the city and the surrounding area of Japanese troops.<ref>[http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/M/y/Myitkyina.htm Pacific War Online]</ref>

==Aftermath==
The operations against Myitkyina was particularly hard on the Chinese Expeditionary Force, due to the hard fighting, lack of supplies, difficult terrain, and disease. Owing to excessive casualties, the unit effectively ceased to exist as a fighting force and was therefore disbanded. The long-awaited taking of Myitkyina and its airfield allowed for the opening of the [[Ledo Road]], connecting the old [[Burma Road]] with China. The Chinese forces' casualties were the highest among all the battles during the Chinese-intervention of Burma Campaign.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], which are part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller highland valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Fort Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain ridgeline in the southernmost end of the vallet and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. 

==Roads and Gaps==

Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. 

Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.

Roads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.

==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==

The [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. 

The [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.

Fort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)

==History==
According to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] would have made Washington's plans unnecessary.

[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 – 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry.

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], which are part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller highland valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Fort Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain ridgeline in the southernmost end of the vallet and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. 

==Roads and Gaps==

Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. 

Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.

Roads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.

==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==

The [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. 

The [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.

Fort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)

==History==
According to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's plans unnecessary.

[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 – 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>.

'''''This Modern World''''' is a weekly [[satire|satirical]] [[comic strip]] by [[cartoonist]] and political commentator [[Tom Tomorrow]] (real name Dan Perkins) that covers current events from a left-wing point of view.  Tomorrow also runs a weblog that informs readers about stories of interest, often presented as a follow up to his cartoons. ''This Modern World'' appears mainly in alternative weekly newspapers.

==Summary==
Visually ''This Modern World'' draws inspiration from a [[retro]], 1950s sensibility, with brightly colored illustrations that are also inspired by [[clip art]]. Initially, the strip was almost completely composed of actual vintage clip art and magazine cutouts, assembled collage-style and often manipulated and retouched. However, Tomorrow has gradually replaced cutouts with his own drawings, which merely mimic the clip art look. Usually drawn in four panels, it is not uncommon for all panels to be identical or nearly so, with only the dialogue and/or facial expressions changing.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The '50s theme extends to the typically verbose dialogue of his human characters which is often bubbly, over-enthusiastic, and naïve. The stupidity of the humans is countered by Sparky, a fast-talking penguin (although the strip occasionally postulates he is actually an [[auk]]) with a red visor, who provides much of the strip's political commentary.

A recurring theme in the comic books (though far less so in the strips) was that of \"reality engineering\", wherein \"the very fabric of space and time\" is mined for \"the good of mankind\". This periodically generates \"reality discontinuities\", where reality breaks down. These are (generally) resolved by reality engineers.<ref>Tomorrow, Tom. “This Modern World.” Self-Syndicated, 1988.</ref>

==Animation==
From 2000 to 2001, an animated ''This Modern World'' series was produced by Flickerlab for [[Mondo Media]], with [[Bob Harris (writer)|Bob Harris]] as the voice of Sparky. Each episode was approximately five minutes long.

===Crew===
*'''Directed by''' Harold Moss
*'''Writers''': Harold Moss, Tom Tomorrow, Bob Harris
*'''Executive Producer for Mondo Media''': Jan Mallis
*'''Produced by''' Angela Webb
*'''Producer for Mondo Media''': Eileen McKee

*'''Illustrations & Backgrounds''': Antonio Jimenez
*'''Sound Record & Mix''': Tom Lino

==Characters==
The series has been through several incarnations through the years, the first of which appeared in the \"Suburban High Life\" comic books published by [[Slave Labor Graphics|Slave Labor]] in the late 1980s. Characters include:

;Tom Tomorrow (fictional)
In an \"intermediate\" version of the strip, a character ''named'' Tom Tomorrow was in the strip. He was a [[private investigator|private eye]] who was dressed in a [[radiation suit]] so his face was never seen. He was eventually phased out.

;Dippy the Wonder-Penguin
Tom Tomorrow's sidekick. His vocabulary was limited to \"wank\".

;Sparky the Wonder Penguin
A sort of upgraded version of Dippy (who had been phased out by the time of Sparky's introduction), Sparky can actually talk. Similar to Dippy, Spark's first words in the strip are \"George [H. W.] Bush is a '''wanker'''\".  A strong liberal advocate, he briefly became a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] after being hit on the head with a random falling toilet.

;Blinky the Dog
A small dog ([[Boston Terrier]]) who shares some of Sparky's political sympathies. Normally very mellow, he briefly became a radical when steroids were put into his food when he was intended to replace the then-Republican Sparky.

;Bob Friendly
Mr. Friendly is in charge of the advertising section of This Modern World (thus breaking the [[fourth wall]]). It was he who introduced Sparky the Penguin. He appears only occasionally.

;Dr. Wilbur von Philbert
One of the longest-running characters in the strip, Dr. von Philbert is the person who discovered how to mine reality for energy.

;Biff and Wanda
Two blow-dried [[News anchor|anchorpeople]] of the \"Action McNews\", a newscast in which Tomorrow suggests that most [[News program|TV news]] is little more than PR spin. A Biff and Wanda strip almost always ends with a cut to a commercial break (\"Now, these messages!\")

;Biff and Betty
Biff and Betty are two [[archetype]]s of 1950s people, who sometimes share their thoughts on the modern world. Biff often appears alone with Sparky, expressing a naive conservative opinion which invariably prompts an exasperated liberal rebuttal from the penguin.

;Invisible Hand of the Free Market Man
Invisible Hand of the Free Market Man (abbreviated I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man in dialog in the strip) is a [[superhero]] character, wearing what is basically a [[Superman]] costume, with an I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man logo (a hand with the IHOTF in each finger, and M in the palm) where the Superman logo would be.  I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man's head is a giant left hand with facial features in the palm.  I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man is an ardent defender of [[Adam Smith]]'s [[invisible hand]] metaphor, and usually intervenes in situations where the purity of [[free market]] economics is in jeopardy.  His declarations are often based on principles of free market economics taken to their logical extreme.  The first panel of a comic featuring I.H.O.T.F.M-Man is usually a parody of the cover of [[Action Comics 1]].

;Conservative Jones and Moonbat McWacky
Conservative Jones and Moonbat McWacky are two children used in the strip to satirize conservative talking points. Conservative, who is dressed as a detective, asks Moonbat questions about politics. Moonbat gives reasonable answers, which the Conservative turns into illogical statements about liberals.

;Tom Tomorrow
Tom occasionally appears in his own strips, this time as himself (again, breaking the [[fourth wall]]).

;Public figures
All the presidents since [[Ronald Reagan]] have appeared, as well as other political and media figures. [[Rush Limbaugh]] is a favorite caricature subject, although he usually talks through a radio and is not personally shown. (He was once, however, depicted as a pig, in a strip parodying the film ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]''.) Conservative columnist [[Ann Coulter]] is often the target of particularly unflattering caricatures, usually popping up in the middle of a strip to make a typically inflammatory remark, ending with a guttural \"Haw haw haw!\" laugh. In a few strips, [[George W. Bush]] gets hold of what appears to be the [[DeLorean time machine|DeLorean]] from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and goes back in time to meet the [[founding fathers]]. [[Karl Rove]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] make frequent appearances.

;Parallel Earth
The strip occasionally visits a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel Earth]], a deliberate parody of our own world. A \"small cute dog\" was elected as commander-in-chief in their 2000 presidential election, and re-elected in 2004.

;Planet Glox
Actually shown is only a newscast from Glox with two anchor-aliens. Their newscast resembles Fox News, and they report about news strikingly similar to that on earth, but in factual scientific terminology (i.e., [[Coneheads]]-style), thereby making, for example, fun of the public obsession with the sexual activities of public figures by referring to the global importance of touching reproductive organs.

==Other recurring elements==

===Supergiant Conglomerated Corporation===
A fictitious, stereotypical [[big business]] or [[megacorporation]] in an unspecified industry, but appears to represent the [[military-industrial complex]]. This company has been portrayed as being unethical, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], obsessed with [[spin (public relations)|spin]], and environmentally unfriendly. Occasionally written as \"Supergiant Amalgamated Corporation\".

===Action McNews===
The (presumably local) TV news program on which Biff and Wanda are anchors.

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], which are part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller highland valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Fort Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain ridgeline in the southernmost end of the vallet and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. 

==Roads and Gaps==

Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. 

Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.

Roads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.

==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==

The [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. 

The [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.

Fort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)

==History==
According to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] would have made Washington's plans unnecessary.

[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 – 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.

Signal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping, unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The site can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.

The [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], which are part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller highland valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Fort Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain ridgeline in the southernmost end of the vallet and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains.

'''Log pod Mangartom''' ({{IPA-sl|ˈloːk pɔd ˈmaːnɡaɾtɔm|pron}}; sometimes ''Log pod Mangrtom''; {{lang-it|Bretto}};<ref>Flynn, Randall E., & Gerd Quinting. 1983. ''Gazetteer of Yugoslavia: A–L''. Washington, DC: Defense Mapping Agency, p. 73.</ref> {{lang-de|Behrt}}), is a settlement in the [[Municipality of Bovec]] in the [[Slovenian Littoral|Littoral]] region of [[Slovenia]]. It comprises Gornji Log and  Spodnji Log as well as the hamlets Loška Koritnica, Možnica and Pustina.

==Geography==
Log pod Mangartom lies in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Log Koritnica Valley|sl}} ({{lang-sl|Loška Koritnica}}) within [[Triglav National Park]] and is surrounded by 15 peaks with an [[elevation]] of over 2,000 m, giving it a unique atmosphere and making it an attractive starting point for [[hikers]].<ref>[http://www.bovec.si/default.asp?id=56 Bovec municipal site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005215236/http://www.bovec.si/default.asp?id=56 |date=5 October 2011 }}</ref> The Log Cliff ({{lang-sl|Loška stena}}, {{lang-it|Parete di Bretto}}<ref>Buscaini, Gino. 1974. ''Alpi Giulie.'' Milan: Club Alpino Italiano, p. 408.</ref>) rises directly southeast of Log pod Mangartom.<ref>Kladnik, Darinka. 1994. ''Sto slovenskih krajev.'' Ljubljana: Prešernova družba, p. 100.</ref> The road from Bovec to [[Tarvisio]] over the [[Predil Pass]] and the [[Predel Viaduct]] (the viaduct has the longest arch (85 m) in the [[Alps]]) runs through the settlement. Between Gornji Log and Spodnji Log is the entrance to the 4.5&nbsp;km (2.8&nbsp;mi.) {{Interlanguage link multi|Štoln|sl}} drainage tunnel leading through Sheep Mountain ({{lang-sl|Ovčja gora}}) of the [[Kolovrat Range]] to the former lead mine in [[Cave del Predil]], Italy.

==History==
The Štoln Tunnel was opened in 1903 and was used for a railway during World War I.<ref name=\"Savnik\">Savnik, Roman, ed. 1968. ''Krajevni leksikon Slovenije'', vol. 1. Ljubljana: Državna založba Slovenije. pp. 412–413.</ref> It was later used for transport of miners and political refugees escaping from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Communist Yugoslavia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In November 2000, a landslide destroyed a large part of the village and took the lives of seven people.<ref>{{cite news |first=Slavko |last=Šipec |title=Naravne in druge nesreče v Sloveniji leta 2000 |url=http://www.sos112.si/slo/tdocs/ujma/2001/p2_4.pdf |publisher=[[Administration of the Republic of Slovenia for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief]] |journal=UJMA |volume=15 |year=2001 |language=Slovenian |page=29 |trans-title=Natural and Other Disasters and Incidences in Slovenia in 2000 |accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref>

==Church==
The [[parish church]] in the settlement is dedicated to [[Saint Stephen]]. It was built at the end of the 18th century and later rebuilt. Frescos by the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter [[Ivan Grohar]] in the [[sanctuary]] depict the stoning of [[Saint Stephen]]. It also contains a late 15th-century wooden sculpture of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|The Virgin enthroned as Queen]]  and  a [[Baroque painting]] of [[Saint Sebastian]].<ref>[http://www.slovenia.info/en/sakralne-znamenitosti/Cerkev-Sv-%C5%A0tefana-v-Logu-pod-Mangrtom.htm?sakralne_znamenitosti=5042&lng=2   Slovenian Tourist Association site]</ref>

==Mosque==
The town is notable for once being the location of the [[Log pod Mangartom Mosque]], which until 2013 was the only [[mosque]] ever built in Slovenia, erected by [[Bosniak]] [[Muslim]] troops in the service of [[Austria-Hungary]] during [[World War I]]. After the war, the mosque was abandoned and the deteriorating structure was demolished by the local Italian government, which had taken over the area.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Log pod Mangrtom include:
*Zorko Jelinčič (1900–1965), alpinist and journalist<ref name=\"Savnik\"/>
*Ivan Likar (a.k.a. Sočan) (1921–1991), [[Order of the People's Hero|People's Hero of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Savnik\"/>

'''Log pod Mangartom''' ({{IPA-sl|ˈloːk pɔd ˈmaːnɡaɾtɔm|pron}}; sometimes ''Log pod Mangrtom''; {{lang-it|Bretto}}<ref>Flynn, Randall E., & Gerd Quinting. 1983. ''Gazetteer of Yugoslavia: A–L''. Washington, DC: Defense Mapping Agency, p. 73.</ref>; {{lang-de|Behrt}}), is a settlement in the [[Municipality of Bovec]] in the [[Slovenian Littoral|Littoral]] region of [[Slovenia]]. It comprises Gornji Log and  Spodnji Log as well as the hamlets Loška Koritnica, Možnica and Pustina.

==Geography==
Log pod Mangartom lies in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Log Koritnica Valley|sl}} ({{lang-sl|Loška Koritnica}}) within [[Triglav National Park]] and is surrounded by 15 peaks with an [[elevation]] of over 2,000 m, giving it a unique atmosphere and making it an attractive starting point for [[hikers]].<ref>[http://www.bovec.si/default.asp?id=56 Bovec municipal site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005215236/http://www.bovec.si/default.asp?id=56 |date=5 October 2011 }}</ref> The Log Cliff ({{lang-sl|Loška stena}}, {{lang-it|Parete di Bretto}}<ref>Buscaini, Gino. 1974.

==History==
The Štoln Tunnel was opened in 1903 and was used for a railway during World War I.<ref name=\"Savnik\">Savnik, Roman, ed. 1968. ''Krajevni leksikon Slovenije'', vol. 1.

==Church==
The [[parish church]] in the settlement is dedicated to [[Saint Stephen]]. It was built at the end of the 18th century and later rebuilt. Frescos by the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter [[Ivan Grohar]] in the [[sanctuary]] depict the stoning of [[Saint Stephen]]. It also contains a late 15th-century wooden sculpture of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|The Virgin enthroned as Queen]]  and  a [[Baroque painting]] of [[Saint Sebastian]].<ref>[http://www.slovenia.info/en/sakralne-znamenitosti/Cerkev-Sv-%C5%A0tefana-v-Logu-pod-Mangrtom.htm?sakralne_znamenitosti=5042&lng=2   Slovenian Tourist Association site]</ref>

==Mosque==
The town is notable for once being the location of the [[Log pod Mangartom Mosque]], which until 2013 was the only [[mosque]] ever built in Slovenia, erected by [[Bosniak]] [[Muslim]] troops in the service of [[Austria-Hungary]] during [[World War I]]. After the war, the mosque was abandoned and the deteriorating structure was demolished by the local Italian government, which had taken over the area.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Log pod Mangrtom include:
*Zorko Jelinčič (1900–1965), alpinist and journalist<ref name=\"Savnik\"/>
*Ivan Likar (a.k.a. Sočan) (1921–1991), [[Order of the People's Hero|People's Hero of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Savnik\"/>

The '''azimuthal equidistant projection''' is an [[Azimuthal projection#Azimuthal .28projections onto a plane.29|azimuthal map projection]]. It has the useful properties that all points on the map are at proportionally correct distances from the center point, and that all points on the map are at the correct azimuth (direction) from the center point. A useful application for this type of projection is a polar projection which shows all meridians (lines of longitude) as straight, with distances from the pole represented correctly. The [[United Nations flag|flag of the United Nations]] contains an example of a polar azimuthal equidistant projection. This projection is also used by the [[Modern flat Earth societies|Flat Earth Society]] as a main way to visualize the Earth.

== Mathematical definition ==
A point on the globe is chosen as \"the center\" in the sense that mapped distances and [[azimuth]] directions from that point to any other point will be correct. That point, (''φ''{{sub|1}}, ''λ''{{sub|0}}), will project to the center of a circular projection, with ''φ'' referring to latitude and ''λ'' referring to longitude. All points along a given azimuth will project along a straight line from the center, and the angle ''θ'' that the line subtends from the vertical is the azimuth angle. The distance from the center point to another projected point ''ρ'' is the [[arc length]] along a [[great circle]] between them on the globe. By this description, then, the point on the plane specified by (''θ'',''ρ'') will be projected to Cartesian coordinates:
:<math>x = \\rho \\sin \\theta, \\qquad y = -\\rho \\cos \\theta</math>

The relationship between the coordinates (''θ'',''ρ'') of the point on the globe, and its latitude and longitude coordinates (''φ'', ''λ'') is given by the equations:

\\end{align}
</math>

When the center point is the north pole, ''φ''<sub>1</sub> equals <math>\\pi/2</math> and ''λ''{{sub|0}} is arbitrary, so it is most convenient to assign it the value of 0. This assignment significantly simplifies the  equations for ''ρ''<sub>u</sub> and ''θ'' to:
:<math>\\rho = R \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\varphi \\right), \\qquad \\theta = \\lambda~~</math>

== Limitation ==
With the [[Earth's circumference|circumference of the Earth]] being approximately {{convert|40,000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, the maximum distance that can be displayed on an azimuthal equidistant projection map is half the circumference, or about {{convert|20,000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. For distances less than {{convert|10,000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} distortions are minimal. For distances {{convert|10,000|-|15,000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} the distortions are moderate. Distances greater than {{convert|15,000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are severely distorted.

If the azimuthal equidistant projection map is centered about a point whose [[Antipodes|antipodal point]] lies on land and the map is extended to the maximum distance of {{convert|20,000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} the antipode point smears into a large circle. This is shown in the example of two maps centered about [[Los Angeles]], and [[Taipei]]. The antipode for Los Angeles is in the south [[Indian Ocean]] hence there is not much significant distortion of land masses for the Los Angeles centered map except for [[East Africa]] and [[Madagascar]]. On the other hand, Taipei's antipode is near the [[Argentina–Paraguay border]], causing the Taipei centered map to severely distort [[South America]].

== Applications ==
[[File:Gcmsyd.jpg|250px|thumb|left|An azimuthal equidistant projection centered on Sydney]]
Azimuthal equidistant projection maps can be useful in terrestrial [[point to point communication]]. This type of projection allows the operator to easily determine in which direction to point their [[directional antenna]]. The operator simply finds on the map the location of the target transmitter or receiver (i.e. the other antenna being communicated with) and uses the map to determine the [[azimuth|azimuth angle]] needed to point the operator's antenna. The operator would use an [[Antenna rotator|electric rotator]] to point the antenna. The map can also be used in one way communication. For example if the operator is looking to receive signals from a distant radio station, this type of projection could help identify the direction of the distant radio station. In order for the map to be useful, the map should be centered as close as possible about the location of the operator's antenna.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Mr. Mister''' was an American [[pop rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]], active from 1980 until 1990. The band consisted of [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] on lead vocals and bass guitar, [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Steve George]] on keyboards/backing vocals, [[Pat Mastelotto]] on acoustic and electronic drums/percussion and Steve Farris on guitars/backing vocals. Mr. Mister was the successor to the band [[Pages (band)|Pages]], fronted by Page and George from 1978 to 1981.

==Early work==
Although formed in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States,<ref name=oldies>{{cite web|title=Mr. Mister Biography|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Mr-Mister.html|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> Mr. Mister was based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=oldies/> [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] had previously worked as a [[session musician]] (for [[Quincy Jones]]) and had composed for [[Michael Jackson]], [[Rick Springfield]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Al Jarreau]], and many more.

In 1978, Page and his childhood friend [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Steve George]] founded the band [[Pages (band)|Pages]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Pages explored a [[jazz fusion|pop fusion]] sound, with a changing lineup of session musicians. Although Pages had a minor hit single with \"I Do Believe in You\", and its three albums garnered favorable reviews, the group had little commercial success. After disbanding Pages in 1981, Page and George focused on songwriting and studio session work for pop artists ranging from [[Laura Branigan]] to [[Village People]].

By 1982, Page and George began putting together a more pop-oriented group with a permanent lineup, rounded out by drummer [[Pat Mastelotto]] and guitarist Steve Farris. All four members had done extensive session work for other artists and brought numerous influences to the band. The initial plan was to bring in a fifth member, a bass guitarist, but after realizing that Page, who was originally slated to be solely the lead singer, could also play bass, the members decided to remain a four-piece.<ref name= \"History\">{{cite web |author=Dehenau, Peter |url=http://users.skynet.be/sky67891/history.htm| title=History - Mr. Mister |website=Users.skynet.be |accessdate=March 30, 2009}}</ref> And There Is an Actual Child Kyrie Eleison (Kyrie Eleison Sophia Badior) And everyone doesn't know at all!! Please send this out on the News

==Mainstream success==
When the first Mr. Mister album, ''[[I Wear the Face]]'', was released by [[RCA Records]] in 1984, Page was offered the chance to replace [[Bobby Kimball]] as lead singer of [[Toto (band)|Toto]], and later was offered [[Peter Cetera]]'s place in [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]; he refused both offers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Forchhammer, Georg |url=http://www.bluedesert.dk/pageinterview.html |title=Richard Page interview |date=December 1, 2008 |publisher=Blue Desert |accessdate=March 30, 2009}}</ref>

Their second album, 1985's ''[[Welcome to the Real World (Mr. Mister album)|Welcome to the Real World]]''—with lyrics from Page's cousin John Lang—was the breakthrough for Mr. Mister. All three singles were in the top 10, two of which hit No.&nbsp;1 on the U.S. pop charts—\"[[Kyrie (song)|Kyrie]]\" and \"[[Broken Wings (Mr. Mister song)|Broken Wings]]\".

'''Mr. Mister''' was an American [[pop rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]], active from 1980 until 1990. The band consisted of [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] on lead vocals and bass guitar, [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Steve George]] on keyboards/backing vocals, [[Pat Mastelotto]] on acoustic and electronic drums/percussion and Steve Farris on guitars/backing vocals. Mr. Mister was the successor to the band [[Pages (band)|Pages]], fronted by Page and George from 1978 to 1981.

==Early work==
Although formed in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States,<ref name=oldies>{{cite web|title=Mr. Mister Biography|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Mr-Mister.html|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> Mr. Mister was based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=oldies/> [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] had previously worked as a [[session musician]] (for [[Quincy Jones]]) and had composed for [[Michael Jackson]], [[Rick Springfield]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Al Jarreau]], and many more.

In 1978, Page and his childhood friend [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Steve George]] founded the band [[Pages (band)|Pages]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Pages explored a [[jazz fusion|pop fusion]] sound, with a changing lineup of session musicians. Although Pages had a minor hit single with \"I Do Believe in You\", and its three albums garnered favorable reviews, the group had little commercial success. After disbanding Pages in 1981, Page and George focused on songwriting and studio session work for pop artists ranging from [[Laura Branigan]] to [[Village People]].

By 1982, Page and George began putting together a more pop-oriented group with a permanent lineup, rounded out by drummer [[Pat Mastelotto]] and guitarist Steve Farris. All four members had done extensive session work for other artists and brought numerous influences to the band. The initial plan was to bring in a fifth member, a bass guitarist, but after realizing that Page, who was originally slated to be solely the lead singer, could also play bass, the members decided to remain a four-piece.<ref name= \"History\">{{cite web |author=Dehenau, Peter |url=http://users.skynet.be/sky67891/history.htm| title=History - Mr. Mister |website=Users.skynet.be |accessdate=March 30, 2009}}</ref>

==Mainstream success==
When the first Mr. Mister album, ''[[I Wear the Face]]'', was released by [[RCA Records]] in 1984, Page was offered the chance to replace [[Bobby Kimball]] as lead singer of [[Toto (band)|Toto]], and later was offered [[Peter Cetera]]'s place in [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]; he refused both offers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Forchhammer, Georg |url=http://www.bluedesert.dk/pageinterview.html |title=Richard Page interview |date=December 1, 2008 |publisher=Blue Desert |accessdate=March 30, 2009}}</ref>

Their second album, 1985's ''[[Welcome to the Real World (Mr. Mister album)|Welcome to the Real World]]''—with lyrics from Page's cousin John Lang—was the breakthrough for Mr. Mister. All three singles were in the top 10, two of which hit No.&nbsp;1 on the U.S. pop charts—\"[[Kyrie (song)|Kyrie]]\" and \"[[Broken Wings (Mr. Mister song)|Broken Wings]]\". The latter was inspired by the [[Broken Wings (Gibran novel)|book of the same title]] by [[Khalil Gibran]].<ref name=\"writing\">{{Cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/sky67891/history.htm|title=History of Mr. Mister - Pages - 3rd Matinee - Richard Page|website=Users.skynet.be|accessdate=November 7, 2019}}</ref> They had several No.&nbsp;1 [[MTV]] videos, and performed at the first ''MTV Spring Break'' show in 1986.

{{Main article|Bookmarklet}}

[[File:Word count bookmarklet.png|thumb|300px|A bookmarklet in action]]

Bookmarklets are [[JavaScript]] programs stored as bookmarks. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''bookmark'' and ''[[applet]]''. Bookmarklets are possible because the JavaScript [[URI scheme]] allows JavaScript programs to be stored as URIs, which can be stored in bookmarks. Bookmarklets have access to the current page, which they may inspect and change. As such, they can be simple \"one-click\" tools which add functionality to the browser. Bookmarklets are typically installed by navigating to a web page that links to a JavaScript URI, right-clicking the link, and clicking the bookmark option.

Web developer Steve Kangas got the idea from the [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] JavaScript Guide,<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.bookmarklets.com/about/
|title=About Bookmarklets
|accessdate=3 July 2009
}}</ref> and coined the term ''bookmarklets'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> [[Brendan Eich]], the inventor of JavaScript, explained bookmarklets as follows:

{{quote|They were a deliberate feature in this sense: I invented the <code>javascript:</code> URL along with JavaScript in 1995, and intended that <code>javascript:</code> URLs could be used as any other kind of URL, including being bookmark-able.

In particular, I made it possible to generate a new document by loading, ''e.g.'' <code>javascript:'hello, world'</code>, but also (key for bookmarklets) to run arbitrary script against the DOM of the current document, e.g. <code>javascript:alert(document.links[0].href)</code>. The difference is that the latter kind of URL uses an expression that evaluates to the undefined type in JS. I added the void operator to JS before Netscape 2 shipped to make it easy to discard any non-undefined value in a <code>javascript:</code> URL.|Brendan Eich|3=email to [[Simon Willison]]<ref>{{cite web

==Live bookmarks==
Live bookmarks are Internet bookmarks powered by [[RSS (file format)|RSS]], particularly in [[Features of Mozilla Firefox#Live bookmarks|Mozilla Firefox]]. They allow users to dynamically monitor changes to their favorite news sources. Instead of treating RSS-feeds as HTML pages like most [[news aggregator]]s do, they are treated as bookmarks that are updated in real-time with a link to the appropriate source. Live bookmarks are updated automatically; however no browser option exists to prevent or control the automatic Live Bookmark updates.

Live bookmarks were available in Firefox from 2004 until December 2018; since then, Firefox no longer supports them.<ref name=\"Firefox 64.0\" />

==Bookmarklets==
{{Main article|Bookmarklet}}

[[File:Word count bookmarklet.png|thumb|300px|A bookmarklet in action]]

Bookmarklets are [[JavaScript]] programs stored as bookmarks. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''bookmark'' and ''[[applet]]''. Bookmarklets are possible because the JavaScript [[URI scheme]] allows JavaScript programs to be stored as URIs, which can be stored in bookmarks. Bookmarklets have access to the current page, which they may inspect and change. As such, they can be simple \"one-click\" tools which add functionality to the browser. Bookmarklets are typically installed by navigating to a web page that links to a JavaScript URI, right-clicking the link, and clicking the bookmark option.

Web developer Steve Kangas got the idea from the [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] JavaScript Guide,<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.bookmarklets.com/about/
|title=About Bookmarklets
|accessdate=3 July 2009
}}</ref> and coined the term ''bookmarklets'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> [[Brendan Eich]], the inventor of JavaScript, explained bookmarklets as follows:

{{quote|They were a deliberate feature in this sense: I invented the <code>javascript:</code> URL along with JavaScript in 1995, and intended that <code>javascript:</code> URLs could be used as any other kind of URL, including being bookmark-able.

In particular, I made it possible to generate a new document by loading, ''e.g.'' <code>javascript:'hello, world'</code>, but also (key for bookmarklets) to run arbitrary script against the DOM of the current document, e.g. <code>javascript:alert(document.links[0].href)</code>. The difference is that the latter kind of URL uses an expression that evaluates to the undefined type in JS. I added the void operator to JS before Netscape 2 shipped to make it easy to discard any non-undefined value in a <code>javascript:</code> URL.|Brendan Eich|3=email to [[Simon Willison]]<ref>{{cite web

==Live bookmarks==
Live bookmarks are Internet bookmarks powered by [[RSS (file format)|RSS]], particularly in [[Features of Mozilla Firefox#Live bookmarks|Mozilla Firefox]]. They allow users to dynamically monitor changes to their favorite news sources. Instead of treating RSS-feeds as HTML pages like most [[news aggregator]]s do, they are treated as bookmarks that are updated in real-time with a link to the appropriate source. Live bookmarks are updated automatically; however no browser option exists to prevent or control the automatic Live Bookmark updates.

Live bookmarks were available in Firefox from 2004 until December 2018; since then, Firefox no longer supports them.<ref name=\"Firefox 64.0\" />

'''Yeading''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɛ|d|ɪ|ŋ}} {{respell|YED|ing}}) is a settlement at the eastern end of [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]] in [[west London]], forming part of the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]], having been developed after the Second World War.

==Etymology==
Yeading is very early [[Saxons|Saxon]] and was originally ''Geddingas'' or ''Geddinges'', meaning \"the people of Geddi\".<ref name=\"Etymology\">Catherine Kelter, ''Hayes: A Concise History'' (Hillingdon Borough Libraries, 1988), p. 9.</ref>

==History==
The earliest surviving documented allusion to Yeading dates from 757 AD, in which year [[Æthelbald of Mercia]] made a land grant which mentioned ''Geddinges'' (Yeading) and ''Fiscesburne'' (Crane or Yeading Brook). The first land grant including Yeading was made by [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] in 790 to [[Æthelhard]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]: \"in the place called on linga Haese [Hayes] and Geddinges [Yeading] around the stream called Fiscesburna [Crane or Yeading Brook].\"<ref name=\"Geddinges\">Kelter, ''Hayes'' (1988), p. 13.</ref>

[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] settlement in Yeading therefore seems probable, but the history of Yeading in subsequent centuries is not as clear as that of [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]]. Such details as the names of many Yeading [[manor]] holders remain unknown.<ref name=\"Geddinges\"/>

[[Dock (maritime)|Yeading Dock]] was one of many docks built along the [[Grand Union Canal]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The main industry in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]] and Yeading at this time was [[Brickworks|brickmaking]], and the canal provided a reliable way of transporting larger numbers of bricks. Yeading's brickworkers could be known to keep pigs as a second source of income. A [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] writer, one Elizabeth Hunt, wrote in 1861 that in \"Yeading dirt, ignorance and darkness reign supreme.\"<ref name=\"Brickmaking\">Kelter, ''Hayes'' (1988), p. 39.</ref> In 1874, however, one James Thorne wrote that the inhabitants of Yeading were \"always found civil\".<ref name=\"Civil\">James Thorne, ''Handbook to the Environs of London, alphabetically arranged'' (London, 1876), pp. 334-6.</ref>

Yeading was still not developed in the 1920s. Yeading Lane was often flooded, and access beyond Yeading to [[Northolt]] seems to have been by [[footpath]] only before the [[World War I|First World War]]. During the War, a properly constructed road was built linking the [[Great Western Railway]] station at [[Hayes and Harlington railway station|Hayes]] with the L.N.E.R. line at  [[Northolt tube station|Northolt]]. Yeading was still mainly a [[rural area]].<ref name=\"Lane\">Kelter, ''Hayes'' (1988), p. 59.</ref>

After the [[World War II|Second World War]], a large [[Prefabricated home|prefab]] estate was erected in Yeading. By 1956, Yeading's Tilbury Square was still without gas and electricity, and oil stoves and open fires were still used; the public house ''The Willow Tree'', reputedly some 400 years old (now demolished), was lit by three cylinders of [[Calor Gas|calor gas]].<ref name=\"Prefab\">Kelter, ''Hayes'' (1988), pp. 72-3.</ref> The Yeading Lane estate underwent largescale development in the late 1960s and '70s.

'''Jennifer Bolande''' is an American artist whose work employs various media—primarily photography, sculpture, film and site-specific installations to explore the affinities between particular sets of objects and images and the mercurial meanings they manufacture.

Bolande emerged as an artist in the late 1970s, working initially in dance, choreography and drawing. In the early 1980s, she advanced the ideas and strategies proposed by the Pictures Generation Movement and began working with found images, re-photography, appropriation, film and installation, taking her place among those artists who have helped to redefine photography. She takes an intuitive approach to creating conceptual works in the construction of a coherent visual language.  A retrospective exhibition of her work was organized in 2010 by the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and traveled to the ICA in Philadelphia<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/94790029.html|title=A Conversation: Jennifer Bolande and David Robbins|website=archive.jsonline.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>, and the Luckman Gallery at California State University in Los Angeles.

'''USS ''Harold J. Ellison'' (DD-864)''' was a {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer}} in service with the [[United States Navy]] from 1945 to 1983. She was then transferred to [[Pakistan]] and renamed '''''Shah Jahan'' (D-164)'''. The ship was finally sunk as a target in 1994.

==History==
USS ''Harold J. Ellison'' was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] [[Harold John Ellison]], a naval aviator who died during the [[Battle of Midway]]. An earlier [[destroyer escort]] assigned the name, {{USS|Harold J. Ellison|DE-545|3}} was cancelled in 1944.

===1945–1983===
''Harold J. Ellison'' was laid down by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] at [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on 3 October 1944, launched on 14 March 1945 by Mrs. Audrey Ellison, the widow of Ensign Ellison and commissioned on 23 June 1945.

Although scheduled to join the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] for the final assault on Japan, ''Harold J. Ellison'' was completing her shakedown cruise when the surrender came on 15 August 1945. Homeported at [[Naval Station Norfolk]], she operated in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] for the next two years, taking part in [[United States Navy Reserve]] training cruises, and [[anti-submarine warfare]] exercises.

Beginning in 1947, when she sailed from Norfolk on 10 November, ''Harold J. Ellison'' added periodic cruises to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] to her operations, helping to keep the peace and protect American interests in this area. She participated in the search for lost British [[submarine]] {{HMS|Affray|P421|6}} in April 1951, and added cruises to the Caribbean and northern Europe in 1953.

From 1954 to 1956 she continued tactical training along the [[United States East Coast]] and participated in [[Western Europe|European]] cruises. Following the 1956 [[Suez crisis]], ''Harold J. Ellison'', took part in peacekeeping operations in the Eastern Mediterranean during 1957.

The following summer, the [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon crisis]] occurred as the government of [[Lebanon]]  experienced a division between pro-Western and pro-Arab sides. The destroyer screened [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|3}} and [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Des Moines|CA-134|3}} from July to September 1958 while the 6th Fleet landed [[United States Marines]] at the request of Lebanese President [[Camille Chamoun]].

[[File:USS Harold J. Ellison (DD-864) underway in May 1958.jpg|thumb|left|''Harold J. Ellison'' underway in May 1958.]]

In September 1958, she operated with \"Task Group Alfa\" for the training of new tactics and equipment in antisubmarine warfare. ''Harold J. Ellison'' remained on this duty until April 1959.

The ship returned to her pattern of cruises to the Mediterranean in 1959, departing Norfolk on 21 September. In 1960, her homeport became [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and in 1961, during her tenth deployment to the 6th Fleet, the ship cruised in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Ramadan Revolution|crisis in Kuwait]]. ''Harold J. Ellison'' added a new function in January 1962, when she was assigned to [[Project Mercury]] as a part of the recovery unit in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1962, she underwent an extensive [[Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization]] (FRAM I) overhaul at the [[Brooklyn Naval Shipyard]]. The destroyer rejoined the fleet in early 1963 and through 1964 continued to operate on training and readiness exercises off the Atlantic coast.

On 29 September 1965, ''Harold J. Ellison'' departed Norfolk with Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 24 and headed via the [[Panama Canal]] for the [[Pacific Ocean]]. She served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on \"[[Yankee Station]]\" in the [[Tonkin Gulf]], participated in \"[[Operation Sea Dragon (Vietnam War)|Sea Dragon]]\" operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out [[naval gunfire support]] missions during the [[Vietnam War]]. Leaving Southeast Asia by steaming eastward through the [[Suez Canal]], she completed her round-the-world cruise upon returning to Norfolk in April 1966. In July she entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] for an overhaul which lasted for the rest of the year. After sea trials and refresher training early in 1967, ''Harold J. Ellison'' rejoined the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]]. She visited [[Brazil]] and crossed the equator on her way around Africa en route to the Middle East. During a port visit in [[Ethiopia]], Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] was a guest aboard the ship. ''Harold J. Ellison'' also visited [[Kenya]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Pakistan]] and returned in March 1971.

In July 1971, ''Harold J. Ellison'' was assigned to DesRon 36 and operated mainly in the Atlantic Ocean. On 1 July 1972, the destroyer was assigned to the DesRon 34 of the Navy Reserve. During the first half of 1973, she underwent an overhaul at [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. Following her yard period, she sailed the Caribbean Sea, visiting [[Port-au-Prince]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and [[Bermuda]].

On 19 July 1974, ''Harold J. Ellison'' departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean Sea with the aircraft carrier {{USS|Independence|CV-62|6}}. The destroyer was transferred to DesRon 30 on 30 November 1974 and her homeport was changed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. For her remaining career in the U.S. Navy, she continued to train reservists on cruises along the U.S. East Coast or to the Caribbean Sea. ''Harold J. Ellison'' was decommissioned on 1 October 1983. Together with {{USS|William C. Lawe|DD-763|6}}, which was decommissioned on the same day, she was the last {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer}} in the United States Navy.

===Transfer to Pakistan===

{{other ships|PNS Shah Jahan}}

''Harold J. Ellison'' was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 October 1983, transferred to [[Pakistan]] and renamed ''Shah Jahan'' (D-164). She was cannibalized for parts and sunk as a target vessel in 1994.
