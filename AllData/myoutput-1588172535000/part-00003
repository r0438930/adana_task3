Following the release of his previous album ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975), Oldfield moved into a new home in [[Bisley, Gloucestershire]], where he set up a new recording studio. He started on a follow-up in 1977 which took form as a [[double album]] with one, side-long track on each side of the [[LP record]]. Oldfield wished to use real [[incantations]] in the music, but ended up using folklore as a loose running theme, such as [[Diana (mythology)|Dianna the Huntress]]. Though primarily instrumental, lyrical sections are adapted from works by poems [[Longfellow]] and [[Ben Jonson]]. Oldfield completed the self-awareness seminar [[Exegesis (group)|Exegesis]] while recording ''Incantations''.\n\n''Incantations'' peaked at No. 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], becoming Oldfield's first album not to reach the UK top-five. It was supported by Oldfield's first concert tour as a solo artist, the [[Tour of Europe 1979]], which featured all four parts of ''Incantations'' performed on stage with a band, orchestra, and choir. The album was reissued in 2000 and 2011; the latter release features a digital remaster with a new stereo mix and additional content, including Oldfield's 1979 disco-influenced non-album single \"[[Guilty (Mike Oldfield song)|Guilty]]\" and footage from his 1979 live album, ''[[Exposed (Mike Oldfield album)|Exposed]]''.\n\n== Background and writing==\nBy the end of 1975 Oldfield had released his third album, ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975), which, like his previous two albums, ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (1973) and ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974), had reached the top-five of the [[UK Albums Chart]] and helped to solidify Oldfield's popularity as a musician. The three albums were similar in structure, formed of a single composition split into two parts of the [[LP record]]. The release of ''Ommadawn'' marked the end of Oldfield's time at his home in [[Kington, Herefordshire]], from which he moved to Througham Slad Manor near [[Bisley, Gloucestershire]] and set up a recording studio there.<ref name=MM75>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1975_10/Beyond-the-Ridge-Portrait-of-a-Genius|title=Beyond the Ridge: Portrait of a Genius|work=Melody Maker|first=Karl|last=Dallas |date=25 October 1975|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen work on ''Incantations'' began, Oldfield recalled that his initial goal was a record that contained \"real [[incantation]]s to exert a benign magical influence on anybody who heard it\".<ref name=DIS11>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4143187-if-people-go-one-way-i-instinctively-go-the-other-dis-meets-mike-oldfield|title=\"If people go one way I instinctively go the other\" - DiS meets Mike Oldfield|first=Andrew|last=Kennedy|date=2 August 2011|publisher=Drowned in Sound|accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref> He intended to base the music around real spells and chants, and asked the A&R department of his label, [[Virgin Records]], to invite the head [[Druidry (modern)|Druid]] to his home and discuss it further.

It developed into the double vibraphone section on \"Incantations (Part Four)\".{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=192, 193}} In its final form, ''Incantations'' took shape as a [[double album]] and separated into four distinct parts, each one taking up one side of an LP record. Oldfield named composer and electronic musician [[Terry Riley]] as a big influence on ''Incantations'', particularly his use of [[ostinato]].<ref name=IMARW80>{{cite web|url=https://www-rocksbackpages-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/Library/Article/mike-oldfield|title=Mike Oldfield|first=Tim|last=Oakes|work=International Musician and Recording World|date=June 1980|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|accessdate=17 February 2020}}</ref> At 72 minutes in total length, ''Incantations'' remained Oldfield's longest album until his 2005 double album, ''[[Light + Shade]]''.\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Througham Slad - geograph.org.uk - 786986.jpg|thumb|right|Througham Slad Manor, where the album was recorded]]\n''Incantations'' was recorded at Througham Slad between December 1977 and September 1978, during which Oldfield faced professional and personal difficulties. After some 20 minutes of music was recorded, staff at Virgin Records asked Oldfield to hear what had been done. Oldfield recalled that one day, \"a delegation arrived at my house\", including label founder [[Richard Branson]].{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=197}} Upon hearing the music, and telling the staff that ''Incantations'' was to be a double album with what Oldfield called \"mathematical and classical-sounding\" piece, Oldfield wrote: \"They quietly sat around the place listening; at the end, Richard was his usual cheerful self but everyone else filed out in silence\".{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=197}} Oldfield theorised that the incident helped to convince Virgin management to switch from being a predominantly [[progressive rock]] label and to begin supporting [[Punk rock|punk]] bands, who were becoming popular. In addition to the lack of support from his label, Oldfield became a target in the music press as being outdated and no longer in fashion. These events drained Oldfield's inspiration and enthusiasm for ''Incantations'' and recording slowed.{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=197, 199}} He started to drink heavily, becoming more aggressive and withdrawn which ended his relationship with Critchlow's daughter Louise. He looked back on this time as when life was \"really at rock bottom\".{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=199}}\n\nIn June 1978, after a road trip to Italy and Greece with his brother and time at home with his father had failed to help his situation, Oldfield was recommended to attend an [[Exegesis (group)|Exegesis]] seminar by the wife of his studio engineer. After the three-day assertiveness course Oldfield said he felt \"nothing but absolute relief and euphoria\".{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=200}}\n\nAlong with some other pieces of Oldfield's work, a different version of \"Part Four\" was used for the soundtrack of [[Tony Palmer (director)|Tony Palmer]]'s ''[[The Space Movie]]''.\n\n== Music ==\nDespite the length, much of the album can be described as being compositionally [[Minimalist music|minimalist]], including melodic lines played by only a few instruments at a time.\n\nThe album as a whole is unusual in that it makes extensive use of the [[circle of fifths]] as an accompaniment to many of the musical ideas. Since this musical structure requires that each idea be [[Modulation (music)|modulated]] through twelve keys, before the next is introduced, more time is required to develop each idea, so that each section unfolds more slowly than is usual in Oldfield's work. A byproduct of this musical structure is that most of the album is not in any one key, but cycles continuously through them all.\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part One\" simply repeat the names of the goddesses [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]].\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part Two\" are taken from the beginnings of chapter XXII and XII (in that order) of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s epic poem \"[[The Song of Hiawatha]]\".\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part Four\" are [[Ben Jonson]]'s \"Ode to Cynthia\" from ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'', but adjusted again to match the music.\n\nWhen the CD version was released, due to the shorter length of the format at the time (early [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|redbook]] standards only allowed for a maximum playing time of 74:33), many early pressings unnecessarily have \"Part Three\" shortened from 16:59 down to 13:49 by cutting from the beginning. When 80-minute CDs became the norm and quality control was increased, the full cut of \"Part Three\" was restored. All modern pressings have the full version of the piece.\n\n== Artwork ==\nThe cover was once again done by [[Trevor Key]]. The beach in the cover photograph is [[Cala Pregonda]], in [[Menorca]]. The current CD sleeve has a different [[typeface]] than the original LP artwork (which is shown at the top of the page). Early copies of the album came with a poster showing a subtly different photograph from the one used on the cover.\n\nThe cover photograph used may have been [[Photo manipulation|altered]] by Key. There have been some theories about why this may have been done, although the claim that Oldfield was not actually on the beach is easily contradicted by other photographs from the shoot. It is assumed that Key simply cut and pasted the image of Oldfield onto a slightly different background for artistic reasons.\n\nThe 2011 reissue of the album was given new artwork, showing a new photograph of the same rock formation and no image of Oldfield.\n\n== Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r129941|first=Steven|last=McDonald|title=''Incantations'' review}}</ref>\n}}\n''Incantations'' was released in the UK on 1 December 1978 and received a strong opening commercial response.

Oldfield named composer and electronic musician [[Terry Riley]] as a big influence on ''Incantations'', particularly his use of [[ostinato]].<ref name=IMARW80>{{cite web|url=https://www-rocksbackpages-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/Library/Article/mike-oldfield|title=Mike Oldfield|first=Tim|last=Oakes|work=International Musician and Recording World|date=June 1980|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|accessdate=17 February 2020}}</ref> At 72 minutes in total length, ''Incantations'' remained Oldfield's longest album until his 2005 double album, ''[[Light + Shade]]''.\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Througham Slad - geograph.org.uk - 786986.jpg|thumb|right|Througham Slad Manor, where the album was recorded]]\n''Incantations'' was recorded at Througham Slad between December 1977 and September 1978, during which Oldfield faced professional and personal difficulties. After some 20 minutes of music was recorded, staff at Virgin Records asked Oldfield to hear what had been done. Oldfield recalled that one day, \"a delegation arrived at my house\", including label founder [[Richard Branson]].{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=197}} Upon hearing the music, and telling the staff that ''Incantations'' was to be a double album with what Oldfield called \"mathematical and classical-sounding\" piece, Oldfield wrote: \"They quietly sat around the place listening; at the end, Richard was his usual cheerful self but everyone else filed out in silence\".{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=197}} Oldfield theorised that the incident helped to convince Virgin management to switch from being a predominantly [[progressive rock]] label and to begin supporting [[Punk rock|punk]] bands, who were becoming popular. In addition to the lack of support from his label, Oldfield became a target in the music press as being outdated and no longer in fashion. These events drained Oldfield's inspiration and enthusiasm for ''Incantations'' and recording slowed.{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=197, 199}} He started to drink heavily, becoming more aggressive and withdrawn which ended his relationship with Critchlow's daughter Louise. He looked back on this time as when life was \"really at rock bottom\".{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=199}}\n\nIn June 1978, after a road trip to Italy and Greece with his brother and time at home with his father had failed to help his situation, Oldfield was recommended to attend an [[Exegesis (group)|Exegesis]] seminar by the wife of his studio engineer. After the three-day assertiveness course Oldfield said he felt \"nothing but absolute relief and euphoria\".{{sfn|Oldfield|2008|p=200}}\n\nAlong with some other pieces of Oldfield's work, a different version of \"Part Four\" was used for the soundtrack of [[Tony Palmer (director)|Tony Palmer]]'s ''[[The Space Movie]]''.\n\n== Music ==\nDespite the length, much of the album can be described as being compositionally [[Minimalist music|minimalist]], including melodic lines played by only a few instruments at a time.\n\nThe album as a whole is unusual in that it makes extensive use of the [[circle of fifths]] as an accompaniment to many of the musical ideas. Since this musical structure requires that each idea be [[Modulation (music)|modulated]] through twelve keys, before the next is introduced, more time is required to develop each idea, so that each section unfolds more slowly than is usual in Oldfield's work. A byproduct of this musical structure is that most of the album is not in any one key, but cycles continuously through them all.\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part One\" simply repeat the names of the goddesses [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]].\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part Two\" are taken from the beginnings of chapter XXII and XII (in that order) of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s epic poem \"[[The Song of Hiawatha]]\".\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part Four\" are [[Ben Jonson]]'s \"Ode to Cynthia\" from ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'', but adjusted again to match the music.\n\nWhen the CD version was released, due to the shorter length of the format at the time (early [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|redbook]] standards only allowed for a maximum playing time of 74:33), many early pressings unnecessarily have \"Part Three\" shortened from 16:59 down to 13:49 by cutting from the beginning. When 80-minute CDs became the norm and quality control was increased, the full cut of \"Part Three\" was restored. All modern pressings have the full version of the piece.\n\n== Artwork ==\nThe cover was once again done by [[Trevor Key]]. The beach in the cover photograph is [[Cala Pregonda]], in [[Menorca]]. The current CD sleeve has a different [[typeface]] than the original LP artwork (which is shown at the top of the page). Early copies of the album came with a poster showing a subtly different photograph from the one used on the cover.\n\nThe cover photograph used may have been [[Photo manipulation|altered]] by Key. There have been some theories about why this may have been done, although the claim that Oldfield was not actually on the beach is easily contradicted by other photographs from the shoot. It is assumed that Key simply cut and pasted the image of Oldfield onto a slightly different background for artistic reasons.\n\nThe 2011 reissue of the album was given new artwork, showing a new photograph of the same rock formation and no image of Oldfield.\n\n== Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r129941|first=Steven|last=McDonald|title=''Incantations'' review}}</ref>\n}}\n''Incantations'' was released in the UK on 1 December 1978 and received a strong opening commercial response. The album was certified platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] two weeks prior to its release for over 300,000 copies ordered.<ref name=BPI>{{cite web|url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/award/3320-2671-2|title=BRIT Certified - Certified Awards Search - Mike Oldfield - Incantations|publisher=British Phonographic Inustry|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The album was promoted with the release of \"[[Guilty (Mike Oldfield song)|Guilty]]\", a non-album track that was released in April 1979 with the four-minute \"Excerpt from Incantations\" on the B-side.
