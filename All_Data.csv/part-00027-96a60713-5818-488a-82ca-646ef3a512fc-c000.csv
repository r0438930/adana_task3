\"'''Maryland, My Maryland'''\" is the [[regional anthem]] (or [[state song]]) of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]]. The song is set to the melody of \"Lauriger Horatius\"<ref>Code of Maryland, State Government, Title 13, § 13-307.</ref> — the same tune \"[[O Tannenbaum]]\" was taken from.  The lyrics are from a nine-stanza poem written by [[James Ryder Randall]] (1839–1908) in 1861. The [[Maryland General Assembly|state's general assembly]] adopted \"Maryland, My Maryland\" as the state song on April 29, 1939.<ref>Maryland State Archives (2004). [http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/symbols/song.html Maryland State Song - \"Maryland, My Maryland\"]. Retrieved 27 Dec. 2004.</ref>

The song's words refer to [[History of Maryland|Maryland's history]] and geography and specifically mention several historical figures of importance to the state. The song calls for Marylanders to fight against the U.S. and was used across the Confederacy during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] as a battle hymn.<ref>[[Bruce Catton|Catton, Bruce]].

Due to its origin in reaction to the [[Baltimore riot of 1861]] and Randall's support for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], it includes lyrics that refer to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] as \"the tyrant\", \"the despot\", and \"the Vandal\", and to the Union as \"Northern scum\", as well as referring to the phrase \"[[Sic semper tyrannis]]\", which was the slogan later shouted by Marylander [[John Wilkes Booth]] when he [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated Lincoln]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/boothdiary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229212451/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/boothdiary.html |archivedate=2010-12-29 }} Diary Entry of John Wilkes Booth</ref> For these reasons, occasional attempts have been made to replace it as Maryland's state song,<ref>Another Try for Maryland's State Song?, ''The Washington Post'', April 6, 2000.</ref> but to date, all such attempts have failed.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/03/01/ST2009030100010.html</ref>

==History==
The poem was a result of events at the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. During the secession crisis, U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] (referred to in the poem as \"the despot\" and \"the tyrant\") ordered U.S. troops to be brought to Washington, D.C., to protect the capital and to prepare for war with the seceding southern states. Many of these troops were brought through [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]], a major transportation hub. There was considerable [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathy in Maryland at the time, as well as a large number of residents who objected to waging a war against their southern neighbors.<ref name=\"Arrest\">{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |title=Teaching American History in Maryland – Documents for the Classroom: ''Arrest of the Maryland Legislature, 1861'' |publisher=Maryland State Archives |year=2005 |accessdate=February 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111110628/http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Riots ensued as Union troops came through Baltimore on their way south in April 1861 and were attacked by mobs. A number of Union troops and Baltimore residents were killed in the [[Baltimore riot of 1861|Baltimore riots]]. The Maryland legislature summarized the state's ambivalent feelings when it met soon after, on April 29, voting 53–13 against secession,<ref name=\"Mitchell, p.87\">Mitchell, p.87</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/uscw/features/articles/articleview.cfm?aid%3D34|title=States Which Seceded|website=eHistory|series=Civil War Articles|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=October 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084544/http://ehistory.osu.edu/uscw/features/articles/articleview.cfm?aid=34|archivedate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> but also voting not to reopen rail links with the North, and requesting that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland.<ref name=\"Arrest\">{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |title=Teaching American History in Maryland – Documents for the Classroom: ''Arrest of the Maryland Legislature, 1861'' |publisher=Maryland State Archives |year=2005 |accessdate=February 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111110628/http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At this time the legislature seems to have wanted to avoid involvement in a war against its seceding neighbors.<ref name=\"Arrest\"/> The contentious issue of troop transport through Maryland would lead one month later to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, also a Marylander, penning one of the United States' most controversial wartime rulings, [[Ex parte Merryman]].<ref>McGinty (2011) p. 173. \"The decision was controversial on the day it was announced, and it has remained controversial ever since.\"  Neely (2011) p. 65 Quoting Lincoln biographer James G. Randall,\"Perhaps no other feature of Union policy was more widely criticized nor more strenuously defended.\"</ref>

One of the reported victims of these troop transport riots was Francis X. Ward, a friend of [[James Ryder Randall]]. Randall, a native Marylander, was teaching at [[Poydras High School|Poydras College]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana]], at the time and, moved by the news of his friend's death, wrote the nine-stanza poem, \"Maryland, My Maryland\". The poem was a plea to his home state of Maryland to [[secession#Confederate States of America|secede]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and join the Confederacy. Randall later claimed the poem was written \"almost involuntarily\" in the middle of the night on April 26, 1861. Being unable to sleep after hearing the news, he claimed \"some powerful spirit appeared to possess me ... the whole poem was dashed off rapidly ... [under] what may be called a conflagration of the senses, if not an inspiration of the intellect\".<ref name=Fahs80>Alice Fahs.

The poem contains many references to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] as well as to the [[Mexican–American War]] and Maryland figures in that war (many of whom have fallen into obscurity). It was first published in the [[New Orleans]] ''Sunday Delta''. The poem was quickly turned into a song — put to the tune of \"Lauriger Horatius\" — by Baltimore resident Jennie Cary, sister of [[Hetty Cary]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/harrison/harrison.html#harrison57|page=57| title=Recollections Grave and Gay| author=Mrs. Burton Harrison |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons| year=1911}}</ref> It became instantly popular in Maryland, aided by a [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|series of unpopular federal actions]] there, and throughout the [[U.S. Southern states|South]]. It was sometimes called \"the [[La Marseillaise|Marseillaise]] of the South\".

After the War, author [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]] compared \"Maryland, My Maryland\" with \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" as the two most popular songs from the opposing sides in the early months of the conflict. Each side, he wrote, had \"a sword in its hand, each with a song in its mouth\". The songs indicated as well their respective audiences, according to Holmes: \"One is a hymn, with ghostly imagery and anthem-like ascription. The other is a lyric poem, appealing chiefly to local pride and passion.\"<ref name=Fahs80/>

<div>{{poemquote|
I
The despot's heel is on thy shore,
Maryland!{{efn|Although the words as written, and as adopted by statute, contain only one instance of \"Maryland\" in the second and fourth line of each stanza, common practice is to sing \"Maryland, my Maryland\" each time to keep with the meter of the tune.}}
His torch is at thy temple door,
Maryland!
Avenge the [[Baltimore riot of 1861|patriotic gore]]
That flecked the streets of [[Baltimore]],
And be the battle queen of yore,
Maryland! My Maryland!

II
Hark to an exiled son's appeal,
Maryland!
My mother State! to thee I kneel,
Maryland!
For life and death, for woe and weal,
Thy peerless chivalry reveal,
And gird thy beauteous limbs with steel,
Maryland! My Maryland!

III
Thou wilt not cower in the dust,
Maryland!
Thy beaming sword shall never rust,
Maryland!
Remember [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Carroll]]'s sacred trust,
Remember [[John Eager Howard|Howard]]'s warlike thrust,—
And all thy slumberers with the just,
Maryland! My Maryland!

IV
Come! 'tis the red dawn of the day,
Maryland!
Come with thy panoplied array,
Maryland!
With [[Samuel Ringgold (United States Army officer)|Ringgold]]'s spirit for the fray,
With [[William H. Watson|Watson]]'s blood at [[Battle of Monterrey|Monterey]],
With fearless [[Enoch Louis Lowe|Lowe]] and dashing [[Charles A. May|May]],
Maryland! My Maryland!

V
Come! for thy shield is bright and strong,
Maryland!
Come! for thy dalliance does thee wrong,
Maryland!
Come to thine own anointed throng,
Stalking with Liberty along,
And sing thy dauntless slogan song,
Maryland! My Maryland!

VI
Dear Mother! burst the tyrant's chain,
Maryland!
[[Virginia]] should not call in vain,
Maryland!
She meets her sisters on the plain—
\"[[Sic semper tyrannis|Sic semper]]!\" 'tis the proud refrain
That baffles minions back amain,
Maryland! My Maryland!

VII
I see the blush upon thy cheek,
Maryland!
For thou wast ever bravely meek,
Maryland!
But lo! there surges forth a shriek,
From hill to hill, from creek to creek—
[[Potomac River|Potomac]] calls to [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]],
Maryland! My Maryland!

VIII
Thou wilt not yield the [[Vandals|Vandal]] toll,
Maryland!
Thou wilt not crook to his control,
Maryland!
Better the fire upon thee roll,
Better the blade, the shot, the bowl,
Than crucifixion of the soul,
Maryland! My Maryland!

IX
I hear the distant thunder-hum,
Maryland!
[[Maryland Line|The Old Line]]'s bugle, fife, and drum,
Maryland!
She is not dead, nor deaf, nor dumb—
Huzza! she spurns the Northern scum!
She breathes! she burns! she'll come! she'll come!
Maryland! My Maryland!

==Efforts to repeal, replace, or revise Maryland's state song==

==History==
The poem was a result of events at the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. During the secession crisis, U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] (referred to in the poem as \"the despot\" and \"the tyrant\") ordered U.S. troops to be brought to Washington, D.C., to protect the capital and to prepare for war with the seceding southern states. Many of these troops were brought through [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]], a major transportation hub. There was considerable [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathy in Maryland at the time, as well as a large number of residents who objected to waging a war against their southern neighbors.<ref name=\"Arrest\">{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |title=Teaching American History in Maryland – Documents for the Classroom: ''Arrest of the Maryland Legislature, 1861'' |publisher=Maryland State Archives |year=2005 |accessdate=February 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111110628/http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Riots ensued as Union troops came through Baltimore on their way south in April 1861 and were attacked by mobs. A number of Union troops and Baltimore residents were killed in the [[Baltimore riot of 1861|Baltimore riots]]. The Maryland legislature summarized the state's ambivalent feelings when it met soon after, on April 29, voting 53–13 against secession,<ref name=\"Mitchell, p.87\">Mitchell, p.87</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/uscw/features/articles/articleview.cfm?aid%3D34|title=States Which Seceded|website=eHistory|series=Civil War Articles|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=October 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084544/http://ehistory.osu.edu/uscw/features/articles/articleview.cfm?aid=34|archivedate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> but also voting not to reopen rail links with the North, and requesting that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland.<ref name=\"Arrest\">{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |title=Teaching American History in Maryland – Documents for the Classroom: ''Arrest of the Maryland Legislature, 1861'' |publisher=Maryland State Archives |year=2005 |accessdate=February 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111110628/http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At this time the legislature seems to have wanted to avoid involvement in a war against its seceding neighbors.<ref name=\"Arrest\"/> The contentious issue of troop transport through Maryland would lead one month later to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, also a Marylander, penning one of the United States' most controversial wartime rulings, [[Ex parte Merryman]].<ref>McGinty (2011) p. 173. \"The decision was controversial on the day it was announced, and it has remained controversial ever since.\"  Neely (2011) p. 65 Quoting Lincoln biographer James G. Randall,\"Perhaps no other feature of Union policy was more widely criticized nor more strenuously defended.\"</ref>

One of the reported victims of these troop transport riots was Francis X. Ward, a friend of [[James Ryder Randall]]. Randall, a native Marylander, was teaching at [[Poydras High School|Poydras College]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana]], at the time and, moved by the news of his friend's death, wrote the nine-stanza poem, \"Maryland, My Maryland\". The poem was a plea to his home state of Maryland to [[secession#Confederate States of America|secede]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and join the Confederacy. Randall later claimed the poem was written \"almost involuntarily\" in the middle of the night on April 26, 1861. Being unable to sleep after hearing the news, he claimed \"some powerful spirit appeared to possess me ... the whole poem was dashed off rapidly ... [under] what may be called a conflagration of the senses, if not an inspiration of the intellect\".<ref name=Fahs80>Alice Fahs.

The poem contains many references to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] as well as to the [[Mexican–American War]] and Maryland figures in that war (many of whom have fallen into obscurity). It was first published in the [[New Orleans]] ''Sunday Delta''. The poem was quickly turned into a song — put to the tune of \"Lauriger Horatius\" — by Baltimore resident Jennie Cary, sister of [[Hetty Cary]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/harrison/harrison.html#harrison57|page=57| title=Recollections Grave and Gay| author=Mrs. Burton Harrison |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons| year=1911}}</ref> It became instantly popular in Maryland, aided by a [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|series of unpopular federal actions]] there, and throughout the [[U.S. Southern states|South]]. It was sometimes called \"the [[La Marseillaise|Marseillaise]] of the South\".

After the War, author [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]] compared \"Maryland, My Maryland\" with \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" as the two most popular songs from the opposing sides in the early months of the conflict. Each side, he wrote, had \"a sword in its hand, each with a song in its mouth\". The songs indicated as well their respective audiences, according to Holmes: \"One is a hymn, with ghostly imagery and anthem-like ascription. The other is a lyric poem, appealing chiefly to local pride and passion.\"<ref name=Fahs80/>

[[File:James Ryder Randall 1861.jpg|thumb|James Ryder Randall in 1861, the year he wrote \"Maryland, My Maryland]]
<div>{{poemquote|
I
The despot's heel is on thy shore,
Maryland!{{efn|Although the words as written, and as adopted by statute, contain only one instance of \"Maryland\" in the second and fourth line of each stanza, common practice is to sing \"Maryland, my Maryland\" each time to keep with the meter of the tune.}}
His torch is at thy temple door,
Maryland!
Avenge the [[Baltimore riot of 1861|patriotic gore]]
That flecked the streets of [[Baltimore]],
And be the battle queen of yore,
Maryland! My Maryland!

II
Hark to an exiled son's appeal,
Maryland!
My mother State! to thee I kneel,
Maryland!
For life and death, for woe and weal,
Thy peerless chivalry reveal,
And gird thy beauteous limbs with steel,
Maryland! My Maryland!

III
Thou wilt not cower in the dust,
Maryland!
Thy beaming sword shall never rust,
Maryland!
Remember [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Carroll]]'s sacred trust,
Remember [[John Eager Howard|Howard]]'s warlike thrust,—
And all thy slumberers with the just,
Maryland! My Maryland!

IV
Come! 'tis the red dawn of the day,
Maryland!
Come with thy panoplied array,
Maryland!
With [[Samuel Ringgold (United States Army officer)|Ringgold]]'s spirit for the fray,
With [[William H. Watson|Watson]]'s blood at [[Battle of Monterrey|Monterey]],
With fearless [[Enoch Louis Lowe|Lowe]] and dashing [[Charles A. May|May]],
Maryland! My Maryland!

V
Come! for thy shield is bright and strong,
Maryland!
Come! for thy dalliance does thee wrong,
Maryland!
Come to thine own anointed throng,
Stalking with Liberty along,
And sing thy dauntless slogan song,
Maryland! My Maryland!

VI
Dear Mother! burst the tyrant's chain,
Maryland!
[[Virginia]] should not call in vain,
Maryland!
She meets her sisters on the plain—
\"[[Sic semper tyrannis|Sic semper]]!\" 'tis the proud refrain
That baffles minions back amain,
Maryland! My Maryland!

VII
I see the blush upon thy cheek,
Maryland!
For thou wast ever bravely meek,
Maryland!
But lo! there surges forth a shriek,
From hill to hill, from creek to creek—
[[Potomac River|Potomac]] calls to [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]],
Maryland! My Maryland!

VIII
Thou wilt not yield the [[Vandals|Vandal]] toll,
Maryland!
Thou wilt not crook to his control,
Maryland!
Better the fire upon thee roll,
Better the blade, the shot, the bowl,
Than crucifixion of the soul,
Maryland! My Maryland!

IX
I hear the distant thunder-hum,
Maryland!
[[Maryland Line|The Old Line]]'s bugle, fife, and drum,
Maryland!
She is not dead, nor deaf, nor dumb—
Huzza! she spurns the Northern scum!
She breathes! she burns! she'll come! she'll come!
Maryland! My Maryland!

'''''Bugs''''' is a British television [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] series that ran for four series from 1 April 1995 to 28 August 1999. The programme, a mixture of action/adventure and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]], involved a team of independent crime-fighting technology experts, who faced a variety of threats involving computers and other modern technology. It was originally broadcast on Saturday evenings on [[BBC One]], and was produced for the BBC by the independent production company [[Carnival Films]]. In July 2014, [[London Live (TV channel)|London Live]], a local digital terrestrial station in London, began airing a complete re-run from Series 1.

==Overview==
The series was devised by Carnival boss [[Brian Eastman]] and producer Stuart Doughty with input from veteran writer-producer [[Brian Clemens]], who had previously worked on ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. Clemens described ''Bugs'' as \"an ''Avengers'' for the 1990s\". Other notable series writers included [[Colin Brake]] and [[Stephen Gallagher]]. Two episodes (\"Bugged Wheat\" and \"Hollow Man\"), were written by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], who went on to create the series ''[[Smallville]]''. The theme tune was written by [[Gavin Greenaway]].
The programme was a mixture of action/adventure and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]], with a reliance on fast-paced plots, technical gadgetry, stunts and explosions. Much of the programme's filming took place around the [[London Docklands]] area, which had recently been redeveloped with projects such as [[Canary Wharf]]. This was intended to give a modern, and perhaps even slightly futuristic, feel to locations of the episodes. The production was originally based at two warehouses of Blackwall Basin, on the [[Isle of Dogs]] in London. After the [[1996 Docklands bombing|IRA bombing of the South Quay Plaza]], the crew had to travel further to find intact buildings for exterior locations.<ref>[[SFX Magazine]], May 1996, p. 51.</ref>

The plot of the programme involved a team of specialist independent crime-fighting technology experts, who faced a variety of threats involving computers and other modern technology. The main trio of regulars were Nick Beckett ([[Jesse Birdsall]]), Ros Henderson ([[Jaye Griffiths]]) and Ed ([[Craig McLachlan]] in series one to three, [[Steven Houghton]] in series four). Initially an independent team, they began working alongside the government agency 'Bureau of Weapons Technology' in series two and from series three, with the original Bureau decimated, they came under the authority of the newly created Bureau 2, whose head was codenamed Jan ([[Jan Harvey]]) (her real first name was revealed to be Barbara, but her surname was never given) and her secretary, Alex Jordan (Paula Hunt).
The series evolved, as a result, from a series of relatively unconnected one-off episodes to an overarching 'soap opera' complete with office romances. There has been controversy over Ed's surname - because he was never called anything other than \"Ed\", some people have taken his surname to be Russell, simply because he was addressed as \"Dr Russell\" in one episode. However, that was more likely a pseudonym, as both Ros and Beckett used plenty of false names throughout the series.

The programme came close to cancellation at the conclusion of its third series, but due to an exciting cliffhanger ending deliberately included by the production team, and strong foreign sales, a fourth was commissioned. The final series suffered from being moved to an earlier timeslot on Saturday evenings, and for only having the first eight of its produced ten episodes scheduled for broadcast.<ref>Original announcement of BUGs series four's eight episode run on the Official BUGs website {{cite web |url=http://www.bugs.co.uk/s4news.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505003804/http://www.bugs.co.uk/s4news.html |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> Coupled with the [[Omagh Bombing]] forcing the [[BBC]] to postpone the series for a week, this meant that the concluding three episodes would not be broadcast until a year later. Another attempt to save the show by giving the series a cliffhanger ending was not successful, and the ending of the final episode &mdash; where Alex has just married boyfriend Adam, only to have him killed at the wedding and Ros and Beckett are abducted by an attacker unseen by the audience but recognised by Beckett &mdash; was never resolved.

The series has something of a minor cult following in the UK, not least for glaring production faults - for example in the first episode the cast are quite clearly stepping onto pre-chalked outlines to aid what was presumably a necessarily short external shot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
Overall 40 episodes were produced, ten in each of the four series. [[Virgin Publishing]] produced novelizations of the episodes of the first series, but these were not successful and subsequent episodes were not novelised. As of 2005, the series is available on [[DVD]] in series-by-series box set form, released by [[Revelation Films]]. A complete box set collection of all four series is also available.

'''''Bugs''''' is a British television [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] series that ran for four series from 1 April 1995 to 28 August 1999. The programme, a mixture of action/adventure and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]], involved a team of independent crime-fighting technology experts, who faced a variety of threats involving computers and other modern technology. It was originally broadcast on Saturday evenings on [[BBC One]], and was produced for the BBC by the independent production company [[Carnival Films]]. In July 2014, [[London Live (TV channel)|London Live]], a local digital terrestrial station in London, began airing a complete re-run from Series 1.

==Overview==
The series was devised by Carnival boss [[Brian Eastman]] and producer Stuart Doughty with input from veteran writer-producer [[Brian Clemens]], who had previously worked on ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. Clemens described ''Bugs'' as \"an ''Avengers'' for the 1990s\". Other notable series writers included [[Colin Brake]] and [[Stephen Gallagher]]. Two episodes (\"Bugged Wheat\" and \"Hollow Man\"), were written by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], who went on to create the series ''[[Smallville]]''. The theme tune was written by [[Gavin Greenaway]].
The programme was a mixture of action/adventure and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]], with a reliance on fast-paced plots, technical gadgetry, stunts and explosions. Much of the programme's filming took place around the [[London Docklands]] area, which had recently been redeveloped with projects such as [[Canary Wharf]]. This was intended to give a modern, and perhaps even slightly futuristic, feel to locations of the episodes. The production was originally based at two warehouses of Blackwall Basin, on the [[Isle of Dogs]] in London. After the [[1996 Docklands bombing|IRA bombing of the South Quay Plaza]], the crew had to travel further to find intact buildings for exterior locations.<ref>[[SFX Magazine]], May 1996, p. 51.</ref>

The plot of the programme involved a team of specialist independent crime-fighting technology experts, who faced a variety of threats involving computers and other modern technology. The main trio of regulars were Nick Beckett ([[Jesse Birdsall]]), Ros Henderson ([[Jaye Griffiths]]) and Ed ([[Craig McLachlan]] in series one to three, [[Steven Houghton]] in series four). Initially an independent team, they began working alongside the government agency 'Bureau of Weapons Technology' in series two and from series three, with the original Bureau decimated, they came under the authority of the newly created Bureau 2, whose head was codenamed Jan ([[Jan Harvey]]) (her real first name was revealed to be Barbara, but her surname was never given) and her secretary, Alex Jordan (Paula Hunt).
The series evolved, as a result, from a series of relatively unconnected one-off episodes to an overarching 'soap opera' complete with office romances. There has been controversy over Ed's surname - because he was never called anything other than \"Ed\", some people have taken his surname to be Russell, simply because he was addressed as \"Dr Russell\" in one episode. However, that was more likely a pseudonym, as both Ros and Beckett used plenty of false names throughout the series.

The programme came close to cancellation at the conclusion of its third series, but due to an exciting cliffhanger ending deliberately included by the production team, and strong foreign sales, a fourth was commissioned. The final series suffered from being moved to an earlier timeslot on Saturday evenings, and for only having the first eight of its produced ten episodes scheduled for broadcast.<ref>Original announcement of BUGs series four's eight episode run on the Official BUGs website {{cite web |url=http://www.bugs.co.uk/s4news.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505003804/http://www.bugs.co.uk/s4news.html |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> Coupled with the [[Omagh Bombing]] forcing the [[BBC]] to postpone the series for a week, this meant that the concluding three episodes would not be broadcast until a year later. Another attempt to save the show by giving the series a cliffhanger ending was not successful, and the ending of the final episode &mdash; where Alex has just married boyfriend Adam, only to have him killed at the wedding and Ros and Beckett are abducted by an attacker unseen by the audience but recognised by Beckett &mdash; was never resolved.

The series has something of a minor cult following in the UK, not least for glaring production faults - for example in the first episode the cast are quite clearly stepping onto pre-chalked outlines to aid what was presumably a necessarily short external shot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
Overall 40 episodes were produced, ten in each of the four series. [[Virgin Publishing]] produced novelizations of the episodes of the first series, but these were not successful and subsequent episodes were not novelised. As of 2005, the series is available on [[DVD]] in series-by-series box set form, released by [[Revelation Films]]. A complete box set collection of all four series is also available.

It is part of the Lafayette [[Lafayette, Louisiana metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
St. Martinville is located at {{Coord|30|7|30|N|91|49|50|W|type:city}} (30.125053, -91.830593).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site]]]]
[[File:StMartinChurchWM.JPG|thumb|right|[[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church (St. Martinville, Louisiana)|St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church]]]]
In the 16th century, the area between the [[Atchafalaya River]], in Louisiana, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], in [[Texas]], was occupied by numerous tribes or subdivisions of the [[Attakapan]] people. The territory was not closed to outsiders, and several traders roamed through it on business.

Europeans did not begin to settle there until French explorers claimed and founded the colony of Louisiana in 1699. They referred to the territory between the Atchafalaya River and [[Bayou Nezpique]], where the Eastern Atakapa lived, as the Attakapas Territory, adopting the name from the Choctaw language term for this people. The French colonial government gave land away to French soldiers and settlers.

''Poste des Atakapas'' (Attakapas Post) was founded as a trading post on the banks of the Bayou Teche, and settlers started to arrive. Some came separately from [[France]], such as M. Masse, who came about 1754 from [[Grenoble]]. Gabriel [[Fuselier de la Claire]], a Frenchman from [[Lyon]], and some other Frenchmen from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], in present-day Alabama, arrived in late 1763 or early 1764.  Fuselier bought land between [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] and [[Bayou Teche]] from the Eastern Attakapas chief [[Kinemo]]. Shortly after that, the rival Appalousa ([[Opelousas]]) invaded the area via the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]] and [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]] rivers, and exterminated much of the Eastern Atakapan.  Gabriel Fuselier's son Agricole Fuselier was prominent in settling what developed as [[New Iberia, Louisiana]].

Gradually groups of more French speakers arrived, such as the first [[Acadians]] from [[Nova Scotia]]. They were assigned to this area in 1765 by [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]], the French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish. They had been [[Expulsion of Acadians|expelled from Acadia]] by the British, who had defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] and taken over its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Spain took over Louisiana and other territories west of the Mississippi but tended to rely on French colonists to administer ''[[La Louisiane]]''.

The Acadians were led by [[Joseph Broussard]]. In 1768-1769 fifteen families arrived from [[Pointe Coupee]], another French colonial community. Their members had migrated from [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Haïti]]) or from [[Paris]] via [[Fort de Chartres]], in present-day Illinois. Between the arrivals of the two groups, the French captain Étienne de Vaugine came in 1764 and acquired a large domain east of Bayou Teche.

On April 25, 1766, after the arrival of the first Acadians, the census showed a population of 409 inhabitants for the Attakapas region. In 1767 the Attakapas Post had 150 inhabitants before the arrival of the 15 families from Pointe Coupee.

In 1803, after losing his effort to regain control over Saint-Domingue during its slave revolt, [[Napoleon]] sold Louisiana in 1803 to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  The US settlers and territorial government organized the Attakapas Territory between 1807 and 1868. After Louisiana became a state, [[Saint Martin Parish]] was created. Attakapas Post was renamed as [[Saint Martinville]] and designated as the parish seat.

==Attractions==
[[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church (St. Martinville, Louisiana)|St. Martin of Tours Church]] is the oldest church parish in southwest Louisiana. It is known as the Mother Church of the Acadians because it was founded in 1765 upon the arrival of Acadians in this area. The current building has served as a center for religious activities in this predominantly Catholic community for over one hundred fifty years. Next to the church is a monument dedicated to the Militiamen of St Martinville (36 of the militiamen were French [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], three were [[Acadians]], and three colonial [[United States|Americans]], one's citizenship was not known) who took part with General [[Bernardo de Galvez]] in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Battle of Baton Rouge]].  The monument was erected by the Louisiana [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].

[http://members.aol.com/DuchampHouses/ La Maison Duchamp] on Main Street in St. Martinville, Louisiana was built by Eugène and Amélie Duchamp in 1876 as their town house. This St. Martinville landmark house has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]; future generations will be able to see its creative architecture.

[http://members.aol.com/StMartinTour/page15a.html Duchamp Opera House], which dates to the mid-19th century, hosted many theatrical companies in its lifetime and has recently been completely restored.  It once again hosts theatrical companies on the second floor.

The [http://members.aol.com/StMartinTour/page16a.html Evangeline Oak], made famous in [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s poem, \"[[Evangeline]]\", stands on the bank of the Bayou Teche. [[Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site]], containing an eighteenth-century Acadian cabin,  the Creole Maison Olivier, and a museum interpreting Acadian life, is located north of the historic district.

The St. Martinville post office contains a mural, ''Evangeline'', painted in 1940 by [[Minetta Good]]. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the [[United States]] through the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]], later called the [[Section of Fine Arts]], of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].

The African American Museum, located in the historic district, provides insights into the culture and life of the enslaved Africans and the Free People of Color in the community and their contributions to the Attakapas region from the 1750s on.  The ''gens de couleur libre'' were integral to building and service trades. Many descended from Africans from the Senegambian region of West Africa and from French and Spanish colonists.  The exhibit ends with panels on the Civil War and emancipation.   A permanent exhibit on Louisiana's participation in the slave triangle is also included, as well as maps in Creole and French detailing Louisiana's history.   {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The Acadian Memorial and Museum, located on the banks of the Bayou Teche in the historic district, tells the story of the approximately 3,000 Acadians who were forced by genocide to leave their home in Acadie (Maritime Provinces of Canada and Maine) and who arrived in the lower Louisiana territory between 1764 and 1785.   

The newly renovated [http://techetheater.com/ Old Teche Theater] offers entertainment to the town. The 1930s Art Deco movie house is now converted into a television and film studio as well as a performing arts venue and recording studio.

== History ==
[[File:Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site]]]]
[[File:StMartinChurchWM.JPG|thumb|right|[[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church (St. Martinville, Louisiana)|St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church]]]]
In the 16th century, the area between the [[Atchafalaya River]], in Louisiana, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], in [[Texas]], was occupied by numerous tribes or subdivisions of the [[Attakapan]] people. The territory was not closed to outsiders, and several traders roamed through it on business.

Europeans did not begin to settle there until French explorers claimed and founded the colony of Louisiana in 1699. They referred to the territory between the Atchafalaya River and [[Bayou Nezpique]], where the Eastern Atakapa lived, as the Attakapas Territory, adopting the name from the Choctaw language term for this people. The French colonial government gave land away to French soldiers and settlers.

''Poste des Atakapas'' (Attakapas Post) was founded as a trading post on the banks of the Bayou Teche, and settlers started to arrive. Some came separately from [[France]], such as M. Masse, who came about 1754 from [[Grenoble]]. Gabriel [[Fuselier de la Claire]], a Frenchman from [[Lyon]], and some other Frenchmen from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], in present-day Alabama, arrived in late 1763 or early 1764.  Fuselier bought land between [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] and [[Bayou Teche]] from the Eastern Attakapas chief [[Kinemo]]. Shortly after that, the rival Appalousa ([[Opelousas]]) invaded the area via the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]] and [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]] rivers, and exterminated much of the Eastern Atakapan.  Gabriel Fuselier's son Agricole Fuselier was prominent in settling what developed as [[New Iberia, Louisiana]].

Gradually groups of more French speakers arrived, such as the first [[Acadians]] from [[Nova Scotia]]. They were assigned to this area in 1765 by [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]], the French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish. They had been [[Expulsion of Acadians|expelled from Acadia]] by the British, who had defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] and taken over its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Spain took over Louisiana and other territories west of the Mississippi but tended to rely on French colonists to administer ''[[La Louisiane]]''.

The Acadians were led by [[Joseph Broussard]]. In 1768-1769 fifteen families arrived from [[Pointe Coupee]], another French colonial community. Their members had migrated from [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Haïti]]) or from [[Paris]] via [[Fort de Chartres]], in present-day Illinois. Between the arrivals of the two groups, the French captain Étienne de Vaugine came in 1764 and acquired a large domain east of Bayou Teche.

On April 25, 1766, after the arrival of the first Acadians, the census showed a population of 409 inhabitants for the Attakapas region. In 1767 the Attakapas Post had 150 inhabitants before the arrival of the 15 families from Pointe Coupee.

In 1803, after losing his effort to regain control over Saint-Domingue during its slave revolt, [[Napoleon]] sold Louisiana in 1803 to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  The US settlers and territorial government organized the Attakapas Territory between 1807 and 1868. After Louisiana became a state, [[Saint Martin Parish]] was created. Attakapas Post was renamed as [[Saint Martinville]] and designated as the parish seat.

==Attractions==
[[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church (St. Martinville, Louisiana)|St. Martin of Tours Church]] is the oldest church parish in southwest Louisiana. It is known as the Mother Church of the Acadians because it was founded in 1765 upon the arrival of Acadians in this area. The current building has served as a center for religious activities in this predominantly Catholic community for over one hundred fifty years. Next to the church is a monument dedicated to the Militiamen of St Martinville (36 of the militiamen were French [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], three were [[Acadians]], and three colonial [[United States|Americans]], one's citizenship was not known) who took part with General [[Bernardo de Galvez]] in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Battle of Baton Rouge]].  The monument was erected by the Louisiana [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].

[http://members.aol.com/DuchampHouses/ La Maison Duchamp] on Main Street in St. Martinville, Louisiana was built by Eugène and Amélie Duchamp in 1876 as their town house. This St. Martinville landmark house has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]; future generations will be able to see its creative architecture.

[http://members.aol.com/StMartinTour/page15a.html Duchamp Opera House], which dates to the mid-19th century, hosted many theatrical companies in its lifetime and has recently been completely restored.  It once again hosts theatrical companies on the second floor.

The [http://members.aol.com/StMartinTour/page16a.html Evangeline Oak], made famous in [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s poem, \"[[Evangeline]]\", stands on the bank of the Bayou Teche. [[Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site]], containing an eighteenth-century Acadian cabin,  the Creole Maison Olivier, and a museum interpreting Acadian life, is located north of the historic district.

The St. Martinville post office contains a mural, ''Evangeline'', painted in 1940 by [[Minetta Good]]. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the [[United States]] through the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]], later called the [[Section of Fine Arts]], of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].

The African American Museum, located in the historic district, provides insights into the culture and life of the enslaved Africans and the Free People of Color in the community and their contributions to the Attakapas region from the 1750s on.  The ''gens de couleur libre'' were integral to building and service trades. Many descended from Africans from the Senegambian region of West Africa and from French and Spanish colonists.  The exhibit ends with panels on the Civil War and emancipation.   A permanent exhibit on Louisiana's participation in the slave triangle is also included, as well as maps in Creole and French detailing Louisiana's history.   {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The Acadian Memorial and Museum, located on the banks of the Bayou Teche in the historic district, tells the story of the approximately 3,000 Acadians who were forced by genocide to leave their home in Acadie (Maritime Provinces of Canada and Maine) and who arrived in the lower Louisiana territory between 1764 and 1785.   

The newly renovated [http://techetheater.com/ Old Teche Theater] offers entertainment to the town. The 1930s Art Deco movie house is now converted into a television and film studio as well as a performing arts venue and recording studio.

[[Category:2003 in South Korean football]]","'''Group B of the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]]''' was one of four groups of nations, consisting of [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]], [[France women's national football team|France]], [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] and [[South Korea women's national football team|South Korea]]. It began on 20 September and ended on 27 September. Rising power Brazil topped the group, comfortably beating South Korea and Norway by large margins and were denied a 100% record by [[Marinette Pichon]]'s last minute equalizer against France. Brazil were joined in the second round by Norway, who won their other two games against France and South Korea, both which were making their debut at the World Cup.

'''''Rings''''' (known in Japan as '''''The Ring: Rebirth''''') is a 2017 American [[Supernatural horror film|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by [[F. Javier Gutiérrez]], written by [[David Loucka]], [[Jacob Aaron Estes]] and [[Akiva Goldsman]] and starring [[Matilda Lutz]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Johnny Galecki]], [[Aimee Teegarden]], [[Bonnie Morgan]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]. It is the third installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' series]], following the previous installments ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Ring Two]]'' (2005), and is based on elements of ''[[Spiral (Suzuki novel)|Spiral]]'' by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Kôji Suzuki]].

[[Paramount Pictures]] had initially planned a third film, originally titled ''The Ring 3D'', in early 2014, with Gutiérrez signed to direct the film from a screenplay written by Goldsman, Loucka, and Aaron Estes. [[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2015, in [[Atlanta]], and wrapped on May 31, 2015. Reshoots took place in July 2016.

''Rings'' was released in the United States on February 3, 2017, and opened #2 in the box office. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing its story, plot points and [[jump scare|jump scares]], but praised Lutz's performance. It has grossed $83{{nbsp}}million worldwide against its $25{{nbsp}}million budget.

== Plot ==
Ten years after the events of [[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]], [[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]], and [[The Ring Two]], on an airplane bound for [[Seattle]], a man reveals that he has watched [[Samara Morgan]]'s cursed [[videotape]]. Another passenger reveals she has seen the tape too and asks the man if he made a copy; he replies that he did not. Moments later, Samara causes the airplane to crash.

Two years later in 2015, college professor Gabriel Brown buys a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], discovering the videotape inside. Elsewhere, student Julia sees her boyfriend Holt off to college but grows concerned when he falls out of contact. She is inspired to find him when a panicked girl contacts her, asking for Holt's whereabouts. Julia meets Gabriel and finds a group of people known as the Sevens, who are involved in an experiment involving the cursed video. The group films themselves watching the video before passing the footage to another person called a \"tail\".

Julia recognizes the panicked girl, Skye, who takes her to her apartment to have her watch the video, but Holt warns her not to. Julia locks herself in the bathroom as Samara kills Skye. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has 12 hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark on her hand. Julia's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman: she realizes they must [[cremate]] Samara's physical remains.

Gabriel sends them to Sacrament Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial after the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2002 film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.}} He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is [[Braille]], translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to bury her in a [[potter's field]] outside town.

Heading for the field, Julia and Holt are stopped due to a car crash and learn Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia of his discovery but is killed by a falling [[utility pole]]. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower, finding evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant, held in captivity by the priest after being raped before she escaped eight months into the pregnancy.

Julia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of [[cicada]]s fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara cures Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara's corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.

While Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes [[Viral video|viral]], despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be \"[[resurrection|rebirth]]\", as Samara is reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 111 reviews and an average rating of 3.19/10, becoming the worst rated film of the trilogy. The site's critical consensus reads, \"''Rings'' may offer ardent fans of the franchise a few threadbare thrills, but for everyone else, it may feel like an endless loop of muddled mythology and rehashed plot points.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Rings (2017)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rings_2017|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Fandango|accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 25 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Rings reviews|url=https://metacritic.com/movie/rings|website=Metacritic|accessdate=February 10, 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C–\" on an A+ to F scale, lower than the B– and C+ earned by its respective predecessors.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

Alex Gilyadov of [[IGN]] gave the film a score 4.5/10, stating that it \"opts for lazy jump scares and a convoluted origins story no one asked for or needed\", though not dismissing that it has \"some chilling scenes and creepy visuals\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilyadov|first=Alex|title=''Rings'' Review|url=https://ign.com/articles/2017/02/04/rings-review|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the movie zero stars and called it a \"botch job\" that suffers from \"demo-worthy awfulness in directing, writing and acting\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Travers|title='Rings' Review: Latest Entry in Haunted-Video Franchise May Kill You With Boredom|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-rings-movie-review-w464098|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Peter Sobczynski of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave a single star, calling it \"More wearying than frightening\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Sobczynski |first=Peter|title=Rings Movie Review & Film Summary (2017)|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/rings-2017|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> A.A. Dowd of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that the film was a pale imitation of [[The Ring (2002 film)|the 2002 American remake]] in terms of visuals and plot structure. He also dismissed the film's characters as \"bland nothings\", citing their lack of development in the story.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dowd|first=A.A.|title=Samara goes digital in Rings, but this is still just a faded copy of last decade's scares|url=https://avclub.com/review/samara-goes-digital-rings-still-just-faded-copy-de-249684|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref>

Some critics applauded the film out of the US. Mike McCahill of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the film \"smoothly reinvents the wheel\" and \"the director has fun with the franchise's organising visual conceit and handles the setpieces with quiet aplomb\", pointing that \"the admirably loopy finale, involving blind Vincent d'Onofrio's swarming army of cicadas, is worthy of one of the better ''[[The Exorcist|Exorcist]]'' sequels\".<ref>{{cite news|last=McCahill|first=Mike|title=Spooky Ringu reboot smoothly reinvents the wheel (2017)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/03/rings-review-ringu-reboot-f-javier-gutierrez-japanese-cult-horror|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Javier Jimenez Montoya of [[Vavel]] also praised the film, stating that \"it's a step forward in the horror genre\" and applauding \"its strong, surprising ending\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jimenez|first=Javier|title=Critica de Rings, un paso hacia delante (2017)|url=https://www.vavel.com/es/cine/755908-critica-de-rings-un-paso-hacia-adelante.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Vavel.com|date=17 February 2017}}</ref>

The generally negative critical reception in the US, along with its lower-than-expected US box office intake, was partially blamed by some critics and fans for the cancellation of Paramount's newest installment of the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/friday-the-13th-reboot-canceled-paramount-1201979691/|title='Friday the 13th' Reboot Axed by Paramount|last=McNary |first=Dave|date=February 7, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=April 22, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Future==
Speaking at CinemaCon, Paramount Vice Chairman [[Rob Moore (executive)|Rob Moore]] said that should the film prove successful, more sequels could recur annually, taking the place of Paramount's ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comingsoon.net/movies/news/675589-cinemacon-paramount-pictures#/slide/1||title=CinemaCon: Paramount Pictures Teases Upcoming Slate|work=Coming Soon}}</ref> These plans were left in doubt following Moore's departure from the company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/rob-moore-out-at-paramount-pictures-exclusive-1201869165/|title=Rob Moore Out at Paramount Pictures (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Lang|first=Ramin Setoodeh,Brent|date=2016-09-23|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}</ref> In a post-release interview, Moore's successor, Megan Colligan, said that \"time will tell\" if another sequel is in the cards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-boxoffice-idUSKBN15K0QT|title=Box Office: 'Split' Tops 'Rings,' as 'Space Between Us' Bombs|date=2017-02-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-04-22}}</ref> Following Colligan's departure, there has been no update on a sequel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/jim-gianopulos-paramount-employees-interim-team-in-place-after-megan-colligan-exit-1202202872/|title=Jim Gianopulos Statement To Paramount Employees: Interim Team In Place After Megan Colligan Exit|date=2017-11-06|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=2017-11-07}}</ref>

In September 2019, ''[[The Grudge (2020 film)|The Grudge]]'' director [[Nicolas Pesce]] expressed interest in a [[Crossover (fiction)#Film|crossover film]] between ''The Grudge'' and the [[The Ring (franchise)#American film series|American ''The Ring'' film series]].<ref>https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3584775/nicolas-pesce-confirms-new-grudge-canonical-2004-version-exclusive/</ref>

'''''Rings''''' (known in Japan as '''''The Ring: Rebirth''''') is a 2017 American [[Supernatural horror film|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by [[F. Javier Gutiérrez]], written by [[David Loucka]], [[Jacob Aaron Estes]] and [[Akiva Goldsman]] and starring [[Matilda Lutz]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Johnny Galecki]], [[Aimee Teegarden]], [[Bonnie Morgan]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]. It is the third installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' series]], following the previous installments ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Ring Two]]'' (2005), and is based on elements of ''[[Spiral (Suzuki novel)|Spiral]]'' by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Kôji Suzuki]].

[[Paramount Pictures]] had initially planned a third film, originally titled ''The Ring 3D'', in early 2014, with Gutiérrez signed to direct the film from a screenplay written by Goldsman, Loucka, and Aaron Estes. [[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2015, in [[Atlanta]], and wrapped on May 31, 2015. Reshoots took place in July 2016.

''Rings'' was released in the United States on February 3, 2017, and opened #2 in the box office. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing its story, plot points and [[jump scare|jump scares]], but praised Lutz's performance. It has grossed $83{{nbsp}}million worldwide against its $25{{nbsp}}million budget.

== Plot ==
Ten years after the events of [[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring], [[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]], and [[The Ring Two]], on an airplane bound for [[Seattle]], a man reveals that he has watched [[Samara Morgan]]'s cursed [[videotape]]. Another passenger reveals she has seen the tape too and asks the man if he made a copy; he replies that he did not. Moments later, Samara causes the airplane to crash.

Two years later in 2015, college professor Gabriel Brown buys a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], discovering the videotape inside. Elsewhere, student Julia sees her boyfriend Holt off to college but grows concerned when he falls out of contact. She is inspired to find him when a panicked girl contacts her, asking for Holt's whereabouts. Julia meets Gabriel and finds a group of people known as the Sevens, who are involved in an experiment involving the cursed video. The group films themselves watching the video before passing the footage to another person called a \"tail\".

Julia recognizes the panicked girl, Skye, who takes her to her apartment to have her watch the video, but Holt warns her not to. Julia locks herself in the bathroom as Samara kills Skye. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has 12 hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark on her hand. Julia's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman: she realizes they must [[cremate]] Samara's physical remains.

Gabriel sends them to Sacrament Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial after the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2002 film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.}} He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is [[Braille]], translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to bury her in a [[potter's field]] outside town.

Heading for the field, Julia and Holt are stopped due to a car crash and learn Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia of his discovery but is killed by a falling [[utility pole]]. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower, finding evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant, held in captivity by the priest after being raped before she escaped eight months into the pregnancy.

Julia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of [[cicada]]s fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara cures Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara's corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.

While Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes [[Viral video|viral]], despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be \"[[resurrection|rebirth]]\", as Samara is reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 111 reviews and an average rating of 3.19/10, becoming the worst rated film of the trilogy. The site's critical consensus reads, \"''Rings'' may offer ardent fans of the franchise a few threadbare thrills, but for everyone else, it may feel like an endless loop of muddled mythology and rehashed plot points.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Rings (2017)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rings_2017|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Fandango|accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 25 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Rings reviews|url=https://metacritic.com/movie/rings|website=Metacritic|accessdate=February 10, 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C–\" on an A+ to F scale, lower than the B– and C+ earned by its respective predecessors.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

Alex Gilyadov of [[IGN]] gave the film a score 4.5/10, stating that it \"opts for lazy jump scares and a convoluted origins story no one asked for or needed\", though not dismissing that it has \"some chilling scenes and creepy visuals\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilyadov|first=Alex|title=''Rings'' Review|url=https://ign.com/articles/2017/02/04/rings-review|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the movie zero stars and called it a \"botch job\" that suffers from \"demo-worthy awfulness in directing, writing and acting\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Travers|title='Rings' Review: Latest Entry in Haunted-Video Franchise May Kill You With Boredom|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-rings-movie-review-w464098|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Peter Sobczynski of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave a single star, calling it \"More wearying than frightening\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Sobczynski |first=Peter|title=Rings Movie Review & Film Summary (2017)|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/rings-2017|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> A.A. Dowd of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that the film was a pale imitation of [[The Ring (2002 film)|the 2002 American remake]] in terms of visuals and plot structure. He also dismissed the film's characters as \"bland nothings\", citing their lack of development in the story.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dowd|first=A.A.|title=Samara goes digital in Rings, but this is still just a faded copy of last decade's scares|url=https://avclub.com/review/samara-goes-digital-rings-still-just-faded-copy-de-249684|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref>

Some critics applauded the film out of the US. Mike McCahill of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the film \"smoothly reinvents the wheel\" and \"the director has fun with the franchise's organising visual conceit and handles the setpieces with quiet aplomb\", pointing that \"the admirably loopy finale, involving blind Vincent d'Onofrio's swarming army of cicadas, is worthy of one of the better ''[[The Exorcist|Exorcist]]'' sequels\".<ref>{{cite news|last=McCahill|first=Mike|title=Spooky Ringu reboot smoothly reinvents the wheel (2017)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/03/rings-review-ringu-reboot-f-javier-gutierrez-japanese-cult-horror|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Javier Jimenez Montoya of [[Vavel]] also praised the film, stating that \"it's a step forward in the horror genre\" and applauding \"its strong, surprising ending\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jimenez|first=Javier|title=Critica de Rings, un paso hacia delante (2017)|url=https://www.vavel.com/es/cine/755908-critica-de-rings-un-paso-hacia-adelante.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Vavel.com|date=17 February 2017}}</ref>

The generally negative critical reception in the US, along with its lower-than-expected US box office intake, was partially blamed by some critics and fans for the cancellation of Paramount's newest installment of the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/friday-the-13th-reboot-canceled-paramount-1201979691/|title='Friday the 13th' Reboot Axed by Paramount|last=McNary |first=Dave|date=February 7, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=April 22, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Future==
Speaking at CinemaCon, Paramount Vice Chairman [[Rob Moore (executive)|Rob Moore]] said that should the film prove successful, more sequels could recur annually, taking the place of Paramount's ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comingsoon.net/movies/news/675589-cinemacon-paramount-pictures#/slide/1||title=CinemaCon: Paramount Pictures Teases Upcoming Slate|work=Coming Soon}}</ref> These plans were left in doubt following Moore's departure from the company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/rob-moore-out-at-paramount-pictures-exclusive-1201869165/|title=Rob Moore Out at Paramount Pictures (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Lang|first=Ramin Setoodeh,Brent|date=2016-09-23|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}</ref> In a post-release interview, Moore's successor, Megan Colligan, said that \"time will tell\" if another sequel is in the cards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-boxoffice-idUSKBN15K0QT|title=Box Office: 'Split' Tops 'Rings,' as 'Space Between Us' Bombs|date=2017-02-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-04-22}}</ref> Following Colligan's departure, there has been no update on a sequel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/jim-gianopulos-paramount-employees-interim-team-in-place-after-megan-colligan-exit-1202202872/|title=Jim Gianopulos Statement To Paramount Employees: Interim Team In Place After Megan Colligan Exit|date=2017-11-06|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=2017-11-07}}</ref>

In September 2019, ''[[The Grudge (2020 film)|The Grudge]]'' director [[Nicolas Pesce]] expressed interest in a [[Crossover (fiction)#Film|crossover film]] between ''The Grudge'' and the [[The Ring (franchise)#American film series|American ''The Ring'' film series]].<ref>https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3584775/nicolas-pesce-confirms-new-grudge-canonical-2004-version-exclusive/</ref>

'''''Rings''''' (known in Japan as '''''The Ring: Rebirth''''') is a 2017 American [[Supernatural horror film|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by [[F. Javier Gutiérrez]], written by [[David Loucka]], [[Jacob Aaron Estes]] and [[Akiva Goldsman]] and starring [[Matilda Lutz]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Johnny Galecki]], [[Aimee Teegarden]], [[Bonnie Morgan]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]. It is the third installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' series]], following the previous installments ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Ring Two]]'' (2005), and is based on elements of ''[[Spiral (Suzuki novel)|Spiral]]'' by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Kôji Suzuki]].

[[Paramount Pictures]] had initially planned a third film, originally titled ''The Ring 3D'', in early 2014, with Gutiérrez signed to direct the film from a screenplay written by Goldsman, Loucka, and Aaron Estes. [[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2015, in [[Atlanta]], and wrapped on May 31, 2015. Reshoots took place in July 2016.

''Rings'' was released in the United States on February 3, 2017, and opened #2 in the box office. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing its story, plot points and [[jump scare|jump scares]], but praised Lutz's performance. It has grossed $83{{nbsp}}million worldwide against its $25{{nbsp}}million budget.

== Plot ==
Ten years after the events of [[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]], [[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]], and [[The Ring Two]], on an airplane bound for [[Seattle]], a man reveals that he has watched [[Samara Morgan]]'s cursed [[videotape]]. Another passenger reveals she has seen the tape too and asks the man if he made a copy; he replies that he did not. Moments later, Samara causes the airplane to crash.

Two years later in 2015, college professor Gabriel Brown buys a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], discovering the videotape inside. Elsewhere, student Julia sees her boyfriend Holt off to college but grows concerned when he falls out of contact. She is inspired to find him when a panicked girl contacts her, asking for Holt's whereabouts. Julia meets Gabriel and finds a group of people known as the Sevens, who are involved in an experiment involving the cursed video. The group films themselves watching the video before passing the footage to another person called a \"tail\".

Julia recognizes the panicked girl, Skye, who takes her to her apartment to have her watch the video, but Holt warns her not to. Julia locks herself in the bathroom as Samara kills Skye. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has 12 hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark on her hand. Julia's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman: she realizes they must [[cremate]] Samara's physical remains.

Gabriel sends them to Sacrament Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial after the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains. He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is [[Braille]], translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to bury her in a [[potter's field]] outside town.

Heading for the field, Julia and Holt are stopped due to a car crash and learn Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia of his discovery but is killed by a falling [[utility pole]]. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower, finding evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant, held in captivity by the priest after being raped before she escaped eight months into the pregnancy.

Julia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of [[cicada]]s fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara cures Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara's corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.

While Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes [[Viral video|viral]], despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be \"[[resurrection|rebirth]]\", as Samara is reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 111 reviews and an average rating of 3.19/10, becoming the worst rated film of the trilogy. The site's critical consensus reads, \"''Rings'' may offer ardent fans of the franchise a few threadbare thrills, but for everyone else, it may feel like an endless loop of muddled mythology and rehashed plot points.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Rings (2017)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rings_2017|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Fandango|accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 25 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Rings reviews|url=https://metacritic.com/movie/rings|website=Metacritic|accessdate=February 10, 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C–\" on an A+ to F scale, lower than the B– and C+ earned by its respective predecessors.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

Alex Gilyadov of [[IGN]] gave the film a score 4.5/10, stating that it \"opts for lazy jump scares and a convoluted origins story no one asked for or needed\", though not dismissing that it has \"some chilling scenes and creepy visuals\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilyadov|first=Alex|title=''Rings'' Review|url=https://ign.com/articles/2017/02/04/rings-review|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the movie zero stars and called it a \"botch job\" that suffers from \"demo-worthy awfulness in directing, writing and acting\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Travers|title='Rings' Review: Latest Entry in Haunted-Video Franchise May Kill You With Boredom|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-rings-movie-review-w464098|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Peter Sobczynski of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave a single star, calling it \"More wearying than frightening\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Sobczynski |first=Peter|title=Rings Movie Review & Film Summary (2017)|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/rings-2017|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> A.A. Dowd of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that the film was a pale imitation of [[The Ring (2002 film)|the 2002 American remake]] in terms of visuals and plot structure. He also dismissed the film's characters as \"bland nothings\", citing their lack of development in the story.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dowd|first=A.A.|title=Samara goes digital in Rings, but this is still just a faded copy of last decade's scares|url=https://avclub.com/review/samara-goes-digital-rings-still-just-faded-copy-de-249684|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The A.V.

Some critics applauded the film out of the US. Mike McCahill of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the film \"smoothly reinvents the wheel\" and \"the director has fun with the franchise's organising visual conceit and handles the setpieces with quiet aplomb\", pointing that \"the admirably loopy finale, involving blind Vincent d'Onofrio's swarming army of cicadas, is worthy of one of the better ''[[The Exorcist|Exorcist]]'' sequels\".<ref>{{cite news|last=McCahill|first=Mike|title=Spooky Ringu reboot smoothly reinvents the wheel (2017)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/03/rings-review-ringu-reboot-f-javier-gutierrez-japanese-cult-horror|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Javier Jimenez Montoya of [[Vavel]] also praised the film, stating that \"it's a step forward in the horror genre\" and applauding \"its strong, surprising ending\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jimenez|first=Javier|title=Critica de Rings, un paso hacia delante (2017)|url=https://www.vavel.com/es/cine/755908-critica-de-rings-un-paso-hacia-adelante.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Vavel.com|date=17 February 2017}}</ref>

The generally negative critical reception in the US, along with its lower-than-expected US box office intake, was partially blamed by some critics and fans for the cancellation of Paramount's newest installment of the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/friday-the-13th-reboot-canceled-paramount-1201979691/|title='Friday the 13th' Reboot Axed by Paramount|last=McNary |first=Dave|date=February 7, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=April 22, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

Speaking at CinemaCon, Paramount Vice Chairman [[Rob Moore (executive)|Rob Moore]] said that should the film prove successful, more sequels could recur annually, taking the place of Paramount's ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comingsoon.net/movies/news/675589-cinemacon-paramount-pictures#/slide/1||title=CinemaCon: Paramount Pictures Teases Upcoming Slate|work=Coming Soon}}</ref> These plans were left in doubt following Moore's departure from the company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/rob-moore-out-at-paramount-pictures-exclusive-1201869165/|title=Rob Moore Out at Paramount Pictures (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Lang|first=Ramin Setoodeh,Brent|date=2016-09-23|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}</ref> In a post-release interview, Moore's successor, Megan Colligan, said that \"time will tell\" if another sequel is in the cards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-boxoffice-idUSKBN15K0QT|title=Box Office: 'Split' Tops 'Rings,' as 'Space Between Us' Bombs|date=2017-02-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-04-22}}</ref> Following Colligan's departure, there has been no update on a sequel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/jim-gianopulos-paramount-employees-interim-team-in-place-after-megan-colligan-exit-1202202872/|title=Jim Gianopulos Statement To Paramount Employees: Interim Team In Place After Megan Colligan Exit|date=2017-11-06|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=2017-11-07}}</ref>

'''''Rings''''' (known in Japan as '''''The Ring: Rebirth''''') is a 2017 American [[Supernatural horror film|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by [[F. Javier Gutiérrez]], written by [[David Loucka]], [[Jacob Aaron Estes]] and [[Akiva Goldsman]] and starring [[Matilda Lutz]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Johnny Galecki]], [[Aimee Teegarden]], [[Bonnie Morgan]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]. It is the third installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' series]], following the previous installments ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Ring Two]]'' (2005), and is based on elements of ''[[Spiral (Suzuki novel)|Spiral]]'' by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Kôji Suzuki]].

[[Paramount Pictures]] had initially planned a third film, originally titled ''The Ring 3D'', in early 2014, with Gutiérrez signed to direct the film from a screenplay written by Goldsman, Loucka, and Aaron Estes. [[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2015, in [[Atlanta]], and wrapped on May 31, 2015. Reshoots took place in July 2016.

''Rings'' was released in the United States on February 3, 2017, and opened #2 in the box office. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing its story, plot points and [[jump scare|jump scares]], but praised Lutz's performance. It has grossed $83{{nbsp}}million worldwide against its $25{{nbsp}}million budget.

== Plot ==
Ten years after the events of [[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]], [[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]], and [[The Ring Two]], on an airplane bound for [[Seattle]], a man reveals that he has watched [[Samara Morgan]]'s cursed [[videotape]]. Another passenger reveals she has seen the tape too and asks the man if he made a copy; he replies that he did not. Moments later, Samara causes the airplane to crash.

Two years later in 2015, college professor Gabriel Brown buys a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], discovering the videotape inside. Elsewhere, student Julia sees her boyfriend Holt off to college but grows concerned when he falls out of contact. She is inspired to find him when a panicked girl contacts her, asking for Holt's whereabouts. Julia meets Gabriel and finds a group of people known as the Sevens, who are involved in an experiment involving the cursed video. The group films themselves watching the video before passing the footage to another person called a \"tail\".

Julia recognizes the panicked girl, Skye, who takes her to her apartment to have her watch the video, but Holt warns her not to. Julia locks herself in the bathroom as Samara kills Skye. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has 12 hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark on her hand. Julia's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman: she realizes they must [[cremate]] Samara's physical remains.

Gabriel sends them to Sacrament Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial after the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2002 film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.}} He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is [[Braille]], translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to bury her in a [[potter's field]] outside town.

Heading for the field, Julia and Holt are stopped due to a car crash and learn Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia of his discovery but is killed by a falling [[utility pole]]. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower, finding evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant, held in captivity by the priest after being raped before she escaped eight months into the pregnancy.

Julia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of [[cicada]]s fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara cures Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara's corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.

While Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes [[Viral video|viral]], despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be \"[[resurrection|rebirth]]\", as Samara is reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 111 reviews and an average rating of 3.19/10, becoming the worst rated film of the trilogy. The site's critical consensus reads, \"''Rings'' may offer ardent fans of the franchise a few threadbare thrills, but for everyone else, it may feel like an endless loop of muddled mythology and rehashed plot points.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Rings (2017)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rings_2017|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Fandango|accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 25 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Rings reviews|url=https://metacritic.com/movie/rings|website=Metacritic|accessdate=February 10, 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C–\" on an A+ to F scale, lower than the B– and C+ earned by its respective predecessors.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

Alex Gilyadov of [[IGN]] gave the film a score 4.5/10, stating that it \"opts for lazy jump scares and a convoluted origins story no one asked for or needed\", though not dismissing that it has \"some chilling scenes and creepy visuals\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilyadov|first=Alex|title=''Rings'' Review|url=https://ign.com/articles/2017/02/04/rings-review|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the movie zero stars and called it a \"botch job\" that suffers from \"demo-worthy awfulness in directing, writing and acting\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Travers|title='Rings' Review: Latest Entry in Haunted-Video Franchise May Kill You With Boredom|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-rings-movie-review-w464098|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Peter Sobczynski of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave a single star, calling it \"More wearying than frightening\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Sobczynski |first=Peter|title=Rings Movie Review & Film Summary (2017)|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/rings-2017|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> A.A. Dowd of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that the film was a pale imitation of [[The Ring (2002 film)|the 2002 American remake]] in terms of visuals and plot structure. He also dismissed the film's characters as \"bland nothings\", citing their lack of development in the story.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dowd|first=A.A.|title=Samara goes digital in Rings, but this is still just a faded copy of last decade's scares|url=https://avclub.com/review/samara-goes-digital-rings-still-just-faded-copy-de-249684|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref>

Some critics applauded the film out of the US. Mike McCahill of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the film \"smoothly reinvents the wheel\" and \"the director has fun with the franchise's organising visual conceit and handles the setpieces with quiet aplomb\", pointing that \"the admirably loopy finale, involving blind Vincent d'Onofrio's swarming army of cicadas, is worthy of one of the better ''[[The Exorcist|Exorcist]]'' sequels\".<ref>{{cite news|last=McCahill|first=Mike|title=Spooky Ringu reboot smoothly reinvents the wheel (2017)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/03/rings-review-ringu-reboot-f-javier-gutierrez-japanese-cult-horror|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Javier Jimenez Montoya of [[Vavel]] also praised the film, stating that \"it's a step forward in the horror genre\" and applauding \"its strong, surprising ending\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jimenez|first=Javier|title=Critica de Rings, un paso hacia delante (2017)|url=https://www.vavel.com/es/cine/755908-critica-de-rings-un-paso-hacia-adelante.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Vavel.com|date=17 February 2017}}</ref>

The generally negative critical reception in the US, along with its lower-than-expected US box office intake, was partially blamed by some critics and fans for the cancellation of Paramount's newest installment of the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/friday-the-13th-reboot-canceled-paramount-1201979691/|title='Friday the 13th' Reboot Axed by Paramount|last=McNary |first=Dave|date=February 7, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=April 22, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Future==
Speaking at CinemaCon, Paramount Vice Chairman [[Rob Moore (executive)|Rob Moore]] said that should the film prove successful, more sequels could recur annually, taking the place of Paramount's ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comingsoon.net/movies/news/675589-cinemacon-paramount-pictures#/slide/1||title=CinemaCon: Paramount Pictures Teases Upcoming Slate|work=Coming Soon}}</ref> These plans were left in doubt following Moore's departure from the company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/rob-moore-out-at-paramount-pictures-exclusive-1201869165/|title=Rob Moore Out at Paramount Pictures (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Lang|first=Ramin Setoodeh,Brent|date=2016-09-23|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}</ref> In a post-release interview, Moore's successor, Megan Colligan, said that \"time will tell\" if another sequel is in the cards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-boxoffice-idUSKBN15K0QT|title=Box Office: 'Split' Tops 'Rings,' as 'Space Between Us' Bombs|date=2017-02-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-04-22}}</ref> Following Colligan's departure, there has been no update on a sequel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/jim-gianopulos-paramount-employees-interim-team-in-place-after-megan-colligan-exit-1202202872/|title=Jim Gianopulos Statement To Paramount Employees: Interim Team In Place After Megan Colligan Exit|date=2017-11-06|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=2017-11-07}}</ref>

In September 2019, ''[[The Grudge (2020 film)|The Grudge]]'' director [[Nicolas Pesce]] expressed interest in a [[Crossover (fiction)#Film|crossover film]] between ''The Grudge'' and the [[The Ring (franchise)#American film series|American ''The Ring'' film series]].<ref>https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3584775/nicolas-pesce-confirms-new-grudge-canonical-2004-version-exclusive/</ref>

This was an early area of [[Roman Catholic]] [[missionary]] activity by the [[Society of Jesus]] in what was then called the Province of Paraguay, beginning in the early 17th century. In 1984 the ruins of four mission sites in Argentina were designated [[World Heritage Sites]] by UNESCO.<ref>{{cite web|url={{wdl|2835}} |author=Garriga, Antonio |date=1713 |title=Instruccion practica para ordenar santamente la vidà; que ofrece el P.

==History==
{{see also|History of yerba mate}}
[[Image:Ruins of the São Miguel das Missões.jpg|thumb|left|240px|1846 impression of [[San Ignacio Miní]], a Jesuit Reduction, abandoned following the temporary abolition of the order in 1773.]]

Indigenous peoples of various cultures lived in the area of the future province for thousands of years. At the time of European encounter, it was occupied by the [[Kaingang]] and [[Xokleng people|Xokleng]], later followed by the [[Guarani people|Guarani]]. The first European to visit the region, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], discovered Apipé Falls while navigating the [[Paraná River]] in December 1527. In 1541 [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] reached the [[Iguazu Falls|Iguazú Falls]].

In the 17th century, members of the [[Society of Jesus]] came to the region as missionaries. They began to establish a string of [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit ''Reductions'']], most notably that of [[San Ignacio Miní|San Ignacio]]. In a few years they set up 30 mission villages. They taught the Guarani western-style agriculture and crafts. Their crafts were sold and traded along the river and they shared in the Reductions' prosperity.

In 1759 the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] government, at the insistence of its anti-Jesuit [[Secretary of State]], the [[Marquis de Pombal]], ordered all Reductions closed in [[colonial Brazil|its territory]] (which then included much of present-day Misiones Province). The Marquis eventually prevailed in 1773 on Pope [[Clement XIV]] to have the Jesuit Order [[Suppression of the Jesuits|suppressed]].  With the abandoning of the missions, the prosperous trade surrounding these Reductions quickly vanished. Colonists imposed a brutal [[plantation]] economy in the region, forcing the Guarani to act as slave labor.

[[Image:Puerto de Posadas 1892.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Steamer on the riverbank at Posadas, 1892.]]

In 1814, [[Gervasio Posadas]], the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Director]] of the [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata]], declared Misiones annexed to Argentina's [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] (at this time Argentina was quasi-independent but nominally still a Spanish colony). Argentina did not exert ''de facto'' control over Misiones, which was claimed by several countries and effectively governed itself. In 1830 Argentine military forces from [[Corrientes Province]] took control of Misiones.

In 1838 [[Paraguay]] occupied Misiones, claiming the area on the basis that the Misiones population consisted of indigenous Guarani, the major ethnic group of Paraguay. In 1865 Paraguayan forces invaded Misiones again in what became the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] (1864–1870). Following the defeat of Paraguay and its peace agreement with Argentina (eventually signed in 1876), Paraguay gave up its claim to the Misiones territory.

Although Argentina had claimed Misiones since 1814, academics tend to interpret Argentine possession of Misiones as beginning with the defeat of Paraguay in the War of the Triple Alliance. Bethell writes that \"the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|treaty of alliance]] [i.e. against Paraguay] contained secret clauses providing for the annexation of disputed territory in northern Paraguay by Brazil and regions in the east and west of Paraguay by Argentina... After a long and harrowing war (1865–70), Argentina got it from a prostrate Paraguay territory in Misiones.\"<ref>Bethell ''Argentina since Independence'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, pp. 45–6</ref> Scobie states that \"the political status of Misiones remained vague\" and that Argentina gained the region \"as a by-product of the Paraguayan war in the 1860s\".<ref>Scobie ''Argentina'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1964, pages 22–3</ref>

[[Image:Ukranian immigrants cropping yerba mate in Tres Capones, Misiones.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] immigrants harvest [[yerba mate]] in 1920. Despite challenging conditions, Misiones attracted considerable European immigration in the early 20th-century.]]

The [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] left Paraguay much impoverished, and Misiones benefited economically from belonging to Argentina. In 1876 the Argentine President [[Nicolás Avellaneda]], assisted by his close friend, General Pietro Canestro (an Italian nobleman who devoted much of his life and wealth to the achievement and sustainability of the peace in the region), proclaimed the [[Immigration in Argentina|Immigration and Colonization Law]]. This law fostered the immigration of European colonists in order to populate the vast unspoiled Argentinian territories.

Several colonizing companies formed under this law. One of them, Adolf Schwelm's ''Eldorado Colonización y Explotación de Bosques Ltda. S.A.'', founded the city of [[Eldorado, Misiones|Eldorado]] in 1919 with a port on the Upper Paraná. Its agricultural colonies and experimental farms, the orange- and grapefruit-tree plantations, and the cultivation of yerba mate, the mills and the dryers for such product are characteristic of this area. [[Swedish-Argentines]] became well known for growing [[yerba mate]].

Misiones received many immigrants, mostly from Europe, coming mainly via Southern Brazil. Some came from Buenos Aires, and from Eastern Europe, in particular large numbers of [[Polish minority in Argentina|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians of Argentina|Ukrainian]]s. Since then{{when|date=February 2016}}, Misiones has continued to benefit economically and has developed politically within Argentina. It has been successfully integrated into the Argentine state.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} {{As of | 2016}} control of the province is not contested. On December 10, 1953 the \"National Territory of Misiones\" gained [[provinces of Argentina|provincial]] status in accordance with Law 14.294, and its constitution was approved on April 21, 1958.

Misiones received more attention from national policy-makers following an international agreement (1973) to construct the [[Yacyretá]] hydroelectric dam on a point in the [[Paraná River]] shared by Paraguay and Corrientes Province. When the dam became fully operative in the 1990s, the Paraná's waters all along the Misiones shores rose. They flooded lands that the dam's authorities had failed to clear and condition adequately, resulting in the onset of mosquito-transmitted illnesses, such as [[leishmaniasis]], [[yellow fever]], [[dengue]], and [[malaria]]. The entire Misiones shores along the Paraná River is now confined by two dams, one of them Yaciretá, downstream of the river, and the other [[Itaipu dam|Itaipú]], located in Brazil and Paraguay, upstream of the river and north of [[Puerto Iguazú]]. {{As of | 2016}} Argentina is pursuing an agreement with Paraguay to expand the reservoir works in order to double the facility's [[Electricity sector in Argentina|electricity production]].

== Geography ==
[[Image:Misiones - Ruta Nacional 12.jpg|thumb|right|240px|View along Route 12, near [[Puerto Iguazu]].]]
Misiones is the second smallest province after [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]].
[[File:Misiones - Parque provincial Salto Encantado desde ruta 7 (2).jpg|thumb|240px|[[Alto Paraná Atlantic forests]]]]
The Misiones plateau includes a part of Brazil across the border. The rocks contain significant quantities of iron which forms a part of the soil, giving it a reddish color. At the center of the plateau rises the Sierra de Misiones, its highest peak, 843 m, near Bernardo de Irigoyen, in the Cerro Rincón.

The province is embraced by three big rivers including the [[Paraná River|Paraná]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and [[Iguazú River|Iguazú]]. [[Iguazu Falls]] are spectacular [[waterfall]]s on the Iguazú River in the northwest corner of the province, near the city of [[Puerto Iguazú]]. Misiones shares the falls with the Brazilian state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] (in that nation's Southern Region). Meanwhile, the international border with [[Paraguay]] is close by.

== Climate ==
{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}

The province has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characterized by a lack of a dry season and abundant rainfall throughout the year.<ref name=turismoclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330035342/http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archivedate=30 March 2017 |title=Geografía |publisher=Ministerio de Turismo |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], it is classified as ''Cfa''.<ref name=IRNclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925103809/http://www.mineria.gov.ar/estudios/irn/misiones/m-1.asp |archivedate=25 September 2011 |title=Provincia de Misiones–Clima y Meteorologia |publisher=Secretaria de Mineria de la Nacion (Argentina) |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> There are four distinct seasons although winters and autumns are fairly short.<ref name=IRNclima/> The mean annual temperature is around {{convert|21|C|F|0}}.<ref name=turismoclima/> June–August typically register the coldest days when temperatures can fall below {{convert|10|C|F|0}}.<ref name=turismoclima/> However, rare incursions of polar air into the province from the south can lead to frost.<ref name=IRNclima/> Summers are hot with temperatures exceeding {{convert|32|C|F|0}} from December to February.<ref name=turismoclima/> One of the main characteristic is the presence of hills in the central and northern parts of the province leading to lower temperatures as a result of the higher elevation.<ref name=IRNclima/> Average annual rainfall ranges from a low of {{convert|1870|mm|in|0}} in the south to {{convert|2360|mm|in|0}} in the north.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} The rainfall pattern in the province has a [[bimodal]] distribution with two peaks occurring in Spring and Autumn with winters being the driest.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} The exceptions are the north and higher altitude areas where precipitation is well distributed throughout the year.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} Snowfall has occurred at the higher hills.<ref name=IRNclima/> For example, during the winter of 1975, snowfall was observed and accumulated in Bernando de Irigoyen, one of the coldest towns in the province due to its high altitude {{convert|815|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IRNclima/> Owing to the humid climate and high rainfall, relative humidity is high.<ref name=IRNclima/>

The vegetation is the so-called \"{{Interlanguage link multi|Selva Misionera|es|3=Selva misionera}}\". Part of it has been transformed by mankind to implant cultures and ranching. The original biome is protected in [[Iguazú National Park]], part of the [[Alto Paraná Atlantic forests]], in turn part of the [[Atlantic Forest]] [[biome]].

== Population ==
There are 1,101,593 people living in Misiones according to the national census of 2010. A part of the population is descendant of indigenous peoples (especially [[Guaranis]]) and also Spanish who reached during the colonization and mixed with natives. Another part of the residents are descendants of European [[Immigration to Argentina|immigrants]]. Unlike many regions of Argentina, where the immigrants came through [[Buenos Aires]], most of the immigrants who settled in Misiones came through [[Southern Brazil]]. The ethnic groups who settled in Misiones after Spaniards are [[Italian people|Italians]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]], [[Russian people|Russians]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Danish people|Danes]] and a small number of [[Arabs]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and, recently, [[Laotians]] (in the late 1970s) and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (in the 2000s). From the 1960s, the province has also received immigrants from [[Brazil]] (mostly descendants of [[East Europeans]]) and [[Paraguay]] (mostly descendants both of indigenous peoples and Spaniards).

The literacy rate is 91.4%.

== Economy ==

[[Image:Yerba-mate-misiones.JPG|thumb|left|Yerba mate plantation.]]

Misiones' [[economics|economy]], like most in northern Argentina, is relatively underdeveloped yet fairly well-diversified. Its 2006 output was estimated at US$4.8 billion (which shall be around US$7.2 billion in 2011, according to Argentina's economical growing) or US$4,940 per capita (around US$6,500 in 2011), over 40% below the national average.<ref>[http://www.iader.org.ar/ I.A.D.E.R<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Though its rainy, erosion-prone geography discourages [[intensive crop farming]], [[agriculture]] makes an important contribution to the province's economy, adding about 10% to the total. Misiones' thick forests have long provided for the ample production of roundwood without excessive impact on its [[ecosystem]]. The principal exploited trees are the [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paraná pine]], Guatambú, Cedar, Petiribí, Incense, Cane water-pipe, Anchico, Eucalyptus and Gueycá.

Misiones' chief source of agricultural income, however, has long been the cultivation of [[yerba mate]]: Misiones is Argentina's leading producer (yielding about half a million tons, annually).  [[Tea]], citrus fruit and, in minor amounts, [[tobacco]], sugar cane, rice, coffee, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coconut]] are also cultivated in Misiones.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Light [[manufacturing]] and [[tourism]] also contribute to the local economy, each adding about 13% to the total.

== Government ==
[[Image:Casa-de-gobierno-misiones.jpg|thumb|Governor's offices, Posadas]]
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.
{{main|	Chamber of Representatives of Misiones |Governor of Misiones Province }}
The Constitution of Misiones Province forms the formal law of the province.
[[File:Bandera de ceremonias de la Unidad Regional IX (Jardín América) - Policía de Misiones.jpg|thumb|Misiones Provincial Police]]
In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the [[Argentine Federal Police]] but the additional work is carried out by the [[Misiones Provincial Police]].

== Political division ==
[[Image:Depmisiones.jpg|thumb|Misiones Province, Political Division]]

The province is divided in 17 [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] (Spanish: ''departamentos''):

'''Misiones''' ({{IPA-es|miˈsjones}}, ''Missions'') is one of the [[Provinces of Argentina|23 provinces]] of [[Argentina]], located in the northeastern corner of the country in the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]] region. It is [[Salient (geography)|surrounded]] by [[Paraguay]] to the northwest, [[Brazil]] to the north, east and south, and [[Corrientes Province]] of Argentina to the southwest.

This was an early area of [[Roman Catholic]] [[missionary]] activity by the [[Society of Jesus]] in what was then called the Province of Paraguay, beginning in the early 17th century. In 1984 the ruins of four mission sites in Argentina were designated [[World Heritage Sites]] by UNESCO.<ref>{{cite web|url={{wdl|2835}} |author=Garriga, Antonio |date=1713 |title=Instruccion practica para ordenar santamente la vidà; que ofrece el P.

==History==
{{see also|History of yerba mate}}
[[Image:Ruins of the São Miguel das Missões.jpg|thumb|left|240px|1846 impression of [[San Ignacio Miní]], a Jesuit Reduction, abandoned following the temporary abolition of the order in 1773.]]

Indigenous peoples of various cultures lived in the area of the future province for thousands of years. At the time of European encounter, it was occupied by the [[Kaingang]] and [[Xokleng people|Xokleng]], later followed by the [[Guarani people|Guarani]]. The first European to visit the region, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], discovered Apipé Falls while navigating the [[Paraná River]] in December 1527. In 1541 [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] reached the [[Iguazu Falls|Iguazú Falls]].

In the 17th century, members of the [[Society of Jesus]] came to the region as missionaries. They began to establish a string of [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit ''Reductions'']], most notably that of [[San Ignacio Miní|San Ignacio]]. In a few years they set up 30 mission villages. They taught the Guarani western-style agriculture and crafts. Their crafts were sold and traded along the river and they shared in the Reductions' prosperity.

In 1759 the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] government, at the insistence of its anti-Jesuit [[Secretary of State]], the [[Marquis de Pombal]], ordered all Reductions closed in [[colonial Brazil|its territory]] (which then included much of present-day Misiones Province). The Marquis eventually prevailed in 1773 on Pope [[Clement XIV]] to have the Jesuit Order [[Suppression of the Jesuits|suppressed]].  With the abandoning of the missions, the prosperous trade surrounding these Reductions quickly vanished. Colonists imposed a brutal [[plantation]] economy in the region, forcing the Guarani to act as slave labor.

[[Image:Puerto de Posadas 1892.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Steamer on the riverbank at Posadas, 1892.]]

In 1814, [[Gervasio Posadas]], the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Director]] of the [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata]], declared Misiones annexed to Argentina's [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] (at this time Argentina was quasi-independent but nominally still a Spanish colony). Argentina did not exert ''de facto'' control over Misiones, which was claimed by several countries and effectively governed itself. In 1830 Argentine military forces from [[Corrientes Province]] took control of Misiones.

In 1838 [[Paraguay]] occupied Misiones, claiming the area on the basis that the Misiones population consisted of indigenous Guarani, the major ethnic group of Paraguay. In 1865 Paraguayan forces invaded Misiones again in what became the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] (1864–1870). Following the defeat of Paraguay and its peace agreement with Argentina (eventually signed in 1876), Paraguay gave up its claim to the Misiones territory.

Although Argentina had claimed Misiones since 1814, academics tend to interpret Argentine possession of Misiones as beginning with the defeat of Paraguay in the War of the Triple Alliance. Bethell writes that \"the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|treaty of alliance]] [i.e. against Paraguay] contained secret clauses providing for the annexation of disputed territory in northern Paraguay by Brazil and regions in the east and west of Paraguay by Argentina... After a long and harrowing war (1865–70), Argentina got it from a prostrate Paraguay territory in Misiones.\"<ref>Bethell ''Argentina since Independence'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, pp. 45–6</ref> Scobie states that \"the political status of Misiones remained vague\" and that Argentina gained the region \"as a by-product of the Paraguayan war in the 1860s\".<ref>Scobie ''Argentina'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1964, pages 22–3</ref>

[[Image:Ukranian immigrants cropping yerba mate in Tres Capones, Misiones.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] immigrants harvest [[yerba mate]] in 1920. Despite challenging conditions, Misiones attracted considerable European immigration in the early 20th-century.]]

The [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] left Paraguay much impoverished, and Misiones benefited economically from belonging to Argentina. In 1876 the Argentine President [[Nicolás Avellaneda]], assisted by his close friend, General Pietro Canestro (an Italian nobleman who devoted much of his life and wealth to the achievement and sustainability of the peace in the region), proclaimed the [[Immigration in Argentina|Immigration and Colonization Law]]. This law fostered the immigration of European colonists in order to populate the vast unspoiled Argentinian territories.

Several colonizing companies formed under this law. One of them, Adolf Schwelm's ''Eldorado Colonización y Explotación de Bosques Ltda. S.A.'', founded the city of [[Eldorado, Misiones|Eldorado]] in 1919 with a port on the Upper Paraná. Its agricultural colonies and experimental farms, the orange- and grapefruit-tree plantations, and the cultivation of yerba mate, the mills and the dryers for such product are characteristic of this area. [[Swedish-Argentines]] became well known for growing [[yerba mate]].

Misiones received many immigrants, mostly from Europe, coming mainly via Southern Brazil. Some came from Buenos Aires, and from Eastern Europe, in particular large numbers of [[Polish minority in Argentina|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians of Argentina|Ukrainian]]s. Since then{{when|date=February 2016}}, Misiones has continued to benefit economically and has developed politically within Argentina. It has been successfully integrated into the Argentine state.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} {{As of | 2016}} control of the province is not contested. On December 10, 1953 the \"National Territory of Misiones\" gained [[provinces of Argentina|provincial]] status in accordance with Law 14.294, and its constitution was approved on April 21, 1958.

Misiones received more attention from national policy-makers following an international agreement (1973) to construct the [[Yacyretá]] hydroelectric dam on a point in the [[Paraná River]] shared by Paraguay and Corrientes Province. When the dam became fully operative in the 1990s, the Paraná's waters all along the Misiones shores rose. They flooded lands that the dam's authorities had failed to clear and condition adequately, resulting in the onset of mosquito-transmitted illnesses, such as [[leishmaniasis]], [[yellow fever]], [[dengue]], and [[malaria]]. The entire Misiones shores along the Paraná River is now confined by two dams, one of them Yaciretá, downstream of the river, and the other [[Itaipu dam|Itaipú]], located in Brazil and Paraguay, upstream of the river and north of [[Puerto Iguazú]]. {{As of | 2016}} Argentina is pursuing an agreement with Paraguay to expand the reservoir works in order to double the facility's [[Electricity sector in Argentina|electricity production]].

== Geography ==
[[Image:Misiones - Ruta Nacional 12.jpg|thumb|right|240px|View along Route 12, near [[Puerto Iguazu]].]]
Misiones is the second smallest province after [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]].
[[File:Misiones - Parque provincial Salto Encantado desde ruta 7 (2).jpg|thumb|240px|[[Alto Paraná Atlantic forests]]]]
The Misiones plateau includes a part of Brazil across the border. The rocks contain significant quantities of iron which forms a part of the soil, giving it a reddish color. At the center of the plateau rises the Sierra de Misiones, its highest peak, 843 m, near Bernardo de Irigoyen, in the Cerro Rincón.

The province is embraced by three big rivers including the [[Paraná River|Paraná]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and [[Iguazú River|Iguazú]]. [[Iguazu Falls]] are spectacular [[waterfall]]s on the Iguazú River in the northwest corner of the province, near the city of [[Puerto Iguazú]]. Misiones shares the falls with the Brazilian state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] (in that nation's Southern Region). Meanwhile, the international border with [[Paraguay]] is close by.

== Climate ==
{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}

The province has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characterized by a lack of a dry season and abundant rainfall throughout the year.<ref name=turismoclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330035342/http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archivedate=30 March 2017 |title=Geografía |publisher=Ministerio de Turismo |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], it is classified as ''Cfa''.<ref name=IRNclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925103809/http://www.mineria.gov.ar/estudios/irn/misiones/m-1.asp |archivedate=25 September 2011 |title=Provincia de Misiones–Clima y Meteorologia |publisher=Secretaria de Mineria de la Nacion (Argentina) |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> There are four distinct seasons although winters and autumns are fairly short.<ref name=IRNclima/> The mean annual temperature is around {{convert|21|C|F|0}}.<ref name=turismoclima/> June–August typically register the coldest days when temperatures can fall below {{convert|10|C|F|0}}.<ref name=turismoclima/> However, rare incursions of polar air into the province from the south can lead to frost.<ref name=IRNclima/> Summers are hot with temperatures exceeding {{convert|32|C|F|0}} from December to February.<ref name=turismoclima/> One of the main characteristic is the presence of hills in the central and northern parts of the province leading to lower temperatures as a result of the higher elevation.<ref name=IRNclima/> Average annual rainfall ranges from a low of {{convert|1870|mm|in|0}} in the south to {{convert|2360|mm|in|0}} in the north.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} The rainfall pattern in the province has a [[bimodal]] distribution with two peaks occurring in Spring and Autumn with winters being the driest.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} The exceptions are the north and higher altitude areas where precipitation is well distributed throughout the year.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} Snowfall has occurred at the higher hills.<ref name=IRNclima/> For example, during the winter of 1975, snowfall was observed and accumulated in Bernando de Irigoyen, one of the coldest towns in the province due to its high altitude {{convert|815|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IRNclima/> Owing to the humid climate and high rainfall, relative humidity is high.<ref name=IRNclima/>

The vegetation is the so-called \"{{Interlanguage link multi|Selva Misionera|es|3=Selva misionera}}\". Part of it has been transformed by mankind to implant cultures and ranching. The original biome is protected in [[Iguazú National Park]], part of the [[Alto Paraná Atlantic forests]], in turn part of the [[Atlantic Forest]] [[biome]].

== Population ==
There are 1,101,593 people living in Misiones according to the national census of 2010. A part of the population is descendant of indigenous peoples (especially [[Guaranis]]) and also Spanish who reached during the colonization and mixed with natives. Another part of the residents are descendants of European [[Immigration to Argentina|immigrants]]. Unlike many regions of Argentina, where the immigrants came through [[Buenos Aires]], most of the immigrants who settled in Misiones came through [[Southern Brazil]]. The ethnic groups who settled in Misiones after Spaniards are [[Italian people|Italians]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]], [[Russian people|Russians]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Danish people|Danes]] and a small number of [[Arabs]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and, recently, [[Laotians]] (in the late 1970s) and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (in the 2000s). From the 1960s, the province has also received immigrants from [[Brazil]] (mostly descendants of East Europeans) and [[Paraguay]] (mostly descendants both of indigenous peoples and Spaniards).

The literacy rate is 91.4%.

== Economy ==

[[Image:Yerba-mate-misiones.JPG|thumb|left|Yerba mate plantation.]]

Misiones' [[economics|economy]], like most in northern Argentina, is relatively underdeveloped yet fairly well-diversified. Its 2006 output was estimated at US$4.8 billion (which shall be around US$7.2 billion in 2011, according to Argentina's economical growing) or US$4,940 per capita (around US$6,500 in 2011), over 40% below the national average.<ref>[http://www.iader.org.ar/ I.A.D.E.R<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Though its rainy, erosion-prone geography discourages [[intensive crop farming]], [[agriculture]] makes an important contribution to the province's economy, adding about 10% to the total. Misiones' thick forests have long provided for the ample production of roundwood without excessive impact on its [[ecosystem]]. The principal exploited trees are the [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paraná pine]], Guatambú, Cedar, Petiribí, Incense, Cane water-pipe, Anchico, Eucalyptus and Gueycá.

Misiones' chief source of agricultural income, however, has long been the cultivation of [[yerba mate]]: Misiones is Argentina's leading producer (yielding about half a million tons, annually).  [[Tea]], citrus fruit and, in minor amounts, [[tobacco]], sugar cane, rice, coffee, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coconut]] are also cultivated in Misiones.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Light [[manufacturing]] and [[tourism]] also contribute to the local economy, each adding about 13% to the total.

== Government ==
[[Image:Casa-de-gobierno-misiones.jpg|thumb|Governor's offices, Posadas]]
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.
{{main|	Chamber of Representatives of Misiones |Governor of Misiones Province }}
The Constitution of Misiones Province forms the formal law of the province.
[[File:Bandera de ceremonias de la Unidad Regional IX (Jardín América) - Policía de Misiones.jpg|thumb|Misiones Provincial Police]]
In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the [[Argentine Federal Police]] but the additional work is carried out by the [[Misiones Provincial Police]].

== Political division ==
[[Image:Depmisiones.jpg|thumb|Misiones Province, Political Division]]

The province is divided in 17 [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] (Spanish: ''departamentos''):

The [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]] was detected on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the sailors to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days he emailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board ship. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', were controversial and he resigned a few days later. By mid April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.

==Timeline==
In spring 2020 the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.

On 5 March the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam. On the last night some sailors stayed at a hotel where two people had tested positive for [[COVID-19]], a coronavirus disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. Upon learning this, the crew were ordered back to the ship and the sailors who had stayed at the hotel were isolated. Over the next weeks the ship's medical team monitored the crew for any signs of infection.<ref name = losses/>

On 24 March it was reported that three sailors aboard had tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/24/coronavirus-3-sailors-test-positive-military-readiness-affected/2910165001/ |title=Three sailors from USS Theodore Roosevelt have coronavirus, raising concerns about pandemic's strain on military |work=USA Today |last=Vanden Brook |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Vanden Brook|date=24 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>

Within a few days, that number climbed to \"dozens.\" ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was ordered to [[Guam]] and docked on 27 March 2020.<ref name= disinfectUssTRcvn71 />

On 30 March, the ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]], sent an [[Classified information in the United States#Unclassified|unclassified email]] to multiple Navy officials asking for help with the coronavirus epidemic on his ship.

==Crozier's letter==
[[File:Brett E. Crozier (2).jpg|thumb|Ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]]]]
When the ship arrived in Guam on 26 March the ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]], wanted to have most of the crew immediately taken ashore, saying it was impossible to prevent the spread of the virus in the close quarters of the ship. His superior, Rear Adm. [[Stuart P. Baker]], disagreed, feeling such an action was impractical and too drastic.<ref name = losses>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/coronavirus-roosevelt-carrier-crozier.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20200413&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=cta&regi_id=16153474&segment_id=24971&user_id=e9848bda5d7546386411f6e2fbdaf95e|title=‘There Will Be Losses’: How a Captain’s Plea Exposed a Rift in the Military|date=13 April 2020|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

On 30 March, Crozier sent an email to communicate the status of his ship and its crew, saying it was not possible to observe [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]/Navy<ref>{{cite web |title=Restriction of Movement (ROM) guidance.

==Relieving Crozier of command and aftermath==
On 2 April, acting [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Thomas Modly]] relieved Crozier of his command for sending the request for assistance over non-secure email to a \"broad array of people\" rather than up the chain of command, adding that Crozier \"allowed the complexity of the challenge of the COVID breakout on the ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally\".

Reaction to Crozier's dismissal was mixed.

Modly's speech was widely criticized.

The [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]] was detected on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the sailors to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days he emailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board ship. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', were controversial and he resigned a few days later. By mid April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.

==Timeline==
In spring 2020 the the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.

On 5 March the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam. On the last night some sailors stayed at a hotel where two people had tested positive for [[COVID-19]], a coronavirus disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. Upon learning this, the crew were ordered back to the ship and the sailors who had stayed at the hotel were isolated. Over the next weeks the ship's medical team monitored the crew for any signs of infection.<ref name = losses/>

On 24 March it was reported that three sailors aboard had tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/24/coronavirus-3-sailors-test-positive-military-readiness-affected/2910165001/ |title=Three sailors from USS Theodore Roosevelt have coronavirus, raising concerns about pandemic's strain on military |work=USA Today |last=Vanden Brook |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Vanden Brook|date=24 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>

==Crozier's letter==
[[File:Brett E. Crozier (2).jpg|thumb|Ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]]]]
When the ship arrived in Guam on 26 March the ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]], wanted to have most of the crew immediately taken ashore, saying it was impossible to prevent the spread of the virus in the close quarters of the ship. His superior, Rear Adm. [[Stuart P. Baker]], disagreed, feeling such an action was impractical and too drastic.<ref name = losses>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/coronavirus-roosevelt-carrier-crozier.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20200413&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=cta&regi_id=16153474&segment_id=24971&user_id=e9848bda5d7546386411f6e2fbdaf95e|title=‘There Will Be Losses’: How a Captain’s Plea Exposed a Rift in the Military|date=13 April 2020|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

On 30 March, Crozier sent an email to communicate the status of his ship and its crew, saying it was not possible to observe [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]/Navy<ref>{{cite web |title=Restriction of Movement (ROM) guidance.

==Relieving Crozier of command and aftermath==
On 2 April, acting [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Thomas Modly]] relieved Crozier of his command for sending the request for assistance over non-secure email to a \"broad array of people\" rather than up the chain of command, adding that Crozier \"allowed the complexity of the challenge of the COVID breakout on the ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally\".

Reaction to Crozier's dismissal was mixed.

The [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]] was detected on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the sailors to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days he emailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board ship. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', were controversial and he resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.

==Timeline==
In spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.

===March===
On 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam. On the last night some sailors stayed at a hotel where two people had tested positive for [[COVID-19]], a coronavirus disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. Upon learning this, the crew were ordered back to the ship and the sailors who had stayed at the hotel were isolated. Over the next weeks the ship's medical team monitored the crew for any signs of infection.<ref name = losses/>

On 24 March, it was reported that three sailors aboard had tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/24/coronavirus-3-sailors-test-positive-military-readiness-affected/2910165001/ |title=Three sailors from USS Theodore Roosevelt have coronavirus, raising concerns about pandemic's strain on military |work=USA Today |last=Vanden Brook |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Vanden Brook|date=24 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>

==Relieving Crozier of command and aftermath==
On 2 April, acting [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Thomas Modly]] relieved Crozier of his command for sending the request for assistance over non-secure email to a \"broad array of people\" rather than up the chain of command, adding that Crozier \"allowed the complexity of the challenge of the COVID breakout on the ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally\".

Modly's speech was widely criticized.

The [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]] was detected on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the sailors to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days he emailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board ship. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', were controversial and he resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.

==Timeline==
In spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.

===March===
On 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam. On the last night some sailors stayed at a hotel where two people had tested positive for [[COVID-19]], a coronavirus disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. Upon learning this, the crew were ordered back to the ship and the sailors who had stayed at the hotel were isolated. Over the next weeks the ship's medical team monitored the crew for any signs of infection.<ref name = losses/>

On 24 March, it was reported that three sailors aboard had tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/24/coronavirus-3-sailors-test-positive-military-readiness-affected/2910165001/ |title=Three sailors from USS Theodore Roosevelt have coronavirus, raising concerns about pandemic's strain on military |work=USA Today |last=Vanden Brook |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Vanden Brook|date=24 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>

==Relieving Crozier of command and aftermath==
On 2 April, acting [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Thomas Modly]] relieved Crozier of his command for sending the request for assistance over non-secure email to a \"broad array of people\" rather than up the chain of command, adding that Crozier \"allowed the complexity of the challenge of the COVID breakout on the ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally\".

Reaction to Crozier's dismissal was mixed.

Modly's speech was widely criticized.

The '''Battle of Mogaung''' was a series of engagements that was fought in the [[Burma Campaign]] of [[World War II]] between 6 to 26 June 1944 at the Burmese town of Mogaung. In brutal fighting, the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77th 'Chindit' Brigade]] under Brigadier [[Mike Calvert|Michael Calvert]], later assisted by [[Chinese Expeditionary Force|Chinese forces]] of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], fought-for and captured the town from the [[Japanese occupation of Burma|occupying forces]] of [[Imperial Japan]].

The battle was part of a major [[Chindit]] campaign called [[Chindits#Operation Thursday|Operation ''Thursday'']] which later amalgamated with the [[Siege of Myitkyina]] by Chinese and US forces led by [[Joseph Stilwell]] who was in overall command of the Chindits. The capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war. Two [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded during the battle.<ref name=\"Griffin163\">{{Harvnb|Griffin|2018|pp=163-64}}</ref>

==Background==
In 1943, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]] led the Chindits behind Japanese lines for the first of their [[Long-range penetration]] operations with Operation ''Loincloth''. It resulted in little strategic success but it did prove that [[British Empire]] forces could fight on equal terms with the Japanese in the jungle. The following year General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William 'Bill' Slim]] leading the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] were engaged in a desperate struggle against the Japanese army who had launched [[Operation U-Go]] - the invasion of [[British India]] beginning in March 1944.<ref name=\"Fay262\">{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=265}}</ref>

As a result of the Japanese invasion a second Chindit expedition was launched; Operation ''Thursday'' was much larger than the previous years' with six brigades. The aim was to harass the Japanese rear and supply lines as well as to relieve pressure on American General [[Joseph Stilwell|Vinegar 'Joe' Stilwell]]'s joint Chinese and US forces moving south into Northern Burma who were intending to take the strategic town of [[Myitkyina]]. The early operations of the Chindits were marred by the death of Wingate in an air crash. They then went under the command of Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] but were eventually placed under the command of the [[Anglophobia|Anglophobe]] Stilwell.<ref name=\"McLynn361\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|p=361}}</ref> Once the operation was underway in March, 77 Brigade having held off superior Japanese forces for two months from their stronghold of ''White City''.

===Prelude===
In late May they were ordered north by Stilwell to the area of Mogaung to take the pressure off his Chinese forces as they were struggling in [[Siege of Myitkyina|besieging Myitkyina]]. Capturing Mogaung meant that the Japanese lifeline northward would be cut and Myitkyina would inevitably fall. At the end of May, Fourteenth Army intelligence, backed by hazardous patrols from 77 Brigade, found that the Japanese had reinforced the defenders of Mogaung with four battalions from Lieutenant-General Hisashi Takeda's [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] to  just under 4,000 troops.<ref name=\"Allen369\">{{Harvnb|Allen |1998|p=369}}</ref> The 77th brigade consisted of four battalions; the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], [[King's Regiment]], [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffordshire's]] and [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]s. Accompanying the brigade were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] liaison officers who would need high ground for radio contact from which to bring in close air support.<ref name=\"Diamond74\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=74}}</ref>

Getting to Mogaung would be difficult for the brigade however. There was no way of flying in and to the North of the town was the fast flowing Mogaung River and to the West diverging off was the Wetthauk Chaung river. The country to the East and South were interspersed by lakes, marshes with the only access being a two mile long Pinhmi road on a causeway. The British would have to use this in order to get there and would come up against villages on the outskirts that had been heavily fortified - with bunkers being constructed under the buildings.<ref name=\"Towill113\">{{Harvnb|Towill 2000|p=114}}</ref>

==Battle==
On May 30 the brigade set off; the plan was to advance 160 miles to the town using the Pinhmi road as an axis. Their first priority was for the  need for an area for a small landing strip for evacuating the sick and wounded as well as an area for supplies to be dropped. Calvert had hoped to reach and even capture Mogaung by 5 June.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan141\">{{cite book |last1=Gibbs |first1=Herbert Ronald K |last2=Ryan |first2=D.G.J |title=Historical Record of the 6th Gurkha Rifles, Volume 2 |date=1955 |publisher=Gale & Polden |page=141 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=REoFAAAAMAAJ&q=}}</ref>

===Lakum===

The march was difficult - thick jungle intersected by deep ravines and the occasional sporadic firefight with the Japanese. Nevertheless on 2 June the South Staffordshires and the Gurkhas captured the village of [[Lakum]] after a fierce encounter with the Japanese. The village was a low laying hill overlooking the plain two miles south west of Mogaung. On the following day, another series of bitter encounters forced the Japanese off the surrounding hills - the Gurkhas seized a hamlet, later dubbed 'Gurkha Village', after wiping out the forty strong garrison there. They captured intact a large [[ammunition dump]], fifteen lorries and a camouflaged hospital full of medical supplies, as well as many sick Japanese soldiers. Many of these tried to escape without success and many more committed suicide.<ref name=\"Calvert230\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=230}}</ref>

Calvert had his headquarters operational just south of Lakum and a small airstrip was hastily laid from which supplies were arranged to be flown in and dropped by [[C-47]]'s. The wounded and sick could be flown out by using [[Stinson L-5 Sentinel|Sentinal]] aircraft and even the new [[Sikorsky R-4]] helicopters.<ref name=\"M,M,M\">{{cite book |last1=MacKay |first1=J.N |last2=Macaulay |first2=Marcus |last3=Macdonell |first3=Ranald |title=A History of the 4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles, 1857-1948, Volume 3 |date=1952 |publisher=W.

Calvert also built up a store of medical, food and military supplies before any major attack went in. At the same time local [[Kachin people|Kachin]] groups led by former [[Burma Rifles]] officers who had established control of the area joined Calvert's men to provide vital intelligence on Japanese movements.<ref name=\"Rooney97\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=97-99}}</ref> The following day two platoons of the Lancashire fusiliers captured a vital point on the Mogaung river known as the Tapaw Ferry that would prove useful if the Chindits needed an escape route.<ref name=\"Kirby408\">{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=Stanley Woodburn |title=The War Against Japan: The decisive battles Volume 3 of The War Against Japan |date=1957 |publisher=H.M.

The villages of Mahaung, Natgyigon and the Pinhmi bridge on the outskirts of Mogaung were key positions in its defence; once these had fallen the Japanese hold on the town would become untenable. In Mogaung itself the courthouse and railway station were potential areas for heavy resistance as they were the two main all brick buildings. Over the next few days the brigade got supplied - they were delivered [[PIAT]] anti tank weapons as well as [[Flamethrower, Portable, No 2|flamethrowers]], [[ML 3-inch mortar|3 inch]] and [[ML 4.2-inch mortar|4.2 inch]] mortars with thousands of rounds as the only means of heavy fire support. Japanese artillery was causing casualties but Calvert was eventually able to call in [[P-51 Mustang]]s of 1st Air Commando in an attempt to silence the Japanese positions.<ref name=\"Smith277\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=277}}</ref>

===Pinhmi bridge and outskirts===
The attack on the Pinhmi to Mogaung road where the vital Pinhmi bridge crossed the Wetthauk Chaung river began on 7 June. As they advanced closer to Mogaung the Staffordshires found and destroyed a Japanese ammunition dump and the Lancashire Fusiliers later captured the village of Pinhmi. An attempt on the bridge the following day however failed as the Lancashires were repelled from concealed Japanese positions which ranged along a fifteen foot high embankment incurring heavy casualties.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Nevertheless a reconnaissance patrol found a ford further down the river and from this the Gurkhas and the Staffordshires attacked and secured the village of Mahaung. In addition they also secured the village of Ywathitgale taking out a Japanese administrative headquarters, and reached the Pinhmi–Mogaung road outflanking a number of Japanese positions.<ref name=\"Rooney97\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=97-99}}</ref> They then launched a number of counterattacks but were driven off. On 10 June the Gurkha's attempted to take the bridge again; the first attempt ended in failure but the second in a wide flanking move succeeded in taking the bridge. Among them was Captain [[Michael Allmand]]'s heroic feat in ensuring the capture of the bridge. The attacks cost nearly 130 casualties but Calvert's brigade was securely established along the axis of the Pinhmi-Mogaung road.<ref name=\"Diamond70\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=70}}</ref>

The [[monsoon]] then broke later that day and conditions were tough for the men of 77 Brigade; [[malaria]], [[trench foot]] and [[typhus]] were soon rife.<ref name=\"Allen371\">{{Harvnb|Allen|1998|p=371}}</ref> Calvert learnt that two more Japanese battalions arrived to reinforce Mogaung essentially replacing casualties, and seeing the difficulty he then sent a messenger to Stilwell to alert him to the situation; but was not received with any sympathy. Stilwell eventually sent the 1/114th Chinese Infantry Regiment from the 38th Division to support the Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=270-71}}</ref> Calvert assessed the situation on June 12; many battalions were reduced to a company which meant the brigade total consisted of no more than 750 fit men. Calvert was concerned with the number of wounded and the sick having to endure the poor conditions - [[Defensive fighting position|slit trenches]] were impossible due to the wet conditions; men would have to lay face down in the mud if they were under shell fire. Many of the wounded however were determined to stay and fight rather than be flown out.<ref name=\"Rooney100\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=100-01}}</ref>

Over the next few days conditions began to improve many of the wounded were flown out and supplies were brought in once more. On June 15 Calvert continued his attacks, fighting to secure a ridge closer to the town. The Court House was taken the next day, and the area extending to the Mogaung River and up to the outskirts of Natgyigon was cleared.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Japanese mortar fire from the village of Naungkaiktaw was causing some grief upon the Chindits. At dawn on June 18 air attacks and a heavy mortar bombardment over the next few days followed by an assault by the Lancashire Fusiliers and the King's attacked using flamethrowers.<ref name=\"Diamond80\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=80}}</ref> At the cost of some fifty casualties (some from friendly fire) they succeeded and drove around a hundred Japanese out of the village in addition to killing some seventy of them. Whilst consolidating their position in the village a Japanese patrol was ambushed and taken out; they had not realised the village had been in British hands.<ref name=\"Rooney100\"/>

Around the same time Chinese troops began to arrive; Gurkhas made contact with them West of Lakum. Mogaung was then surrounded, with the Chinese in the South which totalled nearly three battalions. Crucially they had [[Bofors 75 mm mountain gun|75mm mountain guns]] which were established at Pinhmi, and they were able pound Japanese positions.<ref name=\"McLynn352\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|pp=351-52}}</ref>

===Mogaung===
[[File:Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand VC.jpg|thumb|150px|Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand who won the VC during the Battle of Mogaung]]
Calvert planned his next attack for 23 June towards Natyigon, a key position and the last outer bastion of Mogaung. At first light on that day the final assault was launched; every available fit man was called up; cooks, orderlies and even Headquarters personnel. The Chinese attacked towards the railway station along the railway embankment which was effectively a last line of defence. Despite a heavy bombardment the attack failed and the Chinese were held back with intense Japanese machine gun fire. The Chindits had no choice but to halt along this line for the remainder of the day.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\"/>

Earlier reconnaissance had pin-pointed the 'Red House', a large bricked building. The following day after a heavy bombardment from the Chinese guns and British mortars as well as air attacks the British attacked from the North of the station. Once once more fighting was intense, the Japanese defending tenaciously despite the constant pounding. The building and surrounding positions were only taken after brutal fighting in which flamethrowers, grenades and PIATs were used.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan143\">Gibbs & Ryan pp. 143-44</ref> One of the men involved was Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]; his single-handed gallantry as part of the Gurkhas attack on the 'Red House' earned him a nomination for the Victoria Cross. The other nomination fell to Michael Allmand who attacked a machine-gun position holding up his remaining company. He Knocked out the position with grenades but was mortally wounded in the process. The Chinese provided some fire support but did not take part in this attack, instead protecting the flanks and cutting off any Japanese escape attempt. The assault by the Gurkhas totally unbalanced the Japanese and Takeda had no other choice to withdraw or risk his battalions being destroyed.<ref name=\"Corrigan\">{{Harvnb|Corrigan|210|pp=466-67}}</ref>

The final attack was on the railway station on June 25 - the Chinese attack from the South was postponed but the Lancashires and the South Staffordshires went in anyway and after more heavy fighting finally took the battered remains and met up with the Chinese.<ref name=\"Lunt39\">{{Harvnb|Lunt|1994|p=39}}</ref> With the British having major foothold in the town, the Japanese launched a number of counter attacks that night but they were beaten off. The following morning the Chindit and Chinese patrols found positions outside the town abandoned.<ref name=\"Smith277\"/> Any Japanese that escaped did so by using [[Drum (container)|oil drums]] in the hope they would make it downriver to Myitkyina. Many however were shot up by patrolling Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell273\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=273-74}}</ref>

With the battle largely over the Chindits consolidated their position in Mogaung but they were physically and mentally exhausted. The brigade at the end of the battle only had less than 550 men left of fighting strength. The Lancashire Fusiliers, King's Regiment and South Staffordshire's between them could only muster 300 between them and the 3/6th Gurkhas had 230 left fit.<ref name=\"Calvert180\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=180}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
Once Mogaung had been captured the Gurkha's garrisoned the town preparing for further counterattacks from across the river but none was forthcoming; the Japanese had left the area completely.<ref name=\"McLynn352\"/> Whilst in Mogaung, the Gurkha's took the opportunity to hold a small ceremonial parade and hoisted the Union Jack on a large [[pagoda]], the most prominent building left standing. The Chindits remained in the area until July 5 and then withdrew to their base area at Pinhmi. They then had to march a further fifty miles to be flown back to India before leaving Mogaung in the hands of the Chinese.<ref name=\"Calvert180\"/>

The capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> The Japanese had lost heavily with nearly 1,600 casualties most of whom were dead and and an unknown number of sick that evacuated.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The cost of taking Mogaung had been high - Calvert had lost 47 officers and 729 other ranks killed or wounded; which equated to around fifty percent casualties. Stilwell had used the Chindits in an unsuitable role of classic infantry, without the support of artillery and armour. He announced via the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] that Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung but without referencing the British. The Chindits were outraged, and Calvert famously signalled to Stilwell's headquarters 'Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.' Stillwell's son who was the intelligence officer announced that 'Umbrage was so small that I can't find it on the map'.<ref name=\"Rooney105\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|p=105}}</ref>

Fearing that they would then be ordered to join the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert shut down his radios and withdrew to [[Kamaing]], where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and the former finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The siege of Myitkyina had already proved a thorn in Stilwell's side after a major Chinese assault had been repelled with heavy losses. The British capture of Mogaung did relieve pressure on Stilwell's troops besieging the town; the Japanese quit Myitkyina on 3 August.<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book |last1=United States Government |title=Merrill's Marauders, February - May 1944 American forces in action series Volume 100, Issue 4 |date=1990 |publisher=Printing Office Center of Military History |page=113 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4aAfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA113&dq=}}</ref>

Two Victoria Crosses were awarded during the battle - Michael Allmand received his [[Posthumous award|posthumously]], while Tul Bahadur Pun received his in November.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> In addition members of the Sixth Gurkhas also received two [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], three

The '''Battle of Mogaung''' was a series of engagements that was fought in the [[Burma Campaign]] of [[World War II]] between 6 to 26 June 1944 at the Burmese town of Mogaung. In brutal fighting, the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77th 'Chindit' Brigade]] under Brigadier [[Mike Calvert|Michael Calvert]], later assisted by [[Chinese Expeditionary Force|Chinese forces]] of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], fought-for and captured the town from the [[Japanese occupation of Burma|occupying forces]] of [[Imperial Japan]].

The battle was part of a major [[Chindit]] campaign called [[Chindits#Operation Thursday|Operation ''Thursday'']] which later amalgamated with the [[Siege of Myitkyina]] by Chinese and US forces led by [[Joseph Stilwell]] who was in overall command of the Chindits. The capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war. Two [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded during the battle.<ref name=\"Griffin163\">{{Harvnb|Griffin|2018|pp=163-64}}</ref>

In 1943, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]] led the Chindits behind Japanese lines for the first of their [[Long-range penetration]] operations with Operation ''Loincloth''. It resulted in little strategic success but it did prove that [[British Empire]] forces could fight on equal terms with the Japanese in the jungle. The following year General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William 'Bill' Slim]] leading the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] were engaged in a desperate struggle against the Japanese army who had launched [[Operation U-Go]] - the invasion of [[British India]] beginning in March 1944.<ref name=\"Fay262\">{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=265}}</ref>

In late May they were ordered north by Stilwell to the area of Mogaung to take the pressure off his Chinese forces as they were struggling in [[Siege of Myitkyina|besieging Myitkyina]]. Capturing Mogaung meant that the Japanese lifeline northward would be cut and Myitkyina would inevitably fall. At the end of May, Fourteenth Army intelligence, backed by hazardous patrols from 77 Brigade, found that the Japanese had reinforced the defenders of Mogaung with four battalions from Lieutenant-General Hisashi Takeda's [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] to  just under 4,000 troops.<ref name=\"Allen369\">{{Harvnb|Allen |1998|p=369}}</ref> The 77th brigade consisted of four battalions; the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], [[King's Regiment]], [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffordshire's]] and [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]s. Accompanying the brigade were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] liaison officers who would need high ground for radio contact from which to bring in close air support.<ref name=\"Diamond74\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=74}}</ref>

Getting to Mogaung would be difficult for the brigade however. There was no way of flying in and to the North of the town was the fast flowing Mogaung River and to the West diverging off was the Wetthauk Chaung river. The country to the East and South were interspersed by lakes, marshes with the only access being a two mile long Pinhmi road on a causeway. The British would have to use this in order to get there and would come up against villages on the outskirts that had been heavily fortified - with bunkers being constructed under the buildings.<ref name=\"Towill113\">{{Harvnb|Towill 2000|p=114}}</ref>

==Battle==
On May 30 the brigade set off; the plan was to advance 160 miles to the town using the Pinhmi road as an axis. Their first priority was for the  need for an area for a small landing strip for evacuating the sick and wounded as well as an area for supplies to be dropped. Calvert had hoped to reach and even capture Mogaung by 5 June.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan141\">{{cite book |last1=Gibbs |first1=Herbert Ronald K |last2=Ryan |first2=D.G.J |title=Historical Record of the 6th Gurkha Rifles, Volume 2 |date=1955 |publisher=Gale & Polden |page=141 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=REoFAAAAMAAJ&q=}}</ref>

===Lakum===
[[File:Ledo and Sodiya, India- Myitkyina, Myanmar- Batang (Ba), Litang, Gyaltang, Kham, Tibet- Burma Road terminus at Kunming, China 1945 map detail, from- Allied Third Burma Campaign Apri 1-May 1945 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Location of Mogaung in Northern Burma]]
The march was difficult - thick jungle intersected by deep ravines and the occasional sporadic firefight with the Japanese. Nevertheless on 2 June the South Staffordshires and the Gurkhas captured the village of [[Lakum]] after a fierce encounter with the Japanese. The village was a low laying hill overlooking the plain two miles south west of Mogaung. On the following day, another series of bitter encounters forced the Japanese off the surrounding hills - the Gurkhas seized a hamlet, later dubbed 'Gurkha Village', after wiping out the forty strong garrison there. They captured intact a large [[ammunition dump]], fifteen lorries and a camouflaged hospital full of medical supplies, as well as many sick Japanese soldiers. Many of these tried to escape without success and many more committed suicide.<ref name=\"Calvert230\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=230}}</ref>

Calvert had his headquarters operational just south of Lakum and a small airstrip was hastily laid from which supplies were arranged to be flown in and dropped by [[C-47]]'s. The wounded and sick could be flown out by using [[Stinson L-5 Sentinel|Sentinal]] aircraft and even the new [[Sikorsky R-4]] helicopters.<ref name=\"M,M,M\">{{cite book |last1=MacKay |first1=J.N |last2=Macaulay |first2=Marcus |last3=Macdonell |first3=Ranald |title=A History of the 4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles, 1857-1948, Volume 3 |date=1952 |publisher=W.

Calvert also built up a store of medical, food and military supplies before any major attack went in. At the same time local [[Kachin people|Kachin]] groups led by former [[Burma Rifles]] officers who had established control of the area joined Calvert's men to provide vital intelligence on Japanese movements.<ref name=\"Rooney97\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=97-99}}</ref> The following day two platoons of the Lancashire fusiliers captured a vital point on the Mogaung river known as the Tapaw Ferry that would prove useful if the Chindits needed an escape route.<ref name=\"Kirby408\">{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=Stanley Woodburn |title=The War Against Japan: The decisive battles Volume 3 of The War Against Japan |date=1957 |publisher=H.M.

The villages of Mahaung, Natgyigon and the Pinhmi bridge on the outskirts of Mogaung were key positions in its defence; once these had fallen the Japanese hold on the town would become untenable. In Mogaung itself the courthouse and railway station were potential areas for heavy resistance as they were the two main all brick buildings. Over the next few days the brigade got supplied - they were delivered [[PIAT]] anti tank weapons as well as [[Flamethrower, Portable, No 2|flamethrowers]], [[ML 3-inch mortar|3 inch]] and [[ML 4.2-inch mortar|4.2 inch]] mortars with thousands of rounds as the only means of heavy fire support. Japanese artillery was causing casualties but Calvert was eventually able to call in [[P-51 Mustang]]s of 1st Air Commando in an attempt to silence the Japanese positions.<ref name=\"Smith277\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=277}}</ref>

===Pinhmi bridge and outskirts===
The attack on the Pinhmi to Mogaung road where the vital Pinhmi bridge crossed the Wetthauk Chaung river began on 7 June. As they advanced closer to Mogaung the Staffordshires found and destroyed a Japanese ammunition dump and the Lancashire Fusiliers later captured the village of Pinhmi. An attempt on the bridge the following day however failed as the Lancashires were repelled from concealed Japanese positions which ranged along a fifteen foot high embankment incurring heavy casualties.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Nevertheless a reconnaissance patrol found a ford further down the river and from this the Gurkhas and the Staffordshires attacked and secured the village of Mahaung. In addition they also secured the village of Ywathitgale taking out a Japanese administrative headquarters, and reached the Pinhmi–Mogaung road outflanking a number of Japanese positions.<ref name=\"Rooney97\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=97-99}}</ref> They then launched a number of counterattacks but were driven off. On 10 June the Gurkha's attempted to take the bridge again; the first attempt ended in failure but the second in a wide flanking move succeeded in taking the bridge. Among them was Captain [[Michael Allmand]]'s heroic feat in ensuring the capture of the bridge. The attacks cost nearly 130 casualties but Calvert's brigade was securely established along the axis of the Pinhmi-Mogaung road.<ref name=\"Diamond70\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=70}}</ref>

The [[monsoon]] then broke later that day and conditions were tough for the men of 77 Brigade; [[malaria]], [[trench foot]] and [[typhus]] were soon rife.<ref name=\"Allen371\">{{Harvnb|Allen|1998|p=371}}</ref> Calvert learnt that two more Japanese battalions arrived to reinforce Mogaung essentially replacing casualties, and seeing the difficulty he then sent a messenger to Stilwell to alert him to the situation; but was not received with any sympathy. Stilwell eventually sent the 1/114th Chinese Infantry Regiment from the 38th Division to support the Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=270-71}}</ref> Calvert assessed the situation on June 12; many battalions were reduced to a company which meant the brigade total consisted of no more than 750 fit men. Calvert was concerned with the number of wounded and the sick having to endure the poor conditions - [[Defensive fighting position|slit trenches]] were impossible due to the wet conditions; men would have to lay face down in the mud if they were under shell fire. Many of the wounded however were determined to stay and fight rather than be flown out.<ref name=\"Rooney100\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=100-01}}</ref>

Over the next few days conditions began to improve many of the wounded were flown out and supplies were brought in once more. On June 15 Calvert continued his attacks, fighting to secure a ridge closer to the town. The Court House was taken the next day, and the area extending to the Mogaung River and up to the outskirts of Natgyigon was cleared.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Japanese mortar fire from the village of Naungkaiktaw was causing some grief upon the Chindits. At dawn on June 18 air attacks and a heavy mortar bombardment over the next few days followed by an assault by the Lancashire Fusiliers and the King's attacked using flamethrowers.<ref name=\"Diamond80\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=80}}</ref> At the cost of some fifty casualties (some from friendly fire) they succeeded and drove around a hundred Japanese out of the village in addition to killing some seventy of them. Whilst consolidating their position in the village a Japanese patrol was ambushed and taken out; they had not realised the village had been in British hands.<ref name=\"Rooney100\"/>

Around the same time Chinese troops began to arrive; Gurkhas made contact with them West of Lakum. Mogaung was then surrounded, with the Chinese in the South which totalled nearly three battalions. Crucially they had [[Bofors 75 mm mountain gun|75mm mountain guns]] which were established at Pinhmi, and they were able pound Japanese positions.<ref name=\"McLynn352\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|pp=351-52}}</ref>

===Mogaung===
[[File:Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand VC.jpg|thumb|150px|Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand who won the VC during the Battle of Mogaung]]
Calvert planned his next attack for 23 June towards Natyigon, a key position and the last outer bastion of Mogaung. At first light on that day the final assault was launched; every available fit man was called up; cooks, orderlies and even Headquarters personnel. The Chinese attacked towards the railway station along the railway embankment which was effectively a last line of defence. Despite a heavy bombardment the attack failed and the Chinese were held back with intense Japanese machine gun fire. The Chindits had no choice but to halt along this line for the remainder of the day.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\"/>

Earlier reconnaissance had pin-pointed the 'Red House', a large bricked building. The following day after a heavy bombardment from the Chinese guns and British mortars as well as air attacks the British attacked from the North of the station. Once once more fighting was intense, the Japanese defending tenaciously despite the constant pounding. The building and surrounding positions were only taken after brutal fighting in which flamethrowers, grenades and PIATs were used.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan143\">Gibbs & Ryan pp. 143-44</ref> One of the men involved was Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]; his single-handed gallantry as part of the Gurkhas attack on the 'Red House' earned him a nomination for the Victoria Cross. The other nomination fell to Michael Allmand who attacked a machine-gun position holding up his remaining company. He Knocked out the position with grenades but was mortally wounded in the process. The Chinese provided some fire support but did not take part in this attack, instead protecting the flanks and cutting off any Japanese escape attempt. The assault by the Gurkhas totally unbalanced the Japanese and Takeda had no other choice to withdraw or risk his battalions being destroyed.<ref name=\"Corrigan\">{{Harvnb|Corrigan|210|pp=466-67}}</ref>

The final attack was on the railway station on June 25 - the Chinese attack from the South was postponed but the Lancashires and the South Staffordshires went in anyway and after more heavy fighting finally took the battered remains and met up with the Chinese.<ref name=\"Lunt39\">{{Harvnb|Lunt|1994|p=39}}</ref> With the British having major foothold in the town, the Japanese launched a number of counter attacks that night but they were beaten off. The following morning the Chindit and Chinese patrols found positions outside the town abandoned.<ref name=\"Smith277\"/> Any Japanese that escaped did so by using [[Drum (container)|oil drums]] in the hope they would make it downriver to Myitkyina. Many however were shot up by patrolling Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell273\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=273-74}}</ref>

With the battle largely over the Chindits consolidated their position in Mogaung but they were physically and mentally exhausted. The brigade at the end of the battle only had less than 550 men left of fighting strength. The Lancashire Fusiliers, King's Regiment and South Staffordshire's between them could only muster 300 between them and the 3/6th Gurkhas had 230 left fit.<ref name=\"Calvert180\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=180}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
Once Mogaung had been captured the Gurkha's garrisoned the town preparing for further counterattacks from across the river but none was forthcoming; the Japanese had left the area completely.<ref name=\"McLynn352\"/> Whilst in Mogaung, the Gurkha's took the opportunity to hold a small ceremonial parade and hoisted the Union Jack on a large [[pagoda]], the most prominent building left standing. The Chindits remained in the area until July 5 and then withdrew to their base area at Pinhmi. They then had to march a further fifty miles to be flown back to India before leaving Mogaung in the hands of the Chinese.<ref name=\"Calvert180\"/>

The capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> The Japanese had lost heavily with nearly 1,600 casualties most of whom were dead and and an unknown number of sick that evacuated.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The cost of taking Mogaung had been high - Calvert had lost 47 officers and 729 other ranks killed or wounded; which equated to around fifty percent casualties. Stilwell had used the Chindits in an unsuitable role of classic infantry, without the support of artillery and armour. He announced via the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] that Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung but without referencing the British. The Chindits were outraged, and Calvert famously signalled to Stilwell's headquarters 'Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.' Stillwell's son who was the intelligence officer announced that 'Umbrage was so small that I can't find it on the map'.<ref name=\"Rooney105\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|p=105}}</ref> 

Fearing that they would then be ordered to join the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert shut down his radios and withdrew to [[Kamaing]], where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and the former finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The siege of Myitkyina had already proved a thorn in Stilwell's side after a major Chinese assault had been repelled with heavy losses. The British capture of Mogaung did relieve pressure on Stilwell's troops besieging the town; the Japanese quit Myitkyina on 3 August.<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book |last1=United States Government |title=Merrill's Marauders, February - May 1944 American forces in action series Volume 100, Issue 4 |date=1990 |publisher=Printing Office Center of Military History |page=113 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4aAfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA113&dq=}}</ref>

Two Victoria Crosses were awarded during the battle - Michael Allmand received his [[Posthumous award|posthumously]], while Tul Bahadur Pun received his in November.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> In addition members of the Sixth Gurkhas also received two [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], three

\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

==Northumbria and Northern England==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]].

The Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].

\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.)

He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].

\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

==Northumbria and Northern England==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.

At [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.

Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>

==Cambridge==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

==Wales and Scotland==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles.

Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005). Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

==Northumbria and Northern England==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.

At [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.

Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>

==Cambridge==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

==Wales and Scotland==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].

Developed from earlier Greek weapons, it relied upon different mechanics, using two levers with [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] springs instead of a tension prod (the bow part of a modern crossbow). The springs consisting of several loops of twisted [[Hank (textile)|skeins]]. Early versions projected heavy [[dart (missile)|darts]] or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for [[siege warfare]]. It developed into a smaller precision weapon, the [[Scorpio (Dart-thrower)|scorpio]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Warry |first=John |year=1995 |title=Warfare in the Classical World: War and the Ancient Civilisations of Greece and Rome |page=178 |publisher=Salamander Books Ltd. |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn=0-8061-2794-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoABCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA178}}</ref> and possibly the [[polybolos]].

== Greek weapon ==
{{Main|Greek and Roman artillery}}

The early ballistae in [[Ancient Greece]] were developed from two weapons called [[oxybeles]] and [[gastraphetes]]. The gastraphetes ('belly-bow') was a handheld crossbow. It had a composite prod and was spanned by bracing the front end of the weapon against the ground while placing the end of a slider mechanism against the stomach. The operator would then walk forward to arm the weapon while a ratchet prevented it from shooting during loading. This produced a weapon which, it was claimed, could be operated by a person of average strength but which had a power that allowed it to be successfully used against armoured troops. The oxybeles was a bigger and heavier construction employing a winch, and was mounted on a tripod. It had a lower rate of fire and was used as a siege engine.

With the invention of [[torsion spring]] bundle technology, the first ballistae were built. The advantage of this new technology was the fast relaxation time of this system. Thus it was possible to shoot lighter projectiles with higher velocities over a longer distance. By contrast, the comparatively slow relaxation time of a [[crossbow|tension machine]] such as the oxybeles meant that much less energy could be transferred to light projectiles, limiting the effective range of the weapon.

The earliest form of the ballista is thought to have been developed for [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius of Syracuse]], {{circa}} 400 BC.

The Greek ballista was a [[siege weapon]]. All components that were not made of wood were transported in the baggage train. It would be assembled with local wood, if necessary. Some were positioned inside large, armoured, mobile [[siege tower]]s or even on the edge of a battlefield. For all of the tactical advantages offered, it was only under [[Philip II of Macedon]], and even more so under his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], that the ballista began to develop and gain recognition as both a siege engine and field artillery. Historical accounts, for instance, cited that Philip II employed a group of engineers within his army to design and build catapults for his military campaigns.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Soldiers' Lives through History: The Ancient World|last=Gabriel|first=Richard|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=0313333483|location=Westport, CT|pages=127}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Alexander the Great: Conqueror of the Ancient World|last=McGowen|first=Tom|publisher=Enslow Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9780766025608|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alexandergreatco0000mcgo/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/alexandergreatco0000mcgo/page/24}}</ref> There is even a claim that it was Philip II - with his team of engineers - who invented the ballista after improving Dionysius's device, which was merely an oversized slingshot.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Art of the Catapult: Build Greek Ballistae, Roman Onagers, English Trebuchets, and More Ancient Artillery|last=Gurstelle|first=William|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2004|isbn=1556525265|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofcatapult00will/page/51 51]|url=https://archive.org/details/artofcatapult00will/page/51}}</ref> It was further perfected by Alexander, whose own team of engineers introduced innovations such as the idea of using springs made from tightly strung coils of rope instead of a bow to achieve more energy and power when throwing projectiles.<ref name=\":1\" />  [[Polybius]] reported about the usage of smaller, more portable ballistae, called [[scorpio (weapon)|scorpions]], during the [[Second Punic War]].

Ballistae could be easily modified to shoot both spherical and shaft projectiles, allowing their crews to adapt easily to prevailing battlefield situations in real time.

As the role of battlefield artillery became more sophisticated, a [[universal joint]] (which was invented just for this function) was integrated into the ballista's stand, allowing the operators to alter the trajectory and firing direction of the ballista as required without a lengthy disassembly of the machine.

[[File:Harzhorn-Ereignis roemische Katapultgeschosse (Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum).jpg|thumb|Ballista bolt heads]]

After the absorption of the Ancient Greek city-states into the [[Roman Republic]] in 146 BC, the highly advanced Greek technology began to spread across many areas of Roman influence. This included the great military machine advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.

The Romans 'inherited' the torsion-powered ballista, which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war, including one from [[Pergamum]], which was depicted among a pile of trophy weapons in relief on a balustrade.

The torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could be easily carried.

=== Early Roman ballistae ===
The early Roman ballistae were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the [[Crossbow bolt|bolts]] or stone ''shot''. Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of '[[winch]]es' and a 'claw', used to [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] the bowstring back to the armed firing position.

The slider passed through the ''field frames'' of the weapon, in which were located the ''torsion springs'' (rope made of animal [[Tendon|sinew]]), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn, were attached to the bowstring.

Drawing the bowstring back with the winches twisted the already taut springs, storing the energy to fire the projectiles. The bronze or iron caps, which secured the torsion-bundles were adjustable by means of pins and peripheral holes, which allowed the weapon to be tuned for symmetrical power and for changing weather conditions.

The ballista was a highly accurate weapon (there are many accounts of single soldiers being picked off by ballista operators), but some design aspects meant it could compromise its accuracy for range. The maximum range was over {{convert|500|yd}}, but effective combat range for many targets was far shorter.

The Romans continued the development of the ballista, and it became a highly prized and valued weapon in the army of the [[Roman Empire]].

It was used, just before the start of the Empire, by [[Julius Caesar]] during his conquest of [[Gaul]] and on both of his campaigns in subduing Britain.

The first of [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] took place in 55 BC, after a rapid and successful initial conquest of Gaul, in part as an expedition, and more practically to try to put an end to the reinforcements sent by the native Britons to fight the Romans in Gaul.

A total of eighty transports, carrying two legions, attempted to land on the British shore, only to be driven back by the many British warriors assembled along the shoreline. The ships had to unload their troops on the beach, as it was the only one suitable for many miles, yet the massed ranks of British [[chariot]]eers and javeliners were making it difficult.

<blockquote>Seeing this, Caesar ordered the warships – which were swifter and easier to handle than the transports, and likely to impress the natives more by their unfamiliar appearance – to be removed a short distance from the others, and then be rowed hard and run ashore on the enemy’s right flank, from which position the slings, bows and artillery could be used by men on deck to drive them back. This manoeuvre was highly successful.<br> Scared by the strange shape of the warships, the motion of the oars, and the unfamiliar machines, the natives halted and retreated. ''(Caesar, The Conquest of Gaul, p.99)</blockquote>

==== Siege of Alesia ====

In Gaul, the stronghold of [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]] was [[Battle of Alesia|under a Roman siege]] in 52 BC, and was completely surrounded by a Roman fortification including a wooden [[palisade]] and towers. As was standard siege technique at the time, small ballistae were placed in the towers with other troops armed with [[bow (weapon)|bows]] or [[Sling (weapon)|slings]]. The use of the ballista in the Roman siege strategy was also demonstrated in the case of the [[Siege of Masada]].<ref name=\":0\" />

=== Ballistae in the Roman Empire ===
During the conquest of the Empire, the ballista proved its worth many times in sieges and battles, both at sea and on land. It was even used to quell riots.  It is from the time of the Roman Empire that many of the archaeological finds of ballistae date. Accounts by the finders, including technical manuals and journals, are used today by archaeologists to reconstruct these weapons.

After Julius Caesar, the ballista was a permanent fixture in the Roman army and, over time, modifications and improvements were made by successive engineers. This included replacing the remaining wooden parts of the machine with metal, creating a much smaller, lighter and more powerful machine than the wooden version, which required less maintenance (though the vital torsion springs were still vulnerable to the strain). The largest ballistae of the 4th century could throw a dart further than 1200 yards (1,100 m). The weapon was named ''ballista fulminalis'' in [[De Rebus Bellicis]]: \"From this ballista, darts were projected not only in great number but also at a large size over a considerable distance, such as across the width of the Danube River.\"<ref>De Rebus Bellicis, Chapter XVIII: ballista fulminalis. Note: The modern width of the Danube is 1.5 km. During the Roman Empire, it was unlikely to have been less than 1.1 km, bearing in mind that [[Trajan's Bridge]] is known to have been longer than 1.1 km.</ref> Ballistae were not only used in laying siege: after {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;350, at least 22 [[bastion|semi-circular towers]] were erected around [[London Wall|the walls]] of [[Londinium]] ([[City of London|London]]) to provide platforms for permanently mounted defensive devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Londinium/Today/vizrom/01+wall.htm |title=Visible Roman London: City wall and gates |publisher=Museum of London Group |accessdate=19 February 2015 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219043325/http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Londinium/Today/vizrom/01%2Bwall.htm |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>

=== Eastern Roman Empire ===
[[File:Israel Batch 2 (50).JPG|thumb|Ballista stones found at excavation site in Jerusalem]]
During the 6th century, [[Procopius]] described the effects of this weapon:

<blockquote>But Belisarius placed upon the towers engines which they call \"ballistae\". Now these engines have the form of a bow, but on the under side of them a grooved wooden shaft projects; this shaft is so fitted to the bow that it is free to move, and rests upon a straight iron bed. So when men wish to shoot at the enemy with this, they make the parts of the bow which form the ends bend toward one another by means of a short rope fastened to them, and they place in the grooved shaft the arrow, which is about one half the length of the ordinary missiles which they shoot from bows, but about four times as wide...but the missile is discharged from the shaft, and with such force that it attains the distance of not less than two bow-shots, and that, when it hits a tree or a rock, it pierces it easily. Such is the engine which bears this name, being so called because it shoots with very great force''<ref>Procopius, Gothic war, chapter XXI</ref></blockquote>

The missiles were able to penetrate body-armour:

<blockquote>And at the Salarian Gate a Goth of goodly stature and a capable warrior, wearing a corselet and having a helmet on his head, a man who was of no mean station in the Gothic nation, refused to remain in the ranks with his comrades, but stood by a tree and kept shooting many missiles at the parapet. But this man by some chance was hit by a missile from an engine which was on a tower at his left. And passing through the corselet and the body of the man, the missile sank more than half its length into the tree, and pinning him to the spot where it entered the tree, it suspended him there a corpse.<ref>Procopius, Gothic war, chapter XXIII</ref></blockquote>

==== Cheiroballistra and manuballista ====
{{Main|Cheiroballistra}}

The cheiroballistra and the manuballista are held by many archaeologists to be the same weapon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The difference in name may be attributable to the different languages spoken in the Empire. Latin remained the official language in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], but the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]] predominantly used Greek, which added an extra 'r' to the word ballista.

The manuballista was a handheld version of the traditional ballista. This new version was made entirely of iron, which conferred greater power to the weapon, since it was smaller, and less iron (an expensive material before the 19th century), was used in its production. It was not the ancient [[gastraphetes]], but the Roman weapon. However, the same physical limitations applied as with the gastraphetes.

==== Carroballista ====
[[File:031 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel XXXI (Ausschnitt 01).jpg|thumb|right|Roman cart-mounted carroballista]]
{{Main|Carroballista}}

The carroballista was a cart-mounted version of the weapon. There were probably different models of ballista under the ''cheiroballistra'' class, at least two different two-wheeled models and one model with four wheels. Their probable size was roughly 1.47 m width, i.e., 5 Roman feet. The cart system and structure gave it a great deal of flexibility and capability as a battlefield weapon, since the increased maneuverability allowed it to be moved with the flow of the battle. This weapon features several times on [[Trajan's Column]].

==== Polybolos ====
{{Main|Polybolos}}
[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|Reproductions of [[Greek and Roman artillery|ancient Greek artillery]], including [[catapult]]s such as the ''[[polybolos]]'' (to the left in the foreground) and a large, early [[crossbow]] known as the ''[[gastraphetes]]'' (mounted on the wall in the background)]]
It has been speculated that the Roman military may have also fielded a 'repeating' ballista, also known as a ''polybolos''. Reconstruction and trials of such a weapon carried out in a BBC documentary, ''What the Romans Did For Us'', showed that they \"were able to shoot eleven bolts a minute, which is almost four times the rate at which an ordinary ballista can be operated\".<ref>Hart-Davis, Adam [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/tech_01.shtml Discovering Roman Technology] [[BBC]] History 17 February 2011. Accessed 21 November 2013</ref> However, no example of such a weapon has been found by archaeologists.

=== Archaeology and the Roman ballista ===
[[File:Ballista Ampurias Schramm.jpg|thumb|Metal components of the Ampurias Catapult, found in 1912 in the ''Neapolis'' of [[Empúries|Ampurias]]]]
[[File:Balista Cluj Museaum.JPG|thumb|left|Metal components of a 4th-century ballista]]

[[Archaeology]], and in particular [[experimental archaeology]] has been influential on this subject. Although several ancient authors (such as [[Vegetius]]) wrote very detailed technical treatises, providing us with all the information necessary to reconstruct the weapons, all their measurements were in their native language and therefore highly difficult to translate.

Attempts to reconstruct these ancient weapons began at the end of the 19th century, based on rough translations of ancient authors. It was only during the 20th century, however, that many of the reconstructions began to make any sense as a weapon. By bringing in modern engineers, progress was made with the ancient systems of measurement. By redesigning the reconstructions using the new information, archaeologists in that specialty were able to recognize certain finds from Roman military sites, and identify them as ballistae. The information gained from the excavations was fed into the next generation of reconstructions and so on.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Sites across the empire have yielded information on ballistae, from Spain (the Ampurias Catapult), to Italy (the Cremona Battleshield, which proved that the weapons had decorative metal plates to shield the operators), to Iraq (the Hatra Machine) and even Scotland (Burnswark siege tactics training camp), and many other sites between.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The most influential archaeologists in this area have been [[Peter Connolly]] and Eric Marsden,<ref>Marsden, E.W. (1971). ''Greek and Roman Artillery''. Technical Treatises (Oxford). Reprinted 1999 by Sandpiper</ref> who have not only written extensively on the subject but have also made many reconstructions themselves and have refined the designs over many years of work.

== Middle Ages ==
With the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], resources to build and maintain these complex machines became very scarce, so the ballista was supplanted initially by the simpler and cheaper [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]] and the more efficient [[springald]].

Though the weapon continued to be used in the [[Middle Ages]], it faded from popular use with the advent of the [[trebuchet]] and [[mangonel]] in siege warfare.

While not a direct descendant mechanically, the concept and naming continues on as [[arbalest]] crossbows (''arcus'' 'bow' + ballista).

The springs consisting of several loops of twisted [[Hank (textile)|skeins]]. Early versions projected heavy [[dart (missile)|darts]] or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for [[siege warfare]]. It developed into a smaller precision weapon, the [[Scorpio (Dart-thrower)|scorpio]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Warry |first=John |year=1995 |title=Warfare in the Classical World: War and the Ancient Civilisations of Greece and Rome |page=178 |publisher=Salamander Books Ltd. |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn=0-8061-2794-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoABCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA178}}</ref> and possibly the [[polybolos]].

== Greek weapon ==
{{Main|Greek and Roman artillery}}

The early ballistae in [[Ancient Greece]] were developed from two weapons called [[oxybeles]] and [[gastraphetes]]. The gastraphetes ('belly-bow') was a handheld crossbow. It had a composite prod and was spanned by bracing the front end of the weapon against the ground while placing the end of a slider mechanism against the stomach. The operator would then walk forward to arm the weapon while a ratchet prevented it from shooting during loading. This produced a weapon which, it was claimed, could be operated by a person of average strength but which had a power that allowed it to be successfully used against armoured troops. The oxybeles was a bigger and heavier construction employing a winch, and was mounted on a tripod. It had a lower rate of fire and was used as a siege engine.

With the invention of [[torsion spring]] bundle technology, the first ballistae were built. The advantage of this new technology was the fast relaxation time of this system. Thus it was possible to shoot lighter projectiles with higher velocities over a longer distance. By contrast, the comparatively slow relaxation time of a [[crossbow|tension machine]] such as the oxybeles meant that much less energy could be transferred to light projectiles, limiting the effective range of the weapon.

The earliest form of the ballista is thought to have been developed for [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius of Syracuse]], {{circa}} 400 BC.

The Greek ballista was a [[siege weapon]]. All components that were not made of wood were transported in the baggage train. It would be assembled with local wood, if necessary. Some were positioned inside large, armoured, mobile [[siege tower]]s or even on the edge of a battlefield. For all of the tactical advantages offered, it was only under [[Philip II of Macedon]], and even more so under his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], that the ballista began to develop and gain recognition as both a siege engine and field artillery. Historical accounts, for instance, cited that Philip II employed a group of engineers within his army to design and build catapults for his military campaigns.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Soldiers' Lives through History: The Ancient World|last=Gabriel|first=Richard|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=0313333483|location=Westport, CT|pages=127}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Alexander the Great: Conqueror of the Ancient World|last=McGowen|first=Tom|publisher=Enslow Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9780766025608|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alexandergreatco0000mcgo/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/alexandergreatco0000mcgo/page/24}}</ref> There is even a claim that it was Philip II - with his team of engineers - who invented the ballista after improving Dionysius's device, which was merely an oversized slingshot.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Art of the Catapult: Build Greek Ballistae, Roman Onagers, English Trebuchets, and More Ancient Artillery|last=Gurstelle|first=William|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2004|isbn=1556525265|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofcatapult00will/page/51 51]|url=https://archive.org/details/artofcatapult00will/page/51}}</ref> It was further perfected by Alexander, whose own team of engineers introduced innovations such as the idea of using springs made from tightly strung coils of rope instead of a bow to achieve more energy and power when throwing projectiles.<ref name=\":1\" />  [[Polybius]] reported about the usage of smaller, more portable ballistae, called [[scorpio (weapon)|scorpions]], during the [[Second Punic War]].

Ballistae could be easily modified to shoot both spherical and shaft projectiles, allowing their crews to adapt easily to prevailing battlefield situations in real time.

As the role of battlefield artillery became more sophisticated, a [[universal joint]] (which was invented just for this function) was integrated into the ballista's stand, allowing the operators to alter the trajectory and firing direction of the ballista as required without a lengthy disassembly of the machine.

After the absorption of the Ancient Greek city-states into the [[Roman Republic]] in 146 BC, the highly advanced Greek technology began to spread across many areas of Roman influence. This included the great military machine advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.

The Romans 'inherited' the torsion-powered ballista, which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war, including one from [[Pergamum]], which was depicted among a pile of trophy weapons in relief on a balustrade.

The torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could be easily carried.

=== Early Roman ballistae ===
The early Roman ballistae were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the [[Crossbow bolt|bolts]] or stone ''shot''. Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of '[[winch]]es' and a 'claw', used to [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] the bowstring back to the armed firing position.

The slider passed through the ''field frames'' of the weapon, in which were located the ''torsion springs'' (rope made of animal [[Tendon|sinew]]), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn, were attached to the bowstring.

Drawing the bowstring back with the winches twisted the already taut springs, storing the energy to fire the projectiles. The bronze or iron caps, which secured the torsion-bundles were adjustable by means of pins and peripheral holes, which allowed the weapon to be tuned for symmetrical power and for changing weather conditions.

The ballista was a highly accurate weapon (there are many accounts of single soldiers being picked off by ballista operators), but some design aspects meant it could compromise its accuracy for range. The maximum range was over {{convert|500|yd}}, but effective combat range for many targets was far shorter.

The Romans continued the development of the ballista, and it became a highly prized and valued weapon in the army of the [[Roman Empire]].

It was used, just before the start of the Empire, by [[Julius Caesar]] during his conquest of [[Gaul]] and on both of his campaigns in subduing Britain.

==== First invasion of Britain ====
The first of [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] took place in 55 BC, after a rapid and successful initial conquest of Gaul, in part as an expedition, and more practically to try to put an end to the reinforcements sent by the native Britons to fight the Romans in Gaul.

The missiles were able to penetrate body-armour:

{{Main|Carroballista}}

The carroballista was a cart-mounted version of the weapon. There were probably different models of ballista under the ''cheiroballistra'' class, at least two different two-wheeled models and one model with four wheels. Their probable size was roughly 1.47 m width, i.e., 5 Roman feet. The cart system and structure gave it a great deal of flexibility and capability as a battlefield weapon, since the increased maneuverability allowed it to be moved with the flow of the battle. This weapon features several times on [[Trajan's Column]].

==== Polybolos ====
{{Main|Polybolos}}
[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|Reproductions of [[Greek and Roman artillery|ancient Greek artillery]], including [[catapult]]s such as the ''[[polybolos]]'' (to the left in the foreground) and a large, early [[crossbow]] known as the ''[[gastraphetes]]'' (mounted on the wall in the background)]]
It has been speculated that the Roman military may have also fielded a 'repeating' ballista, also known as a ''polybolos''. Reconstruction and trials of such a weapon carried out in a BBC documentary, ''What the Romans Did For Us'', showed that they \"were able to shoot eleven bolts a minute, which is almost four times the rate at which an ordinary ballista can be operated\".<ref>Hart-Davis, Adam [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/tech_01.shtml Discovering Roman Technology] [[BBC]] History 17 February 2011. Accessed 21 November 2013</ref> However, no example of such a weapon has been found by archaeologists.

=== Archaeology and the Roman ballista ===
[[File:Ballista Ampurias Schramm.jpg|thumb|Metal components of the Ampurias Catapult, found in 1912 in the ''Neapolis'' of [[Empúries|Ampurias]]]]
[[File:Balista Cluj Museaum.JPG|thumb|left|Metal components of a 4th-century ballista]]

[[Archaeology]], and in particular [[experimental archaeology]] has been influential on this subject. Although several ancient authors (such as [[Vegetius]]) wrote very detailed technical treatises, providing us with all the information necessary to reconstruct the weapons, all their measurements were in their native language and therefore highly difficult to translate.

Attempts to reconstruct these ancient weapons began at the end of the 19th century, based on rough translations of ancient authors. It was only during the 20th century, however, that many of the reconstructions began to make any sense as a weapon. By bringing in modern engineers, progress was made with the ancient systems of measurement. By redesigning the reconstructions using the new information, archaeologists in that specialty were able to recognize certain finds from Roman military sites, and identify them as ballistae. The information gained from the excavations was fed into the next generation of reconstructions and so on.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Sites across the empire have yielded information on ballistae, from Spain (the Ampurias Catapult), to Italy (the Cremona Battleshield, which proved that the weapons had decorative metal plates to shield the operators), to Iraq (the Hatra Machine) and even Scotland (Burnswark siege tactics training camp), and many other sites between.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The most influential archaeologists in this area have been [[Peter Connolly]] and Eric Marsden,<ref>Marsden, E.W. (1971). ''Greek and Roman Artillery''. Technical Treatises (Oxford). Reprinted 1999 by Sandpiper</ref> who have not only written extensively on the subject but have also made many reconstructions themselves and have refined the designs over many years of work.

== Middle Ages ==
With the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], resources to build and maintain these complex machines became very scarce, so the ballista was supplanted initially by the simpler and cheaper [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]] and the more efficient [[springald]].

Though the weapon continued to be used in the [[Middle Ages]], it faded from popular use with the advent of the [[trebuchet]] and [[mangonel]] in siege warfare.

While not a direct descendant mechanically, the concept and naming continues on as [[arbalest]] crossbows (''arcus'' 'bow' + ballista).

\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005). Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

==Northumbria and Northern England==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.

At [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.

Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>

==Cambridge==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

==Wales and Scotland==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].

\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[William Carlos Williams]] and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], Dick Russell and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005). Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

==Northumbria and Northern England==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.

At [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.

Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>

==Cambridge==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

==Wales and Scotland==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].

== History ==
=== Creation ===
''The Anarchist Cookbook'' was written by William Powell as a teenager and first published in 1971 at the apex of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture era]] to protest against [[Role of United States in the Vietnam War|United States involvement in the Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=\"Salon\"/> Powell gained inspiration for his text from his experiences with Vietnam veterans during his time living in Manhattan. During this time, the pacifist movements of the 1960s began to take a more violent turn, having been responsible for over 100 politically inspired bombings. Powell began plans to become a writer but decided upon a political course when he was drafted to the Vietnam war, which inspired him to write \"recipes\" and later compile them into a \"cookbook\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |last1=Dokoupil |first1=Tony |title=Sorry About All the Bombs: William Powell wrote a terrorist bible.

The initial manuscript was sent to Lyle Stuart in 1970.<ref name=\":1\" />

Powell stated ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' was initially designed as a book meant to provide education towards \"the silent majority\" of the American population. He described that the book was not intended for extant political fringe organizations, rather it was designed to galvanize a great societal change by inciting the general population. The ultimate goal of the text was to provide the general population with the skills and capabilities to organize against fascist, capitalist, and communist threats that he perceived. Powell stated \"The central idea to the book was that violence is an acceptable means to bring about political change,\" a sentiment he would renounce later in life.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" />

=== Author remorse ===
After writing the book as a teenager, Powell converted to [[Anglicanism]] in 1976, and later attempted to have the book removed from circulation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saner|first=Emine|title=Why the author of The Anarchist Cookbook wants it taken off the shelves|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/dec/18/why-anarchist-cookbook-author-william-powell-off-shelves|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Salon\"/> In 1979, Powell left the United States, traveling to the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. There he worked as a faculty member for international schools backed by the United States. During this time, he began writing about pedagogy and conflict resolution. This led him to renounce his book and instead campaign for its discontinuation.<ref name=\":1\" /> He was unable to legally stop publication of ''The Anarchist's Cookbook'' because the [[copyright]] had been issued to the original publisher ([[Lyle Stuart]]), and subsequent publishers that purchased the rights have kept the title in print.

== Content summary ==

=== Foreword ===
The Anarchist Cookbook begins with a Foreword section, detailing the author's intentions for the text. At the time of writing, Powell believed that the United States was slowly declining towards communism, thus he found it necessary to pen a book that guided people on revolution against this transition. He championed the idea of \"bringing America back to where she was two hundred years ago\", believing his revolutionary ideals to be reactionary, rather than proactive.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news |title='Power Must Be Taken': Excerpts From 'The Anarchist Cookbook' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2017-12-22 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/books/excerpts-from-the-anarchist-cookbook.html |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Powell begins with his vision for the book in how it is intended to educate and galvanize the public to make tangible change in their home countries. Powell states that fringe political organizations, such [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|The Minutemen]] and [[Weather Underground|The Weathermen]], are not the intended audience, rather it is written for \"the silent majority\". Powell envisioned the United State people rebelling against what he deemed to be oppressive capitalistic ideals, and to a lesser extent, against fascist and communist movements.<ref name=\":3\" />

=== Content ===
Powell begins the content of his book discussing anarchy and anarchist theory. Anarchy, by his definition, is a wide scale mass uprising by the people, similar to that of civil disobedience through violence.<ref name=\":3\" /> He believed that anarchy was the innate state of all individuals, and therefore human nature would drive people to participate in such practices. Powell believed that current expressions of politics, arts, music, and education all contained innate principles of anarchist ideals, thereby equating anarchism to individualism. This principle drives Powell's argumentation as he believed that the current political climate and Vietnam war had undermined human values, therefore revolution based upon his perception of human dignity and freedom was what drove him to write the piece. He ends his introduction by warning of the seriousness that these recipes may have deadly consequences if used improperly.<ref name=\":3\" /> The chapters of ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' include descriptions and detailed instructions in hand-to-hand combat, explosives, booby traps, drugs, tear gas, sabotage and demolition, surveillance, improvised weapons and other topics related to anarchism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />

== Reception ==

=== Legal reviews ===
At the time of its publication, one [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] memo described ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' as \"one of the crudest, low-brow, paranoiac writing efforts ever attempted\".<ref>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2011-02-16) [http://reason.com/blog/2011/02/16/the-fbi-on-the-anarchist-cookb The FBI on ''The Anarchist Cookbook''], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''</ref> The book was reviewed by the Department of Justice, the White House, the FBI, and by both [[John Dean]] and [[Mark Felt]], [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] lawyer and [[J.

=== Anarchism ===
Advocates of [[anarchism]] dispute the association of the book with anarchist political philosophy. The anarchist collective [[CrimethInc.]], which published the book ''[[Recipes for Disaster|Recipes for Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook]]'' in response, denounces the earlier book, saying it was \"not composed or released by anarchists, not derived from anarchist practice, not intended to promote freedom and autonomy or challenge repressive power – and was barely a cookbook, as most of the recipes in it are notoriously unreliable\".<ref>''[[The Guardian]]'', September 2004, as quoted at [http://www.crimethinc.com/books/rfd.html CWC Books : Recipes For Disaster] Retrieved on November 22, 2007</ref>

=== Internet/Media ===

Much of the publication was copied and made available as text documents online<ref name=kernel>{{cite web|last=Sankin |first=Aaron |url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/headline-story/12210/anarchist-cookbook-history-usenet/ |title=The Kernel |publisher=Kernelmag.dailydot.com |date=2015-03-22 |accessdate=2018-02-06}}</ref> through [[Usenet]] and [[FTP]] sites hosted in academic institutions in the early 1990s, and has been made available via [[web browsers]] from their inception in the mid-1990s to the present day. The name varies slightly from ''Anarchist Cookbook'' to ''Anarchy Cookbook'' and the topics have expanded vastly in the intervening decades. Many of the articles were attributed to an anonymous author called \"The Jolly Roger\".

In 2001, British businessman Terrance Brown created the now defunct website anarchist-cookbook.com and sold copies of his derivative work, titled ''Anarchist Cookbook 2000''.

Knowledge of the book, or copied online publications of it, increased along with the increase in public access to the Internet throughout the mid-1990s. Newspapers ran stories about how easy the text was to get hold of, and the influence it may have had with terrorists, criminals, and experimental teenagers.<ref name=kernel />

== History ==
=== Creation ===
''The Anarchist Cookbook'' was written by William Powell as a teenager and first published in 1971 at the apex of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture era]] to protest against [[Role of United States in the Vietnam War|United States involvement in the Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=\"Salon\"/> Powell gained inspiration for his text from his experiences with Vietnam veterans during his time living in Manhattan. During this time, the pacifist movements of the 1960s began to take a more violent turn, having been responsible for over 100 politically inspired bombings. Powell began plans to become a writer but decided upon a political course when he was drafted to the Vietnam war, which inspired him to write \"recipes\" and later compile them into a \"cookbook\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |last1=Dokoupil |first1=Tony |title=Sorry About All the Bombs: William Powell wrote a terrorist bible. Forty Years Later, he revisits his work. |work=[[Newsweek]] |volume=157 |issue=9 |date=2011-02-28 |issn=0028-9604 |df=mdy-all |id={{ProQuest|854940252}} }}</ref> The initial vision of ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' was to post instructional flyers in Manhattan, including how to properly throw a [[Molotov cocktail]] and how to make LSD. These \"recipes\" were eventually adapted to make up an entire book.<ref name=Thompson>{{Cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Tony |title=Ban my bombers' guide, says author |work=[[The Observer]] |date=2000-06-11 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/11/booksnews.uksecurity |issn=0029-7712 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> From 1968 to 1970, Powell began researching in the \"U.S. Combat Bookshelf\" at the New York Public Library, including external texts such as ''The [[Boy Scout Handbook]]'', ''Fuck the System'' by [[Abbie Hoffman]], and other popular anarchist texts. The initial manuscript was sent to Lyle Stuart in 1970.<ref name=\":1\" />

Powell stated ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' was initially designed as a book meant to provide education towards \"the silent majority\" of the American population. He described that the book was not intended for extant political fringe organizations, rather it was designed to galvanize a great societal change by inciting the general population. The ultimate goal of the text was to provide the general population with the skills and capabilities to organize against fascist, capitalist, and communist threats that he perceived. Powell stated \"The central idea to the book was that violence is an acceptable means to bring about political change,\" a sentiment he would renounce later in life.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" />

=== Author remorse ===
After writing the book as a teenager, Powell converted to [[Anglicanism]] in 1976, and later attempted to have the book removed from circulation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saner|first=Emine|title=Why the author of The Anarchist Cookbook wants it taken off the shelves|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/dec/18/why-anarchist-cookbook-author-william-powell-off-shelves|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Salon\"/> In 1979, Powell left the United States, traveling to the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia.

This led him to renounce his book and instead campaign for its discontinuation.<ref name=\":1\" /> He was unable to legally stop publication of ''The Anarchist's Cookbook'' because the [[copyright]] had been issued to the original publisher ([[Lyle Stuart]]), and subsequent publishers that purchased the rights have kept the title in print.

At the time of its publication, one [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] memo described ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' as \"one of the crudest, low-brow, paranoiac writing efforts ever attempted\".<ref>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2011-02-16) [http://reason.com/blog/2011/02/16/the-fbi-on-the-anarchist-cookb The FBI on ''The Anarchist Cookbook''], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''</ref> The book was reviewed by the Department of Justice, the White House, the FBI, and by both [[John Dean]] and [[Mark Felt]], [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] lawyer and [[J. Edgar Hoover|FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover']]<nowiki/>s associate director respectively. While having concerns about the text, the FBI concluded that it could not be regulated as it was published through [[mass media]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Furthermore, the FBI ruled that the Anarchist Cookbook does not incite \"forcible resistance to any law of the United States\" and is therefore protected under the First Amendment.<ref name=\":5\" /> While much of the text was deemed to be inaccurate, the FBI concluded that the chapter on explosives \"appears to be accurate in most respects\".<ref name=\":5\" /> Since its conception, the FBI has kept records of the book, releasing the bulk of its investigation file in 2010.<ref>[https://www.governmentattic.org/4docs/FBI-AnarchistsCookbook_1971-1999.pdf FBI Files on the Anarchist Cookbook] Retrieved on February 14, 2011</ref><ref>[http://rc.vc/files/docs/FBI-AnarchistsCookbook_1971-1999.pdf Mirror of \"FBI Files on the Anarchist Cookbook\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233552/http://rc.vc/files/docs/FBI-AnarchistsCookbook_1971-1999.pdf |date=July 8, 2015 }} Retrieved on July 24, 2013</ref>

=== Anarchism ===
Advocates of [[anarchism]] dispute the association of the book with anarchist political philosophy. The anarchist collective [[CrimethInc.]], which published the book ''[[Recipes for Disaster|Recipes for Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook]]'' in response, denounces the earlier book, saying it was \"not composed or released by anarchists, not derived from anarchist practice, not intended to promote freedom and autonomy or challenge repressive power – and was barely a cookbook, as most of the recipes in it are notoriously unreliable\".<ref>''[[The Guardian]]'', September 2004, as quoted at [http://www.crimethinc.com/books/rfd.html CWC Books : Recipes For Disaster] Retrieved on November 22, 2007</ref>

== Media presence ==

=== Internet/Media ===

Much of the publication was copied and made available as text documents online<ref name=kernel>{{cite web|last=Sankin |first=Aaron |url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/headline-story/12210/anarchist-cookbook-history-usenet/ |title=The Kernel |publisher=Kernelmag.dailydot.com |date=2015-03-22 |accessdate=2018-02-06}}</ref> through [[Usenet]] and [[FTP]] sites hosted in academic institutions in the early 1990s, and has been made available via [[web browsers]] from their inception in the mid-1990s to the present day. The name varies slightly from ''Anarchist Cookbook'' to ''Anarchy Cookbook'' and the topics have expanded vastly in the intervening decades. Many of the articles were attributed to an anonymous author called \"The Jolly Roger\".

In 2001, British businessman Terrance Brown created the now defunct website anarchist-cookbook.com and sold copies of his derivative work, titled ''Anarchist Cookbook 2000''.

Knowledge of the book, or copied online publications of it, increased along with the increase in public access to the Internet throughout the mid-1990s. Newspapers ran stories about how easy the text was to get hold of, and the influence it may have had with terrorists, criminals, and experimental teenagers.<ref name=kernel />

The municipality of Meråker was established on 1 January 1874 when the old municipality of [[Øvre Stjørdal]] was divided into two: [[Hegra (municipality)|Hegra]] (population: 3,409) in the east and Meråker (population: 1,861) in the west.  The municipal borders have not changed since then.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyrå]]|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian}}</ref>  On 1 January 2018, the municipality switched from the old [[Nord-Trøndelag]] county to the new [[Trøndelag]] county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the [[parish]]) is named after the old ''Meråker'' farm (spelled \"Mørakre\" around 1430), since the first [[Meråker Church]] was built there. The meaning of the first element is uncertain (maybe ''merr'' which means \"[[mare]]\" or ''mýrr'' which means \"[[bog]]\" or \"[[marsh]]\") and the last element is ''akr'' which means \"[[field (agriculture)|field]]\" or \"[[acre]]\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Nordre Trondhjems amt|edition=15|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W.

===Coat of arms===
The [[coat of arms]] was granted on 28 September 1990.  Traditionally, [[mining]] has played a major role in the area and has been of great economic importance for Meråker. Thus a silver [[minecart|mining cart]] on a red background as a symbol for the municipality was an obvious decision. The cart depicted in the arms, however, is officially described as a cart, not a mining cart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/m/meraker.htm|author=Norske Kommunevåpen|year=1990|title=Nye kommunevåbener i Norden|accessdate=8 November 2008}}</ref>

==History==

===Meråker Smelter===
In 1898, a [[carbide]] factory was opened at [[Kopperå]], later this factor was rebuilt as a [[silicon]] smelter. The [[smelter]] was in operation until June 2006.  Its main product was [[microsilica]] which is used as an additive to [[cement]].

==Geography==
Meråker is a landlocked municipality in the central part of [[Trøndelag]] county.  To the north is the municipality of [[Verdal]], to the west is [[Stjørdal]], to the south is [[Selbu]] and [[Tydal]], and to the east is [[Sweden]].

There are three major lakes in Meråker: [[Feren]], [[Fjergen]], and [[Funnsjøen]].  The river [[Stjørdalselva]] runs through the municipality towards the [[Trondheimsfjord]].  The river [[Rotla]] begins in the southern part of Meråker.  The mountain [[Fongen]] sits on the southern border with [[Tydal]] and [[Selbu]].

==Government==
All municipalities in Norway, including Meråker, are responsible for [[primary education]] (through 10th grade), outpatient [[Health care|health services]], [[old age|senior citizen]] services, [[unemployment]] and other [[Social work|social services]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], and municipal [[road]]s.  The municipality is governed by a [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] of elected representatives, which in turn elect a [[mayor]].<ref name=\"ks\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://snl.no/kommunestyre|title=kommunestyre|editor-first=Tore|editor-last=Hansen|accessdate=2019-01-01|date=2016-05-12|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=[[Kunnskapsforlaget]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref>  The municipality falls under the [[Inntrøndelag District Court]] and the [[Frostating Court of Appeal]].

===Municipal council===
The [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] ({{lang|no|Kommunestyre}}) of Meråker is made up of 21 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  The [[Political party|party]] breakdown of the council is as follows:

'''Meråker''' is a [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Trøndelag]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], [[Norway]].  It is part of the [[Stjørdalen]] [[Districts of Norway|region]].  The [[administrative centre]] of the municipality is the village of [[Midtbygda, Trøndelag|Midtbygda]] which is about {{convert|20|km}} west of [[Storlien]] in [[Sweden]] and {{convert|46|km}} east of the town of [[Stjørdalshalsen]] in neighboring [[Stjørdal]] municipality.  Other villages in Meråker include [[Gudåa]], [[Kopperå]], and [[Stordalen, Trøndelag|Stordalen]].

The municipality markets itself as a recreational area. The main areas of employment are in [[industry]] and [[agriculture]].  The municipality is noted for its characteristic [[Norwegian dialects|dialect]].

The {{convert|1274|km2|adj=on}} municipality is the 80th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Meråker is the 259th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,422. The municipality's [[population density]] is {{convert|2|PD/km2}} and its population has decreased by 2% over the previous 10-year period.<ref name=\"ssb pop\">{{cite web|title=Table: 06913: Population 1 January and population changes during the calendar year (M)|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/statbank/table/06913/|year=2020|language=Norwegian|author=Statistisk sentralbyrå|authorlink=Statistics Norway}}</ref><ref name=\"ssb area\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/statbank/table/09280/|title=09280: Area of land and fresh water (km²) (M)|year=2020|language=Norwegian|author=Statistisk sentralbyrå|authorlink=Statistics Norway}}</ref>

==General information==
The municipality of Meråker was established on 1 January 1874 when the old municipality of [[Øvre Stjørdal]] was divided into two: [[Hegra (municipality)|Hegra]] (population: 3,409) in the east and Meråker (population: 1,861) in the west.  The municipal borders have not changed since then.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyrå]]|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian}}</ref>  On 1 January 2018, the municipality switched from the old [[Nord-Trøndelag]] county to the new [[Trøndelag]] county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the [[parish]]) is named after the old ''Meråker'' farm (spelled \"Mørakre\" around 1430), since the first [[Meråker Church]] was built there. The meaning of the first element is uncertain (maybe ''merr'' which means \"[[mare]]\" or ''mýrr'' which means \"[[bog]]\" or \"[[marsh]]\") and the last element is ''akr'' which means \"[[field (agriculture)|field]]\" or \"[[acre]]\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Nordre Trondhjems amt|edition=15|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W.

===Coat of arms===
The [[coat of arms]] was granted on 28 September 1990.  Traditionally, [[mining]] has played a major role in the area and has been of great economic importance for Meråker. Thus a silver [[minecart|mining cart]] on a red background as a symbol for the municipality was an obvious decision. The cart depicted in the arms, however, is officially described as a cart, not a mining cart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/m/meraker.htm|author=Norske Kommunevåpen|year=1990|title=Nye kommunevåbener i Norden|accessdate=8 November 2008}}</ref>

==History==

===Meråker Smelter===
In 1898, a [[carbide]] factory was opened at [[Kopperå]], later this factor was rebuilt as a [[silicon]] smelter. The [[smelter]] was in operation until June 2006.  Its main product was [[microsilica]] which is used as an additive to [[cement]].

==Geography==
Meråker is a landlocked municipality in the central part of [[Trøndelag]] county.  To the north is the municipality of [[Verdal]], to the west is [[Stjørdal]], to the south is [[Selbu]] and [[Tydal]], and to the east is [[Sweden]].

There are three major lakes in Meråker: [[Feren]], [[Fjergen]], and [[Funnsjøen]].  The river [[Stjørdalselva]] runs through the municipality towards the [[Trondheimsfjord]].  The river [[Rotla]] begins in the southern part of Meråker.  The mountain [[Fongen]] sits on the southern border with [[Tydal]] and [[Selbu]].

==Government==
All municipalities in Norway, including Meråker, are responsible for [[primary education]] (through 10th grade), outpatient [[Health care|health services]], [[old age|senior citizen]] services, [[unemployment]] and other [[Social work|social services]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], and municipal [[road]]s.  The municipality is governed by a [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] of elected representatives, which in turn elect a [[mayor]].<ref name=\"ks\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://snl.no/kommunestyre|title=kommunestyre|editor-first=Tore|editor-last=Hansen|accessdate=2019-01-01|date=2016-05-12|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=[[Kunnskapsforlaget]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref>  The municipality falls under the [[Inntrøndelag District Court]] and the [[Frostating Court of Appeal]].

\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[William Carlos Williams]] and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], Dick Russell and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005). Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there.

For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.

At [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H.

Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>

The Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].

\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Iain Sinclair]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[William Carlos Williams]] and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], Dick Russell and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].

The '''MAS Modèle 36''' (also known as the ''Fusil à répétition 7 mm 5 M. 36''<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 1956-03-19|title= Manuel du Grade TTA 116|trans-title= |language= French|location= |publisher= Berger-Levrault|page= 207}}</ref>) is a military [[bolt-action]] [[rifle]]. First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the [[Berthier rifle|Berthier]] and [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel]] series of [[service rifle]]s, it saw service long past the [[World War II]] period. It was manufactured from late 1937 onward by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Only 250,000 MAS-36 rifles were available to equip the French [[infantry]] during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.

==Description==
[[File:MAS36 crop.jpg|thumb|Pre World War II produced MAS-36]]

The MAS-36 is a short carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern rimless [[7.5×54mm French]] cartridge; a shortened version of the [[7.5×57mm MAS|7.5×57mm MAS mod. 1924]] cartridge that had been introduced in 1924 (then modified in 1929), for France's [[FM 24/29 light machine gun]]. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles like the two rear locking lugs of the British [[Lee-Enfield|SMLE]] rifle (easy to clean and resistant to dirt), the ''dog leg'' shaped bolt handle of the British [[Pattern 1914 Enfield|P14]]/U.S. [[M1917 Enfield]] rifle that places the bolt knob at a favorable ergonomic position in relation to the trigger and [[peep sight]], and the five-round box magazine (claw extractor) of the German [[Gewehr 98]] which stored 5 rounds in a staggered column and fed by 5-round [[stripper clips]]), to produce an \"ugly, roughly made, but immensely strong and reliable\" service rifle.<ref>Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, Harper Collins Publishers, 2005, page 238</ref>

There are just five user removable parts: a Lebel-type cruciform bayonet inserted into a guard tube under the barrel (taken out by the stopper and turned by snap-fastening the stopper in the tube to fix), the bolt body, the bolt rear cap, the firing pin and the spring of the firing pin. The metal parts of the rifle were black baked in an oven.

The MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an \"awkward fashion\" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand. Some have since been found bent backwards into a facing-downwards position like that of many other bolt-action rifles.<ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, Kruse Publications, 2000, page 182</ref> The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual [[Safety (firearms)|safety]].<ref name=\"ESAA\">{{cite book

The rifle was designed with an [[iron sight]] line consisting of a rear a tangent-type aperture sight element that was calibrated for 7.5×54mm French mle1929 C ammunition for {{convert|100|-|1200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments. The original front sighting element was milled and consisted of a front post that was protected by two open 'ears'.
There were 25 rear aperture elements available for the sight line to optimize it horizontally and laterally  in 2.32 [[Minute and second of arc|MOA]] increments during assembly at the arsenal. These arsenal mounted rear aperture elements shifted to point of aim {{convert|13.5|or|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} left or right or up or down at a range of {{convert|200|m|yd|0}}.
It is worth noting that the front stock fittings are a major component of setting the sights on a MAS-36. To discourage disassembling the front stock non-standard screws with a spanner head were used on the barrel band and nose caps. Only armorers were issued with the appropriate screw drivers to remove the front stock. If removed the front stock will probably face quite a bit of trial and error in getting the screws set back to their exact positions again.

It was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike [[bayonet]], reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. The initial implementation of this bayonet design has a distinct (although, uncommonly<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> encountered) disadvantage: with a bayonet stored in one rifle and the other empty, the top of the stored bayonet could be locked into the empty bayonet tube of the second rifle. This obscures the release button on the bayonet and results in permanently (at least up to destructive disassembly) mated rifles. In post-war use the French updated the bayonet storage design by drilling a hole in the bayonet, which allowed the locking catch to be depressed through an already-dilled hole in the bayonet cap.<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset to the right side of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upright.

==Background==
The MAS-36 was intended as an economical simple bolt action rifle to serve with rear echelon, colonial and reserve troops alongside and meant to share machining and pave the way for a new standard [[semi-automatic rifle]] before the next big conflict. The first French [[semi-automatic rifle]] evolved from the prototype MAS-38/39. A limited number of MAS-40 semi-automatic rifles entered trail service in March 1940. The [[Battle of France]] and following German occupation of France prevented large scale introduction of semi-automatic service rifles amongst French front line troops. During the 1950s the French military adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49 rifle]] as their standard service rifle.

Though intended to replace the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel Model 1886]] and Berthier rifles as well as [[Berthier carbine]]s, budget constraints limited MAS-36 production, and it served along with the former rifles in many French army and colonial units.  During World War II, the MAS-36 was used alongside the Lebel 1886 and Berthiers during the Battle of France. After the [[Battle of France]], the Germans took over a large number of MAS-36s, which were given the designation ''Gewehr 242(f)'' and put into service with their own garrison units based in occupied France and later the [[Volkssturm]].<ref name=\"ESAA\" />

==Further development==
Post World War II produced rifles feature production simplifications like stamped nose caps with a hooded front sight element, stamped magazine floor plates, a stamped front sling attachment featuring a ring, a protective measure to prevent dirt ingress in the trigger area and a side-mounted cam track and button to dial and lock the selected firing range on the rear sight element. The hooded front sight element reduced [[glare (vision)|glare]] under unfavorable light conditions and added extra protection for the post. The bolt of post World War II produced rifles can not be closed on an empty chamber, indicating the rifle needs to be reloaded. Later post war batches feature [[phosphate conversion coating|phosphating]]/[[Parkerizing]] introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment against rust. The \"second model\" is the most produced version with its derivative, the MAS 36/51.

==Postwar usage==
[[File:Crs larzac2.jpg|thumb|In service with the French Police [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité]] during the [[fight for the Larzac]] in 1978.]]
The MAS-36 was extensively used by French Army and colonial defense forces during France's postwar counter-insurgency operations in the [[First Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]],<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement français en A.F.N.|pages=12–16|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-12-13-texte-integral}}</ref> as well as in the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first=Chris|title=20th Century Military Uniforms |year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|page=85}}</ref> During the Suez Crisis, French paratroop marksmen of the ''2ème RPC'' (''Régiment de Parachutistes Coloniaux''), employed telescope-sighted MAS-36 rifles to eliminate enemy snipers.<ref>Leuliette, Pierre, ''St. Michael and the Dragon: Memoirs of a Paratrooper'', Houghton Mifflin (1964)</ref>  The MAS-36 remained in service into the early 1960s as an infantry rifle, often serving with indigenous colonial units. It was officially a substitute-standard rifle after France adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49]] rifle series in 1949, though its bolt design lives on in a dedicated sniper version of the rifle, the [[FR F1]] (now chambered in [[7.62×51mm NATO]]) and its successor the [[FR F2 sniper rifle]].

[[Gabon]] and [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]] continued to use the MAS-36 post independence; In 1968 and 1969 they supplied [[Biafra]] with MAS-36 rifles during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. [[Haiti]] presented Biafra with 300 rifles as a gift late in the conflict.<ref name=\"Jowett\">{{cite book|last=Jowett|first=Philip|title=Modern African Wars (5): The Nigerian-Biafran War 1967-70|date=2016|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1472816092}}</ref>

After the Second World War, civilian hunting rifle versions were made by MAS and by the gunsmith Jean Fournier. These half-stocked rifles were chambered for the [[7×54mm Fournier]] (common, 7.5x54mm necked down to 7mm), [[7×57mm Mauser]] (very rare), [[8×60mm S]] (less common), and [[10.75×68mm]] (rare). Hunting rifles in the two latter calibers had integral muzzle brakes. Also imported into the United States were a few military surplus MAS-36 rifles, converted to 7.62×51mm NATO from 7.5×54mm. These rifles were modified to chamber the NATO round and also had an [[SKS]] type trigger safety fitted to them.

In [[Comoros]], the French had a decent amount of MAS-36 rifles in storage during WWII and the [[Post-war]] era. When Comoros became in independent nation in 1975, the rifles were given to the new [[Military of the Comoros|Comoros Army]]. The MAS-36 was widely used during many of the coups and attempted coups that took place on the island nation from 1975 to 1989. After a reformation of the Comoros Army in 1990, the MAS-36 was replaced with newer weapons such as the [[AK-47]].<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>

In 1941, Britain and [[Free France]] occupied Syria, bringing thousands of MAS-36 rifles with them. When French forces departed from Syria in 1946, the rifles were given to the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] in order to arm their own [[Syrian Army|army]] and militias, as the Syrian government at the time was perceived as pro-western. The MAS-36 was widely used by Syrian forces in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The Israeli victory and later, a coup in Syria led to Syria's loyalty shifting towards the [[Soviet Union]] instead of western countries. After purchasing large quantities of Soviet weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, the MAS-36 became obsolete with thousands of units being sent into government storage facilities. In 2011 during the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Syrian opposition]] forces captured thousands of the stored rifles. With nearly all of the rifles being still operational, the [[Free Syrian Army]] widely used the MAS-36 from 2011 to 2015. From 2015 onward, the Free Syrian Army is decreasing the use of the MAS-36 due to scarcity of the rifle's needed 7.5mm ammunition.<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>

===FR F1 and FR F2 sniper rifles===
The French [[FR F1]] and [[FR F2]] sniper rifles utilize the same basic bolt design as the MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy inhibiting flex in these sniper rifles.

==Variants==
* '''MAS 36 CR39''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a folding hollow aluminum stock designed for use by airborne forces.
* '''MAS 36 LG48''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and 48&nbsp;mm [[rifle grenade]] [[Grenade launcher#Muzzle-fired grenades|launcher]] used in the First Indochina War.
* '''MAS 36/51''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[NATO]] standard rifle grenade launcher.
* '''Fusil modèle FR-G2''' - A highly modified MAS-36 rifle action equipped with a match barrel with harmonic compensator and telescopic sight for use by designated marksmen, used as a stopgap while the FR F1 rifles were being rebuilt into the FR F2.

The '''MAS Modèle 36''' (also known as the ''Fusil à répétition 7 mm 5 M. 36''<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 1956-03-19|title= Manuel du Grade TTA 116|trans-title= |language= French|location= |publisher= Berger-Levrault|page= 207}}</ref>) is a military [[bolt-action]] [[rifle]]. First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the [[Berthier rifle|Berthier]] and [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel]] series of [[service rifle]]s, it saw service long past the [[World War II]] period. It was manufactured from late 1937 onward by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Only 250,000 MAS-36 rifles were available to equip the French [[infantry]] during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.

==Description==
[[File:MAS36 crop.jpg|thumb|Pre World War II produced MAS-36]]

The MAS-36 is a short carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern rimless [[7.5×54mm French]] cartridge; a shortened version of the [[7.5×57mm MAS|7.5×57mm MAS mod. 1924]] cartridge that had been introduced in 1924 (then modified in 1929), for France's [[FM 24/29 light machine gun]]. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles like the two rear locking lugs of the British [[Lee-Enfield|SMLE]] rifle (easy to clean and resistant to dirt), the ''dog leg'' shaped bolt handle of the British [[Pattern 1914 Enfield|P14]]/U.S. [[M1917 Enfield]] rifle that places the bolt knob at a favorable ergonomic position in relation to the trigger and [[peep sight]], and the five-round box magazine (claw extractor) of the German [[Gewehr 98]] which stored 5 rounds in a staggered column and fed by 5-round [[stripper clips]]), to produce an \"ugly, roughly made, but immensely strong and reliable\" service rifle.<ref>Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, Harper Collins Publishers, 2005, page 238</ref>

There are just five user removable parts: a Lebel-type cruciform bayonet inserted into a guard tube under the barrel (taken out by the stopper and turned by snap-fastening the stopper in the tube to fix), the bolt body, the bolt rear cap, the firing pin and the spring of the firing pin. The metal parts of the rifle were black baked in an oven.

The MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an \"awkward fashion\" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand. Some have since been found bent backwards into a facing-downwards position like that of many other bolt-action rifles.<ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, Kruse Publications, 2000, page 182</ref> The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual [[Safety (firearms)|safety]].<ref name=\"ESAA\">{{cite book

The rifle was designed with an [[iron sight]] line consisting of a rear a tangent-type aperture sight element that was calibrated for 7.5×54mm French mle1929 C ammunition for {{convert|100|-|1200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments. The original front sighting element was milled and consisted of a front post that was protected by two open 'ears'.
There were 25 rear aperture elements available for the sight line to optimize it horizontally and laterally  in 2.32 [[Minute and second of arc|MOA]] increments during assembly at the arsenal. These arsenal mounted rear aperture elements shifted to point of aim {{convert|13.5|or|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} left or right or up or down at a range of {{convert|200|m|yd|0}}.
It is worth noting that the front stock fittings are a major component of setting the sights on a MAS-36. To discourage disassembling the front stock non-standard screws with a spanner head were used on the barrel band and nose caps. Only armorers were issued with the appropriate screw drivers to remove the front stock. If removed the front stock will probably face quite a bit of trial and error in getting the screws set back to their exact positions again.

It was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike [[bayonet]], reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. The initial implementation of this bayonet design has a distinct (although, uncommonly<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> encountered) disadvantage: with a bayonet stored in one rifle and the other empty, the top of the stored bayonet could be locked into the empty bayonet tube of the second rifle. This obscures the release button on the bayonet and results in permanently (at least up to destructive disassembly) mated rifles. In post-war use the French updated the bayonet storage design by drilling a hole in the bayonet, which allowed the locking catch to be depressed through an already-dilled hole in the bayonet cap.<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset to the right side of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upright.

==Background==
The MAS-36 was intended as an economical simple bolt action rifle to serve with rear echelon, colonial and reserve troops alongside and meant to share machining and pave the way for a new standard [[semi-automatic rifle]] before the next big conflict. The first French [[semi-automatic rifle]] evolved from the prototype MAS-38/39. A limited number of MAS-40 semi-automatic rifles entered trail service in March 1940. The [[Battle of France]] and following German occupation of France prevented large scale introduction of semi-automatic service rifles amongst French front line troops. During the 1950s the French military adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49 rifle]] as their standard service rifle.

Though intended to replace the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel Model 1886]] and Berthier rifles as well as [[Berthier carbine]]s, budget constraints limited MAS-36 production, and it served along with the former rifles in many French army and colonial units.  During World War II, the MAS-36 was used alongside the Lebel 1886 and Berthiers during the Battle of France. After the [[Battle of France]], the Germans took over a large number of MAS-36s, which were given the designation ''Gewehr 242(f)'' and put into service with their own garrison units based in occupied France and later the [[Volkssturm]].<ref name=\"ESAA\" />

==Further development==
Post World War II produced rifles feature production simplifications like stamped nose caps with a hooded front sight element, stamped magazine floor plates, a stamped front sling attachment featuring a ring, a protective measure to prevent dirt ingress in the trigger area and a side-mounted cam track and button to dial and lock the selected firing range on the rear sight element. The hooded front sight element reduced [[glare (vision)|glare]] under unfavorable light conditions and added extra protection for the post. The bolt of post World War II produced rifles can not be closed on an empty chamber, indicating the rifle needs to be reloaded. Later post war batches feature [[phosphate conversion coating|phosphating]]/[[Parkerizing]] introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment against rust. The \"second model\" is the most produced version with its derivative, the MAS 36/51.

==Postwar usage==
[[File:Crs larzac2.jpg|thumb|In service with the French Police [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité]] during the [[fight for the Larzac]] in 1978.]]
The MAS-36 was extensively used by French Army and colonial defense forces during France's postwar counter-insurgency operations in the [[First Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]],<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement français en A.F.N.|pages=12–16|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-12-13-texte-integral}}</ref> as well as in the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first=Chris|title=20th Century Military Uniforms |year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|page=85}}</ref> During the Suez Crisis, French paratroop marksmen of the ''2ème RPC'' (''Régiment de Parachutistes Coloniaux''), employed telescope-sighted MAS-36 rifles to eliminate enemy snipers.<ref>Leuliette, Pierre, ''St. Michael and the Dragon: Memoirs of a Paratrooper'', Houghton Mifflin (1964)</ref>  The MAS-36 remained in service into the early 1960s as an infantry rifle, often serving with indigenous colonial units. It was officially a substitute-standard rifle after France adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49]] rifle series in 1949, though its bolt design lives on in a dedicated sniper version of the rifle, the [[FR F1]] (now chambered in [[7.62×51mm NATO]]) and its successor the [[FR F2 sniper rifle]].

[[Gabon]] and [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]] continued to use the MAS-36 post independence; In 1968 and 1969 they supplied [[Biafra]] with MAS-36 rifles during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. [[Haiti]] presented Biafra with 300 rifles as a gift late in the conflict.<ref name=\"Jowett\">{{cite book|last=Jowett|first=Philip|title=Modern African Wars (5): The Nigerian-Biafran War 1967-70|date=2016|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1472816092}}</ref>

After the Second World War, civilian hunting rifle versions were made by MAS and by the gunsmith Jean Fournier. These half-stocked rifles were chambered for the [[7×54mm Fournier]] (common, 7.5x54mm necked down to 7mm), [[7×57mm Mauser]] (very rare), [[8×60mm S]] (less common), and [[10.75×68mm]] (rare). Hunting rifles in the two latter calibers had integral muzzle brakes. Also imported into the United States were a few military surplus MAS-36 rifles, converted to 7.62×51mm NATO from 7.5×54mm. These rifles were modified to chamber the NATO round and also had an [[SKS]] type trigger safety fitted to them.

In [[Comoros]], the French had a decent amount of MAS-36 rifles in storage during WWII and the [[Post-war]] era. When Comoros became in independent nation in 1975, the rifles were given to the new [[Military of the Comoros|Comoros Army]]. The MAS-36 was widely used during many of the coups and attempted coups that took place on the island nation from 1975 to 1989. After a reformation of the Comoros Army in 1990, the MAS-36 was replaced with newer assault weapons such as the [[AK-47]].<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>

In 1941, Britain and [[Free France]] occupied Syria, bringing thousands of MAS-36 rifles with them. When French forces departed from Syria in 1946, the rifles were given to the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] in order to arm their own [[Syrian Army|army]] and militias, as the Syrian government at the time was perceived as pro-western. The MAS-36 was widely used by Syrian forces in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The Israeli victory and later, a coup in Syria led to Syria's loyalty shifting towards the [[Soviet Union]] instead of western countries. After purchasing large quantities of Soviet weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, the MAS-36 became obsolete with thousands of units being sent into government storage facilities. In 2011 during the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Syrian opposition]] forces captured thousands of the stored rifles. With nearly all of the rifles being still operational, the [[Free Syrian Army]] widely used the MAS-36 from 2011 to 2015. From 2015 onward, the Free Syrian Army is decreasing the use of the MAS-36 due to scarcity of the rifle's needed 7.5mm ammunition.<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>

===FR F1 and FR F2 sniper rifles===
The French [[FR F1]] and [[FR F2]] sniper rifles utilize the same basic bolt design as the MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy inhibiting flex in these sniper rifles.

==Variants==
* '''MAS 36 CR39''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a folding hollow aluminum stock designed for use by airborne forces.
* '''MAS 36 LG48''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and 48&nbsp;mm [[rifle grenade]] [[Grenade launcher#Muzzle-fired grenades|launcher]] used in the First Indochina War.
* '''MAS 36/51''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[NATO]] standard rifle grenade launcher.
* '''Fusil modèle FR-G2''' - A highly modified MAS-36 rifle action equipped with a match barrel with harmonic compensator and telescopic sight for use by designated marksmen, used as a stopgap while the FR F1 rifles were being rebuilt into the FR F2.

'''''U.S. Marshals''''' is a 1998 American [[action film|action]] [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Stuart Baird]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Roy Huggins]] and [[John Pogue]]. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', which in turn was based on the [[The Fugitive (TV series)|television series of the same name]], created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of [[Dr. Richard Kimble]], portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by [[Wesley Snipes]], who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Daniel Roebuck]], [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]], and [[LaTanya Richardson]], several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.

The film was a co-production between [[Warner Bros.]] and Kopelson Entertainment. The score was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].

''U.S. Marshals'' premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.

==Plot==
Two [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agents are killed while trying to intercept a briefcase exchange taking place in a [[United Nations]] parking garage. The murders are caught on a security camera, but the criminal escapes with top secret information.

Months later, tow truck driver Mark Warren is arrested for an illegal weapons possession charge following a vehicular collision in Chicago. Through a fingerprint check, the police determine that he is actually federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Samuel Gerard, who is escorting prisoners unrelated to Roberts' case. Roberts thwarts an assassination attempt by a Chinese prisoner with an [[improvised firearm]], but the bullet pierces a window and depressurizes the cabin, forcing an emergency landing which leads to a crash in Southern Illinois . Gerard discovers Roberts has fled the crash site. DSS Special Agent John Royce is assigned to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts.

Roberts flees to New York City. There, he secures money, weapons and fake identification. Roberts also begins conducting surveillance on a Chinese diplomat named Xiang Chen. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux as well as the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, whom the Marshals find murdered by Chen. Gerard and his colleagues watch the surveillance footage of the murders in the parking garage and realize that Roberts acted in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus couldn't have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as was earlier claimed. Confronted with the evidence, DSS Director Bertram Lamb informs Gerard that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former [[CIA]] [[Special Activities Division]] operative and a former [[Force Recon]] Marine, that went rogue during an investigation to uncover a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the U.S. State Department that had been selling covert secrets to China. Chen was the contact delivering the money to Sheridan for the information and when DSS agents tried to apprehend him, Sheridan killed them in resistance and fled the scene.

Eventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he meets with, and threatens to expose, DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows as one of the conspirators who framed him. Chen tries to assassinate Sheridan as he leaves the cemetery, but inadvertently kills Barrows instead. Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Deputy Marshal Noah Newman. Meanwhile, Chen is caught and detained by Deputy Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs. At the senior care facility, Newman overhears a physical struggle and walks into a room where he witnesses Royce holding Sheridan at gunpoint. Royce suddenly shoots Newman with his gun and later lies to his associates, claiming Sheridan shot Newman. Sheridan escapes by jumping from the building onto the roof of a passing train. Newman dies of his gunshot wound.

After retrieving fingerprints from an abandoned vehicle at a marine loading dock, Gerard tracks down Sheridan on a freighter bound for Canada. During a scuffle between Sheridan and Gerard aboard the vessel, Royce shoots Sheridan, injuring him. Sheridan is later taken into custody. Gerard begins to suspect Royce may be the mole when he notices the firearm that shot Newman had its serial number filed off (in an attempt to hide it), was actually Royce's own gun earlier. Left alone to guard Sheridan's hospital room, Royce wakes Sheridan up to murder him just as Gerard steps in and kills Royce first. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped as he is exonerated and released from custody.

The result is unconvincing and disorganized. Yes, there are some spectacular stunts and slick special effects sequences. Yes, Jones is right on the money, and Snipes makes a sympathetic fugitive.

Barbara Shulgasser, writing in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', commented in positive sentiment about the acting, saying, \"The film's pacing is unimpeachable and good performances are delivered by Jones, Snipes, Irene Jacob as Sheridan's loyal girlfriend and, for brief moments, Kate Nelligan as Gerard's tough but lovable boss.\"<ref>Shulgasser, Barbara (6 March 1998).

Ergo, we can't be expected to give a rat's ass what happens to him — and don't.\"<ref>Smith, Russell (6 March 1998).

The film however, was not without its detractors. Writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]], giving the film two and a half stars out of four, observed, \"I didn't expect ''U.S. Marshals'' to be the equal of ''The Fugitive'', and it isn't.

{{quote box|quote=Snipes is luckless in the part, which merely demands a lot of scowling, then moving aside to let the stunt double take over. (The movie's other big treat features that nameless individual, who leaps off a building and swings, as if on a bungee cord, to a nearby station roof, then races after the train pulling out and leaps to land upon its roof; that's fun, but it's no movie in itself.)|source=—Stephen Hunter, writing in ''The Washington Post''<ref name=\"hunter\" />|align=right|width=40%|fontsize=85%|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quoted=2}}
Dissatisfied with the film's quality, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' said that it was \"Not so much a sequel to ''The Fugitive'' as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting—Tommy Lee Jones's Oscar-winning inflections, better-than-average direction—is nowhere in evidence.\"<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan (March 1998).

'''''U.S. Marshals''''' is a 1998 American [[action film|action]] [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Stuart Baird]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Roy Huggins]] and [[John Pogue]]. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', which in turn was based on the [[The Fugitive (TV series)|television series of the same name]], created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of [[Dr. Richard Kimble]], portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by [[Wesley Snipes]], who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Daniel Roebuck]], [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]], and [[LaTanya Richardson]], several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.

The film was a co-production between [[Warner Bros.]] and Kopelson Entertainment. The score was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].

''U.S. Marshals'' premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.

==Plot==
Two [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agents are killed while trying to intercept a briefcase exchange taking place in a [[United Nations]] parking garage. The murders are caught on a security camera, but the criminal escapes with top secret information.

Months later, tow truck driver Mark Warren is arrested for an illegal weapons possession charge following a vehicular collision in Chicago. Through a fingerprint check, the police determine that he is actually federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Samuel Gerard, who is escorting prisoners unrelated to Roberts' case. Roberts thwarts an assassination attempt by a Chinese prisoner with an [[improvised firearm]], but the bullet pierces a window and depressurizes the cabin, forcing an emergency landing which leads to a crash in Southern Illinois . Gerard discovers Roberts has fled the crash site. DSS Special Agent John Royce is assigned to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts.

Roberts flees to New York City. There, he secures money, weapons and fake identification. Roberts also begins conducting surveillance on a Chinese diplomat named Xiang Chen. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux as well as the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, whom the Marshals find murdered by Chen. Gerard and his colleagues watch the surveillance footage of the murders in the parking garage and realize that Roberts acted in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus couldn't have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as was earlier claimed. Confronted with the evidence, DSS Director Bertram Lamb informs Gerard that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former [[CIA]] [[Special Activities Division]] operative and a former [[Force Recon]] Marine, that went rogue during an investigation to uncover a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the U.S. State Department that had been selling covert secrets to China. Chen was the contact delivering the money to Sheridan for the information and when DSS agents tried to apprehend him, Sheridan killed them in resistance and fled the scene.

Eventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he meets with, and threatens to expose, DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows as one of the conspirators who framed him. Chen tries to assassinate Sheridan as he leaves the cemetery, but inadvertently kills Barrows instead. Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Deputy Marshal Noah Newman. Meanwhile, Chen is caught and detained by Deputy Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs. At the senior care facility, Newman overhears a physical struggle and walks into a room where he witnesses Royce holding Sheridan at gunpoint. Royce suddenly shoots Newman with his gun and later lies to his associates, claiming Sheridan shot Newman. Sheridan escapes by jumping from the building onto the roof of a passing train. Newman dies of his gunshot wound.

After retrieving fingerprints from an abandoned vehicle at a marine loading dock, Gerard tracks down Sheridan on a freighter bound for Canada. During a scuffle between Sheridan and Gerard aboard the vessel, Royce shoots Sheridan, injuring him. Sheridan is later taken into custody. Gerard begins to suspect Royce may be the mole when he notices the firearm that shot Newman had its serial number filed off (in an attempt to hide it), was actually Royce's own gun earlier. Left alone to guard Sheridan's hospital room, Royce wakes Sheridan up to murder him just as Gerard steps in and kills Royce first. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped as he is exonerated and released from custody.

The result is unconvincing and disorganized. Yes, there are some spectacular stunts and slick special effects sequences. Yes, Jones is right on the money, and Snipes makes a sympathetic fugitive.

Barbara Shulgasser, writing in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', commented in positive sentiment about the acting, saying, \"The film's pacing is unimpeachable and good performances are delivered by Jones, Snipes, Irene Jacob as Sheridan's loyal girlfriend and, for brief moments, Kate Nelligan as Gerard's tough but lovable boss.\"<ref>Shulgasser, Barbara (6 March 1998).

Ergo, we can't be expected to give a rat's ass what happens to him — and don't.\"<ref>Smith, Russell (6 March 1998).

The film however, was not without its detractors. Writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]], giving the film two and a half stars out of four, observed, \"I didn't expect ''U.S. Marshals'' to be the equal of ''The Fugitive'', and it isn't. But I hoped it would approach the taut tension of the 1993 film, and it doesn't.

Dissatisfied with the film's quality, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' said that it was \"Not so much a sequel to ''The Fugitive'' as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting—Tommy Lee Jones's Oscar-winning inflections, better-than-average direction—is nowhere in evidence.\"<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan (March 1998).

The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 gives a more detailed account of the settlement, which is referred to as 'Estleie'.<ref name=\"Gosling4\" />

In 1838 the [[London and South Western Railway]] Company (L&SWR) built a railway from [[Southampton]] to [[Winchester]].<ref name=\"Lambert\" /><ref name=\"Williams\">Williams, R. A. (1968) ''The London & South Western Railway'', v. 1: The formative years, and v. 2: Growth and consolidation, David and Charles, {{ISBN|0-7153-4188-X}}; {{ISBN|0-7153-5940-1}}</ref> It was decided to build a station near the little village of Barton. This [[Eastleigh railway station|railway station]] was originally named [[Bishopstoke]] Junction.<ref name=\"Lambert\" /> In 1868 the villages of Barton and Eastley were combined into one parish.<ref name=\"Lambert\" /> A parish church, the Church of the Resurrection, was built in the same year, at a cost of £2,300.<ref>[[#Clarke69|Clarke, Kathleen]]: 1995, Page 6</ref> A local noted author of many novels, [[Charlotte Mary Yonge|Charlotte Yonge]], donated £500 towards the building of the church.<ref name=\"Clarke 1995, Page 7\">[[#Clarke69|Clarke, Kathleen]]: 1995, Page 7</ref> She was rewarded by being given the privilege to choose a name for the 'new' parish; either Barton or Eastly. She chose Eastly, but with a new modern spelling; Eastleigh.<ref name=\"Clarke 1995, Page 7\" /> In 1891 the L&SWR Carriage and Wagon Works from [[Nine Elms]] in London were transferred to Eastleigh. This was followed by the [[Nine Elms Locomotive Works]] which were moved there in 1909.
These railway works were closed in 2006 but have since reopened, albeit on a smaller scale.

Eastleigh has seen a rapid and controlled expansion in residential, industrial and [[commerce|commercial development]] over recent years. The [[Eastleigh (borough)|borough of Eastleigh]] was ranked the \"9th best place to live in the UK 2006\" by a [[Channel 4]] programme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/4homes/ontv/best&worst/2006/eastleigh.html |title=BEST AND WORST PLACES TO LIVE 2006: Eastleigh |accessdate=16 November 2007 |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203102133/http://www.channel4.com/4homes/ontv/best%26worst/2006/eastleigh.html |archivedate=3 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The [[United States Navy]] established a [[naval air station]] on 23 July 1918 to assemble and repair [[Caproni Ca.5]] and [[Airco DH.4]] and [[Airco DH.9|DH.9]] bombers for the [[Northern Bombing Group]] of the [[First World War]].

The film also features [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Uday Chopra]], [[Jugal Hansraj]], [[Kim Sharma]], [[Shamita Shetty]], [[Preeti Jhangiani]], [[Anupam Kher]] and [[Archana Puran Singh]] in other pivotal roles.

Before ''Mohabbatein'', they also worked together in ''[[Josh (2000 film)|Josh]]'' (2000).

Produced on a budget of {{INRConvert|19|c}}, ''Mohabbatein'' was billed as one of the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Hindi films]] to that point. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, story, music, and performances.

Shah Rukh Khan's work in ''Mohabbatein'' is still regarded as one of his finest performances; he won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and also received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] nomination.

==Plot==

Narayan Shankar ([[Animesh Pandey]]) has been the strict Headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. He believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honor, tradition and discipline, with no room for fun and games. He is particularly intolerant of romance, decreeing that any student who is caught having a romantic affair will immediately be expelled.

Despite this draconian rule, three Gurukul students — Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]), and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) — all fall in love. Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), a carefree and sweet young girl who is his childhood friend but who already has a steady boyfriend named Deepak (Raman Lamba). Vicky is attracted to Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a sporty and feisty young student at the neighboring all-girls college who rebuffs his attempts to woo her. Karan falls for Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), an elegant young widow whose military pilot husband has been shot down and whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.

Meanwhile, Narayan hires Raj Aryan Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) as Gurukul's new music teacher. Friendly and a firm believer in the power of love, Raj Aryan makes it his mission to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to not give up and stay loyal to their loves. He tells them that he has a special love himself, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), saying that although she is dead, he imagines her to be by his side every day.

One day, as part of his plan to spread love throughout the school, Raj Aryan throws a party and invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan walks in on the party, shuts it down, and furiously threatens to fire Raj Aryan. At this point, Raj Aryan reveals that he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, who happened to be Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj Aryan from the school without even seeing his face, and a distraught Megha, unable to live without Raj Aryan, committed suicide. Raj Aryan declares that he has come back to Gurukul to honor Megha's memory by reversing the school's zero-tolerance policy on romance, and promises that before he leaves he will fill the school with so much love that even Narayan will be unable to stop it. A shocked Narayan takes this as a challenge and allows Raj Aryan to remain for a while longer.

Sameer, Vicky, and Karan are all able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj Aryan, continues to defy the rules, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels Sameer, Vicky, and Karan. Raj Aryan speaks up on their behalf, stating that they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. He also says that he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj Aryan (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him as well.

Raj Aryan's harsh words sting Narayan, and he tearfully realizes his strict no-romance policy has been misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body and resigns as headmaster of Gurukul, nominating Raj Aryan as his successor, who accepts and reconciles with Narayan.

==Production==
Before the production of the film, Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career with little success, and was also in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, not only hurting his image but leaving him almost penniless. It was at this time that Bachchan contacted his friend, director/producer [[Yash Chopra]], who told him of an upcoming production that he could be in.<ref name=trib>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Lead Article |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=4 March 2001 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref> With ''Mohabbatein'', Bachchan was finally able to shed his \"hero\" image and to play older, more mature roles.<ref name=trib/> This was also the first film in which Bachchan and Khan appeared together. This created a strong buzz for the film, as it brought two huge stars of different generations together.

The railway station scenes were shot at Apta Railway Station, Panvel Maharashtra, India. The scene where Karan asks for friendship from Kiran was shot at Birla Mandir, Revdanda, Hyderabad, Alibag, Maharashtra, India. It was rumored that [[Sridevi]] was approached to be a love interest to Narayan Shankar, but she turned down the role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000312/spectrum/bolly.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Bollywood Bhelpuri |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=12 March 2000 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref> Midway through the filming of the song \"Aankhein Khuli\", [[Jugal Hansraj]] fractured his foot, which required him to wear a cast for the rest of the filming of the song.

The film also features [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Uday Chopra]], [[Jugal Hansraj]], [[Kim Sharma]], [[Shamita Shetty]], [[Preeti Jhangiani]], [[Anupam Kher]] and [[Archana Puran Singh]] in other pivotal roles.

Before ''Mohabbatein'', they also worked together in ''[[Josh (2000 film)|Josh]]'' (2000).

Produced on a budget of {{INRConvert|19|c}}, ''Mohabbatein'' was billed as one of the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Hindi films]] to that point. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, story, music, and performances. With a worldwide gross of {{INRConvert|90|c}}, the film became a major critical and commercial success. It was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year worldwide as well as abroad, and the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year in India. The film changed Amitabh Bachchan's career prospects and earned him critical acclaim as well as several awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Shah Rukh Khan's work in ''Mohabbatein'' is still regarded as one of his finest performances; he won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and also received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] nomination.

==Plot==

Narayan Shankar ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) has been the strict Headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. He believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honor, tradition and discipline, with no room for fun and games. He is particularly intolerant of romance, decreeing that any student who is caught having a romantic affair will immediately be expelled.

Despite this draconian rule, three Gurukul students — Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]), and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) — all fall in love. Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), a carefree and sweet young girl who is his childhood friend but who already has a steady boyfriend named Deepak (Raman Lamba). Vicky is attracted to Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a sporty and feisty young student at the neighboring all-girls college who rebuffs his attempts to woo her. Karan falls for Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), an elegant young widow whose military pilot husband has been shot down and whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.

Meanwhile, Narayan hires Raj Aryan Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) as Gurukul's new music teacher. Friendly and a firm believer in the power of love, Raj Aryan makes it his mission to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to not give up and stay loyal to their loves. He tells them that he has a special love himself, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), saying that although she is dead, he imagines her to be by his side every day.

One day, as part of his plan to spread love throughout the school, Raj Aryan throws a party and invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan walks in on the party, shuts it down, and furiously threatens to fire Raj Aryan. At this point, Raj Aryan reveals that he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, who happened to be Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj Aryan from the school without even seeing his face, and a distraught Megha, unable to live without Raj Aryan, committed suicide. Raj Aryan declares that he has come back to Gurukul to honor Megha's memory by reversing the school's zero-tolerance policy on romance, and promises that before he leaves he will fill the school with so much love that even Narayan will be unable to stop it. A shocked Narayan takes this as a challenge and allows Raj Aryan to remain for a while longer.

Sameer, Vicky, and Karan are all able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj Aryan, continues to defy the rules, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels Sameer, Vicky, and Karan. Raj Aryan speaks up on their behalf, stating that they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. He also says that he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj Aryan (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him as well.

Raj Aryan's harsh words sting Narayan, and he tearfully realizes his strict no-romance policy has been misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body and resigns as headmaster of Gurukul, nominating Raj Aryan as his successor, who accepts and reconciles with Narayan.

==Production==
Before the production of the film, Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career with little success, and was also in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, not only hurting his image but leaving him almost penniless. It was at this time that Bachchan contacted his friend, director/producer [[Yash Chopra]], who told him of an upcoming production that he could be in.<ref name=trib>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Lead Article |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=4 March 2001 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref> With ''Mohabbatein'', Bachchan was finally able to shed his \"hero\" image and to play older, more mature roles.<ref name=trib/> This was also the first film in which Bachchan and Khan appeared together. This created a strong buzz for the film, as it brought two huge stars of different generations together.

The '''Air Force Test Center''' ('''AFTC''') is a development and test organization of the [[United States Air Force]]. It conducts research, development, test, and evaluation of aerospace systems from concept to deployment. It has test flown every aircraft in the Army Air Force's and the Air Force's inventory since World War II. The center employs nearly 13,000 people, and controls the second largest base in the Air Force.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6573 |title=AFFTC Fact Sheet |access-date=22 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602024549/http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6573 |archive-date=2 June 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

On 6 July 2012, the previous Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) was redesignated as the Air Force Test Center (AFTC).<ref name=\"af.mil\">[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123309070 AFFTC to be re-designated as Air Force Test Center]</ref> Up until July 2012, the AFTC consisted of two subordinate wings. The [[95th Air Base Wing]] (95 ABW) provided installation support for all units on [[Edwards Air Force Base]] while the [[412th Test Wing]] (412 TW) conducted aircraft testing and evaluation at Edwards. In July 2012, the redesignated [[96th Test Wing]] (96 TW), an amalgamation of the former 96th Air Base Wing, the former [[46th Test Wing]] and the former [[Air Armament Center]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida, and the [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]] at [[Arnold Air Force Base]], Tennessee, also came under control of the AFTC.

==Overview==
The Air Force Test Center (AFTC) conducts developmental and follow-on testing and evaluation of manned and unmanned aircraft and related avionics, flight-control, and weapon systems. AFTC also operates the USAF Test Pilot School, which trains test pilots, flight-test engineers, and flight-test navigators.

The Center has tested all the aircraft types in the Air Force inventory, and the center's work force—civilian, military and contractor—work together to flight test and evaluate new aircraft and upgrades to aircraft already in inventory for Air Force units, the Department of Defense, NASA and other government agencies. Upgrades to be tested here include improvements to radar, weapons-delivery and navigation systems, and a system to give tactical pilots the ability to strike ground targets from low altitudes at night and in adverse weather.

The Air Force Test Center develops, operates and maintains the Edwards Flight Test Range and Utah Test and Training Range. It also operates the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. The Center provides test infrastructure, overhead support for development, and operational test and evaluation support for aerospace research vehicles. AFFTC resources include the test and evaluation mission simulator, the Benefield Anechoic Chamber, Ridley Mission Control, and the Integration Facility for Avionics Systems Testing.

:: The USAF Test Pilot School, also part of the 412th Test Wing, is where select Air Force pilots, navigators/combat systems officers, and engineers learn how to conduct flight tests and generate the data needed to carry out test missions. A small number of Army Aviators and USN and USMC Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers also attend USAFTPS.  Human lives and millions of dollars depend upon how carefully a test mission is planned and flown. The comprehensive curriculum of Test Pilot School is fundamental to the success of flight test and evaluation.

==History==
===World War II===
[[File:P-59 Airacomet.jpg|thumb|left|P-59A Airacomet with the short-lived red outlined National markings (June–September 1943).]]
Flight testing began at Muroc Army Air Base (later renamed Edwards Air Force Base) during [[World War II]].  It dates to 17 February 1942 when the 477th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron (Reduced) was moved from [[Wright Field]], Ohio to the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range.   Its mission was to test the secret Bell Aircraft [[XP-59]]A jet fighter.<ref name=\"AFMC\">[https://www.scribd.com/doc/45555113/Air-Force-Flight-Test-History  Against the Wind, 90 Years of Flight Testing in the Miami Valley,  History office, Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, 1993]</ref> Muroc was chosen as it was a secluded site in the Mojave Desert out of the public eye.  The first XP-59A aircraft arrived on 21 September 1942 for ground tests and it was fitted with a dummy propeller attached to its nose, just in case the curious might see it and start asking why this aircraft didn't have a propeller.<ref name=\"ATS\">[http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/afhistory/AFFTC1961Opt.pdf  K286.69.37, Volume 1, History of the Air Force FLight Test Center, Air Force Systems Command, AFHRA, 1961.]</ref>

On 30 September, Bell's test pilot Robert Stanley was undergoing some high-speed taxiing trials with the XP-59A when the aircraft \"inadvertently\" became airborne for a short time, reaching an altitude of ten feet for one-half-mile during high speed taxi tests.   However, the first official flight was on 1 October with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Royal Air Force, Army, Bell and General Electric personnel on hand.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>
[[File:XP-80A Gray Ghost af.jpg|thumb|Lockheed XP-80A, AAF Ser. No. 44-83021, Gray Ghost in flight.]]
XP-59 aircraft testing continued at Muroc for the remainder of 1942 and in 1943.  The second XP-59A flew on 15 February 1943 and the third late in April.  Shortly before the first flight of the XP-59A, the USAAF had placed an order for one hundred P-59A Airacomets. However, the performance of the XP-59A service test aircraft had proved to be rather disappointing, not even up to the standards of conventional piston-engined fighter aircraft already in service with the USAAF. It was considered rather unlikely that any appreciable improvements in the performance of the P-59 would be soon be forthcoming, and by the early fall of 1943 the Airacomet was no longer considered by the USAAF as being worthy of consideration as an operational combat type.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

Most of the P-59s went to the [[Fourth Air Force]] [[412th Fighter Group]] where they served in the training role. The Airacomets provided USAAF pilots and ground crews with valuable data about the difficulties and pitfalls involved in converting to jet aircraft. This information proved quite useful when more advanced jet fighters finally became available in quantity.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

In the fall of 1944, [[Eighth Air Force]] tested its [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es along with [[P-51D Mustang]]s against the XP-59 to see how well they stood up against the jet.  The results were obvious.   Also in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at Muroc for experimental work in rocket firing, remaining until the end of 1945.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

Although the XP-59A provided valuable experience to the USAAF in the operation of jet-powered aircraft, it was basically a flying testbed and not a combat-capable aircraft. The USAAF had to look elsewhere in its search for an effective jet fighter.   The first flight of the [[Lockheed XP-80]] took place on 8 January 1944 with test pilot Milo Burcham at the controls. The XP-80 was eventually transferred to the 412th Fighter Group for tactical evaluation.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

===Postwar era===
[[File:YB49-6 300.jpg|thumb|left|The Northrop YB-49 on a test flight, 1949]]
Following the war flight testing officially became the base's primary mission. Test work on the Lockheed P-80, the successor to the XP-59 was undertaken for the greater part of 1945. The [[Convair XP-81]] and [[Republic XP-84]] Thunderjet arrived at Muroc in 1946 for testing. It was clear by this time that the base's mission would be a proving ground for aircraft and a testing site for experimental aircraft.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

On 14 October 1947, Captain [[Charles E. Yeager]], piloted the [[Bell X-1]] to a speed of 760 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier for the first time. In the years since, multiple generations of experimental \"X-Planes\" have been tested and flown at Edwards, for the Air Force and other agencies, such as NASA.<ref name=\"ATS\"/> Simultaneously, the base was hosting testing for proposed weapon systems including the [[F-84 Thunderjet]], [[F-86 Sabre]], [[F-94 Starfire]], and [[B-45 Tornado]].<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\">[http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-028.pdf James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012075524/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-028.pdf |date=12 October 2012 }}</ref>

The first [[Northrop XB-35]] Flying Wing (serial number 42-13603) took off on its maiden flight on 25 June 1946, with Max Stanley as pilot and Dale Schroeder as flight engineer. On this first flight, the aircraft was flown from Hawthorne to Muroc, a flight lasting 45 minutes.  The propeller-driven XB-35 however, was considered outdated and it was replaced by the jet-powered [[YB-49]] on 21 October 1947 from the [[Northrop Field]] at Hawthorne, California, piloted by Northrop's chief test pilot, Max Stanley. At the end of the flight, it landed at Muroc Air Force Base where it was to carry out its test program. On the morning of 5 June 1948, XB-49 42-102368 crashed just north of Muroc Dry Lake. The pilot, Air Force Capt. Glenn Edwards, and all four other members of the crew were killed. In 1951 Muroc AFB was re-designated '''Edwards Air Force Base''' in his honor.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

Later modified as an X-15A-2, it is now on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|NMUSAF]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio.]]
With the transfer of Edwards AFB from Air Materiel Command to the newly created Air Research and Development Command, the postwar 2759th Experimental Wing was inactivated, being replaced by the Air Force Flight Test Center on 25 June 1951.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

Technology pioneered through the AFTC led to remarkable advancements in aviation.  The \"[[Century Series]]\" of aircraft, the [[F-100 Super Sabre]]; [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], the Mach 2 [[F-104 Starfighter]]; [[F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[F-106 Delta Dart]] made supersonic flight commonplace in combat aircraft.  The Century Series fighters defined the basic speed and altitude envelopes for fighters that are still in effect today.  Meanwhile, the aircraft of the X series continued to set speed and altitude records.<ref name=\"EAFB\">Edwards Air Force Base Guide, Edwards AFB Public Affairs Office, 2013</ref>

The 1960s ushered in the Space Age.  The Test Pilot School was re-designated as the Aerospace Research Pilot School as it began to train future astronauts.   The [[North American X-15]] arrived and began to explore hypersonic and exoatmospheric flight.  Major [[Robert Michael White|Robert \"Bob\" White]] became the first person to fly an aircraft into space on 17 July 1962 when he flew his [[North American X-15|X-15]] to an altitude of 314,750 feet.  Flying the same airframe a year later [[Joseph Albert Walker|Joe Walker]] reached an altitude of 354,200 feet (67 miles).  On 3 October 1967 [[William J. Knight|William \"Pete\" Knight]] set the standing aircraft speed record of Mach&nbsp;6.72 (4,520&nbsp;mph), again flying an X-15.  When the space program began a number of [[astronaut]]s were selected from the Air Force's test pilot cadre.  Additionally, the AFTC assisted with the testing of rocket engines and re-entry vehicles.<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\"/><ref name=\"EAFB\"/>
[[File:North American XB-70 above runway ECN-792.jpg|thumb|left|XB-70A Valkyrie on takeoff|alt=White delta-wing aircraft taking off with landing gears retracting. At the front of aircraft are canards.]]
Along with the X-15, pilots at Edwards were expanding the frontiers of atmospheric flight, testing the [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] high-altitude bomber, along with the [[YF-12]] interceptor for [[Air Defense Command]] and the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] Strategic Reconnaissance aircraft for [[Strategic Air Command]].<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>

With the decline of the military manned space mission after the [[NASA]] Lunar Landing Program ended, the Aerospace Research Pilot School was once again re-designated as the USAF Test Pilot School.   The school replaced its space-oriented curriculum with an entire new battery of courses focusing on systems and test management.   New aircraft arrived in the 1970s with the McDonnell [[F-15 Eagle]]. Two major \"fly-offs\" were conducted, one between the [[Northrop YA-9]] and the [[Fairchild Republic YA-10]], the other between the [[Northrop YF-17]] and [[General Dynamics YF-16]].  The Rockwell [[B-1 Lancer]] began flight testing in 1974 with its multitude of highly sophisticated offensive and defensive systems.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>

In April 1981, the wheels of [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] touched down on Rogers Dry Lakebed, with Astronauts John Young and Robert Crippin successfully landing the first orbiting space vehicle ever to leave the Earth under rocket power and return to Earth aerodynamically for re-use.  The \"Flying Wing\" returned to Edwards in the late 1980s when the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber began testing, and at a remote site, the [[F-117A Nighthawk]] stealth fighter.  [[Air-Launched Cruise Missile]], and [[LANTIRN]] systems were also tested during the 1980s.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>

The 1990s saw the arrival of the Lockheed YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23 prototype fighters, both using stealth technology and designed for air supremacy with agility, high-speed and supersonic cruise capability.  Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was tested that has subsequently been used extensively for high-level reconnaissance in the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq began testing in February 1998.   The MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper attack counterparts, tested at Edwards, today fill a critical role in the Global War on Terrorism.
[[File:YAL-1A Airborne Laser unstowed crop.jpg|thumb|YAL-1A Airborne Laser undergoing flight testing.]]
More recently the AFTC has been part of the [[ASM-135 ASAT|anti-satellite missile]] and [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] development.  Additionally, the center has played a key role in the development of the Air Force's X-35A and X-32A prototypes for the Joint Strike Fighter program, both making their first flights in late 2000.  The resulting [[F-35 Lightning II]] is being built in three versions for the Air Force, the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as multiple allied military partners.<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\"/> [[NASA]] maintains its [[Armstrong Flight Research Center]] on Edwards and partners with the AFFTC on aircraft development.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>

Effective 6 July 2012, it was re-designated from the Air Force Flight Test Center to the Air Force Test Center, part of a new five-center construct across Air Force Materiel Command. The new name reflects AFTC's expanded mission which includes Eglin AFB and Arnold AFB as well as flight test activities at Edwards.<ref name=\"af.mil\"/>

The '''Air Force Test Center''' ('''AFTC''') is a development and test organization of the [[United States Air Force]]. It conducts research, development, test, and evaluation of aerospace systems from concept to deployment. It has test flown every aircraft in the Army Air Force's and the Air Force's inventory since World War II. The center employs nearly 13,000 people, and controls the second largest base in the Air Force.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6573 |title=AFFTC Fact Sheet |access-date=22 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602024549/http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6573 |archive-date=2 June 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

On 6 July 2012, the previous Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) was redesignated as the Air Force Test Center (AFTC).<ref name=\"af.mil\">[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123309070 AFFTC to be re-designated as Air Force Test Center]</ref> Up until July 2012, the AFTC consisted of two subordinate wings. The [[95th Air Base Wing]] (95 ABW) provided installation support for all units on [[Edwards Air Force Base]] while the [[412th Test Wing]] (412 TW) conducted aircraft testing and evaluation at Edwards. In July 2012, the redesignated [[96th Test Wing]] (96 TW), an amalgamation of the former 96th Air Base Wing, the former [[46th Test Wing]] and the former [[Air Armament Center]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida, and the [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]] at [[Arnold Air Force Base]], Tennessee, also came under control of the AFTC.

==Overview==
The Air Force Test Center (AFTC) conducts developmental and follow-on testing and evaluation of manned and unmanned aircraft and related avionics, flight-control, and weapon systems. AFTC also operates the USAF Test Pilot School, which trains test pilots, flight-test engineers, and flight-test navigators.

The Center has tested all the aircraft types in the Air Force inventory, and the center's work force—civilian, military and contractor—work together to flight test and evaluate new aircraft and upgrades to aircraft already in inventory for Air Force units, the Department of Defense, NASA and other government agencies. Upgrades to be tested here include improvements to radar, weapons-delivery and navigation systems, and a system to give tactical pilots the ability to strike ground targets from low altitudes at night and in adverse weather.

The Air Force Test Center develops, operates and maintains the Edwards Flight Test Range and Utah Test and Training Range. It also operates the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. The Center provides test infrastructure, overhead support for development, and operational test and evaluation support for aerospace research vehicles. AFFTC resources include the test and evaluation mission simulator, the Benefield Anechoic Chamber, Ridley Mission Control, and the Integration Facility for Avionics Systems Testing.

==History==
===World War II===
[[File:P-59 Airacomet.jpg|thumb|left|P-59A Airacomet with the short-lived red outlined National markings (June–September 1943).]]
Flight testing began at Muroc Army Air Base (later renamed Edwards Air Force Base) during [[World War II]].  It dates to 17 February 1942 when the 477th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron (Reduced) was moved from [[Wright Field]], Ohio to the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range.   Its mission was to test the secret Bell Aircraft [[XP-59]]A jet fighter.<ref name=\"AFMC\">[https://www.scribd.com/doc/45555113/Air-Force-Flight-Test-History  Against the Wind, 90 Years of Flight Testing in the Miami Valley,  History office, Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, 1993]</ref> Muroc was chosen as it was a secluded site in the Mojave Desert out of the public eye.  The first XP-59A aircraft arrived on 21 September 1942 for ground tests and it was fitted with a dummy propeller attached to its nose, just in case the curious might see it and start asking why this aircraft didn't have a propeller.<ref name=\"ATS\">[http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/afhistory/AFFTC1961Opt.pdf  K286.69.37, Volume 1, History of the Air Force FLight Test Center, Air Force Systems Command, AFHRA, 1961.]</ref>

On 30 September, Bell's test pilot Robert Stanley was undergoing some high-speed taxiing trials with the XP-59A when the aircraft \"inadvertently\" became airborne for a short time, reaching an altitude of ten feet for one-half-mile during high speed taxi tests.   However, the first official flight was on 1 October with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Royal Air Force, Army, Bell and General Electric personnel on hand.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>
[[File:XP-80A Gray Ghost af.jpg|thumb|Lockheed XP-80A, AAF Ser. No. 44-83021, Gray Ghost in flight.]]
XP-59 aircraft testing continued at Muroc for the remainder of 1942 and in 1943.  The second XP-59A flew on 15 February 1943 and the third late in April.  Shortly before the first flight of the XP-59A, the USAAF had placed an order for one hundred P-59A Airacomets. However, the performance of the XP-59A service test aircraft had proved to be rather disappointing, not even up to the standards of conventional piston-engined fighter aircraft already in service with the USAAF. It was considered rather unlikely that any appreciable improvements in the performance of the P-59 would be soon be forthcoming, and by the early fall of 1943 the Airacomet was no longer considered by the USAAF as being worthy of consideration as an operational combat type.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

Most of the P-59s went to the [[Fourth Air Force]] [[412th Fighter Group]] where they served in the training role. The Airacomets provided USAAF pilots and ground crews with valuable data about the difficulties and pitfalls involved in converting to jet aircraft. This information proved quite useful when more advanced jet fighters finally became available in quantity.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

In the fall of 1944, [[Eighth Air Force]] tested its [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es along with [[P-51D Mustang]]s against the XP-59 to see how well they stood up against the jet.  The results were obvious.   Also in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at Muroc for experimental work in rocket firing, remaining until the end of 1945.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

Although the XP-59A provided valuable experience to the USAAF in the operation of jet-powered aircraft, it was basically a flying testbed and not a combat-capable aircraft. The USAAF had to look elsewhere in its search for an effective jet fighter.   The first flight of the [[Lockheed XP-80]] took place on 8 January 1944 with test pilot Milo Burcham at the controls. The XP-80 was eventually transferred to the 412th Fighter Group for tactical evaluation.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

===Postwar era===
[[File:YB49-6 300.jpg|thumb|left|The Northrop YB-49 on a test flight, 1949]]
Following the war flight testing officially became the base's primary mission. Test work on the Lockheed P-80, the successor to the XP-59 was undertaken for the greater part of 1945. The [[Convair XP-81]] and [[Republic XP-84]] Thunderjet arrived at Muroc in 1946 for testing. It was clear by this time that the base's mission would be a proving ground for aircraft and a testing site for experimental aircraft.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

On 14 October 1947, Captain [[Charles E. Yeager]], piloted the [[Bell X-1]] to a speed of 760 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier for the first time. In the years since, multiple generations of experimental \"X-Planes\" have been tested and flown at Edwards, for the Air Force and other agencies, such as NASA.<ref name=\"ATS\"/> Simultaneously, the base was hosting testing for proposed weapon systems including the [[F-84 Thunderjet]], [[F-86 Sabre]], [[F-94 Starfire]], and [[B-45 Tornado]].<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\">[http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-028.pdf James O.

The first [[Northrop XB-35]] Flying Wing (serial number 42-13603) took off on its maiden flight on 25 June 1946, with Max Stanley as pilot and Dale Schroeder as flight engineer. On this first flight, the aircraft was flown from Hawthorne to Muroc, a flight lasting 45 minutes.  The propeller-driven XB-35 however, was considered outdated and it was replaced by the jet-powered [[YB-49]] on 21 October 1947 from the [[Northrop Field]] at Hawthorne, California, piloted by Northrop's chief test pilot, Max Stanley. At the end of the flight, it landed at Muroc Air Force Base where it was to carry out its test program. On the morning of 5 June 1948, XB-49 42-102368 crashed just north of Muroc Dry Lake. The pilot, Air Force Capt. Glenn Edwards, and all four other members of the crew were killed. In 1951 Muroc AFB was re-designated '''Edwards Air Force Base''' in his honor.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

Later modified as an X-15A-2, it is now on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|NMUSAF]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio.]]
With the transfer of Edwards AFB from Air Materiel Command to the newly created Air Research and Development Command, the postwar 2759th Experimental Wing was inactivated, being replaced by the Air Force Flight Test Center on 25 June 1951.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>

Technology pioneered through the AFTC led to remarkable advancements in aviation.  The \"[[Century Series]]\" of aircraft, the [[F-100 Super Sabre]]; [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], the Mach 2 [[F-104 Starfighter]]; [[F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[F-106 Delta Dart]] made supersonic flight commonplace in combat aircraft.  The Century Series fighters defined the basic speed and altitude envelopes for fighters that are still in effect today.  Meanwhile, the aircraft of the X series continued to set speed and altitude records.<ref name=\"EAFB\">Edwards Air Force Base Guide, Edwards AFB Public Affairs Office, 2013</ref>

The 1960s ushered in the Space Age.  The Test Pilot School was re-designated as the Aerospace Research Pilot School as it began to train future astronauts.   The [[North American X-15]] arrived and began to explore hypersonic and exoatmospheric flight.  Major [[Robert Michael White|Robert \"Bob\" White]] became the first person to fly an aircraft into space on 17 July 1962 when he flew his [[North American X-15|X-15]] to an altitude of 314,750 feet.  Flying the same airframe a year later [[Joseph Albert Walker|Joe Walker]] reached an altitude of 354,200 feet (67 miles).  On 3 October 1967 [[William J. Knight|William \"Pete\" Knight]] set the standing aircraft speed record of Mach&nbsp;6.72 (4,520&nbsp;mph), again flying an X-15.  When the space program began a number of [[astronaut]]s were selected from the Air Force's test pilot cadre.  Additionally, the AFTC assisted with the testing of rocket engines and re-entry vehicles.<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\"/><ref name=\"EAFB\"/>
[[File:North American XB-70 above runway ECN-792.jpg|thumb|left|XB-70A Valkyrie on takeoff|alt=White delta-wing aircraft taking off with landing gears retracting. At the front of aircraft are canards.]]
Along with the X-15, pilots at Edwards were expanding the frontiers of atmospheric flight, testing the [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] high-altitude bomber, along with the [[YF-12]] interceptor for [[Air Defense Command]] and the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] Strategic Reconnaissance aircraft for [[Strategic Air Command]].<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>

With the decline of the military manned space mission after the [[NASA]] Lunar Landing Program ended, the Aerospace Research Pilot School was once again re-designated as the USAF Test Pilot School.   The school replaced its space-oriented curriculum with an entire new battery of courses focusing on systems and test management.   New aircraft arrived in the 1970s with the McDonnell [[F-15 Eagle]]. Two major \"fly-offs\" were conducted, one between the [[Northrop YA-9]] and the [[Fairchild Republic YA-10]], the other between the [[Northrop YF-17]] and [[General Dynamics YF-16]].  The Rockwell [[B-1 Lancer]] began flight testing in 1974 with its multitude of highly sophisticated offensive and defensive systems.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>

In April 1981, the wheels of [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] touched down on Rogers Dry Lakebed, with Astronauts John Young and Robert Crippin successfully landing the first orbiting space vehicle ever to leave the Earth under rocket power and return to Earth aerodynamically for re-use.  The \"Flying Wing\" returned to Edwards in the late 1980s when the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber began testing, and at a remote site, the [[F-117A Nighthawk]] stealth fighter.  [[Air-Launched Cruise Missile]], and [[LANTIRN]] systems were also tested during the 1980s.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>

The 1990s saw the arrival of the Lockheed YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23 prototype fighters, both using stealth technology and designed for air supremacy with agility, high-speed and supersonic cruise capability.  Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was tested that has subsequently been used extensively for high-level reconnaissance in the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq began testing in February 1998.   The MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper attack counterparts, tested at Edwards, today fill a critical role in the Global War on Terrorism.
[[File:YAL-1A Airborne Laser unstowed crop.jpg|thumb|YAL-1A Airborne Laser undergoing flight testing.]]
More recently the AFTC has been part of the [[ASM-135 ASAT|anti-satellite missile]] and [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] development.  Additionally, the center has played a key role in the development of the Air Force's X-35A and X-32A prototypes for the Joint Strike Fighter program, both making their first flights in late 2000.  The resulting [[F-35 Lightning II]] is being built in three versions for the Air Force, the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as multiple allied military partners.<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\"/> [[NASA]] maintains its [[Armstrong Flight Research Center]] on Edwards and partners with the AFFTC on aircraft development.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>

Effective 6 July 2012, it was re-designated from the Air Force Flight Test Center to the Air Force Test Center, part of a new five-center construct across Air Force Materiel Command. The new name reflects AFTC's expanded mission which includes Eglin AFB and Arnold AFB as well as flight test activities at Edwards.<ref name=\"af.mil\"/>

→‎Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy:ce,safe,Jzsj,"{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book 
|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About
|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,
written by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at 
the time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's 
subjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
There was one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]], which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements, including the existing marble floors and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factory for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discoveries of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>
[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]

=== Protestants and Jews ===
{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time. At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls to return the child to his parents, from [[The Times|''The Times'']], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont,<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> were politely rejected.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists – both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution – saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia, playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]]. The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope, following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
{{See also|Giuseppe Garibaldi}}
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]]. widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

===Prisoner of the Vatican===
In 1929, the papacy — then under [[Pope Pius XI]] — renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book

the time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's 
subjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists – both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution – saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia, playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]]. The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope, following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]]. widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book 
|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About
|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,
written by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at 
the time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's 
subjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
There was one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]], which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements, including the existing marble floors and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factory for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discoveries of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>

The '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.

A view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th 
century is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book 
|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About

written by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at 
the time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's 
subjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>

==Pius' internal administration==
Pius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von Döllinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}
The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>

The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>

=== Finance ===
[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]
The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>

The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>

=== Commerce and trade ===
[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]
Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>

To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>

=== Justice ===
The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>

=== Military ===
[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]
A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>

=== Education ===
Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>

[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] 
The two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>

=== Social life ===
There was one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L’Osservatore Romano]], which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>

=== Arts ===
[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]
Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements, including the existing marble floors and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factory for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>

Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discoveries of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>
[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]

=== Protestants and Jews ===
{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}
The Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time. At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>

In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls to return the child to his parents, from [[The Times|''The Times'']], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont,<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> were politely rejected.

==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==

===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===
[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.

===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===
In the years that followed, Italian nationalists — both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution — saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.

===Second Italian War of Independence===
[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]
After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].

===Rome declared capital of Italy===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]
Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].

===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===
After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.

:The Pope’s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King’s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>

===Military resistance to Italy===
On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.

===Capture of Rome===
{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}
This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.
