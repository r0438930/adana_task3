After release from the cam, the hammer accelerates downwards to hit the outer casing and cause its penetration through the [[regolith]]. Meanwhile a suppressor mass travels upwards and its kinetic energy is compensated by gravitational potential and compression of a brake spring and wire helix on the opposite side of the mole.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'/> \n\nIn principle, every {{cvt|50|cm}} the probe puts out a pulse of heat and its sensors measure how the heat pulse changes with time.

After release from the cam, the hammer accelerates downwards to hit the outer casing and cause its penetration through the [[regolith]]. Meanwhile a suppressor mass travels upwards and its kinetic energy is compensated by gravitational potential and compression of a brake spring and wire helix on the opposite side of the mole.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'/> \n\nIn principle, every {{cvt|50|cm}} the probe puts out a pulse of heat and its sensors measure how the heat pulse changes with time. If the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] material is a thermal conductor, like metal, the pulse will decay quickly.<ref name=\"Home HP3\" />  The mole is first allowed to cool down for two days, then it is heated to about {{cvt|10|C|F|abbr=on}} over 24 hours.
