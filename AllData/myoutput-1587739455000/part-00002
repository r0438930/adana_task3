With the out set of colonial rule in the [[Indian Ocean]], Sri Lanka was occupied by several major colonial empires that from time-to-time became the dominant power in the Indian Ocean. The colonists built several western styled forts, mostly in and round the cost of the island. The first to build colonial forts in Sri Lanka were the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], these forts were captured and later expanded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] occupied these  Dutch forts during the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nMost of colonial forts were garrisoned up until the early 20th century. The coastal forts had [[coastal artillery]] manned by the [[Ceylon Garrison Artillery]] during the two world wars. Most of these were abandoned by the military, but retained civil administrative officers, while others retained military garrisons, which were more administrative than operational. Some were reoccupied by military units with the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], Jaffna fort for example came under siege several times.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Ancient forts ==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
