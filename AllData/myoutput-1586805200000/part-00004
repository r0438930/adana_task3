The story was set in an [[alternative history]] 1970s, in which [[Nazi Germany]] won [[World War II]] and [[England]] is run by a collaborationist fascist government. Peter Ingram ([[Kenneth More]]) is a writer for a soap opera (also called ''An Englishman's Castle''), which is set in [[London]] in 1940, during the fictional Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Ingram is a successful London screenwriter, the creator of one of the most popular television shows in Nazi-occupied Europe, ''An Englishman's Castle''. It is a period soap opera, following an ordinary London family during an imagined German invasion of England in 1940. Ingram is oblivious to Nazi rule, which is hidden behind a fa\u00e7ade of seemingly-normal English daily life. The invasion was followed by several years of guerrilla warfare, which ended in a truce with Germany and an amnesty that enabled the resisters to resume normal daily life in return for accepting the reality of German occupation, which they generally did, feeling that further resistance was futile.\n\nIngram's show furthers the feeling among the population in the present (1978) and so is highly valuable to the authorities. A kind of normality was restored, with few Germans to be seen in the streets. German rule is maintained mainly through an extensive system of collaborators, known as \"[[delator]]s\". When dissidents are detained it is done by polite, soft-spoken English police, but they are then delivered to horrible torture chambers, kept discreetly out of sight.\n\nIngram gradually becomes aware of the real state of things. Firstly, he encounters his superiors' firm objection to the inclusion of a character with a [[Jewish]] name in the series. The series is largely based on his own life, he argues, and the Jewish man was a real friend. However, having such a character would violate the official policy of letting the [[Holocaust|extermination of the Jews]] remain forgotten, never discussed openly. Then, Ingram discovers that his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], Jill, one of the stars of his show, is secretly Jewish and a member of an underground [[resistance movement]]. Eventually, his loyalties are tested, and he sides with the resistance.\n\nWhen the resistance decides to include the [[code word]] that will signal a nationwide [[insurgency]] in his show, due to its huge audience, he complies, allowing Sally (Jill) to speak the phrase when it is filmed. However, in the closing scene, he locks himself in his office as the episode is broadcast, cuts off the feed just before her scene airs, and speaks the phrase himself instead, live over the air. As the sounds of a rebellion against the collaborationist government begin to come through the windows of his office, Ingram awaits the [[secret police]], when someone breaks down the door and he turns to stare at the unseen intruder.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kenneth More]] as Peter Ingram\n* [[Isla Blair]] as Jill / \"Sally\"\n* [[Anthony Bate]] as Harmer\n* [[Kathleen Byron]] as Mrs. Ingram\n* [[Noel Dyson]] as Connie / \"Mrs. Worth\"\n* [[Rob Edwards (actor)|Rob Edwards]] as Adrian / \"Bert Worth\"\n* Fiona Gray as Susan\n* [[Nigel Havers]] as Mark Ingram\n* [[Peter Hughes (actor)|Peter Hughes]] as John / \"Mr. Worth\"\n* [[David Meyer]] as Henry Ingram\n* [[Frederick Treves (actor)|Frederick Treves]] as Lonsdale\n* David Roy Paul as Head waiter\n* Brian Peck as Jimmy\n* [[Philip Bond (actor)|Philip Bond]] as Inspector\n* Anthony Stafford as Arthur / \"Frank Worth\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n==DVD==\nAccording to the DVD cover, the series was released by Simply Media and the BBC in 2015.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II]]<!-- includes list of other works of World War II alternative histories, included in place of listing various works -->\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0077007|title=An Englishman's Castle}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Englishman's Castle, An}}\n[[Category:Alternate history television series]]\n[[Category:Television series about World War II alternate histories]]\n[[Category:1970s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1978 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1978 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:BBC television dramas]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1978 British television series}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2016}}\n{{one source|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = An Englishman's Castle\n| image                    = <!-- include ALT text per [[WP:ALT]] guideline -->\n| caption                  = \n| genre                    = [[Dramatic programming|Drama]]\n| writer                   = [[Philip Mackie]]\n| director                 = Paul Ciappessoni\n| starring                 = {{plainlist|\n*[[Kenneth More]]\n*[[Isla Blair]]\n*[[Anthony Bate]]\n*[[Kathleen Byron]]\n*[[Noel Dyson]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = United Kingdom\n| language                 = English\n| num_episodes             = 3\n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = \n| producer                 = [[Innes Lloyd]]\n| editor                   = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = \n| runtime                  = 50 minutes\n| company                  = [[BBC]]\n| distributor              = \n| channel                  = [[BBC Two]]\n| picture_format           = \n| audio_format             = \n| first_aired              = {{Start date|1978|6|5|df=yes}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|1978|6|19|df=yes}}\n}}\n'''''An Englishman's Castle''''' is a [[BBC]] television serial first broadcast in 1978, written by [[Philip Mackie]] and directed by Paul Ciappessoni.
