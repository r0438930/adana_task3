This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\n[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.\n\nThe [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process to make soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co \u2013 Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Buxton Lime Firms ===\n[[File:Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington 1964.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Limestone%20train%20from%20Tunstead%20to%20ICI%20Winnington%201964.jpg|thumb|'''Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington, 1964''']]\nThe arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBuxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891.
