It was a flagship of the [[London County Council]]'s new policy of building comprehensive schools that aimed to breakdown the previous national policy of selecting children, largely on 11-plus results, to attend grammar, technical or secondary modern schools.  It eventually grew to a role of around 1,400 boys.  Pastoral care was organised through six houses, each with seven mixed-year tutor groups.  For academic subjects, boys were divided into nine forms by general ability, with sets for Maths and English.\n\nThe first head teacher was Alexander E. Howard, who was a leading national figure in technical education.<ref>A.E.

There are usually eight forms per year, organised by house. In years 7 through to 11 the forms are sorted into houses which the students keep from year 7, the house colours are Blue, Green, Red and Yellow. In years 10 and 11 there are separate teaching groups from the forms in all subjects. The sixth form at the school does not use the house system.\n\n== Houses ==\nThe four houses of Forest Hill are named after famous people of the 16th, 17th, 18th and early 20th centuries, each designated a colour which determines the colour of the trim on the school blazers worn by the pupils. While the house only initially determines which form the student is in, it forms the basis of sport teams throughout each pupil's career at the school. As such, friendly rivalries exist between each house especially at the end of every school year when students from year seven, eight, nine and ten take part in a sports day at the National Athletics Stadium at the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]], barring 2017 due to the school having financial difficulties. The houses compete to win the most points to win the best sporting house award, and another award is given to the house who was the most supportive (noise, banners, house colours for shirts) that day.\n\nOriginally there were six houses, but two were later dropped: Browning and  Newton. When there were six houses Browning's house colour was red, Drake's dark blue, Reynold's light blue and Newton's maroon.\n\nPupils are recognised by the house they are in and by the code such as R9F (Reynolds, year 9, French) or S11G (Shackleton, Year 11, German).\n\nThe letters stand for:\n* F \u2013 these groups study [[French language|French]] only, as their modern foreign language.\n* G \u2013 these groups study [[German language|German]] only, as their modern foreign language.\n* Spanish is also a language taught at Forest Hill School but the tutor groups stay with the letters F or G in their tutor group name.\n\n[[File:Foresthillschool new.JPG|The new main building of Forest Hill School seen during redevelopment in September 2007|300px|right|thumb]]\n\n==Student leadership==\nAt the end of the Spring term, new Year 11 prefects are chosen, two from every form group. Leadership roles amongst the prefects include the Head, Deputy Heads and four House Captains for the student council. Other school prefects are divided between the roles of Duty Prefect and Form Prefect. The school also includes a [[Student council|school council]] which takes care of student issues and passes them on to the senior management and the headteacher. The school council works similar to the way that the form groups work, as two school councilors are chosen from each tutor group and in Year 9 a selected amount of them may become trainee prefects throughout year 10, this gives them a better chance to become prefects and house captains in Year 11.\n\n== Redevelopment ==\n=== Sports Hall ===\nIn 2006 the school's new \u00a34.5M state-of-the-art sports facility was opened with lottery funding and help with [[Sport England]] and [[The FA|The FA Charter Standard Schools Program]].<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/GrassrootsNew/CharterStandard/School/ TheFA.com \u2013 Charter Standard Schools<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The facility features a large air conditioned sports hall with basketball nets, indoor cricket, indoor football markings and goals and a scoreboard. The other part of the gym includes a fitness suite, caf\u00e8, space for trampolining and table tennis, new changing room facilities with showers and also two of the old three gyms. The sports centre opened on top of Gym 3, but was also expanded towards Bampton Road on the other side of the school.\n\n=== Main building ===\n[[File:Foresthillschool7 new.JPG|300px|right|thumb|The new school during redevelopment]]\nThe school began a major redevelopment project in July 2006 which completed in January 2008.<ref>http://www.foresthill.lewisham.sch.uk/new_build_gal.asp</ref> The only part of the school which remains unchanged is the current art block, which was built recently. The rest of the school was entirely demolished and rebuilt from the ground up with the three floor plan changed to a higher four story building. The new school building now features a huge atrium which doubles up into a fully functioning theatre, two fully equipped drama rooms, a separate theatre, a fully equipped music department with a [[Recording studio]] and a Mac computer room. There is also a fully functional dance studio complete with sprung floors, mirrors, and a 600 watt speaker system, all of which enable the school to carry out its performing arts specialism.\n\n== Notable people educated at Forest Hill School ==\n* [[Brian Jacks]], Olympic judo medalist and TV sports personality{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n* [[Andy Kane]] aka \"Handy Andy\", television DIY expert (''[[Changing Rooms]]'')\n* [[Richard Rufus]], footballer\n* Glen Murphy (Pulse) of [[Twist & Pulse]], street dancer\n* [[Dave Courtney]], former gangster and author\n* Charlie Elliott, Freddi Hyde-Thompson and Joe Simpson of [[The Metros]]\n* [[King Krule]], award-winning musician\n* [[Marlon King]], played Premier League football for [[Watford FC|Watford]], [[Wigan Athletic]], [[Hull City]]\n*[[Joe Gomez (footballer)|Joe Gomez]], plays Premier League football for [[Liverpool F.C.]] and [[Charlton Athletic]]\n* [[Eman Kellam]], YouTube and television personality\n* [[Sean Scully]], contemporary artist, based in New York\n* [[Joe Absolom]], actor \n* [[Valentine Nonyela]], actor and producer \n* [[Kasey Palmer]], footballer for Bristol City\n* [[Manny Month\u00e9]], footballer for Tranmere Rovers\n* [[James Ellington]], Olympic athlete\n* [[Kim-Jong-Un]], Supreme Leader of North Korea\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.foresthill.lewisham.sch.uk/ Forest Hill School]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131206/http://www.hillsyde.org.uk/home/ Hillsyde Sixth Form]\n* [http://www.lewisham.gov.uk/EducationAndLearning/SecondarySchools/SecondarySchoolLocationsContacts/ForestHillSecondarySchool.htm Lewisham information]\n* [http://www.lewisham-clc.org.uk/?_id=2 Lewisham City Learning Centre]\n\n{{Schools and colleges in Lewisham}}\n\n[[Category:Boys' schools in London]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in the London Borough of Lewisham]]\n[[Category:Community schools in the London Borough of Lewisham]]\n[[Category:Comprehensive schools in London]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1956]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name = Forest Hill School\n| image = Title grade.png\n| caption = The 'three schools' logo\n| established = 1956\n| type = Secondary Comprehensive\n| head = Mike Sullivan\n| city = [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]]\n| county = [[London Borough of Lewisham]]\n| country = [[England]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|51.4318|-0.0477|type:edu_region:GB_dim:100|format=dec|display=inline,title}}\n| enrolment = 1360\n| local_authority = [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]]\n| ofsted = yes\n| urn = 100745\n| gender = Boys (Girls in Sixth Form)\n| houses = Drake (Red)<br>Harvey (Yellow)<br>Reynolds (Light Blue)<br>Shackleton (Green)\n| lower_age = 11\n| upper_age = 18\n| publication = Our Voice\n| website = {{url|http://foresthillschool.co.uk/}}\n| module = {{OSM Location map\n | float = centre\n | width = 250\n | coord = {{coord|51.4318|-0.0477}} <!-- Centred -->\n | mark-coord = {{coord|51.4318|-0.0477}} | label = Forest Hill School| label-pos = bottom\n | zoom = 12}} <!-- marking the school-->\n}}\n\n'''Forest Hill School''' is a boy's secondary comprehensive school located in [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]], in the [[London Borough of Lewisham]].

There is also a fully functional dance studio complete with sprung floors, mirrors, and a 600 watt speaker system, all of which enable the school to carry out its performing arts specialism.\n\n== Notable people educated at Forest Hill School ==\n* [[Brian Jacks]], Olympic judo medalist and TV sports personality{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n* [[Andy Kane]] aka \"Handy Andy\", television DIY expert (''[[Changing Rooms]]'')\n* [[Richard Rufus]], footballer\n* Glen Murphy (Pulse) of [[Twist & Pulse]], street dancer\n* [[Dave Courtney]], former gangster and author\n* Charlie Elliott, Freddi Hyde-Thompson and Joe Simpson of [[The Metros]]\n* [[King Krule]], award-winning musician\n* [[Marlon King]], played Premier League football for [[Watford FC|Watford]], [[Wigan Athletic]], [[Hull City]]\n*[[Joe Gomez (footballer)|Joe Gomez]], plays Premier League football for [[Liverpool F.C.]] and [[Charlton Athletic]]\n* [[Eman Kellam]], YouTube and television personality\n* [[Sean Scully]], contemporary artist, based in New York\n* [[Joe Absolom]], actor \n* [[Valentine Nonyela]], actor and producer \n* [[Kasey Palmer]], footballer for Bristol City\n* [[Manny Month\u00e9]], footballer for Tranmere Rovers\n* [[James Ellington]], Olympic athlete\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.foresthill.lewisham.sch.uk/ Forest Hill School]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131206/http://www.hillsyde.org.uk/home/ Hillsyde Sixth Form]\n* [http://www.lewisham.gov.uk/EducationAndLearning/SecondarySchools/SecondarySchoolLocationsContacts/ForestHillSecondarySchool.htm Lewisham information]\n* [http://www.lewisham-clc.org.uk/?_id=2 Lewisham City Learning Centre]\n\n{{Schools and colleges in Lewisham}}\n\n[[Category:Boys' schools in London]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in the London Borough of Lewisham]]\n[[Category:Community schools in the London Borough of Lewisham]]\n[[Category:Comprehensive schools in London]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1956]]\n", "name_user": "Soldier151", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Hill_School"}
