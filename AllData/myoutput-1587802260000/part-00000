Marathi is one of several languages that further descend from [[Maharashtri Prakrit]]. Further change led to the [[Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba]] languages like Old Marathi, however, this is challenged by Bloch (1970), who states that [[Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba]] was formed after Marathi had already separated from the Middle Indian dialect.{{sfn|Bloch|1970|p=32}}\n\nThe earliest example of Maharashtri as a separate language dates to approximately 3rd century BCE: a stone inscription found in a cave at [[Naneghat]], [[Junnar]] in [[Pune district]] had been written in Maharashtri using [[Brahmi script]]. A committee appointed by the Maharashtra State Government to get the [[Languages of India#Classical languages|Classical]] status for Marathi has claimed that Marathi existed at least 2300 years ago alongside [[Sanskrit]] as a [[sister language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/clamour-grows-for-marathi-to-be-given-classical-language-status/articleshow/63776578.cms|title=Clamour grows for Marathi to be given classical language status|author=Clara Lewis|website=[[The Times of India]]|date=16 April 2018|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref> Marathi, a derivative of Maharashtri, is probably first attested in a 739 CE [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper-plate inscription]] found in [[Satara district|Satara]]. Several inscriptions dated to the second half of the 11th century feature Marathi, which is usually appended to [[Sanskrit]] or [[Kannada language|Kannada]] in these inscriptions.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}} The earliest Marathi-only inscriptions are the ones issued during the [[Shilahara]] rule, including a c. 1012 CE stone inscription from Akshi taluka of [[Raigad district]], and a 1060 or 1086 CE copper-plate inscription from Dive that records a land grant (''[[agrahara]]'') to a Brahmin.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|pp=53-54}} A 2-line 1118 CE Marathi inscription at [[Shravanabelagola]] records a grant by the [[Hoysala]]s. These inscriptions suggest that Marathi was a standard written language by the 12th century. However, there is no record of any literature produced in Marathi until the late 13th century.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=54}}\n\n===Yadava period ===\n\nAfter 1187 CE, the use of Marathi grew substantially in the inscriptions of the [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Seuna (Yadava)]] kings, who earlier used Kannada and Sanskrit in their inscriptions.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|pp=53-54}} Marathi became the dominant language of epigraphy during the last half century of the dynasty's rule (14th century), and may have been a result of the Yadava attempts to connect with their Marathi-speaking subjects and to distinguish themselves from the Kannada-speaking [[Hoysala]]s.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}}<ref name=\"Talbot2001\">{{cite book|author=Cynthia Talbot|title=Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C&pg=PR9|date=20 September 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803123-9|pages=211\u2013213}}</ref>\n\nFurther growth and usage of the language was because of two religious sects \u2013 the [[Mahanubhava]] and [[Varkari]] ''[[panthan]]''s \u2013 who adopted Marathi as the medium for preaching their doctrines of devotion. Marathi was used in court life by the time of the Seuna kings. During the reign of the last three Seuna kings, a great deal of literature in verse and prose, on astrology, medicine, [[Puranas]], [[Vedanta]], kings and courtiers were created. ''Nalopakhyan'', ''Rukmini swayamvar'' and Shripati's ''Jyotishratnamala'' (1039) are a few examples.\n\nThe oldest book in prose form in Marathi, ''Viv\u0113kasindhu'' ({{lang|mr|\u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0927\u0941}}), was written by Mukundaraja, a [[Nath]] yogi and arch-poet of Marathi. Mukundaraja bases his exposition of the basic tenets of the [[Hindu philosophy]] and the yoga marga on the utterances or teachings of [[Shankaracharya]]. Mukundaraja's other work, ''Paramamrta,'' is considered the first systematic attempt to explain the Vedanta in the Marathi language\n\nNotable examples of Marathi prose are \"{{IAST|L\u012b\u1e37\u0101car\u012btra}}\" ({{lang|mr|\u0932\u0940\u0933\u093e\u091a\u0930\u0940\u0924\u094d\u0930}}), events and anecdotes from the miracle-filled the life of [[Chakradhar Swami]] of the Mahanubhava sect compiled by his close disciple, Mahimbhatta, in 1238. The ''[[Leela Charitra|L\u012b\u1e37\u0101car\u012btra]]'' is thought to be the first biography written in the Marathi language. Mahimbhatta's second important literary work is the ''Shri Govindaprabhucharitra'' or ''Rudhipurcharitra'', a biography of Shri Chakradhar Swami's guru, Shri Govind Prabhu. This was probably written in 1288. The Mahanubhava sect made Marathi a vehicle for the propagation of religion and culture. Mahanubhava literature generally comprises works that describe the incarnations of gods, the history of the sect, commentaries on the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', poetical works narrating the stories of the life of [[Krishna]] and grammatical and etymological works that are deemed useful to explain the philosophy of sect.\n\n===Medieval and Deccan Sultanate period===\nThe 13th-century varkari saint [[Dnyaneshwar]] (1275\u20131296) wrote a treatise in Marathi on Bhagawat Gita popularly called ''[[Dnyaneshwari]]'' and ''[[Amrutanubhav|Amritanubhava]]''.\n\nMukund Raj was a poet who lived in the 13th century and is said to be the first poet who composed in Marathi.{{sfn|Kher|1895|pp=446\u2013454}} He is known for the ''Viveka-Siddhi'' and ''Parammrita'' which are metaphysical, pantheistic works connected with orthodox [[Advaita Vedanta|Vedantism]].\n\nThe 16th century saint-poet [[Eknath]] (1528\u20131599) is well known for composing the Ekn\u0101th\u012b Bh\u0101gavat, a commentary on Bhagavat Purana and the devotional songs called Bharud.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keune|first1=Jon Milton|title=Ekn\u0101th Remembered and Reformed: Bhakti, Brahmans, and Untouchables in Marathi Historiography|date=2011|publisher=Columbia University press|location=New York, NY, USA|page=32|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:11409|accessdate=9 March 2016}}</ref> Mukteshwar translated the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into Marathi; [[Tukaram]] (1608\u201349) transformed Marathi into a rich literary language.

Subsequent Maratha rulers extended the empire northwards to [[Attock]], eastwards to [[Odisha]], and southwards to [[Thanjavur]] in [[Tamil Nadu]]. These excursions by the Marathas helped to spread Marathi over broader geographical regions. This period also saw the use of Marathi in transactions involving land and other business. Documents from this period, therefore, give a better picture of the life of common people. There are a lot of Bakharis written in Marathi and Modi script from this period. But by the late 18th century, the Maratha Empire's influence over a large part of the country was on the decline.\n\nIn the 18th century during Peshwa rule, some well-known works such as Yatharthadeepika by [[Vaman Pandit]], Naladamayanti Swayamvara by [[Raghunath Pandit]], Pandava Pratap, Harivijay, Ramvijay by Shridhar Pandit and Mahabharata by [[Moropant]] were produced. Krishnadayarnava and Sridhar were poets during the [[Peshwa]] period.

The new grammar stuck, which led to the unique flexibility of vowels lengths \u2013 amongst other anomalies \u2013 in Marathi. Marathi retains the original Sanskrit pronunciation of certain letters such as the ''[[anusv\u0101ra]]'' (for instance, ''sa\u1e43har,'' compared to ''sanhar'' in Hindi). Moreover, Marathi preserves certain Sanskrit patterns of pronunciation, as in the words ''pur\u1e47a'' and ''r\u0101ma'' compared to ''pur\u1e47'' and ''r\u0101m'' in Hindi.\n\n== Writing ==\n[[File:Dnyaneshwari_Verse_In_Modi_Script.png|thumb|[[Modi script]] was used to write Marathi]]\n{{Main|Devanagari|Balbodh|Modi script}}\n[[File:The word 'Marathi' written in \"Modi' script as a part of India Post's My Stamp scheme..png|thumb|An effort to conserve the \"Modi Script\" under [[India Posts|India Post]]'s My Stamp scheme.

For example, the word '\u0930\u0902\u0917' (colour) is pronounced as 'ranga' in Marathi & 'rang' in other languages using Devanagari despite same spelling, '\u0916\u0930\u0902' (true) despite the [[anuswara]] is pronounced as 'Khara' as the Anusara in this case is used to avoid [[Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages|schwa deletion]] in pronunciation since most other languages using Devanagari show schwa deletion in pronunciation despite the presence of schwa in the written spelling. From the 13th century until the beginning of British rule in 19th century, Marathi was written in the [[Modi script]] for administrative purposes but in Devnagari for literature. Since 1950 it has been written in the Balbodh style of Devanagari. Except for Father Stephen's [[Krista Purana]] in the [[Latin script]] in the 1600s, Marathi has mainly been printed in Devanagari because [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]], the pioneer of printing in Indian languages, was only able to print in Devanagari.

Other words (\"[[tadbhava]]s\") have undergone [[phonological change]]s from their Sanskrit roots, for example ''d\u0101r'' (''dw\u0101ra'' or door), ''ghar'' (''g\u1e5bha'' or house), ''v\u0101gh'' (''vy\u0101ghra'' or tiger), ''pa\u1e37a\u1e47e'' (''pal\u0101yate'' or to run away), ''kiti'' (''kati'' or how many) have undergone more modification.\nExamples of words borrowed from other Indian and foreign languages include:\n* ''A\u1e0dakitt\u0101'' \"nutcracker\" directly borrowed from [[Kannada language|Kannada]]\n* ''Akka'' \"sister\" borrowed from [[Tamil language|Tamil]]\n* ''Haj\u0113r\u012b'' Attendance from ''Haziri'' Urdu\n* ''J\u0101hir\u0101ta'' \"advertisement\" is derived from Arabic ''zaahiraat''\n* ''Marj\u012b'' \"wish\" is derived from Persian \"marzi\"\n* ''Shiph\u0101rasa'' \"recommendation\" is derived from Persian sefaresh\n\nA lot of English words are commonly used in conversation and are considered to be assimilated into the Marathi vocabulary. These include \"pen\" (native Marathi ''lekha\u1e47ii'') and \"shirt\" (''sadaraa'').\n\n===Compounds===\nMarathi uses many [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] processes to join words together, forming [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]]. For example, ''ati'' + ''uttam'' gives the word ''atyuttam'', ''miith-bhaakar'' (\"salt-bread\"), ''udyog-patii'' (\"businessman\"), ''ash\u1e6da-bhujaa'' (\"eight-hands\", name of a Hindu goddess).\n\n=== Counting ===\nLike many other languages, Marathi uses distinct names for the numbers 1 to 20 and each multiple of 10, and composite ones for those greater than 20.\n\nAs with other Indic languages, there are distinct names for the fractions {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|2}}, and {{frac|3|4}}. They are ''paava'', ''ardhaa'', and ''pau\u1e47a'', respectively. For most fractions greater than 1, the prefixes ''savvaa-'', ''saa\u1e0de-'', ''paava\u1e47e-'' are used. There are special names for {{frac|3|2}} (''dii\u1e0d''), {{frac|5|2}} (''a\u1e0dich''), and {{frac|7|2}} (''aut'').\n\nPowers of ten are denoted by separate specific words as depicted in below table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, 1,234,567 is written as 12,34,567 and read as ''12 lakh 34 Hazara 5 she 67''.\n\nEvery two-digit number after 18 (11 to 18 are predefined) is read backward. For example, 21 is read \u090f\u0915-\u0935\u0940\u0938 (1-twenty). Also, a two digit number that ends with a 9 is considered to be the next tens place minus one. For example, 29 is \u090f\u0915\u0941\u0923\u0924\u0940\u0938/\u090f\u0915\u094b\u0923\u0924\u0940\u0938 (\u090f\u0915-\u0909\u0923\u0947-\u0924\u0940\u0938) (thirty minus one).

Marathi is one of several languages that further descend from [[Maharashtri Prakrit]]. Further change led to the [[Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba]] languages like Old Marathi, however, this is challenged by Bloch (1970), who states that [[Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba]] was formed after Marathi had already separated from the Middle Indian dialect.{{sfn|Bloch|1970|p=32}}\n\nThe earliest example of Maharashtri as a separate language dates to approximately 3rd century BCE: a stone inscription found in a cave at [[Naneghat]], [[Junnar]] in [[Pune district]] had been written in Maharashtri using [[Brahmi script]]. A committee appointed by the Maharashtra State Government to get the [[Languages of India#Classical languages|Classical]] status for Marathi has claimed that Marathi existed at least 2300 years ago alongside [[Sanskrit]] as a [[sister language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/clamour-grows-for-marathi-to-be-given-classical-language-status/articleshow/63776578.cms|title=Clamour grows for Marathi to be given classical language status|author=Clara Lewis|website=[[The Times of India]]|date=16 April 2018|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref> Marathi, a derivative of Maharashtri, is probably first attested in a 739 CE [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper-plate inscription]] found in [[Satara district|Satara]]. Several inscriptions dated to the second half of the 11th century feature Marathi, which is usually appended to [[Sanskrit]] or [[Kannada language|Kannada]] in these inscriptions.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}} The earliest Marathi-only inscriptions are the ones issued during the [[Shilahara]] rule, including a c. 1012 CE stone inscription from Akshi taluka of [[Raigad district]], and a 1060 or 1086 CE copper-plate inscription from Dive that records a land grant (''[[agrahara]]'') to a Brahmin.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|pp=53-54}} A 2-line 1118 CE Marathi inscription at [[Shravanabelagola]] records a grant by the [[Hoysala]]s. These inscriptions suggest that Marathi was a standard written language by the 12th century. However, there is no record of any literature produced in Marathi until the late 13th century.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=54}}\n\n===Yadava period ===\n\nAfter 1187 CE, the use of Marathi grew substantially in the inscriptions of the [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Seuna (Yadava)]] kings, who earlier used Kannada and Sanskrit in their inscriptions.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|pp=53-54}} Marathi became the dominant language of epigraphy during the last half century of the dynasty's rule (14th century), and may have been a result of the Yadava attempts to connect with their Marathi-speaking subjects and to distinguish themselves from the Kannada-speaking [[Hoysala]]s.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}}<ref name=\"Talbot2001\">{{cite book|author=Cynthia Talbot|title=Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C&pg=PR9|date=20 September 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803123-9|pages=211\u2013213}}</ref>\n\nFurther growth and usage of the language was because of two religious sects \u2013 the [[Mahanubhava]] and [[Varkari]] ''[[panthan]]''s \u2013 who adopted Marathi as the medium for preaching their doctrines of devotion. Marathi was used in court life by the time of the Seuna kings. During the reign of the last three Seuna kings, a great deal of literature in verse and prose, on astrology, medicine, [[Puranas]], [[Vedanta]], kings and courtiers were created. ''Nalopakhyan'', ''Rukmini swayamvar'' and Shripati's ''Jyotishratnamala'' (1039) are a few examples.\n\nThe oldest book in prose form in Marathi, ''Viv\u0113kasindhu'' ({{lang|mr|\u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0927\u0941}}), was written by Mukundaraja, a [[Nath]] yogi and arch-poet of Marathi. Mukundaraja bases his exposition of the basic tenets of the [[Hindu philosophy]] and the yoga marga on the utterances or teachings of [[Shankaracharya]]. Mukundaraja's other work, ''Paramamrta,'' is considered the first systematic attempt to explain the Vedanta in the Marathi language\n\nNotable examples of Marathi prose are \"{{IAST|L\u012b\u1e37\u0101car\u012btra}}\" ({{lang|mr|\u0932\u0940\u0933\u093e\u091a\u0930\u0940\u0924\u094d\u0930}}), events and anecdotes from the miracle-filled the life of [[Chakradhar Swami]] of the Mahanubhava sect compiled by his close disciple, Mahimbhatta, in 1238. The ''[[Leela Charitra|L\u012b\u1e37\u0101car\u012btra]]'' is thought to be the first biography written in the Marathi language. Mahimbhatta's second important literary work is the ''Shri Govindaprabhucharitra'' or ''Rudhipurcharitra'', a biography of Shri Chakradhar Swami's guru, Shri Govind Prabhu. This was probably written in 1288. The Mahanubhava sect made Marathi a vehicle for the propagation of religion and culture.

Subsequent Maratha rulers extended the empire northwards to [[Attock]], eastwards to [[Odisha]], and southwards to [[Thanjavur]] in [[Tamil Nadu]]. These excursions by the Marathas helped to spread Marathi over broader geographical regions. This period also saw the use of Marathi in transactions involving land and other business. Documents from this period, therefore, give a better picture of the life of common people. There are a lot of Bakharis written in Marathi and Modi script from this period. But by the late 18th century, the Maratha Empire's influence over a large part of the country was on the decline.\n\nIn the 18th century during Peshwa rule, some well-known works such as Yatharthadeepika by [[Vaman Pandit]], Naladamayanti Swayamvara by [[Raghunath Pandit]], Pandava Pratap, Harivijay, Ramvijay by Shridhar Pandit and Mahabharata by [[Moropant]] were produced. Krishnadayarnava and Sridhar were poets during the [[Peshwa]] period. New literary forms were successfully experimented with during the period and classical styles were revived, especially the Mahakavya and Prabandha forms.

The new grammar stuck, which led to the unique flexibility of vowels lengths \u2013 amongst other anomalies \u2013 in Marathi. Marathi retains the original Sanskrit pronunciation of certain letters such as the ''[[anusv\u0101ra]]'' (for instance, ''sa\u1e43har,'' compared to ''sanhar'' in Hindi).

From the 13th century until the beginning of British rule in 19th century, Marathi was written in the [[Modi script]] for administrative purposes but in Devnagari for literature. Since 1950 it has been written in the Balbodh style of Devanagari. Except for Father Stephen's [[Krista Purana]] in the [[Latin script]] in the 1600s, Marathi has mainly been printed in Devanagari because [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]], the pioneer of printing in Indian languages, was only able to print in Devanagari.

Other words (\"[[tadbhava]]s\") have undergone [[phonological change]]s from their Sanskrit roots, for example ''d\u0101r'' (''dw\u0101ra'' or door), ''ghar'' (''g\u1e5bha'' or house), ''v\u0101gh'' (''vy\u0101ghra'' or tiger), ''pa\u1e37a\u1e47e'' (''pal\u0101yate'' or to run away), ''kiti'' (''kati'' or how many) have undergone more modification.\nExamples of words borrowed from other Indian and foreign languages include:\n* ''A\u1e0dakitt\u0101'' \"nutcracker\" directly borrowed from [[Kannada language|Kannada]]\n* ''Akka'' \"sister\" borrowed from [[Tamil language|Tamil]]\n* ''Haj\u0113r\u012b'' Attendance from ''Haziri'' Urdu\n* ''J\u0101hir\u0101ta'' \"advertisement\" is derived from Arabic ''zaahiraat''\n* ''Marj\u012b'' \"wish\" is derived from Persian \"marzi\"\n* ''Shiph\u0101rasa'' \"recommendation\" is derived from Persian sefaresh\n\nA lot of English words are commonly used in conversation and are considered to be assimilated into the Marathi vocabulary. These include \"pen\" (native Marathi ''lekha\u1e47ii'') and \"shirt\" (''sadaraa'').\n\n===Compounds===\nMarathi uses many [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] processes to join words together, forming [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]]. For example, ''ati'' + ''uttam'' gives the word ''atyuttam'', ''miith-bhaakar'' (\"salt-bread\"), ''udyog-patii'' (\"businessman\"), ''ash\u1e6da-bhujaa'' (\"eight-hands\", name of a Hindu goddess).\n\n=== Counting ===\nLike many other languages, Marathi uses distinct names for the numbers 1 to 20 and each multiple of 10, and composite ones for those greater than 20.\n\nAs with other Indic languages, there are distinct names for the fractions {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|2}}, and {{frac|3|4}}. They are ''paava'', ''ardhaa'', and ''pau\u1e47a'', respectively. For most fractions greater than 1, the prefixes ''savvaa-'', ''saa\u1e0de-'', ''paava\u1e47e-'' are used.

For example, 1,234,567 is written as 12,34,567 and read as ''12 lakh 34 Hazara 5 she 67''.\n\nEvery two-digit number after 18 (11 to 18 are predefined) is read backward. For example, 21 is read \u090f\u0915-\u0935\u0940\u0938 (1-twenty). Also, a two digit number that ends with a 9 is considered to be the next tens place minus one. For example, 29 is \u090f\u0915\u0941\u0923\u0924\u0940\u0938/\u090f\u0915\u094b\u0923\u0924\u0940\u0938 (\u090f\u0915-\u0909\u0923\u0947-\u0924\u0940\u0938) (thirty minus one). Two digit numbers used before ''Hazara'', etc. are written in the same way.\n\n==Marathi on computers and the Internet==\nShrilipee, Shivaji, kothare 2,4,6, [[Kiran fonts]] KF-Kiran<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiranfont.com/ |title=Welcome to www.kiranfont.com |publisher=Kiranfont.com |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031154146/http://www.kiranfont.com/ |archivedate=31 October 2014 }}</ref> and many more (about 48) are [[clip font]]s that were used prior to the introduction of [[Unicode]] standard for [[Devanagari script]]. Clip fonts are in vogue on PCs even today since most of the computers in use are working with English Keyboard. Even today a large number of printed publications of books, newspapers and magazines are prepared using these ASCII based fonts. However, clip fonts cannot be used on [[internet]] since those did not have [[unicode]] compatibility.\n\nEarlier Marathi suffered from weak support by computer operating systems and [[Internet]] services, as have other Indian languages. But recently, with the introduction of language localization projects and new technologies, various software and Internet applications have been introduced. Various Marathi typing software is widely used and display interface packages are now available on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. Many Marathi websites, including Marathi newspapers, have become popular especially with Maharashtrians outside India. Online projects such as the [[Marathi Wikipedia|Marathi language Wikipedia]], with 36,000+ articles, the Marathi blogroll, and Marathi blogs have gained immense popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20070219/technology01.shtml |title=Inside the Indian Blogosphere |accessdate=10 October 2008 |last=Askari |first=Faiz |publisher=Express Computer |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004182304/http://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20070219/technology01.shtml |archivedate=4 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Marathi Language Day==\n\nMarathi Language Day (\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0928/\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938 ({{translation|Marathi Dina/Marathi Diwasa}}) is celebrated on 27 February every year across the Indian states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]].
