It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nArticle 2 of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], used the [[Great Lakes]] as a border between British territory and that of the United States.  Numerous Native American peoples inhabited this region, known to the United States as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In April 1786, a militia from [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] [[Battle of the Embarras River|attacked a village]] on the [[Embarras River (Illinois)|Embarras River]], forcing [[Piankeshaw]] to move farther away and consolidate near the [[Vermilion River (Wabash River)|Vermilion River]].  Over 400 Piankeshaw and [[Wea]] returned with a war party in July, but were persuaded not to attack Vincennes. That Autumn, Generals George Rogers Clark and [[Benjamin Logan]] led a two-pronged force of Kentucky militia in punitive raids against Native American villages to the north of the Ohio River.{{r|sword|pp=35\u201336}}  Clark's force, considered the primary expedition, set off in September and marched north along the Wabash River to Illinois country. He was hindered by logistical problems caused by low water on the river, and when he reached the mouth of the Vermilion River in October, he was beset by mutiny and mass desertion.  Clark returned with the remains of his force to Vincennes, his reputation in ruins.{{r|sword|p=37}}\n\nGeneral Logan, meanwhile, recruited and trained for his secondary force of Federal soldiers and mounted Kentucky [[Militia (United States)|militia]] against several Shawnee towns along the [[Mad River (Ohio)|Mad River]].  The Shawnee nation was divided in their response to the United States settlers, but the Kentucky settlers made no distinction between hostile and friendly villages.{{r|sword|p=36}}  The Shawnee villages along the Mad River were defended primarily by noncombatants while the warriors were hunting or raiding forts in Kentucky.  Logan burned the native towns and food supplies, and killed or captured numerous natives.  Against Logan's orders, Captain [[Hugh McGary]] murdered an elderly Shawnee chief named [[Moluntha]], who was considered friendly towards the United States and who had even hoisted a striped flag to welcome Logan's men.{{r|sword|pp=38\u201339}}  Logan continued to 7 other villages, killing, torturing, or capturing dozens of villagers, including women and children. The militia also plundered their goods and burned their crops before returning to Kentucky.{{r|sword|p=40-41}}  Logan's raid devastated the Shawnee nation, who's survivors struggled that winter due to the destroyed harvests, but it also united the Shawnee against the United States.  Reports of Logan's raid alarmed the confederate council in Detroit that November, and Shawnee raids into Kentucky were reported by December 1786.{{r|sword|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nNative American raids on both sides of the Ohio River resulted in increasing casualties.  During the mid- and late-1780s, American settlers south of the Ohio River in Kentucky and travelers on and north of the Ohio River suffered approximately 1,500 casualties.  Settlers retaliated with attacks on Indians.  In 1789, the new [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] argued that Congress had provoked Native Americans by claiming possession of their territories.<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Harless |title=Native American Policy |url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/native-american-policy/ |website=George Washington's Mount Vernon |accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Harmar Campaign===\n{{Main|Harmar campaign}}\nIn 1790, the new [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]] and Secretary of War Henry Knox ordered General [[Josiah Harmar]] to launch the [[Harmar campaign]], a major western offensive into the Shawnee and Miami country.

Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied St. Clair's request to build a fort there.  St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that \"we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.\"{{r|Poinsatte|p=21-3}}  Western native leaders, meanwhile, met at Kekionga to determine a response to the Treaty of Fort Harmar. \n\nGeneral Harmar's forces of about 1,453 militia and regulars departed [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]] on 7 October 1790.  From 19\u201321 October 1790, General Harmar lost 3 successive skirmishes near [[Kekionga]] (present-day [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]).  On 19 October, a scouting party of about 400 mixed forces under the command of Colonel [[John Hardin]] was lured into an ambush near the village of [[Le Gris]], losing 129 soldiers in one of two defeats that has been called [[Hardin's Defeat]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Harmar's Defeat |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=505 |accessdate=20 Jan 2009}}</ref>{{sfnp|Drake|1901|p=173-5}}  The following day, another scouting party under Ensign Phillip Hartshorn was ambushed, but Harmar did not move to assist them or recover their remains.  Finally, on 21 October 1790, a mixed party of militia and regulars under Colonel Hardin established attack positions on Kekionga and awaited reinforcements from General Harmar, which never came.  Instead, forces under Little Turtle overwhelmed Hardin and compelled the U.S. forces to retreat in the second battle known as Harmar's Defeat.  With 3 consecutive losses, more than 300 casualties, and low morale, Harmar retreated to Fort Washington.  Following Harmar's defeat, Knox changed his mind, instructing St. Clair to fortify Kekionga the following year.{{r|Poinsatte|p=21-3}}\n\nBecause they were both present when Harmar's army arrived, this was the first full military operation shared between Miami leader Little Turtle and Shawnee leader [[Blue Jacket]].{{r|Hogeland|pp=113\u2013115}}  It was largest the Native American victory over US forces [[St. Clair's defeat|until the following year]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Allison, Harold |title=The Tragic Saga of the Indiana Indians |year=1986 |page=76 |publisher=Turner Publishing Company, Paducah |isbn=0-938021-07-9}}</ref> and emboldened Native Nations within the Northwest Territory.

At dawn on 4 November 1791, St. Clair's force was camped (near modern [[Fort Recovery, Ohio]]) with weak defenses set up on the perimeter.  A Native American force of about 2,000 warriors, led by [[Little Turtle]] and [[Blue Jacket]], struck quickly. Surprising the Americans, they soon overran the poorly prepared perimeter.

[[Buckongahelas]], Blue Jacket, and Little Turtle had received word from [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester]] that Great Britain could be at war with the United States within the year, and felt no need to discuss terms of peace.{{r|nelson|pp=253\u2013254}}  Lord Dorchester had made those remarks in February 1794 while meeting with Iroquois representatives.{{r|sword|p=258}}  Word spread, causing an uproar in the United States and encouraging the confederacy.  Dorchester warned the United States that \"taking possession of any part of the Indian Territory\" would be a \"direct violation of His Britannic Majesty's rights.\"{{r|sword|p=264}}  That April, the British constructed [[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miami]] and garrisoned it with 120 soldiers with the 24th Regiment and a detachment of artillery with 8 cannon, as a defense against anticipated attacks from the United States.{{r|sword|pp=261-2}}  The United States viewed the construction of Fort Miami as a blatant act of aggression, and Wayne fumed that his Legion was not quite prepared to attack.{{r|sword|p=262}}\n\nBy June 1794, Fort Recovery had been reinforced, and the Legion had recovered four copper cannons (two six-pound and two three-pound), two copper howitzers, and one iron [[carronade]].{{r|Gaff|p=234}}  That same month, an American Indian force of over 1,200 warriors under the nominal command of Blue Jacket, [[Egushawa]], and the Odawa [[Bear Chief]],{{r|Gaff|p=241}} and British officers [[Siege of Fort Recovery|arrived at Fort Recovery]] with powder and shot, intent on recovering the same cannons.

Little Turtle, wary of Wayne and disappointed with the British, argued that they should negotiate peace with Wayne.  Blue Jacket mocked Little Turtle as a traitor and convinced the others that Wayne would be defeated, just as Harmar and St. Clair had been.  Little Turtle then relinquished leadership to Blue Jacket, stating that he would only be a follower.{{r|Hogeland|pp=337, 369}}  Three days later, on 16 August, a messenger returned with a response asking Wayne to pause at his currently location, stating \"You have only to write & your Business is done, but we Indians must do all our Business with every nation of the Confederacy which takes up a great deal of time.\"{{r|Gaff|pp=292\u2013293}}  Native American advisors told Wayne that many of the Confederation were ready to accept Wayne's offer of peace, but that Little Turtle had sent this response as a delay tactic needed to gather additional forces.{{r|Gaff|pp=292\u2013293}}  Wayne departed Fort Recovery the next day.

The Legion's cavalry secured the right along the Maumee River.  General Scott provided a brigade of mounted militia to guard the open left flank, while the rest of the Kentucky militia formed a reserve.<ref name=NMUSA />  Once contact had been established, U.S. scouts identified the location of Confederacy warriors, and Wayne ordered an immediate bayonet charge.  Legion dragoons also charged and attacked with sabres.  Blue Jacket's warriors fled from the battlefield to regroup nearby [[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miami]], but found themselves locked out of the fort by the British occupants.

The entire battle lasted little more than an hour.{{r|sword|p=306}}  The Legion had significant casualties, with 33 men killed and 100 wounded.  The Confederacy had between 19 and 40 warriors killed, and an unknown number wounded.{{r|Gaff|p=327}}  The battle fostered distrust between the native nations, and between the confederacy and the British; it was the last time the Western Confederacy gathered a large military force to oppose the United States.\n\nWayne's army encamped for three days in sight of Fort Miamis, under command of Major [[William Campbell (British Army officer and Governor)|William Campbell]].  When Major Campbell asked the meaning of the encampment, Wayne replied that the answer had already been given by the sound of their muskets and the retreat of the Indians.{{r|Hogeland|p=350}}  The next day, Wayne rode alone to Fort Miamis and slowly conducted an inspection of the fort's exterior walls.  The British garrison debated whether or not to engage the General, but in the absence of orders and being already at war with France, Major Campbell declined to fire the first shot at the United States.{{r|Hogeland|pp=350\u2013351}}  The Legion, meanwhile, destroyed Indian villages and crops in the region of Fort Deposit, and burned Alexander McKee's trading post within sight of Fort Miamis before withdrawing.{{r|Hogeland|p=351}}\n\nWayne's Legion finally arrived at [[Kekionga]] on 17 September 1794, and Wayne personally selected the site for a new U.S. fort.<ref name=\"Poinsatte\" />{{rp|27\u201328}} Wayne wanted a strong fort built, capable of withstanding not only an Indian uprising, but a possible attack by the British from Fort Detroit.

It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nArticle 2 of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], used the [[Great Lakes]] as a border between British territory and that of the United States.  Numerous Native American peoples inhabited this region, known to the United States as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In a particularly brutal act, Koonay, the sister of Tachnechdorus, was strung up by the wrists while her unborn baby was impaled.

At this, Brant determined to boycott negotiations with the United States, and suggested others do the same.  About 200 moderate American Indians came to Fort Harmar in December, and agreed to concessions in the 1789 [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], which moved the border and named the United States as sovereign over native lands.{{r|Hogeland|pp=112\u2013113}}  To those who had refused to attend or sign, the treaty re-enforced the United States' appetite for native lands in the region without addressing the concerns of the native nations.\n\nThe confederacy was a loose association of primarily Algonquin-speaking tribes in the Great Lakes area. The Wyandot (Huron) were the nominal \"fathers,\" or senior guaranteeing tribe of the confederacy, but the [[Shawnee]] and [[Miami people|Miami]] provided the greatest share of the fighting forces.

In April 1786, a militia from [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] [[Battle of the Embarras River|attacked a village]] on the [[Embarras River (Illinois)|Embarras River]], forcing [[Piankeshaw]] to move farther away and consolidate near the [[Vermilion River (Wabash River)|Vermilion River]].  Over 400 Piankeshaw and [[Wea]] returned with a war party in July, but were persuaded not to attack Vincennes. That Autumn, Generals George Rogers Clark and [[Benjamin Logan]] led a two-pronged force of Kentucky militia in punitive raids against Native American villages to the north of the Ohio River.{{r|sword|pp=35\u201336}}  Clark's force, considered the primary expedition, set off in September and marched north along the Wabash River to Illinois country. He was hindered by logistical problems caused by low water on the river, and when he reached the mouth of the Vermilion River in October, he was beset by mutiny and mass desertion.  Clark returned with the remains of his force to Vincennes, his reputation in ruins.{{r|sword|p=37}}\n\nGeneral Logan, meanwhile, recruited and trained for his secondary force of Federal soldiers and mounted Kentucky [[Militia (United States)|militia]] against several Shawnee towns along the [[Mad River (Ohio)|Mad River]].  The Shawnee nation was divided in their response to the United States settlers, but the Kentucky settlers made no distinction between hostile and friendly villages.{{r|sword|p=36}}  The Shawnee villages along the Mad River were defended primarily by noncombatants while the warriors were hunting or raiding forts in Kentucky.  Logan burned the native towns and food supplies, and killed or captured numerous natives.  Against Logan's orders, Captain [[Hugh McGary]] murdered an elderly Shawnee chief named [[Moluntha]], who was considered friendly towards the United States and who had even hoisted a striped flag to welcome Logan's men.{{r|sword|pp=38\u201339}}  continued to 7 other villages, killing, torturing, or capturing dozens of villagers, including women and children, and plundering their goods, and burning their crops before returning to Kentucky.{{r|sword|p=40-41}}  Logan's raid devastated the Shawnee nation, who's survivors struggled that winter due to the destroyed harvests.  But it also united the Shawnee against the United States.  Reports of Logan's raid alarmed the confederate council in Detroit that November, and Shawnee raids into Kentucky were reported by December 1786.{{r|sword|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nNative American raids on both sides of the Ohio River resulted in increasing casualties.  During the mid- and late-1780s, American settlers south of the Ohio River in Kentucky and travelers on and north of the Ohio River suffered approximately 1,500 casualties.  Settlers retaliated with attacks on Indians.  In 1789, the new [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] argued that Congress had provoked Native Americans by claiming possession of their territories.<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Harless |title=Native American Policy |url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/native-american-policy/ |website=George Washington's Mount Vernon |accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Harmar Campaign===\n{{Main|Harmar campaign}}\nIn 1790, the new [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]] and Secretary of War Henry Knox ordered General [[Josiah Harmar]] to launch the [[Harmar campaign]], a major western offensive into the Shawnee and Miami country.

Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied St. Clair's request to build a fort there.  St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that \"we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.\"{{r|Poinsatte|p=21-3}}  Western native leaders, meanwhile, met at Kekionga to determine a response to the Treaty of Fort Harmar. \n\nGeneral Harmar's forces of about 1,453 militia and regulars departed [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]] on 7 October 1790.  From 19\u201321 October 1790, General Harmar lost 3 successive skirmishes near [[Kekionga]] (present-day [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]).  On 19 October, a scouting party of about 400 mixed forces under the command of Colonel [[John Hardin]] was lured into an ambush near the village of [[Le Gris]], losing 129 soldiers in one of two defeats that has been called [[Hardin's Defeat]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Harmar's Defeat |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=505 |accessdate=20 Jan 2009}}</ref>{{sfnp|Drake|1901|p=173-5}}  The following day, another scouting party under Ensign Phillip Hartshorn was ambushed, but Harmar did not move to assist them or recover their remains.  Finally, on 21 October 1790, a mixed party of militia and regulars under Colonel Hardin established attack positions on Kekionga and awaited reinforcements from General Harmar, which never came.  Instead, forces under Little Turtle overwhelmed Hardin and compelled the U.S. forces to retreat in the second battle known as Harmar's Defeat.  With 3 consecutive losses, more than 300 casualties, and low morale, Harmar retreated to Fort Washington.  Following Harmar's defeat, Knox changed his mind, instructing St. Clair to fortify Kekionga the following year.{{r|Poinsatte|p=21-3}}\n\nBecause they were both present when Harmar's army arrived, this was the first full military operation shared between Miami leader Little Turtle and Shawnee leader [[Blue Jacket]].{{r|Hogeland|pp=113\u2013115}}  It was largest the Native American victory over US forces [[St. Clair's defeat|until the following year]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Allison, Harold |title=The Tragic Saga of the Indiana Indians |year=1986 |page=76 |publisher=Turner Publishing Company, Paducah |isbn=0-938021-07-9}}</ref> and emboldened Native Nations within the Northwest Territory.

At dawn on 4 November 1791, St. Clair's force was camped (near modern [[Fort Recovery, Ohio]]) with weak defenses set up on the perimeter.  A Native American force of about 2,000 warriors, led by [[Little Turtle]] and [[Blue Jacket]], struck quickly. Surprising the Americans, they soon overran the poorly prepared perimeter. The barely trained recruits panicked and were slaughtered, along with many of their officers, who frantically tried to restore order and stop the rout.
