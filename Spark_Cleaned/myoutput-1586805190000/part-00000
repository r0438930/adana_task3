The cell may detect this uncapping as DNA damage and then either stop growing, enter cellular old age ([[Cellular senescence|senescence]]), or begin programmed cell self-destruction ([[apoptosis]]) depending on the cell's genetic background ([[p53]] status). Uncapped telomeres also result in chromosomal fusions. Since this damage cannot be repaired in normal somatic cells, the cell may even go into apoptosis. Many aging-related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres. Organs deteriorate as more and more of their cells die off or enter cellular senescence.\n\n[[File:Telosome.png|thumb|300x300px|Shelterin co-ordinates the T-loop formation of telomeres]]\n\n===Shelterin===\n{{Main|Shelterin}}\nAt the very distal end of the telomere is a 300 base pair single-stranded portion, which forms the T-loop. This loop is analogous to a knot, which stabilizes the telomere, preventing the telomere ends from being recognized as break points by the DNA repair machinery. Should non-homologous end joining occur at the telomeric ends, chromosomal fusion will result. The T-loop is held together by several proteins, the most notable ones being TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN1, and TIN2, collectively referred to as the shelterin complex. In humans, the shelterin complex consists of six proteins identified as TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, POT1, TPP1, and RAP1.<ref name=\"pmid20569239\" />\n\n==Shortening==\n\nTelomeres shorten in part because of the ''end replication problem'' that is exhibited during DNA replication in [[eukaryote]]s only. Because DNA replication does not begin at either end of the DNA strand, but starts in the center, and considering that all known [[DNA polymerase]]s read the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction, one finds a leading and a lagging strand on the DNA molecule being replicated.\n\nOn the leading strand, DNA polymerase can make a complementary DNA strand without any difficulty because it reads the template strand from 3' to 5'. However, there is a problem going in the other direction on the lagging strand. To counter this, short sequences of [[RNA]] acting as [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]]s attach to the lagging strand a short distance ahead of where the initiation site was. The DNA polymerase can start replication at that point and go to the end of the initiation site. This causes the formation of [[Okazaki fragment]]s. More RNA primers attach further on the DNA strand and DNA polymerase comes along and continues to make a new DNA strand.[[File:Dnareplication.svg|thumb|250 px|Lagging strand during DNA replication]]Eventually, the last RNA primer attaches, and DNA polymerase, RNA nuclease, and [[DNA ligase]] come along to convert the RNA (of the primers) to DNA and to seal the gaps in between the Okazaki fragments. But, in order to change RNA to DNA, there must be another DNA strand in front of the RNA primer. This happens at all the sites of the lagging strand, but it does not happen at the end where the last RNA primer is attached. Ultimately, that RNA is destroyed by enzymes that degrade any RNA left on the DNA. Thus, a section of the telomere is lost during each cycle of replication at the 5' end of the lagging strand's daughter.\n\nHowever, [[in vitro|test-tube]] studies have shown that telomeres are highly susceptible to [[oxidative stress]]. There is evidence that oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage is an important determinant of telomere shortening.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richter T, von Zglinicki T | title = A continuous correlation between oxidative stress and telomere shortening in fibroblasts | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 42 | issue = 11 | pages = 1039\u201342 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17869047 | doi = 10.1016/j.exger.2007.08.005 }}</ref> Telomere shortening due to free radicals explains the difference between the estimated loss per division because of the end-replication problem (c. 20 bp) and actual telomere shortening rates (50\u2013100 bp), and has a greater absolute impact on telomere length than shortening caused by the end-replication problem.

The reason that this would extend human life is because it would extend the Hayflick limit. Three routes have been proposed to reverse telomere shortening: drugs, gene therapy, or metabolic suppression, so-called, torpor/hibernation. So far these ideas have not been proven in humans, but it has been demonstrated that telomere shortening is reversed in hibernation and aging is slowed (Turbill, ''et al.'' 2012 & 2013) and that hibernation prolongs life-span (Lyman ''et al.'' 1981).

The cell may detect this uncapping as DNA damage and then either stop growing, enter cellular old age ([[Cellular senescence|senescence]]), or begin programmed cell self-destruction ([[apoptosis]]) depending on the cell's genetic background ([[p53]] status). Uncapped telomeres also result in chromosomal fusions. Since this damage cannot be repaired in normal somatic cells, the cell may even go into apoptosis. Many aging-related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres. Organs deteriorate as more and more of their cells die off or enter cellular senescence.\n\n[[File:Telosome.png|thumb|300x300px|Shelterin co-ordinates the T-loop formation of telomeres]]\n\n===Shelterin===\n{{Main|Shelterin}}\nAt the very distal end of the telomere is a 300 base pair single-stranded portion, which forms the T-loop. This loop is analogous to a knot, which stabilizes the telomere, preventing the telomere ends from being recognized as break points by the DNA repair machinery. Should non-homologous end joining occur at the telomeric ends, chromosomal fusion will result. The T-loop is held together by several proteins, the most notable ones being TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN1, and TIN2, collectively referred to as the shelterin complex. In humans, the shelterin complex consists of six proteins identified as TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, POT1, TPP1, and RAP1.<ref name=\"pmid20569239\" />\n\n==Shortening==\n\nTelomeres shorten in part because of the ''end replication problem'' that is exhibited during DNA replication in [[eukaryote]]s only. Because DNA replication does not begin at either end of the DNA strand, but starts in the center, and considering that all known [[DNA polymerase]]s read the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction, one finds a leading and a lagging strand on the DNA molecule being replicated.\n\nOn the leading strand, DNA polymerase can make a complementary DNA strand without any difficulty because it reads the template strand from 3' to 5'. However, there is a problem going in the other direction on the lagging strand. To counter this, short sequences of [[RNA]] acting as [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]]s attach to the lagging strand a short distance ahead of where the initiation site was. The DNA polymerase can start replication at that point and go to the end of the initiation site. This causes the formation of [[Okazaki fragment]]s. More RNA primers attach further on the DNA strand and DNA polymerase comes along and continues to make a new DNA strand.[[File:Dnareplication.svg|thumb|250 px|Lagging strand during DNA replication]]Eventually, the last RNA primer attaches, and DNA polymerase, RNA nuclease, and [[DNA ligase]] come along to convert the RNA (of the primers) to DNA and to seal the gaps in between the Okazaki fragments. But, in order to change RNA to DNA, there must be another DNA strand in front of the RNA primer. This happens at all the sites of the lagging strand, but it does not happen at the end where the last RNA primer is attached. Ultimately, that RNA is destroyed by enzymes that degrade any RNA left on the DNA. Thus, a section of the telomere is lost during each cycle of replication at the 5' end of the lagging strand's daughter.\n\nHowever, [[in vitro|test-tube]] studies have shown that telomeres are highly susceptible to [[oxidative stress]]. There is evidence that oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage is an important determinant of telomere shortening.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richter T, von Zglinicki T | title = A continuous correlation between oxidative stress and telomere shortening in fibroblasts | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 42 | issue = 11 | pages = 1039\u201342 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17869047 | doi = 10.1016/j.exger.2007.08.005 }}</ref> Telomere shortening due to free radicals explains the difference between the estimated loss per division because of the end-replication problem (c. 20 bp) and actual telomere shortening rates (50\u2013100 bp), and has a greater absolute impact on telomere length than shortening caused by the end-replication problem.

So far these ideas have not been proven in humans, but it has been demonstrated that telomere shortening is reversed in hibernation and aging is slowed (Turbill, et al. 2012 & 2013) and that hibernation prolongs life-span (Lyman et al. 1981).
