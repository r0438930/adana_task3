{{Main|List of Honda Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}

The Honda US90 was a three-wheeled Recreational vehicle designed by [[Osamu Takeuchi]]. Development began in 1967, in response to requests from American dealers for products to sell in the motorcycle off-season. Takeuchi considered many variations before settling on a three-wheeled design with low-pressure ballon tires, driven by an enlarged [[Honda ST70]] engine, through a 4 Speed Dual-Range Semi automatic clutched transmission. <ref>{{cite web|author=ATC90.com |url= http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html |title=ATC90-History|website=ATC90.tripod.com|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==1st Generation US90 (1970-1973)==

The Initial US90 was offered at $595 in 1970, and featured an 89cc engine producing 7hp. The US90 designation was used until 1973, when Honda successfully trademarked the moniker ‘All Terrain Cycle’. <ref>{{cite web|author=Louis Mieike |url= http://www.3wheelerworld.com/content.php/216-US90-and-ATC90-Technical-Data |title=US90 and ATC90 technical data|website=Www.3wheelerworld.com|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> The designation was then changed to ATC90. The ATC prefix would be used for all Honda Three-Wheeled-Vehicles until production ceased in 1987, and become a universal epithet for other manufacturers three-wheeled machines.

==2nd Generation ATC90 (1974-1978)==

The US90 had been designed without suspension, which would be common place on ATC’s for the first decade. Cushioning for the rider was provided by the low-pressure hubless tires, which also provided a low-impact impression on the environments it traverses. <ref>{{cite web|author=NMCM |url= https://nationalmcmuseum.org/2017/09/22/1972-honda-atc90/ |title=1972 Honda ATC90(sic)|website=Nationalmcmuseum.org|date=2015-09-04 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> For all the benefits, the tires proved to be fragile in rougher terrain, and expensive to replace.

In 1985, this  machine was phased out for the more contemporary [[Honda ATC125M]].

{{Main|List of Honda Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}

The Honda US90 was a three-wheeled Recreational vehicle designed by [[Osamu Takeuchi]]. Development began in 1967, in response to requests from American dealers for products to sell in the motorcycle off-season. Takeuchi considered many variations before settling on a three-wheeled design with low-pressure ballon tires, driven by an enlarged [[Honda ST70]] engine, through a 4 Speed Dual-Range Semi automatic clutched transmission. <ref>{{cite web|author=ATC90.com |url= http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html |title=ATC90-History|website=ATC90.tripod.com|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==1st Generation US90 (1970-1973)==

The Initial US90 was offered at $595 in 1970, and featured an 89cc engine producing 7hp. The US90 designation was used until 1973, when Honda successfully trademarked the moniker ‘All Terrain Cycle’. <ref>{{cite web|author=Louis Mieike |url= http://www.3wheelerworld.com/content.php/216-US90-and-ATC90-Technical-Data |title=US90 and ATC90 technical data|website=Www.3wheelerworld.com|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> The designation was then changed to ATC90. The ATC prefix would be used for all Honda Three-Wheeled-Vehicles until production ceased in 1987, and become a universal epithet for other manufacturers three-wheeled machines.

==2nd Generation ATC90 (1974-1978)==

The US90 had been designed without suspension, which would be common place on ATC’s for the first decade. Cushioning for the rider was provided by the low-pressure hubless tires, which also provided a low-impact impression on the environments it traverses. <ref>{{cite web|author=NMCM |url= https://nationalmcmuseum.org/2017/09/22/1972-honda-atc90/ |title=1972 Honda ATC90(sic)|website=Nationalmcmuseum.org|date=2015-09-04 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> For all the benefits, the tires proved to be fragile in rougher terrain, and expensive to replace.

'''Jawan Canteen''', Dadar was formed to serve Indian Soldiers during the [[Indo-Pak war that took place in 1971]]. The Canteen was conducted by Wadala Junior Chambers (Founder- Gangaram Joshi), under the guidance of [[Nanik Rupani]], who was the President at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-long-healing-of-1971/article17874134.ece|title=The long healing of 1971|work=thehindu}}</ref>

== History ==
In 1971, War broke down between India and Pakistan. Bombay was then the vital point of transit for Jawans. To commute to the border, Mumbai was the best route that could be taken for traveling. The war lasted for 13 days, that is marked as the shortest war in history. With its adverse effects, some soldiers never returned from the war, while some were seriously injured. The injured soldiers were commuted back for recovery. The train came to Dadar, which was the main station of receival of the Jawans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/India-Pakistan-not-telling-truth-Dayal-Singh/articleshow/54785778.cms|title=India, Pakistan not telling truth: Dayal Singh|work=timesofindia.indiatimes.com}}</ref>

Wadala Junior Chamber (formed in 1970) was a non-profit organization that was initially established in the [[United States]] and was expanded to India. They assisted the young people irrespective of their caste and creed for a better future. Wadala Junior Chamber, under the guidance of [[Nanik Rupani]], started with the ‘Jawan Canteen’ that was an initiative to serve refreshments to the soldiers in transit. The Jawans Canteen provided medical assistance, food, and blankets to the Jawans who had been injured for the country. Some volunteers also helped soldiers to write down about their welfare to their families.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

== Venue ==
As Dadar was the major railway station in Mumbai that had the highest number of trains commuting to and forth from the border, ‘Jawan Canteen’ was set at ‘Dadar Railway Station’.

== Announcement ==
After finalizing the formation of ‘Jawan Canteen’ in an emergency meeting by Wadala Junior Chambers, they presented the railway authorities with the details of the canteen. After getting the approval from railway authorities, the announcement about the ‘Jawan Canteen’ was made in a press conference.

After the announcement, more than 250 individuals joined the canteen in a short time to work as volunteers. These volunteers were from all walks of society and helped serve the Jawans in these difficult times.

== Duration ==
Jawan Canteen took its first project of serving a trainload of soldiers for INR 7000 collected solely by Wadala Junior Chamber.

After finishing two successful projects, the canteen supplies were then delivered by that the President of the Grain Merchants’ Federation Mr. Devji Ratanshi and was managed by Wadala Junior Chamber until the war lasted.
 
Considering the critical situation and the purpose of the Jawan Canteen, many people volunteered for the cause.

'''South Park''' is a 7.9&nbsp;hectare park in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]]. South Park contains a public cricket pitch, tennis courts, football pitches, netball and basketball courts. In addition there is a large children's playground fenced off from the main park and a 1&nbsp;km perimeter walk used by runners, walkers, dogs and their owners.  Many people enjoy South Park for its unique trees and well maintained gardens. A nursery for 2-5 year olds operates out of the cricket pavilion.

[[File:South Park, Fulham - geograph.org.uk - 35116.jpg|thumb|South Park Fulham]]

==History==
South Park opened in 1904 after local benefactress and naturalist Ms Charlotte Sulivan sold the land to the Fulham Borough Council for use as a public recreation ground.  The land was formerly known as Broom House Farm and Southfields Farm.  The land had been part of the Sulivan private lands though it had been leased to Messrs Veithch & Sons of Chelsea as a nursery for fruit trees.
When South Park opened in March 1904, it was described in the local newspaper as
\"Possessing over 20 acres, cricket, tennis, plus other open air games were offered and there was a bandstand, refreshment pavilion, ladies and gentleman's lavatories and a shelter.\" The report also said that a gymnasium ( ¾ acre in extent) fitted with complete apparatus was at the Hugon Road corner. There is no evidence of any structure in this part of the park and it is believed that the gymnasium was an open area which might not have been uncommon at that time. This area is now an enclosed hard court games zone.
South Park's first park-keeper was John Eckett who lived in the gardener's lodge whilst Miss Gertrude Eckett, is noted as being at the refreshment room. This was in an extension to the North Lodge at the corner of Clancarty Road and Peterborough Road. The lodge is currently undergoing restoration. The refreshment room, with a conservatory extension, was used as a nursery school for a number of years.
World War I saw military occupation of the park and allotments and in 1915 South Park became the training ground for three Fulham Brigades of the Royal Field Artillery. World War II, 11000 cu. yards of sand was dug from South Park and surrounds to fill sandbags needed to protect key buildings and areas. Air raid shelters were created near the present cricket pavilion.
In 2004, South Park celebrated its centenary. The Mayor of Hammersmith and Fulham presented the park with some memorial benches.

==Design==
South Park opened in 1904 after local benefactress and naturalist Ms Charlotte Sulivan sold the land to the Fulham Borough Council for use as a public recreation ground.  Attached to the Sale was a covenant that the land should remain open space. The land was formerly known as Broom House Farm and Southfields Farm.  The land had been part of the Sulivan private lands though it had been leased to Messrs Veithch & Sons of Chelsea as a nursery for fruit trees.

\"'''Designated Driver'''\" is the tenth episode of the eighth season of the American television drama series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', and the 94th episode overall. It premiered on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on April 12, 2020.

== Plot ==

Recalling what she heard on the flight recorder, [[Carrie Mathison|Carrie]] ([[Claire Danes]]) touches base with Chief Mechanic Worley (Michael Rabe), who confirms that the pilots' verbiage indicates a mechanical failure in the helicopter, upon which they were forced to attempt a landing on mountainous terrain.  Carrie reports this to Saul ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), along with the fact that the Russian government is now possessing the flight recorder.  Saul makes inquiries via the Russian ambassador Victor Makarov ([[Elya Baskin]]) as to what is Russia's price to give back the recorder.  Saul infers from the ambassador's cryptic responses that they have the recorder but are not interested in trading it.

A disastrous meeting between President Hayes ([[Sam Trammell]]) and Ambassador Rashad ([[Samrat Chakrabarti]]) from Pakistan only increases the likelihood of nuclear conflict between the countries.  Wellington ([[Linus Roache]]) takes Rashad aside and, in order to de-escalate the situation, suggests that Pakistan release the U.S. special ops team that was arrested in Kohat.

Jalal (Elham Ehsas) plots an attack on the United States, against the advice of his second-in-command Balach (Seear Kohi).  Jalal orders that a car be filled with explosives which will be driven into the target.  Not satisfied with Balach's loyalty, Jalal commands that Balach himself will drive the car and die a martyr, else his family will be killed.

Carrie is accosted by Yevgeny ([[Costa Ronin]]) after searching his now-empty apartment.   Yevgeny makes her an offer:  the only thing more valuable to Russia than the flight recorder is the identity of a double agent that Saul has placed very highly inside the Kremlin.   Carrie then goes to the CIA station in Kabul and turns herself in.   After a brief interrogation, Carrie demands a lawyer.   She is immediately arrested and put on a plane to be extradited to the United States.

Jenna ([[Andrea Deck]]) travels to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to greet the special ops team when they are released.  Balach, sitting in the car loaded with explosives, records a final message to his family on his phone.  He drives at high speed towards his target, which is the bus containing the special ops soldiers.  Border guards open fire on the car, attempting to stop him, but he crashes into the bus, triggering an explosion.

[[File:Moleda-2019.jpg|thumb|upright|Mateusz Molęda, 2019]]
'''Mateusz Krzysztof Maksymilian Molęda''' (born December 4, 1986) is a German-Polish conductor.

== Life ==

Mateusz Molęda was born in [[Dresden]], Germany, into a family of musicians. His parents Alicja Borkowska-Molęda (born 1952) and Krzysztof Molęda (born 1953) are both [[opera]] singers and sang for more than two decades title and major roles at European opera houses like the [[Semper Opera House]], the [[Komische Oper Berlin]], the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], the [[Leipzig Opera]] and the [[Prague State Opera]]. Molęda holds the German and Polish citizenship and lives in [[Hanover]], Germany. He is fluent in German, Polish, English, French and Russian.

== Education ==

Molęda started to play the piano at the age of six and studied later at the [[Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover]] in the class of [[Arie Vardi]], considered one of the most distinguished piano teachers of the world, who also serves as conductor of the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] for more than twenty years. He continued his studies in the area of historical keyboard instruments and [[historical performance practice]] in cooperation with Zvi Meniker.

Molęda has received important musical impulses from his mentor [[Marek Janowski]], for whom he worked by personal request also as assistant with the [[Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Dresden Philharmonic]] and the [[Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. By sharing his varied experiences, Janowski has profoundly influenced Molęda's artistic development in the spirit of the traditional German conducting school.

== Collaboration with orchestras ==

Molęda conducted for the first time an orchestra at the age of nineteen. He guest-conducted renowned orchestras in more than 10 countries of the world, among others in Germany, Poland, Spain, Denmark, Albania, South Korea, Japan as well as in South Africa. He has worked among others with the Deutsches Kammerorchester Berlin, the [[Nuremberg Symphony]]<ref>https://www.br-klassik.de/aktuell/news-kritik/freundschaftskonzert-koszalin-polen-nuernberg-symphoniker100.html</ref>, the [[Jena Philharmonic]], the Heidelberg Philharmonic, the Folkwang Kammerorchester Essen, the Staatskapelle Schwerin, the Carl Nielsen Academy Orchestra, the [[Aalborg Symfoniorkester]], the [[Aarhus Symfoniorkester]], the [[Odense Symfoniorkester]]<ref>https://odensesymfoni.dk/koncerter/romantic-overload/</ref> and the NFM Wroclaw Philharmonic<ref>https://www.nfm.wroclaw.pl/en/component/nfmcalendar/event/5608</ref>.

== Notable concerts ==

With his performance of Beethoven's [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]] at the formal function of the Federal Government on the [[Day of German Unity]] on 3 October 2007, Molęda commanded attention throughout Germany. The concert was broadcast live by the German TV channel [[ZDF]] with over eight million viewers.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKxy5ijCM0Q</ref>

On November 8, 2018, Molęda conducted the world premiere of the Concerto for [[Hammond organ]] by Danish composer [[Anders Koppel]], the first composition of this genre ever.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEjFa62zuUw</ref>

[[File:Wisbech-clarkson-memorial--.jpg|thumb|The Wisbech Clarkson Memorial--]]
The '''Clarkson Memorial''' in [[Wisbech]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]] commemorates [[Thomas Clarkson]] (1760 &ndash; 1846), a central figure in the campaign against the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] in the [[British empire]], and a former native of Wisbech. It is a [[Grade II* listed building]].<ref name=\"NHLE\">{{NHLE|num=1228597 |desc=|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref>

The memorial consists of a [[statue]] mounted on a platform. Above this, rises a canopy, in the form of a [[spire]]. The whole structure is 68 feet (20.6 m) high. On three of the four sides are carved [[bas-relief]]s, representing  [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Granville Sharp]],  both prominent figures in the campaign against the slave trade, and a manacled [[Slavery|slave]] in a beseeching attitude. The fourth side bears an inscription to the memory of Clarkson.

==History==
Clarkson was born in the town in 1760, the son of the Rev. John Clarkson (1710–1766). He attended [[Wisbech Grammar School]] where his father was headmaster before going on to [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London in 1775. His prize winning essay \"Is it right to make slaves of others against their will ?\", written whilst at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] was a turning point in his life, culminating in him turning the abolition campaign into \"one of the major issues of the day\".<ref>[http://www.wisbech-society.co.uk/clarksonmemorial.html The Wisbech Society & Preservation Trust, The Thomas Clarkson Memorial]</ref> The [[Wisbech & Fenland Museum]] houses  Clarkson's chest which contains examples of 18th century African textiles, seeds and leatherwork which he used to illustrate his case for direct trade with Africa in place of the slave trade.

The memorial is in Bridge Street, on the South Brink of the [[River Nene]]. It is on the site of the old Customs House, built in 1801, which itself replaced the Butter Market. In 1856 the Old Bridge was rebuilt, and the Customs House pulled down to make way for the bridge improvements. In 1880, when work started on the Clarkson Memorial the location was chosen because of its central position.

The Clarkson Memorial cost £2,035, and was paid for primarily by a large donation from the Peckover family, local [[Quaker]] [[philanthropists]]. The shortfall was made up by public subscriptions. Work started on 28 October 1880 and the statue was unveiled on 11 November 1881  by [[Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden|Sir Henry Brand]], speaker of the House of Commons and MP for Cambridgeshire.

The design was an adaption of one by [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] [[Royal Academician|RA]], who first put forward his design in 1875. He was a brother of the Rev John Scott, vicar of St Peter's, Wisbech, 1867-86. The monument falls into a tradition of Gothic monuments for which Scott was largely responsible; his work in this line included the [[Martyrs' Memorial]] (1841-3) in Oxford, and the [[Albert Memorial]] (1876) in Hyde Park.  Responsibility for the execution of the monument was assumed by [[John Oldrid Scott]] after his father's death.<ref name=\"NHLE\"/>

A four-year renovation project was completed in 2011 and a new supplicant panel installed to coincide with the 130th anniversary of the building of the monument.<ref>Wisbech Standard August 2011</ref>

The monument is used as the saluting point for the Remembrance Day parade.

'''Raúl Osvaldo Castronovo Zanón''' (born 11 January 1949) is an Argentine retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], Castronovo began his career with local [[Rosario Central]] in 1968, but an economic crisis in 1970 prompted his move to [[Peñarol]] in [[Uruguay]], where he became the [[List of Copa Libertadores top scorers|top scorer]] of the [[1971 Copa Libertadores|1971 edition]] of the [[Copa Libertadores]], tied with [[Luis Artime]] at ten goals.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/copa71.html Copa Libertadores de América 1971]; at [[RSSSF]]</ref>

After playing in [[Ligue 1]] with [[AS Nancy]] during three seasons, Castronovo moved to Spain where he remained until the end of his career, representing [[CD Málaga]], [[Hércules CF]], [[UD Salamanca]] and [[Algeciras CF]] and competing in both [[La Liga]] and [[Segunda División]]. On 27 April 1980, whilst a [[free agent]], he was involved in a [[match fixing]] incident between the first and the third clubs which resulted in a two-year ban for himself, Málaga teammate Julio Orozco and Salamanca manager [[Felipe Mesones]];<ref>[https://archive.is/20120629175044/http://www.diariosur.es/20070827/deportes/malagacf/salamanca-borron-historia-malaguista-20070827.html El Salamanca, un borrón en la historia malaguista (Salamanca, blur in ''malaguista'' history)]; [[Diario Sur]], 27 August 2007 (in Spanish)</ref> he retired shortly after, aged only 31.

'''Raúl Osvaldo Castronovo Zanón''' (born 11 January 1949) is an Argentine retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], Castronovo began his career with local [[Rosario Central]] in 1968, but an economic crisis in 1970 prompted his move to [[Peñarol]] in [[Uruguay]], where he became the [[List of Copa Libertadores top scorers|top scorer]] of the [[1971 Copa Libertadores|1971 edition]] of the [[Copa Libertadores]], tied with [[Luis Artime]] at ten goals.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/copa71.html Copa Libertadores de América 1971]; at [[RSSSF]]</ref>

After playing in [[Ligue 1]] with [[AS Nancy]] during three seasons, Castronovo moved to Spain where he remained until the end of his career, representing [[CD Málaga]], [[Hércules CF]], [[UD Salamanca]] and [[Algeciras CF]] and competing in both [[La Liga]] and [[Segunda División]]. On 27 April 1980, whilst a [[free agent]], he was involved in a [[match fixing]] incident between the first and the third clubs which resulted in a two-year ban for himself, Málaga teammate Julio Orozco and Salamanca manager [[Felipe Mesones]];<ref>[https://archive.is/20120629175044/http://www.diariosur.es/20070827/deportes/malagacf/salamanca-borron-historia-malaguista-20070827.html El Salamanca, un borrón en la historia malaguista (Salamanca, blur in ''malaguista'' history)]; [[Diario Sur]], 27 August 2007 (in Spanish)</ref> he retired shortly after, aged only 31.

'''Peter N. Davies''' (born [[Birkenhead]], 14 July 1927, died [[Caldy]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], 19 March 2020) was a British economic historian with interests in the port of [[Liverpool]], sea-based trade with [[West Africa]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Japan]], the international fruit trade and the military history of the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] campaign in [[World War II]]. He was an Emeritus Professor in the School of History at the [[University of Liverpool]], [[England]].

Davies was the author of several books including, \"The Trade Makers, [[Elder Dempster]] in West Africa\" (Allen and Unwin, 1973), \"Trading in West Africa\" (Croom Helm, 1976), \"Sir Alfred Jones: Shipping Entrepreneur par Excellence\" (Europa, 1978), \"[[Fyffes]] and the Banana, Musa Sapientum\" (Athlone Press, 1990), \"Japanese Shipping and Shipbuilding Industries: A History of Their Modern Growth\" (with T. Chida, Athlone Press, 1990), \"The Man Behind the Bridge: Colonel Toosey and the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]]\" (Athlone Press, 1991), and \"From Orchard to Market\" (with D.Hope-Mason, Lockwood Press, 2005).

During a long career at the [[University of Liverpool]] which began in 1958 when he entered as an undergraduate in the Department of [[Economic History]] (later known as ‘Economic and Social History’), Davies became Acting Head of Department in 1979 and Head of Department from 1980-89, after which he was awarded a personal Chair. Davies continued the tradition of commitment to Maritime History which had been initiated by Francis Hyde and maintained by John Harris (subsequently Professor of Economic History at the [[University of Birmingham]]) and Sheila Marriner. Taken together, Hyde, Harris, Marriner and Davies have become known as the \"Liverpool School of Maritime Historians\".<ref>Davies PN, \"The Liverpool School of Maritime History\". International Journal of Maritime History (2005);XVII, 2 pp249–260.</ref><ref>Milne G, \"Trade and Traders in Mid-Victorian Liverpool: Mercantile Business and the Making of a World Port\" (Liverpool University Press, 2000) pp 5–6.</ref>

\"The Business, Life and Letters of Frederick Cornes : Aspects of the Evolution of Commerce in Modern Japan, 1861-1912\"  (Global Oriental: {{ISBN|1-905246-34-X}}) was published in September 2008. In this book Davies examined the surprisingly well-preserved papers of Frederick Cornes, a merchant from [[Cheshire]], England who spent much of his life trading in Japan's port city of [[Yokohama]] during and after the [[Meiji Restoration]], including the entire correspondence of \"Cornes and Company\" extending over a forty-year period in the early years of Anglo-Japanese trade.

Davies's last book, \"Across the Three Pagodas Pass: The Story of the Thai-Burma Railway\" (Renaissance Books: {{ISBN|978-1-898823-07-0}}), was published in August 2013. Davies acted as editor to Ewart Escritt's translation of the personal records of Japanese Railway Engineer Yoshihiko Futamatsu. Davies had come to know Futamatsu through his research for the 1991 biography of [[Philip Toosey]] \"The Man Behind the Bridge\" and secured his agreement that his memoirs could be published in English after his death.<ref>Davies PN (ed), Futamatsu Y \"Across the Three Pagodas Pass: The Story of the Thai-Burma Railway\" (Renaissance Books: {{ISBN|978-1-898823-07-0}}).</ref> The book is therefore a rare account from the Japanese viewpoint of the construction of the Thai-Burma Railway (and the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] Bridge) during [[World War II]].

Davies''' (born [[Birkenhead]], 14 July 1927, died [[Caldy]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], 19 March 2020) was a British economic historian with interests in the port of [[Liverpool]], sea-based trade with [[West Africa]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Japan]], the international fruit trade and the military history of the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] campaign in [[World War II]]. He was an Emeritus Professor in the School of History at the [[University of Liverpool]], [[England]].

Davies was the author of several books including, \"The Trade Makers, [[Elder Dempster]] in West Africa\" (Allen and Unwin, 1973), \"Trading in West Africa\" (Croom Helm, 1976), \"Sir Alfred Jones: Shipping Entrepreneur par Excellence\" (Europa, 1978), \"[[Fyffes]] and the Banana, Musa Sapientum\" (Athlone Press, 1990), \"Japanese Shipping and Shipbuilding Industries: A History of Their Modern Growth\" (with T. Chida, Athlone Press, 1990), \"The Man Behind the Bridge: Colonel Toosey and the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]]\" (Athlone Press, 1991), and \"From Orchard to Market\" (with D.Hope-Mason, Lockwood Press, 2005).

During a long career at the [[University of Liverpool]] which began in 1958 when he entered as an undergraduate in the Department of [[Economic History]] (later known as ‘Economic and Social History’), Davies became Acting Head of Department in 1979 and Head of Department from 1981-89, after which he was awarded a personal Chair. Davies continued the tradition of commitment to Maritime History which had been initiated by Francis Hyde and maintained by John Harris (subsequently Professor of Economic History at the [[University of Birmingham]]) and Sheila Marriner. Taken together, Hyde, Harris, Marriner and Davies have become known as the \"Liverpool School of Maritime Historians\".<ref>Davies PN, \"The Liverpool School of Maritime History\". International Journal of Maritime History (2005);XVII, 2 pp249–260.</ref><ref>Milne G, \"Trade and Traders in Mid-Victorian Liverpool: Mercantile Business and the Making of a World Port\" (Liverpool University Press, 2000) pp 5–6.</ref>

\"The Business, Life and Letters of Frederick Cornes : Aspects of the Evolution of Commerce in Modern Japan, 1861-1912\"  (Global Oriental: {{ISBN|1-905246-34-X}}) was published in September 2008. In this book Davies examined the surprisingly well-preserved papers of Frederick Cornes, a merchant from [[Cheshire]], England who spent much of his life trading in Japan's port city of [[Yokohama]] during and after the [[Meiji Restoration]], including the entire correspondence of \"Cornes and Company\" extending over a forty-year period in the early years of Anglo-Japanese trade.

Davies's last book, \"Across the Three Pagodas Pass: The Story of the Thai-Burma Railway\" (Renaissance Books: {{ISBN|978-1-898823-07-0}}), was published in August 2013. Davies acted as editor to Ewart Escritt's translation of the personal records of Japanese Railway Engineer Yoshihiko Futamatsu. Davies had come to know Futamatsu through his research for the 1991 biography of [[Philip Toosey]] \"The Man Behind the Bridge\" and secured his agreement that his memoirs could be published in English after his death.<ref>Davies PN (ed), Futamatsu Y \"Across the Three Pagodas Pass: The Story of the Thai-Burma Railway\" (Renaissance Books: {{ISBN|978-1-898823-07-0}}).</ref> The book is therefore a rare account from the Japanese viewpoint of the construction of the Thai-Burma Railway (and the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] Bridge) during [[World War II]].

'''State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur''' (SBBJ) was a major Indian bank. It was a subsidiary of [[State Bank of India]], with which it was merged on 31 March 2017. As of 2015, SBBJ had 1,360 branches, mostly located in the state of [[Rajasthan]], [[India]]. Its branch network out of Rajasthan covered all the major business centers of India. In 1997, the bank entered the capital market with an [[Initial Public Offering]] of 1,360,000 shares at a premium of Rs. 440 per share. For the year 2015-16 the net profit of the company was Rs. 8.5 billion.<ref>http://info.shine.com/Company/State-Bank-of-Bikaner-and-Jaipur/373.aspx Company Overview:  State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur</ref><ref>http://sbbjbank.com/About-Us/history.htm SBBJ History</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.capitalmarket.com/CMEdit/story2-0.asp?SNo=309201 |title=State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur capitalises on robust earnings |date=24 April 2009 |publisher=Capital Market Publishers India }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.equitybulls.com/admin/news2006/news_det.asp?id=50353 |title=State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur 2009 profit up at Rs 403.45 crore |date=4 April 2009 |publisher=Equity Bulls}}</ref>

==History==

State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur came into existence on 1963 when two banks, namely, State Bank of [[Bikaner]] (established in 1944) and State Bank of [[Jaipur]] (established in 1943), were merged. Both these banks were subsidiaries of the State Bank of India under the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Bank) Act, 1959.

On 25 April 1966 SBBJ took over Govind Bank (Private) Ltd., [[Mathura]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rupeetimes.com/banks/state_bank_of_bikaner_and_jaipur.html |title=FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur |accessdate=12 December 2013 |publisher=Rupee Times}}</ref> established on 8 February 1963.

In 1984 SBBJ sponsored and established [[Ganganagar]] Kshetriya Gramin Bank as a [[Regional Rural Bank]]. Thereafter, in 1985 SBBJ opened the Bikaner Kshetriya Gramin Bank, the second Regional Rural Bank sponsored by it. The third Regional Rural Bank, sponsored by SBBJ was Marwar Gramin Bank, which covered the districts of [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]], [[Jalore]] and [[Sirohi]]. On 12 June 2006, SBBJ merged all three regional rural banks that it sponsored under the name MGB Gramin Bank, with headquarters in [[Jodhpur]].

The plans to make SBI one of the top 50 banks in India affected SBBJ very much. In 2016, the plan to merge SBBJ with its five co-subsidiaries was made, and it was ratified by the Government of India on 15 February 2017. It finally merged with SBI on 31 March 2017.
