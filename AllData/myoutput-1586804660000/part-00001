[[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Albert Bacon Fall]] had leased [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[petroleum]] reserves at [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome]] in [[Wyoming]], and two locations in [[California]], to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding.

To ensure that the Navy would always have enough fuel available, several oil-producing areas were designated as naval oil reserves by [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]]. In 1921, President Harding issued an [[executive order]] that transferred control of [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome Oil Field]] in [[Natrona County, Wyoming]], and the [[Elk Hills Oil Field|Elk Hills]] and [[Buena Vista Oil Field]]s in [[Kern County, California]], from the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. This was not implemented until 1922, when Interior Secretary Fall persuaded [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin C. Denby]] to transfer control.\n\nLater in 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall leased the oil production rights at Teapot Dome to [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry F. Sinclair]] of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]]. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to [[Edward L. Doheny]] of [[Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company]]. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding. This manner of leasing was legal under the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ut/vernal_fo/lands___minerals.Par.6287.File.dat/MineralLeasingAct1920.pdf | title= Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 as Amended (re-transcribed 2007-08-07) | publisher= Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior | accessdate=2014-09-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, which secretly made Fall a rich man.

Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had failed to cover up: Doheny's $100,000 loan to Fall. This discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained.
