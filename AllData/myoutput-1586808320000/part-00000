It originally aired from 1981 to 1988 before moving to syndication in the early 1990s. The show relaunched online on nightflight.com in 2015 with original episodes that can be streamed on the subscription channel [[Night Flight Plus]]. In April 2018, it returned to cable television as a short form (15 minute) program airing late Friday nights/early Saturday mornings on the network [[IFC (American TV channel)|IFC]]. It includes a mix of mainstream and alternative [[music video]]s, artist interviews, [[B movie]]s, [[documentary film|documentaries]], [[short film]]s, stand-up comedy and [[animation]].\n\n==History==\nJeff Franklin (head of American Talent International) and [[Stuart S. Shapiro]] (head of International Harmony) approached USA Network about developing ''Night Flight'' in February 1981. \n\nA new series that defied conventional formats and easy categorization was an acceptable risk to USA, and it aired the first episode of ''Night Flight'' on June 5, 1981. The timing was a deliberate move to exploit the [[Hollywood]] writers' strike, which had halted production on NBC's highly popular program ''Saturday Night Live''.<ref>Denisoff, pp. 129\u201430</ref>\n\nEpisodes originally lasted four hours each, and aired in the late-night programming block after 11:00 PM [[Eastern Time]] on Friday and Saturday nights. The final original broadcast of ''Night Flight'' aired December 30, 1988; it was replaced with the programs ''[[Camp Midnite]]'' and ''[[USA Up All Night]]'' starring [[Gilbert Gottfried]], starting the following week.\n\nIn 1990, ''Night Flight'' was revived in syndication. New episodes were produced for three seasons until 1992,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283764/episodes?year=1992|title=Night Flight (TV Series 1981\u20131988) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> when the program reverted to selected reruns of episodes from the USA Network years hosted by Tom Juarez.

It was the first place that many Americans were able to see music documentaries such as ''[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]'', ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'', ''Word, Sound and Power'' and ''[[Yessongs]]''. ''Night Flight'' was also one of the first American television shows to present the music video as a serious visual art form rather than a  mere promotional tool for musicians. Late-night broadcasts also afforded cable television the freedom to air portions of videos that [[MTV]] and other outlets had either censored or banned.\n\nThere was no on-camera host in the original series. Pat Prescott introduced segments with a [[voiceover]] just before they began. Recurring segments included:\n\n*''Take Off'' - A segment that grouped together music videos based on a single unifying theme, and added a mix of interviews and snippets from movies to help round out the segment.  Examples from the show are Take Off To Animation, Take Off To Sex, Take Off To Violence, etc.  San Francisco-based production company VideoWest produced the segment from 1981 to 1983, with news reporter Dave McQueen doing the voice-overs. From 1983 on, Night Flight's producers (ATI Video) were in charge of producing the segment with Prescott narrating.\n*''[[New Wave Theatre]]'' - Hosted by [[Peter Ivers]], the show featured [[punk music|punk]] and [[new wave music|New Wave]] acts, chiefly from the [[Los Angeles]] area.\n*''The Video Artist'' - A segment covering artists working in the then-new world of video and computer graphics. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/1982StephBeckNightFlightTvShow|title=1982 Steph Beck Night Flight Tv Show|date=July 12, 1982|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n*''The Comic'' - Profiles of various comedians, consisting of stand-up bits interspersed with interview segments.
