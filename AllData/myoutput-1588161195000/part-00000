Its antecedents go back to the Dogra Corps raised by intrepid Raja [[Gulab Singh]] of [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] in 1821, under the suzerainty of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] of [[Sikh Empire]]. General [[Zorawar Singh Kahluria|Zorawar Singh]] led daredevil campaigns in northern areas like [[Ladakh]], [[Baltistan]], [[Gilgit]], [[State of Hunza|Hunza]] and [[Yagistan]], consolidating smaller principalities and making the northern areas a part of the expanding dominions of Gulab Singh. He also mounted a breath-taking invasion of [[Tibet]] in 1841.\n\nAfter the establishment of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as independent princely state under the [[British Paramountcy]] in [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|1846]], these troops became the '''Jammu and Kashmir State Forces'''.\n\nThe Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir maintained a larger number of State Forces than any other ruler of an Indian State under the British Raj. These forces were organized into the Jammu and Kashmir Brigades. They comprised a bodyguard cavalry regiment, two mountain batteries, seven infantry battalions, one training battalions and a transport unit consisting of both pack and mechanized transport. Several of these units served with distinction on the North-West Frontier of India and overseas during the Great War.<ref name=globalsecurity/> The state forces fought as [[Imperial Service Troops]] in both the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War|Second]] World Wars (under their own native officers). They distinguished themselves in [[East Africa]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Burma]].\n\n===Kashmir War of 1947===\n{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}\nThe regiment's grimmest hour came during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]. It was their heroic stand that gained time for the entry of the Indian Army and thus saved the [[Kashmir Valley]]. It may not be out of place to mention that the Indian people largely owe the State of Jammu and Kashmir to the heroic defensive stand made by the outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly motivated, J&K State Force. They paid a steep price in blood and sacrificed over 76 officers, 31 JCOs and 1085 Other Ranks. For their gallant stand they earned three Maha Vir Chakra, 20 Vir Chakras and 52 Mentioned in Despatches. Later the Jammu and Kashmir State Force was absorbed en bloc into the Indian Army as a separate regiment.\n\n===Sino-Indian War of 1962===\n{{main|Sino-Indian War}}\nTwo battalions of Jammu and Kashmir Rifles constituted the main fighting force of India in [[Aksai Chin]] during the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962. Supplemented by a battalion of the regular Indian Army, they fought \"very well\" according to scholar Steven Hoffman. China attacked them with a massive force of an entire division.<ref>{{citation |last=Hoffmann |first=Steven A. |title=India and the China Crisis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpSRwC5_EPUC&pg=PA103 |year=1990 |publisher=University of California Press |ISBN=978-0-520-06537-6 |ref={{sfnref|Hoffmann, India and the China Crisis|1990}} |p=103}}</ref>\n\n===UN Peacekeeping Operations===\nA Jammu and Kashmir Rifles battalion was part of the [[UN]] force in [[Cambodia]] during 1990\u201393.<ref name=globalsecurity/>\n\n==Recruitment==\nMuch of the Army's [[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry]] and Jammu and Kashmir Rifles Regiments are made of recruits from the districts of [[Jammu district|Jammu]], [[Samba district|Samba]], [[Kathua district|Kathua]], [[Udhampur district|Udhampur]], and [[Reasi]], while other districts like [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], [[Rajouri district|Rajouri]], [[Doda district|Doda]] and [[Kishtwar district|Kishtwar]] also contribute .<ref name=globalsecurity/> Soldiers from [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] also contribute to the ranks.\n\n==Units==\nIn 1947, the force had 9 infantry battalions and a cavalry regiment.
