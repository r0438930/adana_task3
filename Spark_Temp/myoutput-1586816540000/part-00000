Law Court Society, B.C.  Law Foundation, B.C. Police Commission and the B.C. Mediators Roster.  \nBuller has lectured and written numerous articles and papers about Aboriginal law, criminal law, family law and human rights.\n\n==Early Life==\n\nMarion Buller was born in 1953 in Toronto, Ontario. She is a member of the Mistawasis' First Nations although she did not grow up on the reserve because of discriminatory sections of the Indian Act from that time, she instead was raised in Toronto. Throughout her childhood she maintained a close relationship with her indigenous grandparents even though she did not grow up on the reserve, they taught her their traditional teachings that played a major part in her life while growing up. From a young age a strong work ethic was instilled into her, she learned cooking, cleaning, sewing and outside work from both her mother and father. In her life, work was not a \u201cwoman\u2019s or man\u2019s\u201d job but you had to work hard to be considered equal to others. As both a woman and an indigenous woman she was taught that she would have to work even harder than most to get to the places she needed to be. Education was expected in her family, and she was taught that girls are entitled to the same education as boys received. \nShe was not always aiming for a career in law, at first she wanted a career in a museum. After she finished her BA in Anthropology at the University of Victoria she went to work in the private sector, but because of the job market at the time, she knew she would need some sort of post-graduate degree. She decided to do Law at the University of Victoria so moving was not required. At first she thought she might go into Business Law, but while in first year she took Criminal Law with Dr. Keith Jobson and from that point forward knew she needed to be in the courtroom. \nMarion cannot pinpoint in her life when or how she became a feminist. Her upbringing taught her to believe in equality and equity but also the world\u2019s shortcomings of inequality and equity that must be corrected. \n\t\u201cI learned these lessons not just by words, but by the examples set by my family  members.\u201d \n<ref>M.
