This sandstone building is at the west end of the site and was built for the Haberdashers Company. This was  probably designed by Henry Stock.  New buildings were built at the end of the war in what has been described as an undemonstrative style. In September 1947 it became the '''Monmouth Secondary Modern School''', before changing to its current name in September 1977. At that time further classroom blocks were built at the north east end of the site.<ref>{{cite book|last=Newman|first=John|title=Gwent/Monmouthshire|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=680|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knRf4U60QjcC&dq=%22Monmouth+comprehensive+School%22|isbn=9780300096309}}</ref>  The school has Monmouth Leisure Centre in its grounds.And has a close rivalry between the nearby Public Schools also located in Monmouth and despite historically and socially considered the worse school of the three in the last decade or so has only averaged equal or more commonly higher results in both regular learning and extra curriculum such as there superior rowing club.\n\n==Description==\nCurrently the school has approximately 1600 students and offers a diverse curriculum across all Key Stages.

The current headteacher is Vaughan Davies.\n\n==Welsh==\nThe school teaches [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as the subject has been compulsory in Wales since the [[Welsh Language Act 1993|Welsh Language Act of 1993]]. However, in 2009 there were still students being sent to [[John Kyrle High School]] in [[Ross-on-Wye]], England where the Act does not apply.

Three students were chosen as Olympic Ambassadors and two were [[Olympic Torch]] bearers in 2012.\n\n===Extra curricular clubs and academies===\nMonmouth Comprehensive School runs a range of after school clubs and academies aimed at providing students with an opportunity for extended learning. These activities are designed to supplement the curriculum and enable students to learn to lead their lives through exploring what motivates them and what they enjoy. Clubs include [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Horse care|equine academy]], [[fencing]], [[cookery]] and many more.\n\n===Eco-Schools===\nMonmouth Comprehensive School is striving to become a more eco-friendly school; the Eco-Council is about to apply for their second green flag.   The [[Eco-Schools]] Committee is an established forum of pupils of all ages, who are trying to improve the environmental aspects of everyday life in Monmouth. It is based around the philosophy of \"Learning To Care For Our World\".  In 2012, the school held a successful Green Week which helped raise awareness of [[Fairtrade]] and [[recycling]]. Activities that were undertaken included a paper mountain to raise awareness of how much paper is used within the school, an ecotree, a logo competition and many more, all designed to raise awareness of environmental issues within the school.\nThere are plans to fill a time capsule which will be buried under the Jubilee Oak tree that the school will be receiving soon.  This will give students of the future a chance to see what the school was like in 2012. In addition to this, the school already has an established recycling policy and an effective litter management system.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://monmouthcomprehensive.org.uk/ School website (newly online Jan 2013)]\n\n{{coord|51|34|29|N|03|02|36|W|type:edu_region:GB|display=title}}\n{{Schools in Monmouthshire}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Monmouth, Wales]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in Monmouthshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Reimprove|date=May 2017}}\n{{POV|date=May 2017}}\n}}\n{{Infobox school \n| name          = Monmouth Comprehensive School\n| image = \n| motto         = Learning To Lead Our Lives ({{lang-cy|Dysgu Trwy Arwain}})\n| type          = [[Comprehensive School]]\n| head_label    = Headteacher\n| head          = Mr V Davies\n| r_head_label  = \n| r_head        = \n| chair_label   = Chair of governors\n| chair         = Mr S McLester\n| address        = Old Dixton Road \n| town          = [[Monmouth]]\n| county        = [[Monmouthshire]]\n| country       = [[Wales]]\n| postcode      = \n| local_authority           = [[Monmouthshire County Council]]\n| ofsted        = \n| staff         = \n| enrolment    = 1600<ref name=\"Estyn\">[http://www.estyn.gov.uk/download/publication/90608.7/inspection-reportmonmouth-comprehensive-schooleng2010/ Inspection | Reports - Monmouth Comprehensive School] (PDF).
