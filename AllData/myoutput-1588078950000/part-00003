It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a [[love letter]] to love itself\", ''Lover'' celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating lighter and brighter tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album artwork and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mostly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with [[Brendon Urie]] and the [[Dixie Chicks]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release, including the fourth single \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" that peaked at number 23. ''Lover'' received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and growth; however, a few of them found the album lengthy and inconsistent.  \n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number-one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|2\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], for moving over 2 million units in the US; it was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling studio album of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift was set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, in 2020, but postponed to 2021 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n''Lover'' scored several accolades, including a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017); its singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. ''Lover'' appeared on numerous year-end best music lists of 2019, with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] naming it the best album of 2019.\n\n==Background ==\n[[File:ME! mural.jpg|thumb|Swift posing in front of the interactive butterfly-shaped [[mural]] in [[The Gulch, Nashville, Tennessee]] on April 25, 2019, where she announced that new music would be released by the end of her thirteen-day countdown.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a [[love letter]] to love itself\", ''Lover'' celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating lighter and brighter tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album artwork and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mostly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with [[Brendon Urie]] and the [[Dixie Chicks]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release, including the fourth single \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" that peaked at number 23. ''Lover'' received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and growth; however, a few of them found the album lengthy and inconsistent.  \n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number-one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|2\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], for moving over 2 million units in the US; it was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling studio album of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift was set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, in 2020, but postponed to 2021 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n''Lover'' scored several accolades, including a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017); its singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. ''Lover'' appeared on numerous year-end best music lists of 2019, with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] naming it the best album of 2019.\n\n==Background ==\n[[File:ME! mural.jpg|thumb|Swift posing in front of the interactive butterfly-shaped [[mural]] in [[The Gulch, Nashville, Tennessee]] on April 25, 2019, where she announced that new music would be released by the end of her thirteen-day countdown.
