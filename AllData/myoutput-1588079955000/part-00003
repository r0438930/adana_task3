It was written and produced by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]. The song was released as the first single from Astley's debut album, ''[[Whenever You Need Somebody]]'' (1987). The song was a worldwide number-one hit, initially in the singer's native United Kingdom in 1987, where it stayed [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones|at the top of the chart]] for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year. It eventually topped the charts in 25 countries, including the United States and West Germany.<ref name=\"MikeStock\">{{cite web|title= Biography |publisher= Mike Stock Music |accessdate= 14 November 2011 |url= http://www.mikestockmusic.com/index.php?page=Biography02&section=sectionBiography |archivedate= 3 October 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111003132814/http://www.mikestockmusic.com/index.php?page=Biography02&section=sectionBiography |url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nThe song won Best British Single at the 1988 [[Brit Awards]].

It was written and produced by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]. The song was released as the first single from Astley's debut album, ''[[Whenever You Need Somebody]]'' (1987). The song was a worldwide number-one hit, initially in the singer's native United Kingdom in 1987, where it stayed [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones|at the top of the chart]] for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year. It eventually topped the charts in 25 countries, including the United States and West Germany.<ref name=\"MikeStock\">{{cite web|title= Biography |publisher= Mike Stock Music |accessdate= 14 November 2011 |url= http://www.mikestockmusic.com/index.php?page=Biography02&section=sectionBiography |archivedate= 3 October 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111003132814/http://www.mikestockmusic.com/index.php?page=Biography02&section=sectionBiography |url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nThe song won Best British Single at the 1988 [[Brit Awards]].
