They are divided into three roughly geographic groups:\n\n*the western ''[[Mbenga people|Bambenga]]'', or ''Mbenga'' ([[Cameroon]], [[Gabon]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Central African Republic]]),\n*the eastern ''[[Bambuti]]'', or ''Mbuti'', of the [[Congo basin]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]])\n*the central and southern ''[[Batwa]]'', or ''Twa'' ([[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]], [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]]). The more widely scattered (and more variable in physiology and lifestyle) [[Southern Twa]] are also grouped under the term '''Pygmoid'''.\n\nThey are notable for, and named for, their [[short stature]] (described as \"[[pygmyism]]\" in anthropological literature). They are assumed to be descended from the original [[Middle Stone Age]] expansion of [[anatomically modern human]]s to Central Africa, albeit substantially affected by later migrations from West Africa, from their first appearance in the historical record in the 19th century limited to a comparative small area within Central Africa, greatly decimated by the prehistoric [[Bantu expansion]], and to the present time widely affected by [[Slavery in Africa|enslavement]] and [[cannibalism in Africa|cannibalism]] at the hands of neighboring [[Bantu people|Bantu]] groups.<ref name=slavery/>\n\nMost contemporary Pygmy groups are only partially foragers and partially trade with neighbouring farmers to acquire cultivated foods and other material items; no group lives deep in the forest without access to agricultural products.<ref name=focus/> A total number of about 900,000 Pygmies were estimated to be living in the central African forests in 2016, about 60% of this number in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144499 |pmid=26735953 |pmc=4711706 |title=Distribution and Numbers of Pygmies in Central African Forests |journal=PLOS One |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=e0144499 |year=2016 |last1=Olivero |first1=Jes\u00fas |last2=Fa |first2=John E |last3=Farf\u00e1n |first3=Miguel A |last4=Lewis |first4=Jerome |last5=Hewlett |first5=Barry |last6=Breuer |first6=Thomas |last7=Carpaneto |first7=Giuseppe M |last8=Fern\u00e1ndez |first8=Mar\u00eda |last9=Germi |first9=Francesco |last10=Hattori |first10=Shiho |last11=Head |first11=Josephine |last12=Ichikawa |first12=Mitsuo |last13=Kitanaishi |first13=Koichi |last14=Knights |first14=Jessica |last15=Matsuura |first15=Naoki |last16=Migliano |first16=Andrea |last17=Nese |first17=Barbara |last18=Noss |first18=Andrew |last19=Ekoumou |first19=Dieudonn\u00e9 Ongbwa |last20=Paulin |first20=Pascale |last21=Real |first21=Raimundo |last22=Riddell |first22=Mike |last23=Stevenson |first23=Edward G.

They would have lived  by  hunting  and  gathering  until  they  encountered  expanding  Central  Sudanic,  Adamawa-Ubangian  and   Bantu-speaking farmers ca. 4000 bp. Since that date they have lived in a symbiosis with the farmers, often as a despised and marginalised group. If this is the case,\n then major MSA archaeological sites in the area of the present-day rain-forest are presumed to be the \ntraces of these ancient pygmy groups. There is no doubt the  Central  African  rainforest  has  been  occupied  for  a  very  long  time  (Clist  1995;  Mercader  and  Marti  1999), but there is no direct evidence as to the racial or genetic affiliations of  the populations whose stone  tools  have  been  recovered.

Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with [[honey harvesting]], or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western Pygmy groups. This substrate has been suggested as representing a remnant of an ancient \"western Pygmy\" linguistic phylum, dubbed \"Mbenga\" or \"Baaka\". However, as substrate vocabulary has been widely borrowed between Pygmies and neighboring peoples, no reconstruction of such a \"Baaka\" language is possible for times more remote than a few centuries ago.<ref name=Bahuchet>Bahuchet, Serge (1993) \"History of the inhabitants of the central African rain forest: perspectives from comparative linguistics.\" In C.M.

According [[Merritt Ruhlen]] (1994), \"African Pygmies speak languages belonging to either to the [[Nilo-Saharan]] or [[Niger\u2013Kordofanian]] families. It is assumed that Pygmies once spoke their own language(s), but that, through living in symbiosis with other Africans, in prehistorical times, they adopted languages belonging to these two families.\"<ref>Ruhlen, Merritt (1994) ''The Origin of Language: Tracing the Evolution of the Mother Tongue''.

In Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs (eds.), ''Archaeology and language IV'', Routledge, {{ISBN|1134816235}}</ref> He argued that the Pygmies do not form the residue of a single ancient stock of Central African hunter-gatherers, but that they are rather descended from several neighboring ethno-linguistic groups, independently adopting to forest subsistence strategies. Blench adduced the lack of clear linguistic and archaeological evidence for the antiquity the African Pygmies, that the genetic evidence, at the time of writing, was inconclusive, and that there is no evidence of the Pygmies have hunting technology distinctive from that of their neighbors. He argued that the short stature of Pygmy populations can arise relatively quickly (in less than a few millennia) under strong selection pressures.<ref>Blench, Roger. 1999.

It is generally accepted that their small body size is a result of genetic adaptation; however, which genes were selected, and the nature of the underlying selective force(s), remain unknown. The various hypotheses proposed include adaptations to food limitation, thermoregulation, mobility in the forest, and/or short lifespan. A recent study of the HGDP-CEPH populations identified a signal of selection in the insulin growth factor signalling pathway in Biaka Pygmies, which might be associated with short stature, but this signal was not shared with Mbuti Pygmies. By contrast, '''we found strong signals for selection in both African Pygmy groups at two genes involved in the iodide-dependent thyroid hormone pathway: TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies; and IYD in Biaka Pygmies''' (Fig. 7). Intriguingly, a previous study found a significantly lower frequency of goiter in Efe Pygmies (9.4%) than in Lese Bantu farmers (42.9%). The Efe and Lese live in close proximity to one another in the iodine-deficient Ituri Forest and share similar diets. Moreover, the frequency of goiter in Efe women living in Bantu villages was similar to that of Efe women living in the forest, and the frequency of goiter in offspring with an Efe mother and a Lese father was intermediate between that of Efe and Lese.''' These observations suggest that the Efe have adapted genetically to an iodine-deficient diet'''; we suggest that the signals of recent positive selection that we observe at TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies and IYD in Biaka Pygmies may reflect such genetic adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet. '''Furthermore, alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway can cause short stature. We therefore suggest that short stature in these Pygmy groups may have arisen as a consequence of genetic alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway.''' If this scenario is true, then there are two important implications. First, this would suggest that short stature was not selected for directly in the ancestors of Pygmy groups, but rather arose as an indirect consequence of selection in response to an iodine-deficient diet. Second, since different genes in the thyroid hormone pathway show signals of selection in Mbuti vs. Biaka Pygmies, this would suggest that short stature arose independently in the ancestors of Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies, and not in a common ancestral population. '''Moreover, most Pygmy-like groups around the world dwell in tropical forests, and hence are likely to have iodine-deficient diets. The possibility that independent adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet might therefore have contributed to the convergent evolution of the short stature phenotype in Pygmy-like groups around the world deserves further investigation.'''<ref>{{Cite journal\n|vauthors=Price AL, Tandon A, Patterson N, Barnes KC, Rafaels N, Ruczinski I, Beaty TH, Mathias R, Reich D, Myers S | title = Sensitive Detection of Chromosomal Segments of Distinct Ancestry in Admixed Populations\n| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000519\n| journal = PLOS Genetics\n| volume = 5\n| issue = 6\n| pages = e1000519\n| year = 2009\n| pmid = 19543370\n| pmc = 2689842\n}}</ref>}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Pygmy music}}\n[[File:Africa Speaks!

The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups. The Pygmy slaves belong from birth to their Bantu masters in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition. Even though the Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, Pygmies and Bantus alike say Pygmies are often paid at the master's whim; in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all.

One early example was the capture of Pygmy children under the auspices of the Belgian colonial authorities, who exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe, including the world's fair in the United States in 1907.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/>\n\nPygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not considered citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive [[deforestation]] have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished, and abused by the dominant culture.\n\n[[File:Living on the rainforest 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Aka people|Aka Pygmies]] living in the [[Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve]] in Central African Republic]]\nThere are roughly 500,000 Pygmies left in the rain-forest of Central Africa.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> This population is rapidly decreasing as poverty, intermarriage with Bantu peoples, Westernization, and deforestation gradually destroy their way of life and culture along with their [[Racial hygiene|genetic uniqueness]].\n\nThe greatest environmental problem the Pygmies face is the loss of their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to profit from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the Interahamwe, wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy.\n\nAlong with Raja Sheshardi, the fPcN-Global.org website had conducted research on the pygmies. The human rights organization states that as the forest has receded under logging activities, its original inhabitants have been pushed into populated areas to join the formal economy, working as casual laborers or on commercial farms and being exposed to new diseases.<ref name=\"fpcn-global.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516034223/http://www.fpcn-global.org/node/227 Deforestation in central Africa brings HIV/AIDS to indigenous communities, mainly women]. fpcn-global.org. April 6, 2008</ref> This shift has brought them into closer contact with neighboring ethnic communities whose HIV levels are generally higher. This has led to the spread of HIV/AIDS into the pygmy group.\n\nSince poverty has become very prevalent in the Pygmy communities, sexual exploitation of indigenous women has become a common practice. Commercial sex has been bolstered by logging, which often places large groups of male laborers in camps which are set up in close contact with the Pygmy communities.\n\nHuman rights groups have also reported widespread sexual abuse of indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ohenjo | first1 = N.

They would have lived  by  hunting  and  gathering  until  they  encountered  expanding  Central  Sudanic,  Adamawa-Ubangian  and   Bantu-speaking farmers ca. 4000 bp. Since that date they have lived in a symbiosis with the farmers, often as a despised and marginalised group. If this is the case,\n then major MSA archaeological sites in the area of the present-day rain-forest are presumed to be the \ntraces of these ancient pygmy groups. There is no doubt the  Central  African  rainforest  has  been  occupied  for  a  very  long  time  (Clist  1995;  Mercader  and  Marti  1999), but there is no direct evidence as to the racial or genetic affiliations of  the populations whose stone  tools  have  been  recovered.

Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with [[honey harvesting]], or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western Pygmy groups. This substrate has been suggested as representing a remnant of an ancient \"western Pygmy\" linguistic phylum, dubbed \"Mbenga\" or \"Baaka\". However, as substrate vocabulary has been widely borrowed between Pygmies and neighboring peoples, no reconstruction of such a \"Baaka\" language is possible for times more remote than a few centuries ago.<ref name=Bahuchet>Bahuchet, Serge (1993) \"History of the inhabitants of the central African rain forest: perspectives from comparative linguistics.\" In C.M.

According [[Merritt Ruhlen]] (1994), \"African Pygmies speak languages belonging to either to the [[Nilo-Saharan]] or [[Niger\u2013Kordofanian]] families.

It is generally accepted that their small body size is a result of genetic adaptation; however, which genes were selected, and the nature of the underlying selective force(s), remain unknown. The various hypotheses proposed include adaptations to food limitation, thermoregulation, mobility in the forest, and/or short lifespan. A recent study of the HGDP-CEPH populations identified a signal of selection in the insulin growth factor signalling pathway in Biaka Pygmies, which might be associated with short stature, but this signal was not shared with Mbuti Pygmies. By contrast, '''we found strong signals for selection in both African Pygmy groups at two genes involved in the iodide-dependent thyroid hormone pathway: TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies; and IYD in Biaka Pygmies''' (Fig. 7). Intriguingly, a previous study found a significantly lower frequency of goiter in Efe Pygmies (9.4%) than in Lese Bantu farmers (42.9%). The Efe and Lese live in close proximity to one another in the iodine-deficient Ituri Forest and share similar diets. Moreover, the frequency of goiter in Efe women living in Bantu villages was similar to that of Efe women living in the forest, and the frequency of goiter in offspring with an Efe mother and a Lese father was intermediate between that of Efe and Lese.''' These observations suggest that the Efe have adapted genetically to an iodine-deficient diet'''; we suggest that the signals of recent positive selection that we observe at TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies and IYD in Biaka Pygmies may reflect such genetic adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet. '''Furthermore, alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway can cause short stature. We therefore suggest that short stature in these Pygmy groups may have arisen as a consequence of genetic alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway.''' If this scenario is true, then there are two important implications. First, this would suggest that short stature was not selected for directly in the ancestors of Pygmy groups, but rather arose as an indirect consequence of selection in response to an iodine-deficient diet. Second, since different genes in the thyroid hormone pathway show signals of selection in Mbuti vs. Biaka Pygmies, this would suggest that short stature arose independently in the ancestors of Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies, and not in a common ancestral population. '''Moreover, most Pygmy-like groups around the world dwell in tropical forests, and hence are likely to have iodine-deficient diets. The possibility that independent adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet might therefore have contributed to the convergent evolution of the short stature phenotype in Pygmy-like groups around the world deserves further investigation.'''<ref>{{Cite journal\n|vauthors=Price AL, Tandon A, Patterson N, Barnes KC, Rafaels N, Ruczinski I, Beaty TH, Mathias R, Reich D, Myers S | title = Sensitive Detection of Chromosomal Segments of Distinct Ancestry in Admixed Populations\n| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000519\n| journal = PLOS Genetics\n| volume = 5\n| issue = 6\n| pages = e1000519\n| year = 2009\n| pmid = 19543370\n| pmc = 2689842\n}}</ref>}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Pygmy music}}\n[[File:Africa Speaks!

The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups. The Pygmy slaves belong from birth to their Bantu masters in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition. Even though the Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, Pygmies and Bantus alike say Pygmies are often paid at the master's whim; in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all.

One early example was the capture of Pygmy children under the auspices of the Belgian colonial authorities, who exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe, including the world's fair in the United States in 1907.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/>\n\nPygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not considered citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive [[deforestation]] have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished, and abused by the dominant culture.\n\n[[File:Living on the rainforest 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Aka people|Aka Pygmies]] living in the [[Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve]] in Central African Republic]]\nThere are roughly 500,000 Pygmies left in the rain-forest of Central Africa.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> This population is rapidly decreasing as poverty, intermarriage with Bantu peoples, Westernization, and deforestation gradually destroy their way of life and culture along with their [[Racial hygiene|genetic uniqueness]].\n\nThe greatest environmental problem the Pygmies face is the loss of their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to profit from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the Interahamwe, wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy.\n\nAlong with Raja Sheshardi, the fPcN-Global.org website had conducted research on the pygmies. The human rights organization states that as the forest has receded under logging activities, its original inhabitants have been pushed into populated areas to join the formal economy, working as casual laborers or on commercial farms and being exposed to new diseases.<ref name=\"fpcn-global.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516034223/http://www.fpcn-global.org/node/227 Deforestation in central Africa brings HIV/AIDS to indigenous communities, mainly women]. fpcn-global.org. April 6, 2008</ref> This shift has brought them into closer contact with neighboring ethnic communities whose HIV levels are generally higher. This has led to the spread of HIV/AIDS into the pygmy group.\n\nSince poverty has become very prevalent in the Pygmy communities, sexual exploitation of indigenous women has become a common practice. Commercial sex has been bolstered by logging, which often places large groups of male laborers in camps which are set up in close contact with the Pygmy communities.\n\nHuman rights groups have also reported widespread sexual abuse of indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ohenjo | first1 = N.
