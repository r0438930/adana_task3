As it was expected by Qaplan Giray, in [[Russo-Turkish War (1735\u20131739)|1736 the Russian army invaded]] the Crimea, led by [[Burkhard Christoph von M\u00fcnnich|M\u00fcnnich]], devastated the peninsula, killed civilians and destroyed all major cities, burning the [[Bakhchisaray Palace|Khan's palace]] with all the archives and documents, and then left the Crimea because of the epidemic that had begun in it. One year after the same was done by another Russian general \u2014 [[Peter Lacy]].<ref>Gayvoronsky, 2007</ref> Since then, the Crimean Khanate had not been able to recover, and its slow decline began. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1768 to 1774 resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans by the Russians, and according to the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] (1774) signed after the war, Crimea became independent and the Ottomans renounced their political right to protect the Crimean Khanate. After a period of political unrest in Crimea, [[Imperial Russia]] violated the treaty and [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed the Crimean Khanate]] in 1783.\n\n[[File:Tragedy of Qarasuvbazar.jpg|thumb|Abandoned houses in [[Qarasuvbazar]].]]\nDue to the oppression of the Russian administration, the Crimean Tatars were forced to immigrate to the Ottoman Empire. In total, from 1783 to the beginning of the 20th century, at least 800 thousand Tatars left Crimea. In 1917, the Crimean Tatars, in an effort to recreate their statehood, announced the [[Crimean People's Republic]] \u2014 the first democratic republic in the Muslim world, where all peoples were equal in rights. The head of the republic was the young politician [[Noman \u00c7elebicihan]]. However, a few months later the [[Bolsheviks]] captured Crimea, and \u00c7elebicihan was killed without trial and thrown into the Black Sea.\n\nIn May 1944, the USSR State Defense Committee [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|ordered the deportation of all of the Crimean Tatars from Crimea]], including the families of Crimean Tatars serving in the Soviet Army. The deportees were transported in trains and boxcars to Central Asia, primarily to Uzbekistan. Starting in 1967, some were allowed to return, and in 1989 the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] condemned the [[ethnic cleansing|removal of Crimean Tatars from their motherland]] as inhumane and lawless. Today, Crimean Tatars constitute approximately 12% of the population of Crimea. There remains a [[Crimean Tatar diaspora|large diaspora]] in [[Turkey]] and [[Uzbekistan]].\n\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435_\u0438_\u044e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435_\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435_\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b.jpg|thumb|Crimean Tatar groups.]]\nNowadays, the Crimean Tatars comprise three sub-ethnic groups:\n* the Tats (not to be confused with [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]], living in the Caucasus region) who used to inhabit the [[Crimean Mountains]] before 1944\n* the [[Yal\u0131boylu]] who lived on the southern coast of the peninsula\n* the [[No\u011fay]]s who used to live in the northern part of the Crimea\n\n====Crimean Tatars in Romania and Bulgaria====\n{{further|Tatars of Romania|Crimean Tatars in Romania|Crimean Tatars in Bulgaria}}\nSome Crimean Tatars have lived in the territory of today's [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] since the 13th century. In Romania, according to the 2002 census, 24,000 people declared their ethnicity as Tatar, most of them being Crimean Tatars living in [[Constan\u021ba County]] in the region of [[Dobrogea]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] re-settled Crimean Tatars there as colonists by the beginning in the 17th century.\n\n===Lipka Tatars===\n{{main|Lipka Tatars}}\n[[File:Battle of Warsaw 1656.PNG|thumb| Swedish King [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]] in a skirmish with Tatars near [[Warsaw]] during the [[Second Northern War]] of 1655\u20131660.]]\n\nThe Lipka Tatars are a group of [[Turkic languages| Turkic-speaking]] Tatars who originally settled in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] at the beginning of the 14th century. The first settlers tried to preserve their [[shamanistic]] religion and sought asylum amongst the non-Christian Lithuanians.<ref name=\"galve.lt\">{{in lang|lt}} [http://www.galve.lt/lt/numeriai/2007062225/Trakai%20ir%20pasaulio%20paveldas/koranas Lietuvos totoriai ir j\u0173 \u0161ventoji knyga \u2013 Koranas] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071029035259/http://www.galve.lt/lt/numeriai/2007062225/Trakai%20ir%20pasaulio%20paveldas/koranas |date= 2007-10-29 }}</ref> Towards the end of the 14th century Grand Duke [[Vytautas the Great]] of Lithuania (ruled 1392\u20131430) invited another wave of Tatars \u2014Muslims, this time\u2014 into the Grand Duchy. These Tatars first settled in [[Lithuania proper]] around [[Vilnius]], [[Trakai]], [[Hrodna]] and [[Kaunas]]<ref name=\"galve.lt\"/> and spread to other parts of the Grand Duchy that later became part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569. These areas comprise parts of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and [[Poland]]. From the very beginning of their settlement in Lithuania they were known as the Lipka Tatars.\n\nFrom the 13th to 17th centuries various groups of Tatars settled and/or found refuge within the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Grand Dukes of Lithuania especially promoted the migrations because of the Tatars' reputation as skilled warriors. The Tatar settlers were all granted ''[[szlachta]]'' (nobility) status, a tradition that survived until the end of the Commonwealth in the late-18th century. Such migrants included the [[Lipka Tatars]] (13th\u201314th centuries) as well as Crimean and [[Nogai people |Nogay]] Tatars (15th\u201316th centuries), all of which were notable in Polish military history, as well as [[Volga Tatars]] (16th\u201317th centuries). They all mostly settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\n[[File:Tatar attack warsawa 1656.jpg|thumb| At the [[Battle of Warsaw (1656)|Battle of Warsaw]] in 1656 Tatars fought with the Poles against the Swedes]]\n\nVarious estimates of the Tatars in the Commonwealth in the 17th century place their numbers at about 15,000 persons and 60 villages with mosques. Numerous royal privileges, as well as internal autonomy granted by the monarchs, allowed the Tatars to preserve their religion, traditions, and culture over the centuries. The Tatars were allowed to [[Interethnic marriage| intermarry]] with Christians,a practice uncommon in Europe at the time. The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791 |May Constitution]] of 1791 gave the Tatars representation in the Polish [[Sejm of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth | Sejm]] (parliament).\n\nAlthough by the 18th century the Tatars had adopted the local language, the Islamic religion and many Tatar traditions (e.g. the sacrifice of bulls in their mosques during the main religious festivals) survived. This led to the formation of a distinctive Muslim culture, in which the elements of Muslim orthodoxy mixed with religious tolerance formed a relatively liberal society. For instance, the women in Lipka Tatar society traditionally had the same rights and status as men, and could attend non-segregated schools.\n\n[[File:Tartares lituaniens (par Richard Kn\u00f6tel).jpg|thumb|[[Lithuanian Tartars of the Imperial Guard]] at the charge, by [[Richard Kn\u00f6tel]]]]\nAbout 5,500 Tatars lived within the inter-war boundaries of [[Second Polish Republic | Poland]] (1920\u20131939), and a Tatar cavalry unit had fought for the country's independence. The Tatars had preserved their cultural identity and sustained a number of Tatar organisations, including Tatar archives and a museum in [[Vilnius]].\n\nThe Tatars suffered serious losses during [[World War II]] and furthermore, after the [[Polish\u2013Soviet border agreement of August 1945 | border change in 1945]], a large part of them found themselves in the [[Soviet Union]]. It is estimated{{by whom?|date=August 2019}} that about 3000 Tatars live in present-day Poland, of which about 500 declared Tatar (rather than Polish) nationality in the 2002 census. There are two Tatar villages ([[Bohoniki]] and [[Kruszyniany]]) in the north-east of present-day Poland, as well as urban Tatar communities in [[Warsaw]], [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Bia\u0142ystok]], and [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]]. Tatars in Poland sometimes have a Muslim surname with a Polish ending: ''Ryzwanowicz''; another surname sometimes adopted by more assimilated Tatars is ''Tatara'' or ''Tataranowicz'' or ''Taterczy\u0144ski'', which literally mean \"son of a Tatar\".\n\nThe Tatars played a relatively prominent role for such a small community in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth military as well as in Polish and Lithuanian political and intellectual life.{{Citation needed|date= April 2007}} In modern-day Poland, their presence is also widely known, due in part to their noticeable role in the historical novels of [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] (1846\u20131916), which are universally recognized in Poland. A number of Polish intellectual figures have also been Tatars, e.g. the prominent historian [[Jerzy \u0141ojek]].\n\nA small community of Polish-speaking Tatars settled in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], in the early-20th century. They established a mosque that remained in use {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}.<ref>\n[https://www.rferl.org/a/lipka-tatar-community-brooklyn-poland-baltic/28513760.html Amid Tatar Renaissance In Europe, An American Mosque Turns To Its Roots] - \"A Lipka Tatar -- a Muslim ethnic group native to the Baltic region -- Jakub Szynkiewicz was selected to be Poland's first mufti in 1925, around the time that his community's U.S. diaspora was moving into the very mosque in Brooklyn where his portrait still hangs.\"\n</ref>\n\n===Astrakhan Tatars===\n{{main|Astrakhan Tatars}}\n[[File:Grigory Gagarin.

In the [[Russian Census (2010)| Russian census in 2010]], most Astrakhan Tatars declared themselves simply as Tatars and few declared themselves as Astrakhan Tatars.

You do not have the right to interfere in them\"''<ref>[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Krym/XV/Rozovyj_kust_chanov/24.phtml?id=12944 Halim Giray], 1822 {{ref-ru}}</ref>. [[Treaty of the Pruth]] was signed, and 10 years later, Russia declared itself an empire. In 1736, the Crimean Khan [[Qaplan I Giray]] was summoned by the Turkish Sultan to Persia. Understanding that Russia could take advantage of the lack of troops in Crimea, Qaplan Giray wrote to the Sultan that he could not go to Persia, but the Sultan was persistent. As it was expected by Qaplan Giray, in [[Russo-Turkish War (1735\u20131739)|1736 the Russian army invaded]] the Crimea, led by [[Burkhard Christoph von M\u00fcnnich|M\u00fcnnich]], devastated the peninsula, killed civilians and destroyed all major cities, burning the [[Bakhchisaray Palace|Khan's palace]] with all the archives and documents, and then left the Crimea because of the epidemic that had begun in it. One year after the same was done by another Russian general \u2014 [[Peter Lacy]]. Since then, the Crimean Khanate had not been able to recover, and its slow decline began. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1768 to 1774 resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans by the Russians, and according to the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] (1774) signed after the war, Crimea became independent and the Ottomans renounced their political right to protect the Crimean Khanate. After a period of political unrest in Crimea, [[Imperial Russia]] violated the treaty and [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed the Crimean Khanate]] in 1783.\n\n[[File:Tragedy of Qarasuvbazar.jpg|thumb|Abandoned houses in [[Qarasuvbazar]].]]\nDue to the oppression of the Russian administration, the Crimean Tatars were forced to immigrate to the Ottoman Empire. In total, from 1783 to the beginning of the 20th century, at least 800 thousand Tatars left Crimea. In 1917, the Crimean Tatars, in an effort to recreate their statehood, announced the [[Crimean People's Republic]] \u2014 the first democratic republic in the Muslim world, where all peoples were equal in rights. The head of the republic was the young politician [[Noman \u00c7elebicihan]]. However, a few months later the Bolsheviks captured the Crimea, and \u00c7elebicihan was killed  without trial and thrown into the Black Sea.\n\nIn May 1944, the USSR State Defense Committee [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|ordered the deportation of all of the Crimean Tatars from Crimea]], including the families of Crimean Tatars serving in the Soviet Army. The deportees were transported in trains and boxcars to Central Asia, primarily to Uzbekistan. Starting in 1967, some were allowed to return, and in 1989 the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] condemned the [[ethnic cleansing|removal of Crimean Tatars from their motherland]] as inhumane and lawless. Today, Crimean Tatars constitute approximately 12% of the population of Crimea. There remains a [[Crimean Tatar diaspora|large diaspora]] in [[Turkey]] and [[Uzbekistan]].\n\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435_\u0438_\u044e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435_\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435_\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b.jpg|thumb|Crimean Tatar groups.]]\nNowadays, the Crimean Tatars comprise three sub-ethnic groups:\n* the Tats (not to be confused with [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]], living in the Caucasus region) who used to inhabit the [[Crimean Mountains]] before 1944\n* the [[Yal\u0131boylu]] who lived on the southern coast of the peninsula\n* the [[No\u011fay]]s who used to live in the northern part of the Crimea\n\n====Crimean Tatars in Romania and Bulgaria====\n{{further|Tatars of Romania|Crimean Tatars in Romania|Crimean Tatars in Bulgaria}}\nSome Crimean Tatars have lived in the territory of today's [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] since the 13th century. In Romania, according to the 2002 census, 24,000 people declared their ethnicity as Tatar, most of them being Crimean Tatars living in [[Constan\u021ba County]] in the region of [[Dobrogea]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] re-settled Crimean Tatars there as colonists by the beginning in the 17th century.\n\n===Lipka Tatars===\n{{main|Lipka Tatars}}\n[[File:Battle of Warsaw 1656.PNG|thumb| Swedish King [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]] in a skirmish with Tatars near [[Warsaw]] during the [[Second Northern War]] of 1655\u20131660.]]\n\nThe Lipka Tatars are a group of [[Turkic languages| Turkic-speaking]] Tatars who originally settled in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] at the beginning of the 14th century. The first settlers tried to preserve their [[shamanistic]] religion and sought asylum amongst the non-Christian Lithuanians.<ref name=\"galve.lt\">{{in lang|lt}} [http://www.galve.lt/lt/numeriai/2007062225/Trakai%20ir%20pasaulio%20paveldas/koranas Lietuvos totoriai ir j\u0173 \u0161ventoji knyga \u2013 Koranas] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071029035259/http://www.galve.lt/lt/numeriai/2007062225/Trakai%20ir%20pasaulio%20paveldas/koranas |date= 2007-10-29 }}</ref> Towards the end of the 14th century Grand Duke [[Vytautas the Great]] of Lithuania (ruled 1392\u20131430) invited another wave of Tatars \u2014Muslims, this time\u2014 into the Grand Duchy. These Tatars first settled in [[Lithuania proper]] around [[Vilnius]], [[Trakai]], [[Hrodna]] and [[Kaunas]]<ref name=\"galve.lt\"/> and spread to other parts of the Grand Duchy that later became part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569. These areas comprise parts of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and [[Poland]]. From the very beginning of their settlement in Lithuania they were known as the Lipka Tatars.\n\nFrom the 13th to 17th centuries various groups of Tatars settled and/or found refuge within the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Grand Dukes of Lithuania especially promoted the migrations because of the Tatars' reputation as skilled warriors. The Tatar settlers were all granted ''[[szlachta]]'' (nobility) status, a tradition that survived until the end of the Commonwealth in the late-18th century. Such migrants included the [[Lipka Tatars]] (13th\u201314th centuries) as well as Crimean and [[Nogai people |Nogay]] Tatars (15th\u201316th centuries), all of which were notable in Polish military history, as well as [[Volga Tatars]] (16th\u201317th centuries). They all mostly settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\n[[File:Tatar attack warsawa 1656.jpg|thumb| At the [[Battle of Warsaw (1656)|Battle of Warsaw]] in 1656 Tatars fought with the Poles against the Swedes]]\n\nVarious estimates of the Tatars in the Commonwealth in the 17th century place their numbers at about 15,000 persons and 60 villages with mosques. Numerous royal privileges, as well as internal autonomy granted by the monarchs, allowed the Tatars to preserve their religion, traditions, and culture over the centuries. The Tatars were allowed to [[Interethnic marriage| intermarry]] with Christians,a practice uncommon in Europe at the time. The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791 |May Constitution]] of 1791 gave the Tatars representation in the Polish [[Sejm of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth | Sejm]] (parliament).\n\nAlthough by the 18th century the Tatars had adopted the local language, the Islamic religion and many Tatar traditions (e.g. the sacrifice of bulls in their mosques during the main religious festivals) survived. This led to the formation of a distinctive Muslim culture, in which the elements of Muslim orthodoxy mixed with religious tolerance formed a relatively liberal society. For instance, the women in Lipka Tatar society traditionally had the same rights and status as men, and could attend non-segregated schools.\n\n[[File:Tartares lituaniens (par Richard Kn\u00f6tel).jpg|thumb|[[Lithuanian Tartars of the Imperial Guard]] at the charge, by [[Richard Kn\u00f6tel]]]]\nAbout 5,500 Tatars lived within the inter-war boundaries of [[Second Polish Republic | Poland]] (1920\u20131939), and a Tatar cavalry unit had fought for the country's independence. The Tatars had preserved their cultural identity and sustained a number of Tatar organisations, including Tatar archives and a museum in [[Vilnius]].\n\nThe Tatars suffered serious losses during [[World War II]] and furthermore, after the [[Polish\u2013Soviet border agreement of August 1945 | border change in 1945]], a large part of them found themselves in the [[Soviet Union]]. It is estimated{{by whom?|date=August 2019}} that about 3000 Tatars live in present-day Poland, of which about 500 declared Tatar (rather than Polish) nationality in the 2002 census. There are two Tatar villages ([[Bohoniki]] and [[Kruszyniany]]) in the north-east of present-day Poland, as well as urban Tatar communities in [[Warsaw]], [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Bia\u0142ystok]], and [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]]. Tatars in Poland sometimes have a Muslim surname with a Polish ending: ''Ryzwanowicz''; another surname sometimes adopted by more assimilated Tatars is ''Tatara'' or ''Tataranowicz'' or ''Taterczy\u0144ski'', which literally mean \"son of a Tatar\".\n\nThe Tatars played a relatively prominent role for such a small community in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth military as well as in Polish and Lithuanian political and intellectual life.{{Citation needed|date= April 2007}} In modern-day Poland, their presence is also widely known, due in part to their noticeable role in the historical novels of [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] (1846\u20131916), which are universally recognized in Poland. A number of Polish intellectual figures have also been Tatars, e.g. the prominent historian [[Jerzy \u0141ojek]].\n\nA small community of Polish-speaking Tatars settled in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], in the early-20th century. They established a mosque that remained in use {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}.<ref>\n[https://www.rferl.org/a/lipka-tatar-community-brooklyn-poland-baltic/28513760.html Amid Tatar Renaissance In Europe, An American Mosque Turns To Its Roots] - \"A Lipka Tatar -- a Muslim ethnic group native to the Baltic region -- Jakub Szynkiewicz was selected to be Poland's first mufti in 1925, around the time that his community's U.S. diaspora was moving into the very mosque in Brooklyn where his portrait still hangs.\"\n</ref>\n\n===Astrakhan Tatars===\n{{main|Astrakhan Tatars}}\n[[File:Grigory Gagarin.

In the [[Russian Census (2010)| Russian census in 2010]], most Astrakhan Tatars declared themselves simply as Tatars and few declared themselves as Astrakhan Tatars.

Data on restriction-deletion polymorphism of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) also indicated an increased Caucasoid contribution to Mordovian, Udmurt, and Komi gene pools and an increased Mongoloid component in Chuvashes and Volga Tatars.
