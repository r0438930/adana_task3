Iwerks produced alongside [[Walt Disney]] and won numerous awards, including multiple [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Early life==\nIwerks was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. His father, Eert Ubbe Iwwerks, was born in the village of Uttum in [[East Frisia]] (northwest [[Germany]], today part of the municipality of [[Krummh\u00f6rn]]) and immigrated to the United States in 1869. The elder Iwwerks, who worked as a barber, was 57 when Ub was born and had fathered and abandoned several previous children and wives of his. When Ub was a teenager, he abandoned him as well, forcing the boy to drop out of school and work to support his mother. Iwerks despised his father and never spoke of him--upon learning that he had died, he reportedly said \"Throw him in a ditch.\" Ub's full name, Ubbe Ert Iwwerks, can be seen on early ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' that he signed. Several years later he simplified his name to \"Ub Iwerks\", sometimes written as \"U. B. Iwerks\".<ref>For example in the opening credits of ''[[Little Black Sambo (cartoon)|Little Black Sambo]]'' (1935).</ref>\n\nHe is the father of [[Disney Legend]] [[Don Iwerks]] and grandfather of [[documentary film]] producer [[Leslie Iwerks]].\n\n==Career==\nIwerks was considered by many to be Walt Disney's oldest friend and spent most of his career with Disney. The two met in 1919 while working for the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio in Kansas City,<ref name=\"gabler46\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 46.</ref> and eventually started their own commercial art business together.<ref name=\"gabler47\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), pp. 47\u201350.</ref> Disney and Iwerks then found work as illustrators for the Kansas City Slide Newspaper Company<ref name=\"gabler50\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 50.</ref> (which was later named The Kansas City Film Ad Company).<ref name=\"gabler56\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 56.</ref> While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, Disney decided to take up work in animation,<ref name=\"gabler58\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 58.</ref> and Iwerks soon joined him.\n\nHe was responsible for the distinctive style of the earliest Disney [[animated cartoon]]s, and was also responsible for designing Mickey Mouse.<ref name=\"Maltin, L. 1987\">Maltin, L. (1987). ''Of mice and magic: A history of American animated cartoons'' (Rev. ed.). New York: New American Library.</ref> In 1922, when Disney began his [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio|Laugh-O-Gram]] cartoon series, Iwerks joined him as chief animator. The studio went bankrupt, however, and in 1923 Iwerks followed Disney's move to Los Angeles to work on a new series of cartoons known as \u201cthe [[Alice Comedies]]\u201d which had live-action mixed with animation. After the end of this series, Disney asked Iwerks to design a character that became [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]. The first cartoon Oswald starred in was animated entirely by Iwerks. Following the first cartoon, Oswald was redesigned on the insistence of Oswald\u2019s owner and the distributor of the cartoons, Universal Pictures. The production company at the time, Winkler Pictures, gave additional input on the character\u2019s design.\n\nIn spring 1928, Disney was removed from the Oswald series, and much of his staff was hired away to Winkler Pictures. He promised to never again work with a character he did not own.<ref name=\"gabler109\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 109.</ref> Disney asked Iwerks, who stayed on, to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of frogs, dogs, and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were created at this time by Iwerks, but were also rejected. They later turned up as [[Clarabelle Cow]] and [[Horace Horsecollar]].<ref>Kenworthy, John; ''The Hand Behind the Mouse,'' Disney Editions: New York, 2001. p. 53.</ref> Ub Iwerks eventually got inspiration from an old drawing. In 1925, [[Hugh Harman]] drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney. Then, on a train ride back from a failed business meeting, Walt Disney came up with the original sketch for the character that was eventually called [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref>Kenworthy, John; ''The Hand Behind the Mouse,'' Disney Editions: New York, 2001. p. 54.</ref> Afterward, Disney took the sketch to Iwerks. In turn, he drew a more clean-cut and refined version of Mickey, but one that still followed the original sketch.\n\nThe first few Mickey Mouse and [[Silly Symphonies]] cartoons were animated almost entirely by Iwerks, including ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' and ''[[The Skeleton Dance]]''.<ref name=\"Maltin, L. 1987\"/> However, as Iwerks began to draw more and more cartoons on a daily basis, he chafed under Disney's dictatorial rule.<ref name=\"gabler143\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 143.</ref> Iwerks also felt he wasn't getting the credit he deserved for drawing all of Disney's successful cartoons.<ref name=\"gabler144\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 144.</ref> Eventually, Iwerks and Disney had a falling out; their friendship and working partnership were severed in January 1930. According to an unconfirmed account, a child approached Disney and Iwerks at a party and asked for a picture of Mickey to be drawn on a napkin, to which Disney handed the pen and paper to Iwerks and stated, \"Draw it.\" Iwerks became furious and threw the pen and paper, storming out.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Iwerks accepted a contract with Disney competitor [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]] to leave Disney and start an animation studio under his own name. His last ''Mickey Mouse'' cartoon was ''[[The Cactus Kid (1930 film)|The Cactus Kid]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=J.B. |last2=Gerstein |first2=David |title=Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse: The Ultimate History |date=2018 |publisher=Taschen |location=Cologne |isbn=978-3-8365-5284-4 |page=53}}</ref> (Powers and Disney had an earlier falling-out over Disney's use of the Powers Cinephone [[sound-on-film]] system\u2014actually copied by Powers from [[Lee De Forest|DeForest]] [[Phonofilm]] without credit\u2014in early Disney cartoons.)\n\n[[File:Sinbadthesailor01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Sinbad the Sailor (1935 film)|Sinbad the Sailor]]'']]\nThe Iwerks Studio opened in 1930. Financial backers led by Pat Powers suspected that Iwerks was responsible for much of Disney's early success. However, while animation for a time suffered at Disney from Iwerks' departure, it soon rebounded as Disney brought in talented new young animators.\n\nDespite a contract with MGM to distribute his cartoons, and the introduction of a new character named \u201c[[Flip the Frog]]\u201d, and later \u201c[[Willie Whopper]]\u201d, the Iwerks Studio was never a major commercial success and failed to rival either Disney or [[Fleischer Studios]].  Newly-hired animator Fred Kopietz recommended that Iwerks employ a friend from Chouinard Art School, [[Chuck Jones]], who was hired and put  to work as a cel washer.<ref name=\"Maltin, L. 1987\" />  The Flip and Willie cartoons were later distributed on the home-movie market{{clarification needed| date= March 2019}} by [[Official Films]] in the 1940s. From 1933 to 1936, he produced a series of shorts (independently distributed, not part of the MGM deal) in [[Cinecolor]], named ''[[ComiColor Cartoons]]''. The ComiColor series mostly focused on fairy tales with no continuing character or star. Later in the 1940s, this series received home-movie distribution by [[Castle Films]]. Cinecolor produced the 16&nbsp;mm prints for Castle Films with red emulsion on one side and blue emulsion on the other. Later in the 1970s [[Blackhawk Films]] released these for home use, but this time using conventional Eastmancolor film stock. They are now in the public domain and are available on VHS and DVD. He also experimented with stop-motion animation in combination with the [[multiplane camera]], and made a short called ''The Toy Parade'', which was never released in public.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LEy50gAEhpgC&pg=PA62&dq=unreleased+film+Toy+Parade&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DYECU8i-NcPnywPym4DwBQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=unreleased%20film%20Toy%20Parade&f=false The Mouse Machine: Disney and Technology]</ref> In 1936, backers withdrew financial support from the Iwerks Studio, and it folded soon after.\n\nIn 1937, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]] contracted Iwerks to produce four ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' shorts starring [[Porky Pig]] and [[Gabby Goat]]. Iwerks directed the first two shorts, while former Schlesinger animator [[Robert Clampett]] was promoted to director and helmed the other two shorts before he and his unit returned to the main Schlesinger lot. Iwerks then did contract work for [[Screen Gems]] (then [[Columbia Pictures]]' cartoon division)  where he was the director of several of the ''[[Color Rhapsodies]]'' shorts before returning to work for Disney in 1940.\n\nAfter his return to the Disney studio, Iwerks mainly worked on developing [[special effects|special visual effects]]. He is credited as developing the processes for combining live-action and animation used in ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), as well as the [[Xerography|xerographic]] process adapted for cel animation. He also worked at WED Enterprises, now [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], helping to develop many Disney theme park attractions during the 1960s. Iwerks did special effects work outside the studio as well, including his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated achievement for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).\n\nIwerks' most famous work{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} outside creating and animating Mickey Mouse was Flip the Frog from his own studio. According to Chuck Jones, who worked for him, \"He was the first, if not the first, to give his characters depth and roundness. But he had no concept of humor; he simply wasn't a funny guy.\"\n\n==Death==\nIwerks died in 1971 of a [[heart attack]] in [[Burbank, California]], aged 70, and his ashes interred in a niche in the Columbarium of Remembrance at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]].\n\n==Influence and tributes==\nThe ''Ub Iwerks Award for Technical Achievement'', as part of the [[Annie Award]]s, is named in his honour.\n\nA rare self-portrait of Iwerks was found in the garbage bin at an animation studio in Burbank. The portrait was saved and is now part of the [[ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive Project|Animation Archives]] in Burbank, California.\n\nAfter the Second World War, much of Iwerks' early animation style was imitated by legendary [[manga]] artists [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Sh\u014dtar\u014d Ishinomori]].\n\nIn 1989, Iwerks was named a [[Disney Legend]].\n\nIn the 1996 ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[The Day the Violence Died]]\", a relationship similar to Iwerks' early relationship with [[Walt Disney]] is used as the main plot.\n\nA documentary film, ''The Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story'', was released in 1999, followed by a book written by Iwerks' granddaughter [[Leslie Iwerks]] and John Kenworthy in 2001. The documentary, created by Leslie Iwerks, was released as part of [[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Seven|The Walt Disney Treasures, Wave VII series]] (disc two of The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit collection).\n\nA feature film released in 2014 ''[[Walt Before Mickey]]'', showed how Ub Iwerks, portrayed by [[Armando Gutierrez]], and Walt Disney, portrayed by [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], co-created Mickey Mouse.\n\nThe sixth episode from the second season of ''[[Drunk History]]'' (\"Hollywood\"), tells about Ub's work relationship with Disney, with stress on the creation of [[Mickey Mouse]]. Iwerks was portrayed in the episode by [[Tony Hale]].\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===1930===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Release Date\n!Series\n!Notes\n|-\n|''[[Fiddlesticks (film)|Fiddlesticks]]''\n|8/16/1930\n|[[Flip the Frog]]\n|\u2022 First cartoon by Ub Iwerks.<br>\u2022 First Flip the Frog cartoon.<br>\u2022 Filmed in two-strip Technicolor.\n|-\n|''Little Orphan Willie''\n|10/18/1930\n|Flip the Frog\n| \n|-\n|''Flying Fists''\n|9/6/1930\n|Flip the Frog\n|\u2022 Many sources claim that FF was filmed in two-strip Technicolor like ''Fiddlesticks'', though this is incorrect.\n|-\n|''The Village Barber''\n|9/27/1930\n|Flip the Frog\n|\u2022 First non-woodland cartoon.\n|-\n|''The Cuckoo Murder Case''\n|10/18/1930\n|Flip the Frog\n|\u2022 First Halloween-themed cartoon.<br>\u2022 First time a curse word is heard.

Iwerks produced alongside [[Walt Disney]] and won numerous awards, including multiple [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Early life==\nIwerks was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. His father, Eert Ubbe Iwwerks, was born in the village of Uttum in [[East Frisia]] (northwest [[Germany]], today part of the municipality of [[Krummh\u00f6rn]]) and immigrated to the United States in 1869. The elder Iwwerks, who worked as a barber, was 57 when Ub was born and had fathered and abandoned several previous children and wives of his. When Ub was a teenager, he abandoned him as well, forcing the boy to drop out of school and work to support his mother. Iwerks despised his father and never spoke of him--upon learning that he had died, he reportedly said \"Throw him in a ditch.\" Ub's full name, Ubbe Ert Iwwerks, can be seen on early ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' that he signed. Several years later he simplified his name to \"Ub Iwerks\", sometimes written as \"U. B. Iwerks\".<ref>For example in the opening credits of ''[[Little Black Sambo (cartoon)|Little Black Sambo]]'' (1935).</ref>\n\nHe is the father of [[Disney Legend]] [[Don Iwerks]] and grandfather of [[documentary film]] producer [[Leslie Iwerks]].\n\n==Career==\nIwerks was considered by many to be Walt Disney's oldest friend and spent most of his career with Disney. The two met in 1919 while working for the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio in Kansas City,<ref name=\"gabler46\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 46.</ref> and eventually started their own commercial art business together.<ref name=\"gabler47\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), pp. 47\u201350.</ref> Disney and Iwerks then found work as illustrators for the Kansas City Slide Newspaper Company<ref name=\"gabler50\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 50.</ref> (which was later named The Kansas City Film Ad Company).<ref name=\"gabler56\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 56.</ref> While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, Disney decided to take up work in animation,<ref name=\"gabler58\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 58.</ref> and Iwerks soon joined him.\n\nHe was responsible for the distinctive style of the earliest Disney [[animated cartoon]]s, and was also responsible for designing Mickey Mouse.<ref name=\"Maltin, L. 1987\">Maltin, L. (1987). ''Of mice and magic: A history of American animated cartoons'' (Rev. ed.). New York: New American Library.</ref> In 1922, when Disney began his [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio|Laugh-O-Gram]] cartoon series, Iwerks joined him as chief animator. The studio went bankrupt, however, and in 1923 Iwerks followed Disney's move to Los Angeles to work on a new series of cartoons known as \u201cthe [[Alice Comedies]]\u201d which had live-action mixed with animation. After the end of this series, Disney asked Iwerks to design a character that became [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]. The first cartoon Oswald starred in was animated entirely by Iwerks. Following the first cartoon, Oswald was redesigned on the insistence of Oswald\u2019s owner and the distributor of the cartoons, Universal Pictures. The production company at the time, Winkler Pictures, gave additional input on the character\u2019s design.\n\nIn spring 1928, Disney was removed from the Oswald series, and much of his staff was hired away to Winkler Pictures. He promised to never again work with a character he did not own.<ref name=\"gabler109\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 109.</ref> Disney asked Iwerks, who stayed on, to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of frogs, dogs, and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were created at this time by Iwerks, but were also rejected. They later turned up as [[Clarabelle Cow]] and [[Horace Horsecollar]].<ref>Kenworthy, John; ''The Hand Behind the Mouse,'' Disney Editions: New York, 2001. p. 53.</ref> Ub Iwerks eventually got inspiration from an old drawing. In 1925, [[Hugh Harman]] drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney. Then, on a train ride back from a failed business meeting, Walt Disney came up with the original sketch for the character that was eventually called [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref>Kenworthy, John; ''The Hand Behind the Mouse,'' Disney Editions: New York, 2001. p. 54.</ref> Afterward, Disney took the sketch to Iwerks. In turn, he drew a more clean-cut and refined version of Mickey, but one that still followed the original sketch.\n\nThe first few Mickey Mouse and [[Silly Symphonies]] cartoons were animated almost entirely by Iwerks, including ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' and ''[[The Skeleton Dance]]''.<ref name=\"Maltin, L. 1987\"/> However, as Iwerks began to draw more and more cartoons on a daily basis, he chafed under Disney's dictatorial rule.<ref name=\"gabler143\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 143.</ref> Iwerks also felt he wasn't getting the credit he deserved for drawing all of Disney's successful cartoons.<ref name=\"gabler144\">Neal Gabler, ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (2006), p. 144.</ref> Eventually, Iwerks and Disney had a falling out; their friendship and working partnership were severed in January 1930. According to an unconfirmed account, a child approached Disney and Iwerks at a party and asked for a picture of Mickey to be drawn on a napkin, to which Disney handed the pen and paper to Iwerks and stated, \"Draw it.\" Iwerks became furious and threw the pen and paper, storming out.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Iwerks accepted a contract with Disney competitor [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]] to leave Disney and start an animation studio under his own name. His last ''Mickey Mouse'' cartoon was ''[[The Cactus Kid (1930 film)|The Cactus Kid]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=J.B. |last2=Gerstein |first2=David |title=Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse: The Ultimate History |date=2018 |publisher=Taschen |location=Cologne |isbn=978-3-8365-5284-4 |page=53}}</ref> (Powers and Disney had an earlier falling-out over Disney's use of the Powers Cinephone [[sound-on-film]] system\u2014actually copied by Powers from [[Lee De Forest|DeForest]] [[Phonofilm]] without credit\u2014in early Disney cartoons.)\n\n[[File:Sinbadthesailor01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Sinbad the Sailor (1935 film)|Sinbad the Sailor]]'']]\nThe Iwerks Studio opened in 1930. Financial backers led by Pat Powers suspected that Iwerks was responsible for much of Disney's early success. However, while animation for a time suffered at Disney from Iwerks' departure, it soon rebounded as Disney brought in talented new young animators.\n\nDespite a contract with MGM to distribute his cartoons, and the introduction of a new character named \u201c[[Flip the Frog]]\u201d, and later \u201c[[Willie Whopper]]\u201d, the Iwerks Studio was never a major commercial success and failed to rival either Disney or [[Fleischer Studios]].  Newly-hired animator Fred Kopietz recommended that Iwerks employ a friend from Chouinard Art School, [[Chuck Jones]], who was hired and put  to work as a cel washer.<ref name=\"Maltin, L. 1987\" />  The Flip and Willie cartoons were later distributed on the home-movie market{{clarification needed| date= March 2019}} by [[Official Films]] in the 1940s. From 1933 to 1936, he produced a series of shorts (independently distributed, not part of the MGM deal) in [[Cinecolor]], named ''[[ComiColor Cartoons]]''. The ComiColor series mostly focused on fairy tales with no continuing character or star. Later in the 1940s, this series received home-movie distribution by [[Castle Films]]. Cinecolor produced the 16&nbsp;mm prints for Castle Films with red emulsion on one side and blue emulsion on the other. Later in the 1970s [[Blackhawk Films]] released these for home use, but this time using conventional Eastmancolor film stock. They are now in the public domain and are available on VHS and DVD. He also experimented with stop-motion animation in combination with the [[multiplane camera]], and made a short called ''The Toy Parade'', which was never released in public.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LEy50gAEhpgC&pg=PA62&dq=unreleased+film+Toy+Parade&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DYECU8i-NcPnywPym4DwBQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=unreleased%20film%20Toy%20Parade&f=false The Mouse Machine: Disney and Technology]</ref> In 1936, backers withdrew financial support from the Iwerks Studio, and it folded soon after.\n\nIn 1937, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]] contracted Iwerks to produce four ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' shorts starring [[Porky Pig]] and [[Gabby Goat]]. Iwerks directed the first two shorts, while former Schlesinger animator [[Robert Clampett]] was promoted to director and helmed the other two shorts before he and his unit returned to the main Schlesinger lot. Iwerks then did contract work for [[Screen Gems]] (then [[Columbia Pictures]]' cartoon division)  where he was the director of several of the ''[[Color Rhapsodies]]'' shorts before returning to work for Disney in 1940.\n\nAfter his return to the Disney studio, Iwerks mainly worked on developing [[special effects|special visual effects]]. He is credited as developing the processes for combining live-action and animation used in ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), as well as the [[Xerography|xerographic]] process adapted for cel animation. He also worked at WED Enterprises, now [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], helping to develop many Disney theme park attractions during the 1960s. Iwerks did special effects work outside the studio as well, including his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated achievement for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).\n\nIwerks' most famous work{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} outside creating and animating [[Mickey Mouse]] was [[Flip the Frog]] from his own studio. According to [[Chuck Jones]], who worked for him, \"He was the first, if not the first, to give his characters depth and roundness. But he had no concept of humor; he simply wasn't a funny guy.\"\n\n==Death==\nIwerks died in 1971 of a [[heart attack]] in [[Burbank, California]], aged 70, and his ashes interred in a niche in the Columbarium of Remembrance at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]].\n\n==Influence and tributes==\nThe ''Ub Iwerks Award for Technical Achievement'', as part of the [[Annie Award]]s, is named in his honour.\n\nA rare self-portrait of Iwerks was found in the garbage bin at an animation studio in Burbank. The portrait was saved and is now part of the [[ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive Project|Animation Archives]] in Burbank, California.\n\nAfter the Second World War, much of Iwerks' early animation style was imitated by legendary [[manga]] artists [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Sh\u014dtar\u014d Ishinomori]].\n\nIn 1989, Iwerks was named a [[Disney Legend]].\n\nIn the 1996 ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[The Day the Violence Died]]\", a relationship similar to Iwerks' early relationship with [[Walt Disney]] is used as the main plot.\n\nA documentary film, ''The Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story'', was released in 1999, followed by a book written by Iwerks' granddaughter [[Leslie Iwerks]] and John Kenworthy in 2001. The documentary, created by Leslie Iwerks, was released as part of [[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Seven|The Walt Disney Treasures, Wave VII series]] (disc two of The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit collection).\n\nA feature film released in 2014 ''[[Walt Before Mickey]]'', showed how Ub Iwerks, portrayed by [[Armando Gutierrez]], and Walt Disney, portrayed by [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], co-created Mickey Mouse.\n\nThe sixth episode from the second season of ''[[Drunk History]]'' (\"Hollywood\"), tells about Ub's work relationship with Disney, with stress on the creation of [[Mickey Mouse]]. Iwerks was portrayed in the episode by [[Tony Hale]].\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===1930===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Release Date\n!Series\n!Notes\n|-\n|''[[Fiddlesticks (film)|Fiddlesticks]]''\n|8/16/1930\n|[[Flip the Frog]]\n|\u2022 First cartoon by Ub Iwerks.<br>\u2022 First Flip the Frog cartoon.<br>\u2022 Filmed in two-strip Technicolor.\n|-\n|''Little Orphan Willie''\n|10/18/1930\n|[[Flip the Frog]]\n| \n|-\n|''Flying Fists''\n|9/6/1930\n|Flip the Frog\n|\u2022 Many sources claim that FF was filmed in two-strip Technicolor like ''Fiddlesticks'', though this is incorrect.\n|-\n|''The Village Barber''\n|9/27/1930\n|Flip the Frog\n|\u2022 First non-woodland cartoon.\n|-\n|''The Cuckoo Murder Case''\n|10/18/1930\n|Flip the Frog\n|\u2022 First Halloween-themed cartoon.<br>\u2022 First time a curse word is heard.
