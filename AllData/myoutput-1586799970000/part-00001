He was also honoured with the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award|MTV Video Vanguard Award]]. Often ranked as one of the best albums of the 1980s, ''Faith'' was ranked number 472 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\n==Background==\nBy 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group despite the serious subject matter that was included on albums such as ''[[Fantastic (Wham! album)|Fantastic]]'' and ''[[Make It Big]]''. After the success of ''Make It Big''  Michael had grown weary of continuing the group, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up. A decision was made that the group would dissolve following the end of a tenure at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley Stadiu]]<nowiki/>m for what was titled ''Wham: The Final''. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that eventually would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Recording==\nMichael spent the greater part of 1987 writing and recording the songs for the ''Faith'' album. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, he wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A contemporary \"[[Black music|black]]\" pop-R&B album, ''Faith'' showcases the vocals of Michael in a new style mode. Its songs are littered with introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time. Most of the material was recorded at Puk Recording Studios in Denmark and Sarm West Studios in London. The album covered many styles of which included [[soul music|soul]] (\"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\"), [[Rock music|rock]] (\"Look at Your Hands\", \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Hand to Mouth (song)|Hand to Mouth]]\"), [[funk]] (\"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\", \"[[Hard Day]]\") and [[jazz]] (\"[[Kissing a Fool (song)|Kissing a Fool]]\").\n\nSome of the material was more graphic than Michael's previous efforts with Wham! One such song was \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\", which had three parts: the first part was titled \"Rhythm 1: Lust\", which was the version that would eventually be released as a single and featured [[Electro music|electro funk]] influences; the second part was titled \"Rhythm 2: Brass in Love\", which mixed a more instrumentally-based funk live instrumentation with a smoother R&B arrangement during the verses; the third part, which was edited to be the final song on the album, was titled \"Rhythm 3: A Last Request\", featuring a jazz-influenced quiet storm and R&B sound combined with lyrics telling of Michael drunkenly trying to bring his lover to his bed.{{Quote box\n| width = 250px\n| align = right\n| quote = {{small|Michael's liner notes in the booklet:\n\n\"These songs are the result of the last two years of my life.

After this, the song featured a [[rockabilly]] sound similar to [[Bo Diddley]] while Michael added his own style with his vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/george-michael-faith/|title=George Michael: Faith|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> \"Father Figure\" originally was a dance-styled production until Michael removed the snare drums from it and kept it that way because he loved what he heard, making the song a mid-tempo R&B ballad. \"One More Try\" was a soul song in the tradition of songs by [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]; its lyrics tell of a man who pushes his lover away out of fear of repeating past relationships, only to accept the invitation in the end.\n\n\"Hard Day\", much like the first two parts of \"I Want Your Sex\", was inspired by funk. The social commentary song \"Hand to Mouth\" had a slight pop and [[Folk music|folk]] approach while a similar social commentary song, \"Look at Your Hands\", co-written by Michael and David Austin, produced a pop song with rock elements featuring a piano and saxophone. \"Monkey\" returns to the funk influences of some of the other songs. A remix of the song by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] brings a [[new jack swing]] approach to the original. \"Kissing a Fool\" is a jazz-influenced ballad with lyrics solemnly describing a breakup.\n\n==Release==<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\n[[File:George Michael.jpeg|thumb|Michael during a [[The Faith Tour|Faith Tour]] concert in 1988.

album]] by the English singer [[George Michael]], released on 30 October 1987 by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Epic Records]]. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, Michael wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A \"[[Black music|black]]\" inspired [[Pop music|pop]]-[[R&B]] album, ''Faith''<nowiki/>'s songs include introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kr0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=I+was+much+happier+when+faith+black+george+michael#v=onepage&q=I%20was%20much%20happier%20when%20faith%20black%20george%20michael&f=false|title=Jet \u2013 Google Books|date=26 September 1988|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nBy 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group. After the success of ''[[Make It Big]]'', Michael had grown weary of continuing the duo, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up which eventually happened. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-14/entertainment/ca-36257_1_george-michael|title=George Michael's Got 'Faith' and Lots More|last1=GREIN|first1=PAUL|date=14 January 1988|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\n''Faith'' peaked at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

It was also the first album by a white solo artist to hit number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|''Billboard'' Top Black Albums]] chart.

He was also honoured with the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award|MTV Video Vanguard Award]]. Often ranked as one of the best albums of the 1980s, ''Faith'' was ranked number 472 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\n==Background==\nBy 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo [[Wham!]] and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend [[Andrew Ridgeley]], was nothing more than a [[teenybopper]] group despite the serious subject matter that was included on albums such as ''[[Fantastic (Wham! album)|Fantastic]]'' and ''[[Make It Big]]''. After the success of ''Make It Big''  Michael had grown weary of continuing the group, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up. A decision was made that the group would dissolve following the end of a tenure at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley Stadiu]]<nowiki/>m for what was titled ''Wham: The Final''. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that eventually would make his first solo album, which would be titled ''Faith''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Recording==\nMichael spent the greater part of 1987 writing and recording the songs for the ''Faith'' album. In addition to playing various instruments on the album, he wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"[[Look at Your Hands]]\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A contemporary \"[[Black music|black]]\" pop-R&B album, ''Faith'' showcases the vocals of Michael in a new style mode. Its songs are littered with introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time. Most of the material was recorded at Puk Recording Studios in Denmark and Sarm West Studios in London. The album covered many styles of which included [[soul music|soul]] (\"[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]\", \"[[One More Try (George Michael song)|One More Try]]\"), [[Rock music|rock]] (\"Look at Your Hands\", \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", \"[[Hand to Mouth (song)|Hand to Mouth]]\"), [[funk]] (\"[[Monkey (song)|Monkey]]\", \"[[Hard Day]]\") and [[jazz]] (\"[[Kissing a Fool (song)|Kissing a Fool]]\").\n\nSome of the material was more graphic than Michael's previous efforts with Wham! One such song was \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\", which had three parts: the first part was titled \"Rhythm 1: Lust\", which was the version that would eventually be released as a single and featured [[Electro music|electro funk]] influences; the second part was titled \"Rhythm 2: Brass in Love\", which mixed a more instrumentally-based funk live instrumentation with a smoother R&B arrangement during the verses; the third part, which was edited to be the final song on the album, was titled \"Rhythm 3: A Last Request\", featuring a jazz-influenced quiet storm and R&B sound combined with lyrics telling of Michael drunkenly trying to bring his lover to his bed.{{Quote box\n| width = 250px\n| align = right\n| quote = {{small|Michael's liner notes in the booklet:\n\n\"These songs are the result of the last two years of my life.

After this, the song featured a [[rockabilly]] sound similar to [[Bo Diddley]] while Michael added his own style with his vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/george-michael-faith/|title=George Michael: Faith|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> \"Father Figure\" originally was a dance-styled production until Michael removed the snare drums from it and kept it that way because he loved what he heard, making the song a mid-tempo R&B ballad. \"One More Try\" was a soul song in the tradition of songs by [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]; its lyrics tell of a man who pushes his lover away out of fear of repeating past relationships, only to accept the invitation in the end.\n\n\"Hard Day\", much like the first two parts of \"I Want Your Sex\", was inspired by funk. The social commentary song \"Hand to Mouth\" had a slight pop and [[Folk music|folk]] approach while a similar social commentary song, \"Look at Your Hands\", co-written by Michael and David Austin, produced a pop song with rock elements featuring a piano and saxophone. \"Monkey\" returns to the funk influences of some of the other songs. A remix of the song by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] brings a [[new jack swing]] approach to the original. \"Kissing a Fool\" is a jazz-influenced ballad with lyrics solemnly describing a breakup.\n\n==Release==<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\n[[File:George Michael.jpeg|thumb|Michael during a [[The Faith Tour|Faith Tour]] concert in 1988.

Michael also had both the year's number one album and the number one single, which hadn't happened since 1970, when [[Simon & Garfunkel]] grabbed both positions with ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' and its [[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|title track]].\n\n===The Faith Tour===\n{{Main|The Faith Tour}}\nMichael embarked on a world tour to promote the album in February 1988, opening at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] arena, before going on to dates in Australia, Europe and North America.
