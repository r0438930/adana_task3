In the episode, a new boy at school helps set off an impromptu-singing-and-dancing craze that the boys vow to never go along with, dragging them down into the dregs of unpopularity.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode is a parody of the [[High School Musical (film series)|''High School Musical'']] film series.<ref name=\"AVClub\" />\n\n==Plot==\n[[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] realize that, apart from them, everyone at school has bought into the newest [[fad]], the ''[[High School Musical (film series)|High School Musical]]'' film series. The four boys repeatedly witness the rest of South Park Elementary collectively break into song, in the spirit of the musical films. Unaware of what ''High School Musical'' is, the boys watch one of the films, but dislike it, and vow never to become a part of this fad. Cartman decides to commit suicide by inducing [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] while sleeping under his mother's car (with the engine turned on) but it fails since [[hybrid cars]] do not \"do the trick anymore\".\n\nStan fears that [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] is becoming close with a popular third-grader named Bridon Gueermo (voiced by Parker), because they tend to share lead roles in the musical routines. Stan talks to Bridon in hopes of directing him away from Wendy, and finds out Bridon would prefer to play basketball instead of singing. It is revealed that the reason that Bridon made up the fad because of his theater-crazed, flamboyant metrosexual father (also voiced by Parker) forces him to do it. Stan pressures him to try out with the basketball team anyway. Although Mr. Gueermo is shown to be abusive to his family (though only capable of light, effeminate slaps) Bridon eventually stands up for himself (punching his father in the face), and joins the team.\n\nMeanwhile, unhappy at becoming an outcast in school, Stan decides to join the trend and studies the ''High School Musical'' series intensively, despite having vowed against it. He convinces Kyle, Cartman and Kenny that the world has changed, and they cannot go against the tide anymore. The next day at school, the four boys perform a song along with an equally elaborate dance routine about the importance of following one's dreams. However, upon learning that Bridon has joined the basketball team, everyone else is uninterested and leaves during the boys' performance to watch Bridon play basketball instead. The four kids learn that the rest of the school just liked Bridon for his looks and charisma and not the fad itself.\n\n==Production==\n\n\"Elementary School Musical\" was one of dozens of ''South Park'' episodes developed the Thursday before broadcast during a writer's meeting.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> ''[[High School Musical 3: Senior Year]]'' had opened in theaters several weeks before and was a national hot topic; the team had previously mentioned the series as a target for satire.
