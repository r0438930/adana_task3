He was an enlightened liberal who, at the age of 20, commented flippantly that \"our religion is a very dumb religion.\" In his view, Catholicism too was obscure and Protestantism was \"simplest and most natural\" religion. Consequently, he argued that he would be delighted if Romanians converted to Protestantism. Later, as a dedicated representative of Hungarian liberalism, Vukovics became a government commissioner of [[Banat]], and a year later minister of justice in [[Bertalan Szemere]]'s government. Despite the failure of the revolt, he remained [[Lajos Kossuth]]'s most ardent follower until the end of his life. Vukovics was a pragmatic politician who understood the techniques of county and state bureaucracy. He also knew how to take a person to task\u2014even though he always tried to avoid internal conflicts.\n\nAfter the 1848 Revolution, the Hungarian commander of Serbian nationality General [[J\u00e1nos Damjanich]], with a dozen other high-ranking officers, was hanged by the Austrians, and Vukovics, rightfully, feared for his life. He was hiding from the authorities at the homes of the [[Menyh\u00e9rt L\u00f3nyay]] and Ervin Vlad\u00e1r families immediately after the [[Surrender at Vil\u00e1gos]]. Vukovics and the Polish general, [[J\u00f3zef Bem]], fled into exile, first in France. In Paris Vukovics joined Hungarian refugees [[Mih\u00e1ly Horv\u00e1th]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Teleki]], [[Bertalan Szemere]], [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]], L\u00e1z\u00e1r Mesz\u00e1ros and [[Mih\u00e1ly V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty]], all of whom were [[trial in absentia|sentenced to death ''in absentia'']] by the Austrian crown. Vukovics was the most practical politician among the Paris exiles. In 1851 he emigrated to the United Kingdom, but maintained contact with all the revolutionaries, particularly Lajos Kossuth to whom he wrote many letters, outlining two basic principles for the near future: independence of Hungary, and \"complete democratic freedom with respect to politics, nationality, and religion.\" Vukovics insisted on the unity of historical Hungary. Therefore he did not give up Transylvania but did acknowledge the independence of Croatia, and recognized the establishment of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. Instead of a confederation he proposed an alliance with the neighbouring Danubian states, obviously ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' Austria. Vukovics subordinated the nationality question to the issue of universal suffrage while \"not keeping up any supremacy for the Hungarian nationality.\" Since the \"central power\" would decide only in national affairs, county autonomy could satisfy nationalities claims. The official languages in national affairs would be decided by the state, in county affairs by the county, and municipal affairs by the community.\n\nHe died in London on 19 November 1872.\n\nIn [[Novi Sad]] his father made a donation to found the [[Gymnasium Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj]], constructed in 1810.\n\nSeb\u0151 Vukovics's memoirs were written while he was living in London. They were published in [[Budapest]] by politician Ferenc Besenyei, MP, in 1894.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Minister of Justice of Hungary|Minister of Justice]]|before=[[Ferenc De\u00e1k]]|after=[[Boldizs\u00e1r Horv\u00e1t]]|years=1849}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{HungarianJusticeMinisters}}\n\n{{commons category|Seb\u0151 Vukovics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vukovics, Sebo}}\n[[Category:1811 births]]\n[[Category:1872 deaths]]\n[[Category:Hungarian people of Serbian descent]]\n[[Category:Hungarian emigrants to England]]\n[[Category:Justice ministers of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Habsburg Serbs]]\n[[Category:Austro-Hungarian Serbs]]\n[[Category:19th-century Hungarian people]]\n[[Category:People from Rijeka]]\n[[Category:Austro-Hungarian emigrants to England]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=July 2012}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox Officeholder \n| name            = Seb\u0151 Vukovics\n| image           = Vukovics Seb\u0151.jpg\n| order           = [[Minister of Justice of Hungary]]\n| term_start      = 2 May 1849\n| term_end        = 11 August 1849\n| president       = \n| predecessor     = [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]]\n| successor       = [[Boldizs\u00e1r Horv\u00e1t]]\n| birth_date      = {{Birth date|1811|7|20|df=y}}\n| birth_place     = [[Fiume]], [[Illyrian Provinces]]\n| death_date      = {{Death date and age|1872|11|19|1811|7|20|df=y}}\n| death_place     = London, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]\n| spouse          = Erzs\u00e9bet Dad\u00e1nyi de Gy\u00fclv\u00e9sz\n| children        = M\u00e1ria <br>G\u00e1bor\n| profession      = politician\n| party           = [[Opposition Party (Hungary)|Opposition Party]]\n|}}\n{{eastern name order|Vukovics Seb\u0151}}\n'''Seb\u0151 Vukovics''' (''Sava Vukovi\u0107''; 20 July 1811, [[Fiume]] \u2013 19 November 1872, [[London]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] politician of [[Serbia]]n descent, who served as [[Minister of Justice]] in 1849 during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://mek.niif.hu/00300/00355/html/index.html | title = Magyar \u00c9letrajzi Lexikon - Vukovics, Seb\u0151 | accessdate = 2012-07-02}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nThe [[Serbian Orthodox]] Seb\u00f3 Vukovics, who learned to speak Hungarian as a second language in his adolescence, was an example of spontaneous assimilation that sometimes took place especially among those incorporated into Hungarian nobility.
