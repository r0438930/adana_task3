Following [[World War II]], and in response to the large numbers of people fleeing Eastern Europe, the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] defined  \"refugee\" (in Article 1.A.2) as any person who:{{sfn|Convention Protocol relating|1967}}\n\n<blockquote>\"owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a [[particular social group]] or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.\"{{sfn|Convention Protocol relating|1967}}</blockquote>\n\nIn 1967, the definition was basically confirmed by the UN [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees]].\n\nThe [[Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa]] expanded the 1951 definition, which the [[Organization of African Unity]] adopted in 1969:<blockquote>\"Every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place outside his country of origin or nationality.\"{{sfn|Assembly of Heads of State and Government (Sixth Ordinary Session)|1969}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe 1984 regional, non-binding Latin-American [[Cartagena Declaration on Refugees]] includes:\n\n<blockquote>\"persons who have fled their country because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order.\"{{sfn|Cartagena Declaration}}</blockquote>\n\nAs of 2011, the UNHCR itself, in addition to the 1951 definition, recognizes persons as refugees:\n\n<blockquote>\"who are outside their country of nationality or habitual residence and unable to return there owing to serious and indiscriminate threats to life, physical integrity or freedom resulting from generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order.\"{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)|2011|p=19}}</blockquote>\n\nEuropean Union's minimum standards definition of refugee, underlined by Art. 2 (c) of Directive No. 2004/83/EC, essentially reproduces the narrow definition of refugee offered by the UN 1951 Convention; nevertheless, by virtue of articles 2 (e) and 15 of the same Directive, persons who have fled a war-caused generalized violence are, at certain conditions, eligible for a complementary form of protection, called [[subsidiary protection]]. The same form of protection is foreseen for displaced people who, without being refugees, are nevertheless exposed, if returned to their countries of origin, to death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatments.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Right of asylum|Sanctuary}}\n[[File:Gysis Nikolaos After the destruction of Psara.jpg|right|thumb|Greeks fleeing the [[Destruction of Psara]] in 1824 (painting by [[Nikolaos Gyzis]]).]]\n[[File:Hercegova\u010dki begunci, Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107.jpg|thumb|right|\"Refugees from Herzegovina\", painting by [[Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107]] in 1889 made in the aftermath of the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)]].]]\nThe idea that a person who sought sanctuary in a holy place could not be harmed without inviting divine retribution was familiar to the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[ancient Egypt]]ians. However, the [[right of asylum|right to seek asylum]] in a church or other holy place was first codified in law by King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] in about AD 600. Similar laws were implemented throughout Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. The related concept of political [[exile]] also has a long history: [[Ovid]] was sent to [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]]; [[Voltaire]] was sent to England. By the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], nations recognized each other's [[sovereignty]]. However, it was not until the advent of [[romantic nationalism]] in late 18th-century Europe that [[nationalism]] gained sufficient prevalence for the phrase ''country of nationality'' to become practically meaningful, and for border crossing to require that people provide identification.\n[[File:Turkish refugees from Edirne.jpg|thumb|right|Turkish refugees from [[Edirne]], 1913]]\n[[File:ArmeniansOnDeportationMarch.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|One million [[Armenians]] were forced to leave their homes in Anatolia in 1915, and many either died or were murdered on their way to Syria.]]\n\nThe term \"refugee\" sometime applies to people who might fit the definition outlined by the 1951 Convention, were it applied retroactively. There are many candidates. For example, after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685 outlawed [[Protestantism]] in France, hundreds of thousands of [[Huguenot]]s fled to England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, [[South Africa]], Germany and [[Prussia]]. The repeated waves of [[pogrom]]s that swept Eastern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries prompted mass Jewish emigration (more than 2 million [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] emigrated in the period 1881\u20131920). Beginning in the 19th century, Muslim people emigrated to Turkey from Europe.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995}} The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913 caused 800,000 people to leave their homes.{{sfn|Greek Turkish refugees}} Various groups of people were officially designated refugees beginning in World War I.\n\n===League of Nations===\n[[File:Spanish War Children001.jpg|thumb|Children preparing for evacuation from Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] between 1936 and 1939.]]\nThe first international co-ordination of refugee affairs came with the creation by the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 of the High Commission for Refugees and the appointment of [[Fridtjof Nansen]] as its head. Nansen and the Commission were charged with assisting the approximately 1,500,000 people who fled the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] (1917\u20131921),{{sfn|Hassell|1991}} p.&nbsp;1. most of them aristocrats fleeing the Communist government.

Over the next several years, the mandate was expanded further to cover [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and Turkish refugees.{{sfn|Nansen International Office}} In all of these cases, a refugee was defined as a person in a group for which the League of Nations had approved a mandate, as opposed to a person to whom a general definition applied.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] involved about two million people (around 1.5 million [[Greeks in Turkey|Anatolian Greeks]] and 500,000 Muslims in Greece) most of whom were forcibly repatriated and denaturalized{{clarify|date=September 2015}} from homelands of centuries or millennia (and guaranteed the nationality of the destination country) by a treaty promoted and overseen by the international community as part of the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]].{{efn-ua|The \"[[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]\" was signed at [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, on 30 January 1923, by the governments of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] and Turkey.}}\n\nThe U.S. Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921, followed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]].

Its most notable achievement was the [[Nansen passport]], a [[refugee travel document]], for which it was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The Nansen Office was plagued by problems of financing, an increase in refugee numbers, and a lack of co-operation from some member states, which led to mixed success overall.\n\nHowever, the Nansen Office managed to lead fourteen nations to ratify the 1933 Refugee Convention, an early, and relatively modest, attempt at a [[human rights]] charter, and in general assisted around one million refugees worldwide.{{sfn|Nobel Peace Prize}}\n\n===1933 (rise of Nazism) to 1944===\n[[File:Czech refugees from the Sudetenland 1.gif|thumb|right|upright|Czech refugees from the [[Sudetenland]], October 1938]]\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] led to such a very large increase in the number of refugees from Germany that in 1933 the League created a high commission for refugees coming from Germany.

In 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] created the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) to provide aid to areas liberated from [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]], including parts of Europe and China. By the end of the War, Europe had more than 40 million refugees.{{sfn|Refugees: Save Us!|1979}} UNRRA was involved in returning over seven million refugees, then commonly referred to as [[displaced person]]s or DPs, to their country of origin and setting up [[displaced persons camp]]s for one million refugees who refused to be repatriated. Even two years after the end of War, some 850,000 people still lived in DP camps across Western Europe.

After the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]] on 7 May 1945, the Allies occupied the remainder of Germany, and the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin declaration of 5 June 1945]] confirmed the division of [[Allied-occupied Germany]] according to the Yalta Conference, which stipulated the continued existence of the German Reich as a whole, which would include its [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern territories]] as of 31 December 1937. This did not impact on Poland's eastern border, and Stalin refused to be removed from these [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|eastern Polish territories]].\n\nIn the last months of World War II, about five million German civilians from the German provinces of [[East Prussia]], [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]] fled the advance of the Red Army from the east and became refugees in [[Mecklenburg]], [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony]]. Since the spring of 1945 the Poles had been forcefully expelling the remaining German population in these provinces. When the Allies met in Potsdam on 17 July 1945 at the [[Potsdam Conference]], a chaotic refugee situation faced the occupying powers. The [[Potsdam Agreement]], signed on 2 August 1945, defined the Polish western border as that of 1937, (Article VIII) [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/truman/psources/ps_potsdam.html Agreements of the Berlin (Potsdam) Conference] placing one fourth of Germany's territory under the [[Provisional Government of National Unity|Provisional Polish administration]].

Although significant contributions had been made before, the latter half of the 20th century saw the establishment of institutions dedicated to the study of refugees, such as the Association for the Study of the World Refugee Problem, which was closely followed by the founding of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]].

Since no universally accepted definition for the term \"refugee\" exists, the academic respectability of the policy-based definition, as outlined in the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]], is disputed. Additionally, academics have critiqued the lack of a theoretical basis of refugee studies and dominance of policy-oriented research. In response, scholars have attempted to steer the field toward establishing a theoretical groundwork of refugee studies through \"situating studies of particular refugee (and other forced migrant) groups in the theories of cognate areas (and major disciplines), [providing] an opportunity to use the particular circumstances of refugee situations to illuminate these more general theories and thus participate in the development of social science, rather than leading refugee studies into an intellectual cul-de-sac.\"<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Malkki|first=Liisa H.|date=1995|title=Refugees and Exile: From \"Refugee Studies\" to the National Order of Things|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=495\u2013523|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.24.100195.002431|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1413dec66a9a7f7593379d8ffa29884e196953fe}}</ref> Thus, the term ''refugee'' in the context of refugee studies can be referred to as \"legal or descriptive rubric\", encompassing socioeconomic backgrounds, personal histories, psychological analyses, and spiritualities.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==UN Refugee Agency==\n{{Main|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:South Africa-Xenophobia-001.jpg|thumb|UNHCR tents at a refugee camp following episodes of [[Xenophobia in South Africa|xenophobic violence]] and rioting in [[South Africa]], 2008]]\n\nHeadquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) was established on 14 December 1950.

Moreover, the UNHCR also provides protection and assistance to other categories of displaced persons: asylum seekers, refugees who [[voluntary return|returned home voluntarily]] but still need help rebuilding their lives, local civilian communities directly affected by large refugee movements, [[statelessness|stateless]] people and so-called [[internally displaced people]] (IDPs), as well as people in refugee-like and IDP-like situations.\n\nThe agency is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and to resolve refugee problems worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. It strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to [[asylum seeker|seek asylum]] and find safe refuge in another state or territory and to offer \"durable solutions\" to refugees and refugee hosting countries.\n\n===Acute and temporary protection===\n\n====Refugee camp====\n[[File:Refugee camp in Guinea.jpg|thumb|A camp in [[Guinea]] for refugees from [[Sierra Leone]] ]]\n[[File:Refugee camp.jpg|thumb|Refugee camp in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n{{Main|Refugee camp}}\nA refugee camp is a place built by [[government]]s or [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] (such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]]) to receive refugees, [[internally displaced person]]s or sometimes also other migrants. It is usually designed to offer acute and temporary accommodation and services and any more permanent facilities and structures often banned. People may stay in these camps for many years, receiving emergency food, education and medical aid until it is safe enough to return to their country of origin.\nThere, refugees are at risk of disease, child soldier and terrorist recruitment, and physical and sexual violence. There are estimated to be 700 refugee camp locations worldwide.{{sfn|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}}\n\n====Urban refugee====\n{{Main|Urban refugee}}\nNot all refugees who are supported by the UNHCR live in refugee camps. A significant number, actually more than half, live in urban settings,{{sfn|Learn}} such as the ~60,000 Iraqi refugees in Damascus (Syria),{{sfn|Dehghanpisheh|2013}}<!-- as of 2015, Kenyan government requires refugees to reside in camps --> and the ~30,000 Sudanese refugees in Cairo (Egypt).{{sfn|Mahmoud}}\n\n===Durable solutions===\nThe residency status in the host country whilst under temporary UNHCR protection is very uncertain as refugees are only granted temporary visas that have to be regularly renewed. Rather than only safeguarding the rights and basic well-being of refugees in the camps or in urban settings on a temporary basis the UNHCR's ultimate goal is to find one of the three durable solutions for refugees: integration, repatriation, resettlement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/solutions.html|title=Refugees solutions|last=|first=|date=|website=UNHCR|access-date=26 August 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Integration and naturalisation====\n{{Main|Naturalization}}\nLocal integration is aiming at providing the refugee with the permanent right to stay in the country of asylum, including, in some situations, as a naturalized citizen. It follows the formal granting of refugee status by the country of asylum. It is difficult to quantify the number of refugees who settled and integrated in their first country of asylum and only the number of naturalisations can give an indication.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 2014 Tanzania granted citizenship to 162,000 refugees from Burundi and in 1982 to 32,000 Rwandan refugees.{{sfn|Markus|2014}} Mexico naturalised 6,200 Guatemalan refugees in 2001.{{sfn|Goldberg|2001}}\n\n====Voluntary return====\n{{Main|Voluntary return}}\n\nVoluntary return of refugees into their country of origin, in safety and dignity, is based on their free will and their informed decision. In the last couple of years parts of or even whole refugee populations were able to return to their home countries: e.g. 120,000 Congolese refugees returned from the Republic of Congo to the DRC,{{sfn|Schmitt|2014}} 30,000 Angolans returned home from the DRC{{sfn|Schmitt|2014}} and Botswana, Ivorian refugees returned from Liberia, Afghans from Pakistan, and Iraqis from Syria. In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of refugees from Somalia.{{sfn|Nairobi to open|2014}} The UNHCR and the IOM offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily to their home countries. Many developed countries also have Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes for asylum seekers who want to go back or were [[Asylum seeker#Refusal of asylum|refused asylum]].\n\n====Third country resettlement====\n{{Main|Third country resettlement}}\n\nThird country resettlement involves the assisted transfer of refugees from the country in which they have sought asylum to a safe third country that has agreed to admit them as refugees. This can be for permanent settlement or limited to a certain number of years. It is the third durable solution and it can only be considered once the two other solutions have proved impossible.{{sfn|What is resettlement?}}{{sfn|Resettlement: new beginning}} The UNHCR has traditionally seen resettlement as the least preferable of the \"durable solutions\" to refugee situations.{{sfn|Understanding Resettlement to|2004}} However, in April 2000 the then UN High Commissioner for Refugees, [[Sadako Ogata]], stated \"Resettlement can no longer be seen as the least-preferred durable solution; in many cases it is the ''only'' solution for refugees.\"{{sfn|Understanding Resettlement to|2004}}\n\n===Internally displaced person===\n{{main|Internally displaced person}}\nUNHCR's mandate has gradually been expanded to include protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to [[internally displaced persons]] (IDPs) and people in IDP-like situations. These are civilians who have been forced to flee their homes, but who have not reached a neighboring country. IDPs do not fit the legal definition of a refugee under the [[1951 Refugee Convention]], [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|1967 Protocol]] and the [[OAU Convention|1969 Organization for African Unity Convention]], because they have not left their country. As the nature of war has changed in the last few decades, with more and more internal conflicts replacing interstate wars, the number of IDPs has increased significantly.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" |Comparison between the number of refugees and IDPs who are supported by the UNHCR between 1998 and 2014.{{sfn|UNHCR|2015}}{{Failed verification|date=May 2019|talk=Semi-protected edit request on 14 May 2019}}\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|End-year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|1996\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2000\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2002\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2004\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2006\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2008\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2010\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2012\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2014\n|-\n|Refugees||11,480,900 ||12,129,600 ||10,594,100 ||9,574,800 ||9,877,700 ||10,489,800 ||10,549,700 ||10,498,000 ||14,385,300\n|-\n|[[internally displaced person|IDPs]]||5,063,900 ||5,998,500 ||4,646,600 ||5,426,500 ||12,794,300 ||14,442,200 ||14,697,900 ||17,670,400 ||32,274,600\n|}\n\n==Refugee status==\nThe term refugee is often used in different contexts: in everyday usage it refers to a forcibly displaced person who has fled their country of origin; in a more specific context it refers to such a person who was, on top of that, granted refugee status in the country the person fled to. Even more exclusive is the Convention refugee status which is given only to persons who fall within the [[#Legal definitions|refugee definition]] of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol.\n\nTo receive refugee status, a person must have applied for asylum, making them\u2014while waiting for a decision\u2014an asylum seeker. However, a displaced person otherwise legally entitled to refugee status may never apply for asylum, or may not be allowed to apply in the country they fled to and thus may not have official asylum seeker status.\n\nOnce a displaced person is granted refugee status they enjoy certain [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees#Rights and responsibilities of parties to the Refugee Convention|rights]] as agreed in the 1951 Refugee convention. Not all countries have signed and ratified this convention and some countries do not have a legal procedure for dealing with asylum seekers.\n\n===Seeking asylum===\n{{main|Asylum seeker}}\n[[File:Erstaufnahmelager Jenfelder Moorpark 4.jpg|thumb|Erstaufnahmelager [[Hamburg|Jenfelder]] Moorpark]]\n\nAn asylum seeker is a displaced person or immigrant who has formally sought the protection of the state they fled to as well as the right to remain in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for [[Asylum seeker#Complementary forms of protection|complementary forms of protection]]. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the [[Refugee#Legal definition|legal definition]] that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker receives either Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection, and can stay in the country\u2014or is refused asylum, and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR\u2014wherever the application was made\u2014recognises the protection needs does the asylum seeker ''officially'' receive refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations, according to the legislation of the receiving country.\n\n{{anchor|Qouta}}[[Quota refugee]]s do not need to apply for asylum on arrival in the third countries as they already went through the UNHCR refugee status determination process whilst being in the first country of asylum and this is usually accepted by the third countries.\n\n===Refugee status determination===\n[[File:The Sahrawi refugees&nbsp;\u2013 a forgotten crisis in the Algerian desert (7).jpg|thumb|For over 30 years, several tens of thousands of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] refugees have been living in the region of [[Tindouf, Algeria]], in the heart of the desert.]]\n{{see|Refugee law#Refugee status determination|Asylum seeker#Status determination processes}}\nTo receive refugee status, a displaced person must go through a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) process, which is conducted by the government of the country of asylum or the UNHCR, and is based on [[Refugee law|international, regional]] or national law.{{sfn|Refugee Status Determination}} RSD can be done on a case by case basis as well as for whole groups of people. Which of the [[Asylum seeker#Status determination processes|two processes]] is used often depends on the size of the influx of displaced persons.\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 117.png|thumb|After challenging Queen Jezebel, Elijah takes refuge in a cave until the voice of God calls him in this 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nThere is no specific method mandated for RSD (apart from the commitment to the [[1951 Refugee Convention]]) and it is subject to the overall efficacy of the country's internal administrative and judicial system as well as the characteristics of the refugee flow to which the country responds. This lack of a procedural direction could create a situation where political and strategic interests override humanitarian considerations in the RSD process.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|pp=71\u201393}} There are also no fixed interpretations of the elements in the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] and countries may interpret them differently (see also [[refugee roulette]]).\n\nHowever, in 2013, the UNHCR conducted them in more than 50 countries and co-conducted them parallel to or jointly with governments in another 20 countries, which made it the second largest RSD body in the world{{sfn|Refugee Status Determination}} The UNHCR follows a set of guidelines described in the ''Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status'' to determine which individuals are eligible for refugee status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/4d93528a9.pdf|title=Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees}}</ref>\n\n==Refugee rights==\n{{Main|Refugee law}}\n\nRefugee rights encompass both customary law, [[peremptory norm]]s, and international legal instruments. If the entity granting refugee status is a state that has signed the 1951 Refugee Convention then the refugee has the [[Refugee employment|right to employment]]. Further rights include the following rights and obligations for refugees:\n\n===Right of return===\n{{Main|Right of return}}\nEven in a supposedly \"post-conflict\" environment, it is not a simple process for refugees to return home.<ref name=\"ODI\">Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4409&title=uncharted-territory-land-conflict-humanitarian-action Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> The UN Pinheiro Principles are guided by the idea that people not only have the right to return home, but also the right to the same property.<ref name=\"ODI\"/> It seeks to return to the pre-conflict status quo and ensure that no one profits from violence. Yet this is a very complex issue and every situation is different; conflict is a highly transformative force and the pre-war status-quo can never be reestablished completely, even if that were desirable (it may have caused the conflict in the first place).<ref name=\"ODI\"/> Therefore, the following are of particular importance to the right to return:<ref name=\"ODI\"/>\n* May never have had property (e.g., in Afghanistan)\n* Cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan)\n* Ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue\n* Death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land\n* People settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste)\n* Have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan).\nRefugees who were [[third country resettlement|resettled to a third country]] will likely lose the indefinite leave to remain in this country if they return to their country of origin or the country of first asylum.\n\n===Right to non-refoulement===\n{{Main|Non-refoulement}}\nNon-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.{{sfn|Convention relating to}} The right to non-refoulement is distinct from the right to asylum. To respect the right to asylum, states must not deport genuine refugees. In contrast, the right to non-refoulement allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records. The portable procedural model, proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey, emphasizes the right to non-refoulement by guaranteeing refugees three procedural rights (to a verbal hearing, to legal counsel, and to judicial review of detention decisions) and ensuring those rights in the constitution.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|pages=232\u2013266}} This proposal attempts to strike a balance between the interest of national governments and the interests of refugees.\n\n===Right to family reunification===\n{{Main|Family reunification}}\n\nFamily reunification (which can also be a form of resettlement) is a recognized reason for immigration in many countries. [[Divided family|Divided families]] have the right to be reunited if a family member with permanent right of residency applies for the reunification and can prove the people on the application were a family unit before arrival and wish to live as a family unit since separation. If application is successful this enables the rest of the family to immigrate to that country as well.\n\n===Right to travel===\n{{Main|Refugee travel document}}\nThose states that signed the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] are obliged to issue travel documents (i.e. \"Convention Travel Document\") to refugees lawfully residing in their territory.{{efn-ua|Under Article 28 of the Convention.}} It is a valid travel document in place of a passport, however, it cannot be used to travel to the country of origin, i.e. from where the refugee fled.\n\n===Restriction of onward movement===\nOnce refugees or asylum seekers have found a safe place and protection of a state or territory outside their territory of origin they are discouraged from leaving again and seeking protection in another country. If they do move onward into a second country of asylum this movement is also called ''\"irregular movement\"'' by the UNHCR (see also [[asylum shopping]]). UNHCR support in the second country may be less than in the first country and they can even be returned to the first country.{{sfn|Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme|1989}}\n\n==World Refugee Day==\n\n[[World Refugee Day]] has occurred annually on 20 June since 2000 by a special United Nations General Assembly Resolution. 20 June had previously been commemorated as \"African Refugee Day\" in a number of African countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom World Refugee Day is celebrated as part of [[Refugee Week]].

These long-term mental problems can severely impede the functionality of the person in everyday situations; it makes matters even worse for displaced persons who are confronted with a new environment and challenging situations. They are also at high risk for [[suicide]].{{sfn|Suicide pact|2002}}\n\nAmong other symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder involves [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], over-alertness, sleeplessness, [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], motor difficulties, failing [[short term memory]], [[amnesia]], nightmares and sleep-paralysis. Flashbacks are characteristic to the disorder: the patient experiences the [[traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic event]], or pieces of it, again and again. Depression is also characteristic for PTSD-patients and may also occur without accompanying PTSD.\n\nPTSD was diagnosed in 34.1% of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] children, most of whom were refugees, [[male]]s, and working. The participants were 1,000 children aged 12 to 16 years from governmental, private, and United Nations Relief Work Agency [[UNRWA]] schools in East Jerusalem and various governorates in the West Bank.{{sfn|Khamis|2005|pp=81\u201395}}\n\nAnother study showed that 28.3% of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] refugee women had symptoms of PTSD three or four years after their arrival in Sweden. These women also had significantly higher [[risk]]s of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress than Swedish-born women. For depression the odds ratio was 9.50 among Bosnian women.{{sfn|Sundquist|Johansson|DeMarinis|Johansson|2005|pp=158\u201364}}\n\nA study by the Department of Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine at the [[Boston University]] School of Medicine demonstrated that twenty percent of Sudanese refugee minors living in the United States had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. They were also more likely to have worse scores on all the Child Health Questionnaire subscales.{{sfn|Geltman|Grant-Knight|Mehta|Lloyd-Travaglini|2005|pp=585\u201391}}\n\nIn a study for the United Kingdom, refugees were found to be 4 percentage points more likely to report a mental health problem compared to the non-immigrant population. This contrasts with the results for other immigrant groups, which were less likely to report a mental health problem compared to the non-immigrant population.<ref name=\"giuntella2018\" />\n\nMany more studies illustrate the problem. One [[meta-study]] was conducted by the psychiatry department of [[Oxford University]] at Warneford Hospital in the United Kingdom. Twenty [[Statistical survey|surveys]] were analyzed, providing results for 6,743 adult refugees from seven countries. In the larger studies, 9% were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 5% with major depression, with evidence of much psychiatric co-morbidity. Five surveys of 260 refugee children from three countries yielded a [[prevalence]] of 11% for post-traumatic stress disorder. According to this study, refugees resettled in Western countries could be about ten times more likely to have PTSD than age-matched general populations in those countries. Worldwide, tens of thousands of refugees and former refugees resettled in Western countries probably have post-traumatic stress disorder.{{sfn|Fazel|Wheeler|Danesh|2005|pp=1309\u201314}}\n\n====Malaria====\nRefugees are often more susceptible to illness for several reasons, including a lack of immunity to local strains of [[malaria]] and other diseases. Displacement of a people can create favorable conditions for disease transmission. Refugee camps are typically heavily populated with poor sanitary conditions. The removal of vegetation for space, building materials or firewood also deprives mosquitoes of their natural habitats, leading them to more closely interact with humans.{{sfn|Kazmi|Pandit|2001|pp=1043\u20131055}} In the 1970s, Afghani refugees that were relocated to Pakistan were going from a country with an effective malaria control strategy, to a country with a less effective system.\n\nThe refugee camps were built near rivers or irrigation sites had higher malaria prevalence than refugee camps built on dry lands.{{sfn|Rowland|Rab|Freeman|Durrani|2002|pp=2061\u20132072}}\nThe location of the camps lent themselves to better breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and thus a higher likelihood of malaria transmission. Children aged 1\u201315 were the most susceptible to malaria infection, which is a significant cause of mortality in children younger than 5.{{sfn|Karim|Hussain|Malik|Lee|2016|pp=1\u201312}} Malaria was the cause of 16% of the deaths in refugee children younger than 5 years of age.{{sfn|Mertans|Hall|2000|pp=103\u20139}} Malaria is one of the most commonly reported causes of death in refugees and displaced persons. Since 2014, reports of malaria cases in Germany had doubled compared to previous years, with the majority of cases found in refugees from Eritrea.{{sfn|Roggelin|Tappe|Noack|Addo|2016|p=325}}\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that all people in areas that are endemic for malaria use long-lasting insecticide nets.{{sfn|Fact sheet Malaria}} A cohort study found that within refugee camps in Pakistan, insecticide treated bed nets were very useful in reducing malaria cases. A single treatment of the nets with the insecticide [[permethrin]] remained protective throughout the 6 month transmission season.{{sfn|Kolaczinski|2004|pp=15}}\n\n===Access to healthcare services===\nAccess to services depends on many factors, including whether a refugee has received official status, is situated within a refugee camp, or is in the process of third country resettlement.

There can be instances of exploitation at the hands of enforcement officials, citizens of the host country, and even United Nations peacekeepers. Instances of human rights violations, child labor, mental and physical trauma/torture, violence-related trauma, and [[Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response|sexual exploitation]], especially of children, have been documented. In many refugee camps in three war-torn West African countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, young girls were found to be exchanging sex for money, a handful of fruit, or even a bar of soap. Most of these girls were between 13 and 18 years of age. In most cases, if the girls had been forced to stay, they would have been forced into marriage. They became pregnant around the age of 15 on average. This happened as recently as in 2001. Parents tended to turn a blind eye because sexual exploitation had become a \"mechanism of survival\" in these camps.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2005|pp=514\u2013525}}\n\nLarge groups of displaced persons could be abused as [[refugees as weapons|\"weapons\"]] to threaten or political enemies or neighbouring countries.\n\n===Security threats===\nVery rarely, refugees have been used and recruited as refugee [[militant]]s or [[terrorist]]s,{{sfn|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)|1999}} and the humanitarian aid directed at refugee relief has very rarely been utilized to fund the acquisition of arms.{{sfn|Crisp|1999}} Support from a refugee-receiving state has rarely been used to enable refugees to mobilize militarily, enabling conflict to spread across borders.{{sfn|Weiss|1999|pp=1\u201322}}\n\nHistorically, refugee populations have often been portrayed as a security threat.

Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and [[Immigration|immigrant]] students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.\n\nAside from students, teachers and school staff also face their own obstacles in working with refugee students. They have concerns about their ability to meet the mental, physical, emotional, and educational needs of students. One study of newly arrived [[Bantus (Somalia)|Bantu]] students from Somalia in a Chicago school questioned whether schools were equipped to provide them with a quality education that met the needs of the pupils. The students were not aware of how to use pencils, which caused them to break the tips requiring frequent sharpening. Teachers may even see refugee students as different from other immigrant groups, as was the case with the Bantu pupils.<ref>Birman, D., & Tran, N. (2015). The Academic Engagement of Newly Arriving Somali Bantu Students in a U.S. Elementary School. Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute.</ref> Teachers may sometimes feel that their work is made harder because of the pressures to meet [[Standards-based education reform in the United States|state requirements]] for testing. With refugee children falling behind or struggling to catch up, it can overwhelm teachers and administrators.\n\nNot all students adjust the same way to their new setting. One student may take only three months, while others may take four years. One study found that even in their fourth year of schooling, Lao and [[Vietnamese boat people|Vietnamese refugee]] students in the US were still in a transitional status.<ref name=\"auto3\">Liem Thanh Nguyen, & Henkin, A.

Furthermore, to provide proper support, educators must consider the experiences of students before they settled the US.\n\nIn their first settlement countries, refugee students may encounter negative experiences with education that they can carry with them post settlement.

This trend is evident across several first settlement countries and carry negative impacts on students once they arrive to their permanent settlement homes, such as the US, and have to navigate a new education system. Unfortunately, some refugees do not have a chance to attend schools in their first settlement countries because they are considered [[Illegal immigration|undocumented immigrants]] in places like Malaysia for [[2015 Rohingya refugee crisis|Rohingya refugees]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> In other cases, such as Burundians in Tanzania, refugees can get more access to education while in displacement than in their home countries.<ref name=\"fransen2018\">{{cite journal|author1= Fransen, S. |author2=Vargas-Silva, C. |author3=M.

With the support of educators and the school community, education can help rebuild the academic, social, and emotional well being of refugee students who have suffered from past and present [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], [[Social exclusion|marginalization]], and [[social alienation]].\n\n===Cultural differences===\nIt is important to understand the cultural differences amongst newly arrived refugees and school culture, such as that of the U.S. This can be seen as problematic because of the frequent disruptions that it can create in a classroom setting.\n\nIn addition, because of the differences in language and culture, students are often placed in lower classes due to their lack of English proficiency.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Students can also be made to repeat classes because of their lack of English proficiency, even if they have mastered the content of the class. When schools have the resources and are able to provide separate classes for refugee students to develop their English skills, it can take the average refugee students only three months to catch up with their peers. This was the case with Somali refugees at some primary schools in Nairobi.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe histories of refugee students are often hidden from educators, resulting in cultural misunderstandings. However, when teachers, school staff, and peers help refugee students develop a positive [[cultural identity]], it can help buffer the negative effects refugees' experiences have on them, such as poor academic performance, isolation, and discrimination.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n==Refugee crisis==\n{{main|Refugee crisis}}\n{{see also|List of countries by refugee population}}\n[[File:South sudan refugees in wau - e - 2016 12.png|thumb|Refugee camp in [[South Sudan]], 2016]]\n[[Refugee crisis]] can refer to movements of large groups of [[displaced person]]s, who could be either [[internally displaced person]]s, refugees or other migrants. It can also refer to incidents in the country of origin or departure, to large problems whilst on the move or even after arrival in a safe country that involve large groups of displaced persons.\n\nIn 2018, the United Nations estimated the number of forcibly displaced people to be 68.5 million worldwide. Of those, 25.4 million are refugees while 40 million are internally displaced within a [[nation state]] and 3.1 million are classified as [[asylum seekers]]. 85% of refugees are hosted in [[developed countries]], with 57% coming from [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[South Sudan]]. [[Turkey]] is the top hosting country of refugees with 3.5 million displaced people within its borders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html|title=UNHCR Figures at a Glance}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, there were 8.4 million UNHCR registered refugees worldwide, the lowest number since 1980. At the end of 2015, there were 16.1 million refugees worldwide. When adding the 5.2 million [[Palestinian refugees]] who are under [[UNRWA]]'s mandate there were 21.3 million refugees worldwide. The overall forced displacement worldwide has reached a total of 65.3 million displaced persons at the end of 2015, while it was 59.5 million 12 months earlier. One in every 113 people globally is an [[asylum seeker]] or a refugee. In 2015, the total number of displaced people worldwide, including refugees, asylum seekers and [[internally displaced persons]], was at its highest level on record.{{sfn|Refugees at highest|2016}}\n\nAmong them, [[Syrian refugees]] were the largest group in 2015 at 4.9 million.{{sfn|Global Trends: Forced|2016}} In 2014, Syrians had overtaken [[Afghan refugees]] (2.7 million), who had been the largest refugee group for three decades.{{sfn|Unhcr  |2015}} Somalis were the third largest group with one million. The countries hosting the largest number of refugees according to UNHCR were [[Turkey]] (2.5 million), [[Pakistan]] (1.6 million), [[Lebanon]] (1.1 million) and [[Iran]] (1 million).{{sfn|Global Trends: Forced|2016}} the countries that had the largest numbers of [[internally displaced people]] were [[Colombia]] at 6.9, [[Syria]] at 6.6 million and [[Iraq]] at 4.4 million.\n\nChildren were 51% of refugees in 2015 and most of them were separated from their parents or travelling alone. In 2015, 86 per cent of the refugees under [[UNHCR]]'s mandate were in low and middle-income countries that themselves are close to situations of conflict.{{sfn|Refugees}} Refugees have historically tended to flee to nearby countries with ethnic kin populations and a history of accepting other co-ethnic refugees.{{sfn|R\u00fcegger|Bohnet|2015}} The [[religion|religious]], [[sect]]arian and [[religious denomination|denominational]] affiliation has been an important feature of debate in refugee-hosting nations.{{sfn|Bassel|2012|page=84}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" |Refugees and people in refugee-like situations by region between 2016 and 2008\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|Region (UN major area)\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|2016{{sfn|Global forced displacement|2016}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|2014{{sfn|Global forced displacement|2014}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|2013{{sfn|Global forced displacement|2013}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|2012{{sfn|Global forced displacement|2012}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|2011{{sfn|Global forced displacement|2011}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|2010{{sfn|Global forced displacement|2010}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|2009{{sfn|Global forced displacement|2009}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"|2008{{sfn|Global forced displacement|2008}}\n|-\n\n|Africa ||5,531,693||4,126,800||3,377,700||3,068,300||2,924,100||2,408,700||2,300,100||2,332,900\n\n|-\n\n|Asia ||8,608,597||7,942,100||6,317,500||5,060,100||5,104,100||5,715,800||5,620,500||5,706,400\n\n|-\n\n|Europe ||2,300,833||1,500,500||1,152,800||1,522,100||1,534,400||1,587,400||1,628,100||1,613,400\n\n|-\n\n|Latin America & Caribbean ||322,403||352,700||382,000||380,700||377,800||373,900||367,400||350,300\n|-\n\n|Northern America ||370,291||416,400||424,000||425,800||429,600||430,100||444,900||453,200\n\n|-\n\n|Oceania ||53,671||46,800||45,300||41,000||34,800||33,800||35,600||33,600\n\n|-\n\n|Total ||17,187,488||14,385,300||11,699,300||10,498,000||10,404,800||10,549,700||10,396,600||10,489,800\n\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Asylum shopping]]\n* [[Conservation refugee]], people displaced when conservation areas are created\n* [[Diaspora]], a mass movement of population, usually forced by war or natural disaster\n* [[Emergencybnb]], a website to find accommodation for refugees\n* [[Emergency evacuation]]\n* [[Forced displacement in popular culture]]\n* [[Homo sacer]], a banned person who may be killed by anybody\n* [[Human migration]]\n* [[Language analysis for the determination of origin]]\n* [[List of refugees]]\n* [[List of people granted asylum]]\n* [[Mehran Karimi Nasseri]], an Iranian refugee who lived in [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]]\n* [[Migrant literature]]\n* [[No person is illegal]], network that represents non-resident immigrants\n* [[Open borders]]\n* [[Political asylum]]\n* [[Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program]] -

Following [[World War II]], and in response to the large numbers of people fleeing Eastern Europe, the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] defined  \"refugee\" (in Article 1.A.2) as any person who:{{sfn|Convention Protocol relating|1967}}\n\n<blockquote>\"owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a [[particular social group]] or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.\"{{sfn|Convention Protocol relating|1967}}</blockquote>\n\nIn 1967, the definition was basically confirmed by the UN [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees]].\n\nThe [[Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa]] expanded the 1951 definition, which the [[Organization of African Unity]] adopted in 1969:<blockquote>\"Every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place outside his country of origin or nationality.\"{{sfn|Assembly of Heads of State and Government (Sixth Ordinary Session)|1969}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe 1984 regional, non-binding Latin-American [[Cartagena Declaration on Refugees]] includes:\n\n<blockquote>\"persons who have fled their country because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order.\"{{sfn|Cartagena Declaration}}</blockquote>\n\nAs of 2011, the UNHCR itself, in addition to the 1951 definition, recognizes persons as refugees:\n\n<blockquote>\"who are outside their country of nationality or habitual residence and unable to return there owing to serious and indiscriminate threats to life, physical integrity or freedom resulting from generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order.\"{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)|2011|p=19}}</blockquote>\n\nEuropean Union's minimum standards definition of refugee, underlined by Art. 2 (c) of Directive No. 2004/83/EC, essentially reproduces the narrow definition of refugee offered by the UN 1951 Convention; nevertheless, by virtue of articles 2 (e) and 15 of the same Directive, persons who have fled a war-caused generalized violence are, at certain conditions, eligible for a complementary form of protection, called [[subsidiary protection]]. The same form of protection is foreseen for displaced people who, without being refugees, are nevertheless exposed, if returned to their countries of origin, to death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatments.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Right of asylum|Sanctuary}}\n[[File:Gysis Nikolaos After the destruction of Psara.jpg|right|thumb|Greeks fleeing the [[Destruction of Psara]] in 1824 (painting by [[Nikolaos Gyzis]]).]]\n[[File:Hercegova\u010dki begunci, Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107.jpg|thumb|right|\"Refugees from Herzegovina\", painting by [[Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107]] in 1889 made in the aftermath of the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)]].]]\nThe idea that a person who sought sanctuary in a holy place could not be harmed without inviting divine retribution was familiar to the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[ancient Egypt]]ians. However, the [[right of asylum|right to seek asylum]] in a church or other holy place was first codified in law by King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] in about AD 600. Similar laws were implemented throughout Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. The related concept of political [[exile]] also has a long history: [[Ovid]] was sent to [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]]; [[Voltaire]] was sent to England. By the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], nations recognized each other's [[sovereignty]]. However, it was not until the advent of [[romantic nationalism]] in late 18th-century Europe that [[nationalism]] gained sufficient prevalence for the phrase ''country of nationality'' to become practically meaningful, and for border crossing to require that people provide identification.\n[[File:Turkish refugees from Edirne.jpg|thumb|right|Turkish refugees from [[Edirne]], 1913]]\n[[File:ArmeniansOnDeportationMarch.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|One million [[Armenians]] were forced to leave their homes in Anatolia in 1915, and many either died or were murdered on their way to Syria.]]\n\nThe term \"refugee\" sometime applies to people who might fit the definition outlined by the 1951 Convention, were it applied retroactively. There are many candidates. For example, after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685 outlawed [[Protestantism]] in France, hundreds of thousands of [[Huguenot]]s fled to England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, [[South Africa]], Germany and [[Prussia]]. The repeated waves of [[pogrom]]s that swept Eastern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries prompted mass Jewish emigration (more than 2 million [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] emigrated in the period 1881\u20131920). Beginning in the 19th century, Muslim people emigrated to Turkey from Europe.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995}} The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913 caused 800,000 people to leave their homes.{{sfn|Greek Turkish refugees}} Various groups of people were officially designated refugees beginning in World War I.\n\n===League of Nations===\n[[File:Spanish War Children001.jpg|thumb|Children preparing for evacuation from Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] between 1936 and 1939.]]\nThe first international co-ordination of refugee affairs came with the creation by the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 of the High Commission for Refugees and the appointment of [[Fridtjof Nansen]] as its head. Nansen and the Commission were charged with assisting the approximately 1,500,000 people who fled the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] (1917\u20131921),{{sfn|Hassell|1991}} p.&nbsp;1. most of them aristocrats fleeing the Communist government.

Its most notable achievement was the [[Nansen passport]], a [[refugee travel document]], for which it was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The Nansen Office was plagued by problems of financing, an increase in refugee numbers, and a lack of co-operation from some member states, which led to mixed success overall.\n\nHowever, the Nansen Office managed to lead fourteen nations to ratify the 1933 Refugee Convention, an early, and relatively modest, attempt at a [[human rights]] charter, and in general assisted around one million refugees worldwide.{{sfn|Nobel Peace Prize}}\n\n===1933 (rise of Nazism) to 1944===\n[[File:Czech refugees from the Sudetenland 1.gif|thumb|right|upright|Czech refugees from the [[Sudetenland]], October 1938]]\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] led to such a very large increase in the number of refugees from Germany that in 1933 the League created a high commission for refugees coming from Germany.

After the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]] on 7 May 1945, the Allies occupied the remainder of Germany, and the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin declaration of 5 June 1945]] confirmed the division of [[Allied-occupied Germany]] according to the Yalta Conference, which stipulated the continued existence of the German Reich as a whole, which would include its [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern territories]] as of 31 December 1937.

When the Allies met in Potsdam on 17 July 1945 at the [[Potsdam Conference]], a chaotic refugee situation faced the occupying powers.

Although significant contributions had been made before, the latter half of the 20th century saw the establishment of institutions dedicated to the study of refugees, such as the Association for the Study of the World Refugee Problem, which was closely followed by the founding of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]. In particular, the 1981 volume of the ''International Migration Review'' defined refugee studies as \"a comprehensive, historical, interdisciplinary and comparative perspective which focuses on the consistencies and patterns in the refugee experience.\"<ref>Stein, Barry N., and Silvano M.

Since no universally accepted definition for the term \"refugee\" exists, the academic respectability of the policy-based definition, as outlined in the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]], is disputed. Additionally, academics have critiqued the lack of a theoretical basis of refugee studies and dominance of policy-oriented research. In response, scholars have attempted to steer the field toward establishing a theoretical groundwork of refugee studies through \"situating studies of particular refugee (and other forced migrant) groups in the theories of cognate areas (and major disciplines), [providing] an opportunity to use the particular circumstances of refugee situations to illuminate these more general theories and thus participate in the development of social science, rather than leading refugee studies into an intellectual cul-de-sac.\"<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Malkki|first=Liisa H.|date=1995|title=Refugees and Exile: From \"Refugee Studies\" to the National Order of Things|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=495\u2013523|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.24.100195.002431|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1413dec66a9a7f7593379d8ffa29884e196953fe}}</ref> Thus, the term ''refugee'' in the context of refugee studies can be referred to as \"legal or descriptive rubric\", encompassing socioeconomic backgrounds, personal histories, psychological analyses, and spiritualities.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==UN Refugee Agency==\n{{Main|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:South Africa-Xenophobia-001.jpg|thumb|UNHCR tents at a refugee camp following episodes of [[Xenophobia in South Africa|xenophobic violence]] and rioting in [[South Africa]], 2008]]\n\nHeadquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) was established on 14 December 1950.

It is difficult to quantify the number of refugees who settled and integrated in their first country of asylum and only the number of naturalisations can give an indication.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 2014 Tanzania granted citizenship to 162,000 refugees from Burundi and in 1982 to 32,000 Rwandan refugees.{{sfn|Markus|2014}} Mexico naturalised 6,200 Guatemalan refugees in 2001.{{sfn|Goldberg|2001}}\n\n====Voluntary return====\n{{Main|Voluntary return}}\n\nVoluntary return of refugees into their country of origin, in safety and dignity, is based on their free will and their informed decision. In the last couple of years parts of or even whole refugee populations were able to return to their home countries: e.g. 120,000 Congolese refugees returned from the Republic of Congo to the DRC,{{sfn|Schmitt|2014}} 30,000 Angolans returned home from the DRC{{sfn|Schmitt|2014}} and Botswana, Ivorian refugees returned from Liberia, Afghans from Pakistan, and Iraqis from Syria. In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of refugees from Somalia.{{sfn|Nairobi to open|2014}} The UNHCR and the IOM offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily to their home countries. Many developed countries also have Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes for asylum seekers who want to go back or were [[Asylum seeker#Refusal of asylum|refused asylum]].\n\n====Third country resettlement====\n{{Main|Third country resettlement}}\n\nThird country resettlement involves the assisted transfer of refugees from the country in which they have sought asylum to a safe third country that has agreed to admit them as refugees. This can be for permanent settlement or limited to a certain number of years. It is the third durable solution and it can only be considered once the two other solutions have proved impossible.{{sfn|What is resettlement?}}{{sfn|Resettlement: new beginning}} The UNHCR has traditionally seen resettlement as the least preferable of the \"durable solutions\" to refugee situations.{{sfn|Understanding Resettlement to|2004}} However, in April 2000 the then UN High Commissioner for Refugees, [[Sadako Ogata]], stated \"Resettlement can no longer be seen as the least-preferred durable solution; in many cases it is the ''only'' solution for refugees.\"{{sfn|Understanding Resettlement to|2004}}\n\n===Internally displaced person===\n{{main|Internally displaced person}}\nUNHCR's mandate has gradually been expanded to include protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to [[internally displaced persons]] (IDPs) and people in IDP-like situations. These are civilians who have been forced to flee their homes, but who have not reached a neighboring country. IDPs do not fit the legal definition of a refugee under the [[1951 Refugee Convention]], [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|1967 Protocol]] and the [[OAU Convention|1969 Organization for African Unity Convention]], because they have not left their country. As the nature of war has changed in the last few decades, with more and more internal conflicts replacing interstate wars, the number of IDPs has increased significantly.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" |Comparison between the number of refugees and IDPs who are supported by the UNHCR between 1998 and 2014.{{sfn|UNHCR|2015}}{{Failed verification|date=May 2019|talk=Semi-protected edit request on 14 May 2019}}\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|End-year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|1996\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2000\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2002\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2004\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2006\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2008\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2010\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2012\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 90px;\"|2014\n|-\n|Refugees||11,480,900 ||12,129,600 ||10,594,100 ||9,574,800 ||9,877,700 ||10,489,800 ||10,549,700 ||10,498,000 ||14,385,300\n|-\n|[[internally displaced person|IDPs]]||5,063,900 ||5,998,500 ||4,646,600 ||5,426,500 ||12,794,300 ||14,442,200 ||14,697,900 ||17,670,400 ||32,274,600\n|}\n\n==Refugee status==\nThe term refugee is often used in different contexts: in everyday usage it refers to a forcibly displaced person who has fled their country of origin; in a more specific context it refers to such a person who was, on top of that, granted refugee status in the country the person fled to. Even more exclusive is the Convention refugee status which is given only to persons who fall within the [[#Legal definitions|refugee definition]] of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol.\n\nTo receive refugee status, a person must have applied for asylum, making them\u2014while waiting for a decision\u2014an asylum seeker. However, a displaced person otherwise legally entitled to refugee status may never apply for asylum, or may not be allowed to apply in the country they fled to and thus may not have official asylum seeker status.\n\nOnce a displaced person is granted refugee status they enjoy certain [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees#Rights and responsibilities of parties to the Refugee Convention|rights]] as agreed in the 1951 Refugee convention. Not all countries have signed and ratified this convention and some countries do not have a legal procedure for dealing with asylum seekers.\n\n===Seeking asylum===\n{{main|Asylum seeker}}\n[[File:Erstaufnahmelager Jenfelder Moorpark 4.jpg|thumb|Erstaufnahmelager [[Hamburg|Jenfelder]] Moorpark]]\n\nAn asylum seeker is a displaced person or immigrant who has formally sought the protection of the state they fled to as well as the right to remain in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for [[Asylum seeker#Complementary forms of protection|complementary forms of protection]]. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the [[Refugee#Legal definition|legal definition]] that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker receives either Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection, and can stay in the country\u2014or is refused asylum, and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR\u2014wherever the application was made\u2014recognises the protection needs does the asylum seeker ''officially'' receive refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations, according to the legislation of the receiving country.\n\n{{anchor|Qouta}}[[Quota refugee]]s do not need to apply for asylum on arrival in the third countries as they already went through the UNHCR refugee status determination process whilst being in the first country of asylum and this is usually accepted by the third countries.\n\n===Refugee status determination===\n[[File:The Sahrawi refugees&nbsp;\u2013 a forgotten crisis in the Algerian desert (7).jpg|thumb|For over 30 years, several tens of thousands of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] refugees have been living in the region of [[Tindouf, Algeria]], in the heart of the desert.]]\n{{see|Refugee law#Refugee status determination|Asylum seeker#Status determination processes}}\nTo receive refugee status, a displaced person must go through a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) process, which is conducted by the government of the country of asylum or the UNHCR, and is based on [[Refugee law|international, regional]] or national law.{{sfn|Refugee Status Determination}} RSD can be done on a case by case basis as well as for whole groups of people. Which of the [[Asylum seeker#Status determination processes|two processes]] is used often depends on the size of the influx of displaced persons.\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 117.png|thumb|After challenging Queen Jezebel, Elijah takes refuge in a cave until the voice of God calls him in this 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nThere is no specific method mandated for RSD (apart from the commitment to the [[1951 Refugee Convention]]) and it is subject to the overall efficacy of the country's internal administrative and judicial system as well as the characteristics of the refugee flow to which the country responds. This lack of a procedural direction could create a situation where political and strategic interests override humanitarian considerations in the RSD process.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|pp=71\u201393}} There are also no fixed interpretations of the elements in the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] and countries may interpret them differently (see also [[refugee roulette]]).\n\nHowever, in 2013, the UNHCR conducted them in more than 50 countries and co-conducted them parallel to or jointly with governments in another 20 countries, which made it the second largest RSD body in the world{{sfn|Refugee Status Determination}} The UNHCR follows a set of guidelines described in the ''Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status'' to determine which individuals are eligible for refugee status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/4d93528a9.pdf|title=Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees}}</ref>\n\n==Refugee rights==\n{{Main|Refugee law}}\n\nRefugee rights encompass both customary law, [[peremptory norm]]s, and international legal instruments. If the entity granting refugee status is a state that has signed the 1951 Refugee Convention then the refugee has the [[Refugee employment|right to employment]]. Further rights include the following rights and obligations for refugees:\n\n===Right of return===\n{{Main|Right of return}}\nEven in a supposedly \"post-conflict\" environment, it is not a simple process for refugees to return home.<ref name=\"ODI\">Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4409&title=uncharted-territory-land-conflict-humanitarian-action Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> The UN Pinheiro Principles are guided by the idea that people not only have the right to return home, but also the right to the same property.<ref name=\"ODI\"/> It seeks to return to the pre-conflict status quo and ensure that no one profits from violence. Yet this is a very complex issue and every situation is different; conflict is a highly transformative force and the pre-war status-quo can never be reestablished completely, even if that were desirable (it may have caused the conflict in the first place).<ref name=\"ODI\"/> Therefore, the following are of particular importance to the right to return:<ref name=\"ODI\"/>\n* May never have had property (e.g., in Afghanistan)\n* Cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan)\n* Ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue\n* Death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land\n* People settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste)\n* Have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan).\nRefugees who were [[third country resettlement|resettled to a third country]] will likely lose the indefinite leave to remain in this country if they return to their country of origin or the country of first asylum.\n\n===Right to non-refoulement===\n{{Main|Non-refoulement}}\nNon-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.{{sfn|Convention relating to}} The right to non-refoulement is distinct from the right to asylum. To respect the right to asylum, states must not deport genuine refugees. In contrast, the right to non-refoulement allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records. The portable procedural model, proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey, emphasizes the right to non-refoulement by guaranteeing refugees three procedural rights (to a verbal hearing, to legal counsel, and to judicial review of detention decisions) and ensuring those rights in the constitution.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|pages=232\u2013266}} This proposal attempts to strike a balance between the interest of national governments and the interests of refugees.\n\n===Right to family reunification===\n{{Main|Family reunification}}\n\nFamily reunification (which can also be a form of resettlement) is a recognized reason for immigration in many countries. [[Divided family|Divided families]] have the right to be reunited if a family member with permanent right of residency applies for the reunification and can prove the people on the application were a family unit before arrival and wish to live as a family unit since separation. If application is successful this enables the rest of the family to immigrate to that country as well.\n\n===Right to travel===\n{{Main|Refugee travel document}}\nThose states that signed the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] are obliged to issue travel documents (i.e. \"Convention Travel Document\") to refugees lawfully residing in their territory.{{efn-ua|Under Article 28 of the Convention.}} It is a valid travel document in place of a passport, however, it cannot be used to travel to the country of origin, i.e. from where the refugee fled.\n\n===Restriction of onward movement===\nOnce refugees or asylum seekers have found a safe place and protection of a state or territory outside their territory of origin they are discouraged from leaving again and seeking protection in another country. If they do move onward into a second country of asylum this movement is also called ''\"irregular movement\"'' by the UNHCR (see also [[asylum shopping]]). UNHCR support in the second country may be less than in the first country and they can even be returned to the first country.{{sfn|Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme|1989}}\n\n==World Refugee Day==\n\n[[World Refugee Day]] has occurred annually on 20 June since 2000 by a special United Nations General Assembly Resolution. 20 June had previously been commemorated as \"African Refugee Day\" in a number of African countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom World Refugee Day is celebrated as part of [[Refugee Week]].

These long-term mental problems can severely impede the functionality of the person in everyday situations; it makes matters even worse for displaced persons who are confronted with a new environment and challenging situations. They are also at high risk for [[suicide]].{{sfn|Suicide pact|2002}}\n\nAmong other symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder involves [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], over-alertness, sleeplessness, [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], motor difficulties, failing [[short term memory]], [[amnesia]], nightmares and sleep-paralysis. Flashbacks are characteristic to the disorder: the patient experiences the [[traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic event]], or pieces of it, again and again. Depression is also characteristic for PTSD-patients and may also occur without accompanying PTSD.\n\nPTSD was diagnosed in 34.1% of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] children, most of whom were refugees, [[male]]s, and working. The participants were 1,000 children aged 12 to 16 years from governmental, private, and United Nations Relief Work Agency [[UNRWA]] schools in East Jerusalem and various governorates in the West Bank.{{sfn|Khamis|2005|pp=81\u201395}}\n\nAnother study showed that 28.3% of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] refugee women had symptoms of PTSD three or four years after their arrival in Sweden. These women also had significantly higher [[risk]]s of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress than Swedish-born women. For depression the odds ratio was 9.50 among Bosnian women.{{sfn|Sundquist|Johansson|DeMarinis|Johansson|2005|pp=158\u201364}}\n\nA study by the Department of Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine at the [[Boston University]] School of Medicine demonstrated that twenty percent of Sudanese refugee minors living in the United States had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. They were also more likely to have worse scores on all the Child Health Questionnaire subscales.{{sfn|Geltman|Grant-Knight|Mehta|Lloyd-Travaglini|2005|pp=585\u201391}}\n\nIn a study for the United Kingdom, refugees were found to be 4 percentage points more likely to report a mental health problem compared to the non-immigrant population. This contrasts with the results for other immigrant groups, which were less likely to report a mental health problem compared to the non-immigrant population.<ref name=\"giuntella2018\" />\n\nMany more studies illustrate the problem. One [[meta-study]] was conducted by the psychiatry department of [[Oxford University]] at Warneford Hospital in the United Kingdom. Twenty [[Statistical survey|surveys]] were analyzed, providing results for 6,743 adult refugees from seven countries. In the larger studies, 9% were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 5% with major depression, with evidence of much psychiatric co-morbidity. Five surveys of 260 refugee children from three countries yielded a [[prevalence]] of 11% for post-traumatic stress disorder. According to this study, refugees resettled in Western countries could be about ten times more likely to have PTSD than age-matched general populations in those countries. Worldwide, tens of thousands of refugees and former refugees resettled in Western countries probably have post-traumatic stress disorder.{{sfn|Fazel|Wheeler|Danesh|2005|pp=1309\u201314}}\n\n====Malaria====\nRefugees are often more susceptible to illness for several reasons, including a lack of immunity to local strains of [[malaria]] and other diseases. Displacement of a people can create favorable conditions for disease transmission. Refugee camps are typically heavily populated with poor sanitary conditions. The removal of vegetation for space, building materials or firewood also deprives mosquitoes of their natural habitats, leading them to more closely interact with humans.{{sfn|Kazmi|Pandit|2001|pp=1043\u20131055}} In the 1970s, Afghani refugees that were relocated to Pakistan were going from a country with an effective malaria control strategy, to a country with a less effective system.\n\nThe refugee camps were built near rivers or irrigation sites had higher malaria prevalence than refugee camps built on dry lands.{{sfn|Rowland|Rab|Freeman|Durrani|2002|pp=2061\u20132072}}\nThe location of the camps lent themselves to better breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and thus a higher likelihood of malaria transmission. Children aged 1\u201315 were the most susceptible to malaria infection, which is a significant cause of mortality in children younger than 5.{{sfn|Karim|Hussain|Malik|Lee|2016|pp=1\u201312}} Malaria was the cause of 16% of the deaths in refugee children younger than 5 years of age.{{sfn|Mertans|Hall|2000|pp=103\u20139}} Malaria is one of the most commonly reported causes of death in refugees and displaced persons. Since 2014, reports of malaria cases in Germany had doubled compared to previous years, with the majority of cases found in refugees from Eritrea.{{sfn|Roggelin|Tappe|Noack|Addo|2016|p=325}}\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that all people in areas that are endemic for malaria use long-lasting insecticide nets.{{sfn|Fact sheet Malaria}} A cohort study found that within refugee camps in Pakistan, insecticide treated bed nets were very useful in reducing malaria cases. A single treatment of the nets with the insecticide [[permethrin]] remained protective throughout the 6 month transmission season.{{sfn|Kolaczinski|2004|pp=15}}\n\n===Access to healthcare services===\nAccess to services depends on many factors, including whether a refugee has received official status, is situated within a refugee camp, or is in the process of third country resettlement.

There can be instances of exploitation at the hands of enforcement officials, citizens of the host country, and even United Nations peacekeepers. Instances of human rights violations, child labor, mental and physical trauma/torture, violence-related trauma, and [[Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response|sexual exploitation]], especially of children, have been documented. In many refugee camps in three war-torn West African countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, young girls were found to be exchanging sex for money, a handful of fruit, or even a bar of soap. Most of these girls were between 13 and 18 years of age. In most cases, if the girls had been forced to stay, they would have been forced into marriage. They became pregnant around the age of 15 on average. This happened as recently as in 2001. Parents tended to turn a blind eye because sexual exploitation had become a \"mechanism of survival\" in these camps.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2005|pp=514\u2013525}}\n\nLarge groups of displaced persons could be abused as [[refugees as weapons|\"weapons\"]] to threaten or political enemies or neighbouring countries.\n\n===Security threats===\nVery rarely, refugees have been used and recruited as refugee [[militant]]s or [[terrorist]]s,{{sfn|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)|1999}} and the humanitarian aid directed at refugee relief has very rarely been utilized to fund the acquisition of arms.{{sfn|Crisp|1999}} Support from a refugee-receiving state has rarely been used to enable refugees to mobilize militarily, enabling conflict to spread across borders.{{sfn|Weiss|1999|pp=1\u201322}}\n\nHistorically, refugee populations have often been portrayed as a security threat.

Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and [[Immigration|immigrant]] students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.\n\nAside from students, teachers and school staff also face their own obstacles in working with refugee students. They have concerns about their ability to meet the mental, physical, emotional, and educational needs of students. One study of newly arrived [[Bantus (Somalia)|Bantu]] students from Somalia in a Chicago school questioned whether schools were equipped to provide them with a quality education that met the needs of the pupils. The students were not aware of how to use pencils, which caused them to break the tips requiring frequent sharpening. Teachers may even see refugee students as different from other immigrant groups, as was the case with the Bantu pupils.<ref>Birman, D., & Tran, N. (2015). The Academic Engagement of Newly Arriving Somali Bantu Students in a U.S. Elementary School. Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute.</ref> Teachers may sometimes feel that their work is made harder because of the pressures to meet [[Standards-based education reform in the United States|state requirements]] for testing. With refugee children falling behind or struggling to catch up, it can overwhelm teachers and administrators.\n\nNot all students adjust the same way to their new setting. One student may take only three months, while others may take four years. One study found that even in their fourth year of schooling, Lao and [[Vietnamese boat people|Vietnamese refugee]] students in the US were still in a transitional status.<ref name=\"auto3\">Liem Thanh Nguyen, & Henkin, A.

Furthermore, to provide proper support, educators must consider the experiences of students before they settled the US.\n\nIn their first settlement countries, refugee students may encounter negative experiences with education that they can carry with them post settlement.

This trend is evident across several first settlement countries and carry negative impacts on students once they arrive to their permanent settlement homes, such as the US, and have to navigate a new education system. Unfortunately, some refugees do not have a chance to attend schools in their first settlement countries because they are considered [[Illegal immigration|undocumented immigrants]] in places like Malaysia for [[2015 Rohingya refugee crisis|Rohingya refugees]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> In other cases, such as Burundians in Tanzania, refugees can get more access to education while in displacement than in their home countries.<ref name=\"fransen2018\">{{cite journal|author1= Fransen, S. |author2=Vargas-Silva, C. |author3=M.

Furthermore, they have a learning centered [[pedagogy]], which promotes the idea that there are multiple entry points to engage the students in learning.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Both strategies have helped refugee students succeed during their transition into US schools.\n\nVarious websites contain resources that can help school staff better learn to work with refugee students such as [http://www.brycs.org/publications/schools-toolkit.cfm Bridging Refugee Youth and Children's Services]. With the support of educators and the school community, education can help rebuild the academic, social, and emotional well being of refugee students who have suffered from past and present [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], [[Social exclusion|marginalization]], and [[social alienation]].\n\n===Cultural differences===\nIt is important to understand the cultural differences amongst newly arrived refugees and school culture, such as that of the U.S. This can be seen as problematic because of the frequent disruptions that it can create in a classroom setting.\n\nIn addition, because of the differences in language and culture, students are often placed in lower classes due to their lack of English proficiency.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Students can also be made to repeat classes because of their lack of English proficiency, even if they have mastered the content of the class. When schools have the resources and are able to provide separate classes for refugee students to develop their English skills, it can take the average refugee students only three months to catch up with their peers. This was the case with Somali refugees at some primary schools in Nairobi.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe histories of refugee students are often hidden from educators, resulting in cultural misunderstandings. However, when teachers, school staff, and peers help refugee students develop a positive [[cultural identity]], it can help buffer the negative effects refugees' experiences have on them, such as poor academic performance, isolation, and discrimination.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n==Refugee crisis==\n{{main|Refugee crisis}}\n{{see also|List of countries by refugee population}}\n[[File:South sudan refugees in wau - e - 2016 12.png|thumb|Refugee camp in [[South Sudan]], 2016]]\n[[Refugee crisis]] can refer to movements of large groups of [[displaced person]]s, who could be either [[internally displaced person]]s, refugees or other migrants.
