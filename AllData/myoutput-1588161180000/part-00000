As a large valley with significant differences in geo-location among various districts, the [[weather]] is often cooler in the hilly areas compared to the flat lower part.\n\nSummer is usually mild and fairly dry, but [[relative humidity]] is generally high and the nights are cool. The [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs throughout the year and no month is particularly dry. The hottest month is July (mean minimum temperature 16&nbsp;\u00b0C, mean maximum temperature 32&nbsp;\u00b0C) and the coldest are December\u2013January (mean minimum temperature \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C, mean maximum temperature 0&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nCompared with other plain parts of India, Kashmir valley enjoys a more moderate climate but weather conditions are unpredictable. The recorded high temperature is 33&nbsp;\u00b0C and the recorded low is \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 5 and 6 January 2012, after years of relatively little snow, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures ([[winter storm]]) shocked the valley covering it in a thick layer of snow and ice.\n\nKashmir Valley has seen an increase in relative humidity and annual precipitation in the last few years. This is most likely because of the commercial afforestation projects which also include expanding parks and green cover.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\" caption=\"Different seasons and climatic conditions in Kashmir\">\nImage:Kashmir autumn.jpg|Autumn\nImage:Kashmir winter.jpg|Winter\nImage:Kashmir Spring.jpg|Spring\nImage:Kashmir summer.jpg|Summer\n</gallery>\n\n==Tourism==\n{{Main article|Tourism in Jammu and Kashmir}}\n[[File:Gulmarg-Gondala.JPG|thumb|right|Skiing is popular in [[Gulmarg]], showing cable car in a snow clad mountain]]\nKashmir valley is a popular tourist destination for domestic and foreign tourists.

Other main cities are [[:Baramulla]], [[:Anantnag]],\n[[Pulwama]].\n\n==Politics==\nThe major political parties in the region are the [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]], the [[Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party]] and the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]. [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has very little presence in Kashmir Valley but is dominant in the Hindu-majority Jammu region. Srinagar in the valley is the summer capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The capital moves out of the valley in the winter to [[Jammu]] in a grand ceremony called [[Darbar Move]].\n\n==Climate==\n\n{{climate chart\n| Srinagar\n| \u22122 | 7 | 48\n| \u22120.7 | 8.2 | 68\n| 3.4 | 14.1 | 121\n| 7.9 | 20.5 | 85\n| 10.8 | 24.5 | 68\n| 14.9 | 29.6 | 39\n| 18.1 | 30.1 | 62\n| 17.5 | 29.6 | 76\n| 12.1 | 27.4 | 28\n| 5.8 | 22.4 | 33\n| 0.9 | 15.1 | 28\n| \u22121.5 | 8.2 | 54\n| source = HKO <ref name = HKO>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/asia/india/srinagar_e.htm\n| title = Climatological Information for Srinagar, India\n| publisher = [[Hong Kong Observatory]]\n| accessdate = 2012-06-09\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406095303/http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/asia/india/srinagar_e.htm\n| archive-date = 6 April 2012\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref> }}\n\nKashmir Valley has a moderate climate, which is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering [[Karakoram Range]] in the north, [[Pir Panjal Range]] in the south and west and [[Zanskar Range]] in the east.<ref name=\"Kashmir surrounded\">{{cite book | author=Sharad Singh Negi | title=Geo-botany of India | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oy-1AAAAIAAJ&q=Kashmir+valley+pir+panjal,+zanaskar,+korakaram&dq=Kashmir+valley+pir+panjal,+zanaskar,+korakaram&cd=1 | accessdate=11 July 2012 |year=1986 | publisher=Periodical Expert Book Agency, 1986 | isbn= | page=58\u2013}}</ref> It can be generally described as cool in the spring and autumn, mild in the summer and cold in the winter. As a large valley with significant differences in geo-location among various districts, the [[weather]] is often cooler in the hilly areas compared to the flat lower part.\n\nSummer is usually mild and fairly dry, but [[relative humidity]] is generally high and the nights are cool. The [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs throughout the year and no month is particularly dry. The hottest month is July (mean minimum temperature 16&nbsp;\u00b0C, mean maximum temperature 32&nbsp;\u00b0C) and the coldest are December\u2013January (mean minimum temperature \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C, mean maximum temperature 0&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nCompared with other plain parts of India, Kashmir valley enjoys a more moderate climate but weather conditions are unpredictable. The recorded high temperature is 33&nbsp;\u00b0C and the recorded low is \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 5 and 6 January 2012, after years of relatively little snow, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures ([[winter storm]]) shocked the valley covering it in a thick layer of snow and ice.\n\nKashmir Valley has seen an increase in relative humidity and annual precipitation in the last few years. This is most likely because of the commercial afforestation projects which also include expanding parks and green cover.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\" caption=\"Different seasons and climatic conditions in Kashmir\">\nImage:Kashmir autumn.jpg|Autumn\nImage:Kashmir winter.jpg|Winter\nImage:Kashmir Spring.jpg|Spring\nImage:Kashmir summer.jpg|Summer\n</gallery>\n\n==Tourism==\n{{Main article|Tourism in Jammu and Kashmir}}\n[[File:Gulmarg-Gondala.JPG|thumb|right|Skiing is popular in [[Gulmarg]], showing cable car in a snow clad mountain]]\nKashmir valley is a popular tourist destination for domestic and foreign tourists. Among the popular tourist places in the valley are [[Gulmarg]] that has a ski resort, [[Dal Lake]] that has popular house boats, [[Pahalgam]] and the major [[Hindu]] shrine [[Amarnath Temple]].\n\nBefore insurgency intensified in 1989, tourism formed an important part of the Kashmiri economy. As a result, the tourism economy in the Kashmir valley was worst hit. Thousands of Hindu [[pilgrim]]s visit holy shrine of [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]] every year and this significantly benefits the state's economy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200709130350.htm |work=Online edition of The Hindu, dated 13 September 2007 |title=Amarnath Board to study yatra impact on Kashmir economy |accessdate=9 June 2012 |date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109091413/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200709130350.htm |archivedate= 9 November 2012 }}</ref> \n\nTourism in the Kashmir valley had rebounded at the turn of the century.

The traditional [[wazwan]] feast involves cooking meat or vegetables, usually mutton, in several different ways.\n\nAlcohol is not consumed by many Muslims in the valley. There are two styles of making tea in the region: [[Noon Chai]] or salt tea that is pink in colour (known as chinen posh rang or peach flower colour) and popular with locals, and [[kahwah]], a tea for festive occasions, made with [[saffron]] and spices (cardamom, cinnamon, sugar, noon chai leaves) and black tea.\n\n==Transport==\nKashmir valley is connected to Jammu and Ladakh regions by road and air. It has access to [[Jammu]] region and the rest of India through the [[Banihal]] road tunnel near [[Qazigund]] on national highway [[National Highway 1A (India)|NH 1A]] and through [[National Highway 1B (India, old numbering)|NH 1B]] that passes through [[Sinthan top|Sinthan pass]] and [[Kishtwar]].\n\n[[Srinagar]] is the main airport in Kashmir valley and has scheduled flights from Jammu, Leh, Mumbai, Chandigarh and New Delhi. Kashmir valley has a {{convert|119|km|abbr=on|0}} long modern [[Jammu\u2013Baramulla line|railway]] line that started in October 2009 and connects Baramulla in the western part of the valley to Srinagar and [[Qazigund]]. It further links the Kashmir Valley to Banihal across the Pir Panjal mountains through the new 11.215&nbsp;km (7 mile) long [[Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel]] or Banihal rail tunnel from 26 June 2013. Banihal railway station will be linked to the rest of India in another few years as the construction of the railway line from Jammu to Banihal progresses steadily. Transport within the valley is predominantly by road.Other airports are in [[Udhampur]], [[Leh]] and [[Jammu]]. Another airport is proposed in Anantnag.\n\n==Cities and towns==\n* [[Downtown Srinagar]]\n* [[Lal Bazar]]\n* [[Lal Chowk]]\n* [[Srinagar]]\n* [[Kulgam]]\n* [[Sopore]]\n* [[Kupwara]]\n* [[Pulwama]]\n* [[Baramulla]]\n* [[Anantnag]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://kashmirdivision.nic.in/ Kashmir Division Administration]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/divisionalcommissioner.kashmir Kashmir Divisional Commissioner]\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline}}\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312921/Vale-of-Kashmir Vale of Kashmir]\n\n{{Kashmir Valley}}\n\n{{Jammu and Kashmir topics}}\n\n{{coord|34.0333|N|74.6667|E|source:wikidata-and-enwiki-cat-tree_region:IN|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Valleys of Jammu and Kashmir]]\n[[Category:River valleys of India]]\n[[Category:Jammu and Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmir]]\n", "name_user": "DrKay", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Valley"}
