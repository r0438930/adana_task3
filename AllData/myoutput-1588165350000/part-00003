The creation of the school was in response to widespread fears that the inadequacy of the French political and diplomatic corps would further diminish the country's international stature, as France grappled with a series of crises, including the defeat in the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]], the demise of [[Napoleon III]], and the upheaval and massacre resulting from [[Paris Commune]].

Even though eight of thirteen ministers in De Gaulle's government, including Debr\u00e9 himself, were Sciences Po alumni, a significant reform of the university seemed inevitable, as it had been instrumental in training the class of leaders whom many accused of complacency in face of Nazi aggression. Communist politicians including [[Georges Cogniot]] proposed abolishing the ELSP entirely and founding a new state-run administration college on its premises.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false |title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199256464 |location=Oxford |page=138 |last1=Nord |first1=Philip}}</ref>\n\nDebr\u00e9 proposed the compromise that was eventually adopted. First, the government established the [[Ecole Nationale d'Administration]] (ENA), an elite postgraduate college for training government officials. From then on, the Grands Corps de l'Etat were obliged to recruit new entrants from ENA.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false |title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199256464 |location=Oxford |page=141 |last1=Nord |first1=Philip}}</ref> The change, however, had little impact on Sciences Po's central role in educating the French elite.

Both entities were tasked by the French government to ensure \"the progress and the spread, both within and outside France, of political science, economics, and sociology\".<ref name=\"purpose\" /> FNSP, a private foundation that receives generous subsidies from the government, manages the ''IEP de Paris'', owns its buildings and libraries, and determines its budget. The two entities work together in lockstep, however, as the director of the school is, by tradition, also the administrator of FNSP. This institutional arrangement gives Sciences Po a unique status, as the school draws much of its resources through substantial government subsidies to FNSP, but does not subject it to many government interventions and regulations, giving it a much higher level of autonomy compared to other French universities and schools.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The epithet ''Sciences Po'' is applied to both entities, which inherited the reputation previously vested in ''ELSP''.<ref name=\"duality\">\"Le statut juridique de Sciences Po: la dualit\u00e9 FNSP et IEP de Paris\" ''[http://www.sciences-po.fr/presse/sciencespo_infos/cc/txt_1.htm Centre d'histoire de Sciences Po]''</ref>\n\nThe public-private nature of Sciences Po, Paris, also distinguishes it from a network of [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques|institutes of political studies]] throughout the country that were inspired by its curriculum, but that do not enjoy the same level of autonomy and prestige, namely in [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Lyon|Lyon]], [[Sciences Po Aix|Aix]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[Grenoble Institute of Political Studies|Grenoble]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse|Toulouse]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Rennes|Rennes]] and [[Sciences Po Lille|Lille]].

Even though eight of thirteen ministers in De Gaulle's government, including Debr\u00e9 himself, were Sciences Po alumni, a significant reform of the university seemed inevitable, as it had been instrumental in training the class of leaders whom many accused of complacency in face of Nazi aggression. Communist politicians including [[Georges Cogniot]] proposed abolishing the ELSP entirely and founding a new state-run administration college on its premises.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false |title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199256464 |location=Oxford |page=138 |last1=Nord |first1=Philip}}</ref>\n\nDebr\u00e9 proposed the compromise that was eventually adopted. First, the government established the [[Ecole Nationale d'Administration]] (ENA), an elite postgraduate college for training government officials. From then on, the Grands Corps de l'Etat were obliged to recruit new entrants from ENA.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false |title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199256464 |location=Oxford |page=141 |last1=Nord |first1=Philip}}</ref> The change, however, had little impact on Sciences Po's central role in educating the French elite.

Both entities were tasked by the French government to ensure \"the progress and the spread, both within and outside France, of political science, economics, and sociology\".<ref name=\"purpose\" /> FNSP, a private foundation that receives generous subsidies from the government, manages the ''IEP de Paris'', owns its buildings and libraries, and determines its budget. The two entities work together in lockstep, however, as the director of the school is, by tradition, also the administrator of FNSP. This institutional arrangement gives Sciences Po a unique status, as the school draws much of its resources through substantial government subsidies to FNSP, but does not subject it to many government interventions and regulations, giving it a much higher level of autonomy compared to other French universities and schools.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The epithet ''Sciences Po'' is applied to both entities, which inherited the reputation previously vested in ''ELSP''.<ref name=\"duality\">\"Le statut juridique de Sciences Po: la dualit\u00e9 FNSP et IEP de Paris\" ''[http://www.sciences-po.fr/presse/sciencespo_infos/cc/txt_1.htm Centre d'histoire de Sciences Po]''</ref>\n\nThe public-private nature of Sciences Po, Paris, also distinguishes it from a network of [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques|institutes of political studies]] throughout the country that were inspired by its curriculum, but that do not enjoy the same level of autonomy and prestige, namely in [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Lyon|Lyon]], [[Sciences Po Aix|Aix]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[Grenoble Institute of Political Studies|Grenoble]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse|Toulouse]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Rennes|Rennes]] and [[Sciences Po Lille|Lille]].
