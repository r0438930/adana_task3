==History==
Van Nuys High School opened in 1914, four years after [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]] was established.<ref>[http://search.lausd.k12.ca.us/cgi-bin/fccgi.exe?w3exec=school.profile.content&which=8893 LAUSD School Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For years the only high schools in the Valley were Van Nuys, Owensmouth (now Canoga Park), San Fernando, and North Hollywood.  The main buildings and auditorium were built in 1933, incorporating remnants of the 1915 building which had been destroyed in the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|Long Beach earthquake]].  The football and track stadium, originally built at the same time as the current high school, is named for [[Bob Waterfield]], and the baseball field for [[Don Drysdale]], the two most famous athletes to have played for VNHS.

For the 1998–1999 [[Scholastic Assessment Test]] (SAT), Van Nuys high had a 537 average on the verbal portion and a 568 on the mathematics portion, giving it the highest SAT scores in the LAUSD that year.<ref>Sauerwein, Kristina. \"[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/01/local/me-5722 SAT Scores Find Valley School at Top : Exam: Van Nuys High posts highest average in LAUSD. Two other area schools also surpass national and state averages in math and verbal portions.]\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. September 1, 1999. Retrieved on March 23, 2014.</ref>

The [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] ordered Van Nuys High School to convert to year-round scheduling in 2001, due to such reasons as overcrowding. Even though this relieved the overcrowding at the school, the Magnet Programs separated tracks, along with the residential students. The Performing Arts Magnet and the Medical Magnet were only available on the A-Track Schedule, while the Math and Science Magnet was only available on the C-Track Schedule. B-Trackers could not take the same classes as C-Trackers, while C-Trackers could only take certain A-Track classes. Teachers that had both A-Track and C-Track students were frustrated because the curriculum had to be synchronized with both tracks.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Van Nuys High School returned to the Traditional School Calendar in 2005.  The switch was caused by a decline in the school population and by a new district policy to eliminate year-round schools whenever possible.

The opening of [[Panorama High School]] in October 2006,<ref>http://www.laschools.org/project-status/one-project?project_number=55A67308</ref> relieved overcrowding at Van Nuys High School.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laschools.org/news/item?item_id=3780496|title=News Corner|website=www.laschools.org|access-date=2017-10-19}}</ref>

Van Nuys has a newly created history bowl team {{as of|2019|lc=on}}, and has placed in playoffs on its first year of competing.{{cite needed|date=September 2019}}

==Community Adult School==
The Adult School is on the same campus as Van Nuys High School. It allows adults as well as high school students to take classes. Most Van Nuys High School students take courses in the Adult School for academic remediation. However, some take classes for Counselor-Identified High School Credit Deficiencies, while others take classes for personal necessities of flexible scheduling.

The Adult School is considered a work-at-your-own-pace program. A student can finish an entire course in just 2–3 weeks, but can take longer depending on the work effort of the student.

==Athletics==
In baseball Van Nuys High qualified for postseason play. The following time the school's team qualified was in 1989, after a 9–7 victory over [[Birmingham High School]] at the Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Recreation Center.<ref>\"[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-24/sports/sp-192_1_van-nuys-high High School Baseball : Van Nuys Makes It a Day for Firsts].\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|A Greek hoplite, armed with spear and shield]]
'''Hoplology''' is a science that studies human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word ''hoplology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hoplos'' (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον ''hóplon'', a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece.  The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.<ref name=\"hacc1\" />  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F. Draeger]].<ref name=\"hacc1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplology.com/articles_detail.asp?id=9|title=Hoplology and Combative Culture: Part 1|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Wiley|first=Mark V.|publisher=The International Hoplology Society}}</ref>

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of \"arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial\" (Burton, 1884),<ref>Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=History+of+swords&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&q=History%20of%20swords&f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]</ref> and subsequently as \"the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity\" (Draeger, 1982).<ref name=\"hoplology.com\">International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007</ref>

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as \"the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours.\"<ref>Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&pg=PA184&dq=hoplology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&q=hoplology&f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]</ref>

More recently, hoplology is defined as the investigation and analysis of all forms of armed combat. It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.

==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==
Several pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.  A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution.  Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).

Hoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals “ A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.” London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And “A New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.” London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman’s  “The Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.” London: Archibald Constable & CO.

During the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (\"IHS\") was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or “ryu.”<ref>Masters Magazine Spring 2019 pg 35</ref>. 

During the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of  academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions.  One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings.  In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies. 

More recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons. Ethnographies such as Michael Ryan's [https://www.amazon.com/Venezuelan-Stick-Fighting-Civilizing-Process/dp/1498533205 Venezuelan Stick Fighting: The Civilizing Process in Martial Arts (2016)]. Philip Forde’s recently completed doctoral dissertation “Blocking both Hand and Foot: An Examination of Bajan Sticklicking” (2018) is another informative work. Avron Boretz’s [https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Ghosts-Gangsters-Violence-Masculinity/dp/0824834917 Gods, Ghosts, and Gangsters: Ritual Violence, Martial Arts and Masculinity on the Margins of Chinese Society] (2011) describes Kung Fu training with working-class men and petty criminals in rural Taiwan. Pentjak Silat on the island of Java was explored by Lee Wilson in [https://www.amazon.com/Indonesia-Verhandelingen-Koninklijk-Instituut-Volmenkunde/dp/9004287736 Martial Arts and the Body Politic in Indonesia] (2015).

In 2017 we saw an emergence of a New Hoplology, pioneered by The Immersion Projects. Immersion Projects continue to lead multiple expeditions, sponsor symposiums and launched a new journal<ref>The Immersion Review, www.TheImmersionMedia.com/review</ref> focused on the study of combat.

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accoutrements and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.<ref name=\"hoplology.com\"/>

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.<ref name=\"Meron Langsner\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&pg=PA112 |first=Meron |last=Langsner|title=Text & Presentation |date=2006 |publisher=McFarland |editor-first=Stratos E. |editor-last=Constantinidi |ISBN=0786455411 |chapter=Chapter 10. Theatre Hoplology: simulations and representations of violence on the stage |page=112}}</ref>  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print</ref>

==Current Trends - The New Hoplology==
In 2018 a group of academics and veteran martial artists came together to explore the roots of bodily movements with weapons to uncover any underlying principles that shape all combat. Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. 

=== The Expeditions ===

[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|A Greek hoplite, armed with spear and shield]]
'''Hoplology''' is a science that studies human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word ''hoplology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hoplos'' (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον ''hóplon'', a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece.  The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.<ref name=\"hacc1\" />  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F. Draeger]].<ref name=\"hacc1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplology.com/articles_detail.asp?id=9|title=Hoplology and Combative Culture: Part 1|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Wiley|first=Mark V.|publisher=The International Hoplology Society}}</ref>

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of \"arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial\" (Burton, 1884),<ref>Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=History+of+swords&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&q=History%20of%20swords&f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]</ref> and subsequently as \"the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity\" (Draeger, 1982).<ref name=\"hoplology.com\">International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007</ref>

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as \"the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours.\"<ref>Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&pg=PA184&dq=hoplology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&q=hoplology&f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]</ref>

More recently, hoplology is defined as the investigation and analysis of all forms of armed combat. It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.

==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==
Several pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.  A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution.  Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).

Hoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals “ A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.” London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And “A New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.” London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman’s  “The Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.” London: Archibald Constable & CO.

During the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (\"IHS\") was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or “ryu.”<ref>Masters Magazine Spring 2019 pg 35</ref>. 

During the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of  academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions.  One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings.  In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies. 

More recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons. Ethnographies such as Michael Ryan's [https://www.amazon.com/Venezuelan-Stick-Fighting-Civilizing-Process/dp/1498533205 Venezuelan Stick Fighting: The Civilizing Process in Martial Arts (2016)]. Philip Forde’s recently completed doctoral dissertation “Blocking both Hand and Foot: An Examination of Bajan Sticklicking” (2018) is another informative work.

In 2017 we saw an emergence of a New Hoplology, pioneered by The Immersion Projects. Immersion Projects continue to lead multiple expeditions, sponsor symposiums and launched a new journal<ref>The Immersion Review, www.TheImmersionMedia.com/review</ref> focused on the study of combat.

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accoutrements and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.<ref name=\"hoplology.com\"/>

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.<ref name=\"Meron Langsner\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&pg=PA112 |first=Meron |last=Langsner|title=Text & Presentation |date=2006 |publisher=McFarland |editor-first=Stratos E. |editor-last=Constantinidi |ISBN=0786455411 |chapter=Chapter 10. Theatre Hoplology: simulations and representations of violence on the stage |page=112}}</ref>  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print</ref>

==Current Trends - The New Hoplology==
In 2018 a group of academics and veteran martial artists came together to explore the roots of bodily movements with weapons to uncover any underlying principles that shape all combat. Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. 

The multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date

'''Dr. No''' is the nickname given to a suspected American [[serial killer]] thought to be responsible for the murders of at least nine women and girls in [[Ohio]], between 1981 and 2004. As victims, he chose prostitutes working in parking lots and truck stops located alongside [[Interstate 71|I-71]]. In addition, there are suspicions that he committed three similar killings in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Illinois]] and [[Pennsylvania]], committed between 1986 and 1988.

== Murders ==
Three of the victims worked at \"Union 76\" truck stop in [[Austintown, Ohio|Austintown]], east of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and west of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], which is the largest in the state, making the investigation suspect that the killer is a truck driver. Most of them were found without their underwear and shoes. The killings began in 1981, when the corpse of a young woman was found in [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami County]] on April 24th. After a forensic examination, it was determined that the girl died from strangulation, having received a head injury beforehand. At the time of her discovery, no personal belongings or documents were found on the deceased, making her identification difficult. She was nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl\", from a tasseled bucksin poncho she was when found. In 2018, the victim was finally identified as [[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas/story?id=54417156|title=Body of 'Buckskin Girl' found in Ohio in 1981 identified as Arkansas woman. 12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/cold-case-homicide-victim-identified-after-37-years/1116096993/|title=Cold case homicide victim identified after 37 years. Apr 12, 2018}}</ref>

The next victim was 25-year-old Marcia Matthews, whose body was found by a trucker one mile away from the Union 76 truck stop. She had died from a traumatic brain injury, sustained after a beating with a blunt object. On July 20, 1986, the body of 23-year-old prostitute Shirley Dean Taylor was discovered, who was also beaten and strangled before death. Before her disappearance, she was seen at Union 76, where, according to witness reports, she went to meet a regular client nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whose identity was never established. Her body was discovered a few miles from the place of disappearance, with her underwear and shoes missing. In December 1986, 18-year-old prostitute April Barnett also went missing from the Union 76 truck stop, with her body found only a few days later 70 miles from Austintown. Like the previous cases, the girl was beaten and died from strangulation, with some of her clothes missing as well. A few days after, 28-year-old prostitute Jill Allen was found murdered in Illinois, near the [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. Despite the fact that she had been found in another state, she was also included as a victim, as her killer had the exact same [[modus operandi]]. Allen had also been beaten and asphyxiated, with strangulation marks found on her body. Her shoes, bra and underwear were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/05/mysterious-dr-no-may-have-been-serial-killer-responsible-for-rash-of-1980s-murders/|title=Mysterious “Dr. No” May Have Been Serial Killer Responsible for Rash of 1980s Murders. May 24, 2017}}</ref>

The next victim of the serial killer was 27-year-old Anne-Marie Patterson, who went missing on February 7, 1987, from Union 76. Her semi-decomposed body was found 40 days later, 250 miles away from Austintown, near [[Cincinnati]]. A week before the disappearance, Patterson had been arrested by police. At the police station, the girl gave information about a murder suspect and described his car. During the investigation, law enforcement agencies discovered that Patterson had made an appointment via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] with the client, nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whom she characterized extremely negatively, and then disappeared. In connection with this, the police and later the media coined the nickname for the unidentified criminal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/04/01/I-71-murder-victim-talked-with-police-before-disappearing/6359544251600/|title=I-71 murder victim talked with police before disappearing.

April 19, 1987}}</ref>

On August 10 that same year, another victim's body was found in [[Englewood, Ohio|Englewood]]. The victim's jeans and underwear were lowered to the ankles, while the upper part of the clothes were missing. According to the nature of grass depressions and tire tracks located at the scene, forensic experts determined that the killer threw the girl's corpse out of his car. An autopsy revealed that the victim was a young woman, aged 20-25, and had died from strangulation. Despite the abundance of tattoes on her body, as well as jewelry the offender hadn't stolen, she hasn't been identified, and is simply named \"[[Jane Doe]]\". On November 22nd, the body of 19-year-old Lamonica Cole was discovered at a truck stop in [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania]]. Despite the fact that the truck stop was located on another interstate, Cole was included in the list of potential victims, because she had died from strangulation, was a native of Ohio and some of her things had been recovered, while others not. During the investigation, Lamonica's pimp, 24-year-old Derrick Mims, told police that the alleged killer with whom Cole left on the day of her disappearance was travelling in a blue lorry with white stripes.

According to investigators, another murder was committed on March 29, 1988, this time in New York. The murder was 31-year-old Terri Roark, whose body was found on one of the bridges passing through the [[Mohawk River]]. The medical examiner found that the woman died from a traumatic brain injury that occurred during a beating with a blunt object several hours before the discovery of her body. Some of Roark's clothing, including underwear and shoes, were never found, on the basis of which she was included in the list potential victims of Dr. No. On April 19, 1990, the corpse of another young girl was found near a truck stop on the I-70. Most of her clothes were missing, but this time, her panties remained. An autopsy concluded that she had died from a traumatic brain injury resulting from a beating, and had had sexual intercourse 12-24 hours before her death. With these conclusions, the investigators suggested that the victim was a prostitute and had fallen victim to the serial killer. Despite multiple attempts to identify her, she remains unknown, and is simply named \"Jane Doe-2\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HkFHPBAgLiMJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/body-trail-prompts-fear-of-serial-killer---1991-dispatch-investigation+&cd=3&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru|title=Body trail prompts fear of serial killer. March 10, 1991}}</ref>

== Investigation ==
During the course of the investigation, the police interviewed hundreds of prostitutes, pimps, service station employees and truck drivers, in an attempt to find witnesses and identify the offender.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19910315&id=goQcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8mMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5900,7506894&hl=en|title=Investigators of 10 killings to meet. March 15, 1991}}</ref> According to the witnesses, the killer appeared to be a tall, large man with fair skin and dark hair, aged 25-40, wore glasses and talked with an accent matching that of somebody from the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern states]]. The vehicle he was driving was described as a 1984 silver truck with a [[Wind deflector|windblocker]] and a red hood. The Ohio State Police Department and volunteers from various civil society organizations posted over 4,000 photographs of the victims and an identikit of the offender at 130 truck stops and service stations across the state, and 1,350 truck stops in 9 other states through which interstate motorways where the serial killer would ride through, offering $10,000 for information about him. As a result, five people were detained, who at different times were nicknamed \"Dr. No\", but subsequently no charges were filed against any of them and their names were never disclosed to the public. On most of the corpses, biological traces were discovered that, according to the investigators, came from the perpetrator. To establish if the sperm had the same affiliation, a forensic examination was carried out which gave mixed results, due to the fact that all of the victims had engaged in prostitution during life, and authorities stated questioning whether the deaths were actually related. Since no other incriminating evidence was found at the crime scenes, such as fingerprints, hair samples and pieces of clothing, the investigation to this day hasn't established the killer's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/serial-killer-dr-no/|title=Articles}}</ref>
===Suspects===
In April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards. Alvin Wilson was tested for any involvement, but no evidence proving his guilt could be found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-04-23-9104230376-story.html|title=LAKE MAN A SUSPECT IN SERIAL MURDERS OHIO INVESTIGATORS COMING TO SEARCH TRUCKS.

In June 1994, a 36-year-old trucker from Ohio, James Robert Cruz, Jr., was convicted in the March 1993 murder of 17-year-old Dawn Marie Birnbaum in [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]], whose dumped body was found along the [[Interstate 80|I-80]]. The girl's body was discovered a few days after her death. Since most of her clothes were missing, Cruz was considered a possible suspect in the Ohio killings. He was tested, but subsequently, no charges were filed against him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/ohio-trucker-gets-life-for-killing-gary-runaway/article_edb57afb-4fb3-5a7f-b594-de046e08ed67.html|title=Ohio trucker gets life for killing Gary runaway.

In 1995, 28-year-old Sean Patrick Goble, a trucker from [[North Carolina]], who had admitted to killing two prostitutes in [[Tennessee]] in April of that year, was among the suspects for the murder of a North Carolina woman in early 1995. In accordance with his occupation, Goble traveled to a several dozen states across the country, where cases of disappearances and murders of prostitutes along interstate highways were recorded. Following his arrest, Goble was investigated for murders in at least 10 states. Nevertheless, he was cleared of suspicion when it came to being the elusive \"Dr. No\", since at the time of the first murder in 1981, he wa still in high school, and in the mid-1980s, when the majority of the killings took place, he was serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was stationed outside Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950617/06170345.htm|title=DETECTIVES CREDIT LUCK IN HIGHWAY KILLINGS CASE.

In November 2005, on the basis of [[DNA profiling]], authorities arrested 46-year-old Dellmus Charles Colvin, a truck driver who killed five prostitutes in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]. Colvin later admitted to killing at least two others in [[New Jersey]], but vehemently denied any involvement in the Dr. No murders during the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2011/03/truck_driver_convicted_of_kil.html|title=Truck driver convicted of killing six prostitutes in Ohio to face charges in slaying of N.J. woman 24 years ago.

In early 2019, 49-year-old Samuel Legg was arrested in [[Arizona]]. Using DNA profiling, law enforcement agencies were able to prove his guilt in the four murders in Ohio and Illinois, the first of which he committed at age 20 in 1989. His initial arrested was thanks due to a match for an unsolved 1997 rape of a minor in [[Medina County, Ohio]], where he was extradited to stand trial. In the fall of 1990, Legg was already in the police's sights, as he was a suspect in the murder of his stepdaughter, 14-year-old Angela Hicks, in [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]], but as there wasn't enough evidence, he wasn't charged. Although the likelihood of him being \"Dr. No\" is questionable, since Legg was a teenager in the mid-1980s, it has been suggested that he could be responsible for some of the murders. If this theory is true, it links to another theory which proposes that the serial murders were the doing of several different individuals.<ref>[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uYyZljc1cnoJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/arizona-man-charged-in-1992-slaying-linked-by-dna-to-ohio-truck-stop-killings+&cd=15&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru Arizona man charged in 1992 slaying linked by DNA to Ohio truck-stop killings.

'''Dr. No''' is the nickname given to a suspected American [[serial killer]] thought to be responsible for the murders of at least nine women and girls in [[Ohio]], between 1981 and 2004. As victims, he chose prostitutes working in parking lots and truck stops located alongside [[Interstate 71|I-71]]. In addition, there are suspicions that he committed three similar killings in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Illinois]] and [[Pennsylvania]], committed between 1986 and 1988.

== Murders ==
Three of the victims worked at \"Union 76\" truck stop in [[Austintown, Ohio|Austintown]], east of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and west of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], which is the largest in the state, making the investigation suspect that the killer is a truck driver. Most of them were found without their underwear and shoes. The killings began in 1981, when the corpse of a young woman was found in [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami County]] on April 24th. After a forensic examination, it was determined that the girl died from strangulation, having received a head injury beforehand. At the time of her discovery, no personal belongings or documents were found on the deceased, making her identification difficult. She was nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl\", from a tasseled bucksin poncho she was when found. In 2018, the victim was finally identified as [[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas/story?id=54417156|title=Body of 'Buckskin Girl' found in Ohio in 1981 identified as Arkansas woman. 12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/cold-case-homicide-victim-identified-after-37-years/1116096993/|title=Cold case homicide victim identified after 37 years. Apr 12, 2018}}</ref>

The next victim was 25-year-old Marcia Matthews, whose body was found by a trucker one mile away from the Union 76 truck stop. She had died from a traumatic brain injury, sustained after a beating with a blunt object. On July 20, 1986, the body of 23-year-old prostitute Shirley Dean Taylor was discovered, who was also beaten and strangled before death. Before her disappearance, she was seen at Union 76, where, according to witness reports, she went to meet a regular client nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whose identity was never established. Her body was discovered a few miles from the place of disappearance, with her underwear and shoes missing. In December 1986, 18-year-old prostitute April Barnett also went missing from the Union 76 truck stop, with her body found only a few days later 70 miles from Austintown. Like the previous cases, the girl was beaten and died from strangulation, with some of her clothes missing as well. A few days after, 28-year-old prostitute Jill Allen was found murdered in Illinois, near the [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. Despite the fact that she had been found in another state, she was also included as a victim, as her killer had the exact same [[modus operandi]]. Allen had also been beaten and asphyxiated, with strangulation marks found on her body. Her shoes, bra and underwear were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/05/mysterious-dr-no-may-have-been-serial-killer-responsible-for-rash-of-1980s-murders/|title=Mysterious “Dr. No” May Have Been Serial Killer Responsible for Rash of 1980s Murders. May 24, 2017}}</ref>

The next victim of the serial killer was 27-year-old Anne-Marie Patterson, who went missing on February 7, 1987, from Union 76. Her semi-decomposed body was found 40 days later, 250 miles away from Austintown, near [[Cincinnati]]. A week before the disappearance, Patterson had been arrested by police. At the police station, the girl gave information about a murder suspect and described his car. During the investigation, law enforcement agencies discovered that Patterson had made an appointment via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] with the client, nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whom she characterized extremely negatively, and then disappeared. In connection with this, the police and later the media coined the nickname for the unidentified criminal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/04/01/I-71-murder-victim-talked-with-police-before-disappearing/6359544251600/|title=I-71 murder victim talked with police before disappearing.

April 19, 1987}}</ref>

On August 10th that same year, another victim's body was found in [[Englewood, Ohio|Englewood]]. The victim's jeans and underwear were lowered to the ankles, while the upper part of the clothes were missing. According to the nature of grass depressions and tire tracks located at the scene, forensic experts determined that the killer threw the girl's corpse out of his car. An autopsy revealed that the victim was a young girl, aged 20-25, and had died from strangulation. Despite the abundance of tattoes on her body, as well as jewelry the offender hadn't stolen, she hasn't been identified, and is simply named \"[[Jane Doe]]\". On November 22nd, the body of 19-year-old Lamonica Cole was discovered at a truck stop in [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania]]. Despite the fact that the truck stop was located on another interstate, Cole was included in the list of potential victims, because she had died from strangulation, was a native of Ohio and some of her things had been recovered, while others not. During the investigation, Lamonica's pimp, 24-year-old Derrick Mims, told police that the alleged killer with whom Cole left on the day of her disappearance was travelling in a blue lorry with white stripes.

According to investigators, another murder was committed on March 29, 1988, this time in New York. The murder was 31-year-old Terri Roark, whose body was found on one of the bridges passing through the [[Mohawk River]]. The medical examiner found that the woman died from a traumatic brain injury that occurred during a beating with a blunt object several hours before the discovery of her body. Some of Roark's clothing, including underwear and shoes, were never found, on the basis of which she was included in the list potential victims of Dr. No. On April 19, 1990, the corpse of another young girl was found near a truck stop on the I-70. Most of her clothes were missing, but this time, her panties remained. An autopsy concluded that she had died from a traumatic brain injury resulting from a beating, and had had sexual intercourse 12-24 hours before her death. With these conclusions, the investigators suggested that the victim was a prostitute and had fallen victim to the serial killer. Despite multiple attempts to identify her, she remains unknown, and is simply named \"Jane Doe-2\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HkFHPBAgLiMJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/body-trail-prompts-fear-of-serial-killer---1991-dispatch-investigation+&cd=3&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru|title=Body trail prompts fear of serial killer. March 10, 1991}}</ref>

== Investigation ==
During the course of the investigation, the police interviewed hundreds of prostitutes, pimps, service station employees and truck drivers, in an attempt to find witnesses and identify the offender.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19910315&id=goQcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8mMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5900,7506894&hl=en|title=Investigators of 10 killings to meet. March 15, 1991}}</ref> According to the witnesses, the killer appeared to be a tall, large man with fair skin and dark hair, aged 25-40, wore glasses and talked with an accent matching that of somebody from the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern states]]. The vehicle he was driving was described as a 1984 silver truck with a [[Wind deflector|windblocker]] and a red hood. The Ohio State Police Department and volunteers from various civil society organizations posted over 4,000 photographs of the victims and an identikit of the offender at 130 truck stops and service stations across the state, and 1,350 truck stops in 9 other states through which interstate motorways where the serial killer would ride through, offering $10,000 for information about him. As a result, five people were detained, who at different times were nicknamed \"Dr. No\", but subsequently no charges were filed against any of them and their names were never disclosed to the public. On most of the corpses, biological traces were discovered that, according to the investigators, came from the perpetrator. To establish if the sperm had the same affiliation, a forensic examination was carried out which gave mixed results, due to the fact that all of the victims had engaged in prostitution during life, and authorities stated questioning whether the deaths were actually related. Since no other incriminating evidence was found at the crime scenes, such as fingerprints, hair samples and pieces of clothing, the investigation to this day hasn't established the killer's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/serial-killer-dr-no/|title=Articles}}</ref>
===Suspects===
In April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards. Alvin Wilson was tested for any involvement, but no evidence proving his guilt could be found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-04-23-9104230376-story.html|title=LAKE MAN A SUSPECT IN SERIAL MURDERS OHIO INVESTIGATORS COMING TO SEARCH TRUCKS.

'''Jon Lech Johansen''' (born November 18, 1983 in [[Harstad]], [[Norway]]), also known as '''DVD Jon''', is a Norwegian programmer who has worked on [[reverse engineering]] [[File format|data formats]]. He wrote the [[DeCSS]] software, which decodes the [[Content Scramble System]] used for [[DVD]] licensing enforcement. Johansen is a [[autodidact|self-trained]] [[software engineer]], who quit high school during his first year to spend more time with the DeCSS case. He moved to the United States and worked as a software engineer from October 2005 until November 2006.  He then moved to Norway but moved back to the United States in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/about/ | title=About | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | year=2004 | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

==Education==
In a post on his blog, he said that in the 1990s he started with a book (''Programming the 8086/8088''), the web (\"[[Fravia]]'s site was a goldmine\") and [[IRC]] (\"Lurked in a x86 assembly IRC channel and picked up tips from wise wizards.\")<ref>Jon Lech Johansen’s blog, [http://nanocr.eu/2006/02/09/reverse-engineering/ \"Reverse Engineering\"], 2006-02-09. Retrieved on 2010-06-29.</ref>

== DeCSS prosecution ==
After Johansen released [[DeCSS]], he was taken to court in Norway for computer hacking in 2002. The prosecution was conducted by the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] (''Økokrim'' in Norwegian), after a complaint by the US [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (DVD-CCA) and the [[Motion Picture Association]] (MPA).  Johansen has denied writing the decryption code in DeCSS, saying that this part of the project originated from someone in Germany. He only developed the GUI component of the software. His defense was assisted by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The trial opened in the [[Oslo District Court]] on 9 December 2002 with Johansen pleading not guilty to charges that had a maximum penalty of two years in prison or large fines. The defense argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else's information, since Johansen owned the [[DVD]]s himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on 7 January 2003, [[acquittal|acquitting]] Johansen of all charges.

Two further levels of [[appeal]]s were available to the prosecutors, to the appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. Økokrim filed an appeal on 20 January 2003 and it was reported on 28 February that the [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] had agreed to hear the case. Johansen's second DeCSS trial began in Oslo on 2 December 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on 22 December 2003. Økokrim announced on 5 January 2004 that it would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

==Other projects==

In 2001, Johansen released OpenJaz, a reverse-engineered set of drivers for Linux, BeOS and Windows 2000 that allow operation of the JazPiper MP3 digital audio player without its proprietary drivers.

===2003===
In November 2003, Johansen released [[QTFairUse]], an open source program which dumps the raw output of a QuickTime Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) stream to a file, which could bypass the [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) software used to encrypt content of music from media such as those distributed by the iTunes Music Store, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s online music store. Although these resulting raw AAC files were unplayable by most media players at the time of release, they represent the first attempt at circumventing Apple's encryption.

===2004===
Johansen had by now become a [[VideoLAN]] developer, and had reverse engineered [[FairPlay]] and written VLC's FairPlay support.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | title=DVD Jon on VLC and Apple's iTunes singles | publisher=Boing Boing | first=Cory | last=Doctorow | authorlink=Cory Doctorow | date=2004-03-26 | accessdate=2007-08-14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093239/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref> It has been available in VideoLAN [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] since January 2004, but the first release to include FairPlay support is VLC 0.7.1 (released March 2, 2004).

===2005===

On March 18, 2005, [[Travis Watkins (computer programmer)|Travis Watkins]] and Cody Brocious, along with Johansen, wrote [[PyMusique]], a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] based program which allows the download of purchased files from the iTunes Music Store without [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) encryption.<ref>Smith, Tony (March 18, 2005) &ndash; [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/18/itunes_pymusique/ \"DVD Jon: buy DRM-less tracks from Apple iTunes\"]</ref> This was possible because Apple Computer's iTunes software adds the DRM to the music file after the music file is downloaded. On March 22, Apple released a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] for the iTunes Music Store blocking the use of his PyMusique program. The same day, an update to PyMusique was released, circumventing the new patch.

On June 26, 2005, Johansen created a modification of Google's new in-browser video player (which was based on the open source VLC media player) less than 24 hours after its release, to allow the user to play videos that are not hosted on Google’s servers. The significance of the modification was exaggerated by the online media.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/2005/06/28/google-video-viewer/ | title=Google Video Viewer | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | date=2005-06-28 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

In late 2005, [[Håkon Wium Lie]], the Norwegian CTO of [[Opera Software]], co-creator of Cascading Style Sheets and long-time supporter of open source, named Johansen a \"hero\" in a net meeting arranged by one of Norway's biggest newspapers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/05/10/431391.html | title=DVD-Jon er en helt | first=Lars Eirik | last=Eide | newspaper =Dagbladet | language=Norwegian | date=2005-05-10 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> On September 2, 2005, ''The Register'' published news that DVD Jon had defeated encryption in Microsoft's Windows Media Player by reverse engineering a proprietary algorithm that was ostensibly used to protect [[Windows Media Station]] NSC files from engineers sniffing for the files' source IP address, port or stream format. Johansen had also made a decoder available.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/2005/08/31/reversing-nsc/ | title=Reversing NSC | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | date=2005-08-31 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref><ref>Clarke, Gavin (San Francisco.

In September 2005, Johansen announced the release of [[SharpMusique]] 1.0, an alternative to the default iTunes program. The program allows Linux and Windows users to buy songs from the iTunes music store without copy protection. In 2005, Johansen worked for MP3tunes in San Diego as a software engineer. His first project was a new digital music product, code-named Oboe.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/UNID/A082F24382B9BE5CCC2570A0002C04C7 | title=DVD Jon now working for Linspire's Michael Robertson | publisher=Computerworld | first=Robert | last=McMillan | date=2005-10-21 | accessdate=2007-08-14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231357/http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/UNID/A082F24382B9BE5CCC2570A0002C04C7 | archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref>

====Sony BMG DRM rootkit====
{{main|Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal}}

In November 2005, a Slashdot story claimed that [[Sony-BMG]]s [[Extended Copy Protection]] (XCP) DRM software includes code and comments (such as \"copyright (c) Apple Computer, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\") illegally copied from an iTunes DRM circumvention program by Johansen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=168546&cid=14051648 | title=Wow.

===2006===
On January 8, 2006, Johansen revealed his intent to defeat the encryption of next-generation DVD encryption, [[Advanced Access Content System]] (AACS).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocrew.net/2006/01/08/deaacscom/ | title=DeAACS.com | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | date=2006-01-08 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> On June 7, 2006, he announced that he had moved to San Francisco and was joining DoubleTwist Ventures.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocrew.net/2006/06/07/moved-to-san-francisco/ | title=Moved to San Francisco | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | date=2006-06-07 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> In October 2006, Johansen and DoubleTwist Ventures announced they had reverse engineered Apple Computer's DRM for iTunes, called FairPlay.

===2008===
On February 2, 2008, Johansen launched [[doubleTwist]], which allows customers to route around digital rights management in music files and convert files between various formats. The software converts digital music of any bitrate encoded with any popular codec into a format that can be played on any device.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richards |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.dvorak.org/blog/2008/02/20/hacker-breaks-link-between-itunes-and-the-ipod/ |title=Hacker breaks link between iTunes and the iPod |newspaper=Times Online |date=February 20, 2008 |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref>

'''Jon Lech Johansen''' (born November 18, 1983 in [[Harstad]], [[Norway]]), also known as '''DVD Jon''', is a Norwegian programmer who has worked on [[reverse engineering]] [[File format|data formats]].

He wrote the [[DeCSS]] software, which decodes the [[Content Scramble System]] used for [[DVD]] licensing enforcement. Johansen is a [[autodidact|self-trained]] [[software engineer]], who quit high school during his first year to spend more time with the DeCSS case. He moved to the United States and worked as a software engineer from October 2005 until November 2006.  He then moved to Norway but moved back to the United States in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/about/ | title=About | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | year=2004 | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

Johansen is featured in the documentary film ''[[Info_Wars_(film)|Info Wars]]''.

==Education==
In a post on his blog, he said that in the 1990s he started with a book (''Programming the 8086/8088''), the web (\"[[Fravia]]'s site was a goldmine\") and [[IRC]] (\"Lurked in a x86 assembly IRC channel and picked up tips from wise wizards.\")<ref>Jon Lech Johansen’s blog, [http://nanocr.eu/2006/02/09/reverse-engineering/ \"Reverse Engineering\"], 2006-02-09. Retrieved on 2010-06-29.</ref>

== DeCSS prosecution ==
After Johansen released [[DeCSS]], he was taken to court in Norway for computer hacking in 2002. The prosecution was conducted by the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] (''Økokrim'' in Norwegian), after a complaint by the US [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (DVD-CCA) and the [[Motion Picture Association]] (MPA).  Johansen has denied writing the decryption code in DeCSS, saying that this part of the project originated from someone in Germany. He only developed the GUI component of the software. His defense was assisted by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The trial opened in the [[Oslo District Court]] on 9 December 2002 with Johansen pleading not guilty to charges that had a maximum penalty of two years in prison or large fines. The defense argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else's information, since Johansen owned the [[DVD]]s himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on 7 January 2003, [[acquittal|acquitting]] Johansen of all charges.

Two further levels of [[appeal]]s were available to the prosecutors, to the appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. Økokrim filed an appeal on 20 January 2003 and it was reported on 28 February that the [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] had agreed to hear the case.

Johansen's second DeCSS trial began in Oslo on 2 December 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on 22 December 2003. Økokrim announced on 5 January 2004 that it would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

==Other projects==

In the first decade of the 21st century, Johansen's career has included many other projects.

===2001===
In 2001, Johansen released OpenJaz, a reverse-engineered set of drivers for Linux, BeOS and Windows 2000 that allow operation of the JazPiper MP3 digital audio player without its proprietary drivers.

===2003===
In November 2003, Johansen released [[QTFairUse]], an open source program which dumps the raw output of a QuickTime Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) stream to a file, which could bypass the [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) software used to encrypt content of music from media such as those distributed by the iTunes Music Store, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s online music store.

===2004===
Johansen had by now become a [[VideoLAN]] developer, and had reverse engineered [[FairPlay]] and written VLC's FairPlay support.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | title=DVD Jon on VLC and Apple's iTunes singles | publisher=Boing Boing | first=Cory | last=Doctorow | authorlink=Cory Doctorow | date=2004-03-26 | accessdate=2007-08-14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093239/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref> It has been available in VideoLAN [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] since January 2004, but the first release to include FairPlay support is VLC 0.7.1 (released March 2, 2004).

On April 25, 2004 Johansen released yet another program: DeDRMS. Written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], this 230 line program also removes copy protection.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On July 7, 2004 he released FairKeys, a program that can be used to retrieve the keys needed by DeDRMS from the iTunes Music Store servers themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On August 12, 2004 Johansen announced on his website that he defeated Apple's [[AirPort|AirPort Express]]'s encryption which lets users stream Apple Lossless files to their AirPort Expresses.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On November 25, 2004 he released a [[proof of concept]] program that allows Linux users (via [[VLC media player|VLC]]) to play video encoded with Microsoft's proprietary WMV9 codec, by porting the reference version of the software.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This was a significant development as Microsoft had been lobbying to have their codec used with the next DVD standard.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Liu Ju''' ({{zh|t=劉據}}; 128 BC – 91 BC), formally known as '''[[Taizi|Crown Prince]] Wei''' (衛太子) and posthumously as '''Crown Prince Li''' (戾太子, literally \"the Unrepentant Crown Prince\") was a [[Western Han Dynasty]] [[crown prince]].  He was the eldest son and the [[heir apparent]] to his father, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], until his death at age 38 during the political turmoil that occurred during 91 BC.  Contrary to his less-than-flattering [[posthumous name]], Liu Ju was generally regarded by historians as a well-mannered, benevolent, morally upright man who, by circumstances beyond his control, was forced into an uprising against his father's army and died as a consequence of the rebellion.

== Family background and birth ==
Liu Ju's mother, [[Empress Wei Zifu|Wei Zifu]], was Emperor Wu's second wife. Emperor Wu's first wife, Empress [[Chen Jiao]], had long lost the Emperor's favour due to [[infertility]], as well as her [[spoiled child|spoilt]] and [[jealous]] personality. When Empress Chen was found employing [[witchcraft]] to curse Emperor Wu's other concubines (aimed at Wei Zifu in particular), she was officially deposed in 130 BC, leaving open the position of empress. Wei Zifu, who had been Emperor Wu's favourite consort since 138 BC, had by then already bore him three daughters. In 128 BC, she gave birth to Liu Ju, Emperor Wu's first son, and was created empress as a result.

It was recorded that Emperor Wu, who was already 29 years old when his first son was born, was overjoyed and ordered poets to write [[paean]]s celebrating the arrival of the \"grand prince\", hinting Liu Ju would become his imperial heir by default.  Prince Ju was later formally created crown prince in 122 BC, at the age of 6.

== As crown prince ==
Emperor Wu had high hopes for Prince Ju, and made sure he got the best education possible, even constructing the \"Broad Vision Academy\" (博望苑) to allow his son exposure to all schools of scholars.  It is unclear when Liu Ju become involved in government affairs, but as he matured and Emperor Wu began to take more time away from the capital, from 113 BC he was entrusted as the [[prince regent]] while his father was absent. His mother Empress Wei, whose sexual attraction decreased in the eyes of Emperor Wu, was still entrusted to look after domestic palace affairs. Both Liu Ju and Empress Wei remained well respected by Emperor Wu.

Unlike Emperor Wu, who was at times [[megalomania|megalomanic]] and always looking for territorial expansion which burdened his people to their limit, Liu Ju was regarded as a [[Pacifist|man of peace]], interested more in the social well-being and economic recovery of the people, and openly opposed his father on many policies.  He was well known for his hospitality and openness to different opinions, and he maintained a large group of advisers and friends at his palace.  Because Liu Ju favoured more lenient policies and often helped overturn [[wrongful conviction]]<nowiki/>s.  He frequently had conflicts with legal officials who had received promotions from following his father's harsher, more [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] policies.

In 113 BC, Liu Ju married his only well-known [[Prince consort|consort]], Lady Shi (史良娣), who bore him a son Liu Jin (劉進).  Liu Jin would later produce [[Liu Bingyi|a young grandson]], who was only months old when his entire family were killed during the 91 BC political turmoil.  Liu Ju also had two other sons and a daughter.

While Liu Ju's well-respected uncle, General [[Wei Qing]] was alive, Crown Prince Ju was safe politically.  After Wei Qing died in 106 BC, certain officials and factions started plotting against Liu Ju.

== Forced into rebellion ==
Near the end of his reign, the physically deteriorating Emperor Wu became increasingly paranoid and fearful of others using witchcraft against him, especially after incidents involving the sighting/[[hallucination]] of an armed stranger walking by as well as a nightmare of hundreds of small wooden [[puppet]]<nowiki/>s beating him with sticks. A massive crackdown was ordered and those who were suspected of witchcraft were often summarily executed along with their entire clans. Many important people became victims of this [[witch-hunt]], which peaked during early 91 BC, including the entire family of Prime Minister Gongsun He (公孫賀, Liu Ju's maternal [[uncle-in-law]]), Liu Ju's sisters (and Emperor Wu's own daughters) Princesses Yangshi (陽石公主) and Princess Zhuyi (諸邑公主), as well as Wei Qing's son Wei Kang (衛忼), effectively removing almost all of the Crown Prince's political supporters in the Han court.

Furthermore, Emperor Wu's favourite concubine was now the young Lady Zhao (趙婕妤), who was also known as \"Lady Fist\" (拳夫人) or \"Lady Hook\" (鉤弋夫人) due to legend that she was born with a [[contracture]]<nowiki/>d clenched fist, which somehow magically opened up when Emperor Wu massaged it, revealing a [[jade]] [[Belt hook|hook]] in the palm.  She gave birth to Emperor Wu's youngest son [[Liu Fuling]] after a rumoured 14-month-long pregnancy, same as the legendary [[Emperor Yao]].  Overjoyed that he could still father a son with such divine implications at the age of 66, the superstitious Emperor Wu named Lady Zhao's household the \"Gate of Yao's Mother\" (堯母門).  This gesture did not go unnoticed, and speculations started to rise that he intended to replace Liu Ju with the 3-year-old Prince Fuling as the new crown prince. Such speculation fuelled further conspiracies to dethrone Liu Ju.

One of the conspirators against Crown Prince Ju was Jiang Chong (江充), the ruthless and opportunistic head of the secret intelligence, who once had a run-in with Prince Ju after arresting one of Prince Ju's assistants for improper use of an imperial right of way. Fearing that with Emperor Wu's health declining, Crown Prince Ju would one day ascend to the throne and punish him for their past clashes, Jiang Chong decided that he had to remove the Crown Prince once and for all.  One other conspirator was Emperor Wu's chief [[eunuch]] Su Wen (蘇文), who had falsely and repeatedly accused Liu Ju of committing adultery with Emperor Wu's junior concubines.  Su Wen also blocked any attempts by Liu Ju and Empress Wei to communicate with Emperor Wu, who was then staying at his summer palace in Ganquan (甘泉, in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]).

In the same year, Jiang Chong and Su Wen decided to move against Liu Ju, once again using witchcraft as an excuse. Jiang, with the approval of Emperor Wu, searched through various palaces, ostensibly for witchcraft items, eventually reaching Empress Wei and Liu Ju's household. Jiang's men dug holes everywhere, leaving barely room for the Empress and Crown Prince to lay their beds. Jiang Chong then planted dolls and pieces of cloth with mysterious writing in Liu Ju's palace, and then announced that he found evidence of witchcraft. Liu Ju, initially believing that he had nothing to hide, was shocked and forced to consider his options, and his teacher Shi De (石德), invoking the story of [[Zhao Gao]]'s plot to murder [[Ying Fusu]] and raising the possibility that Emperor Wu might already be deceased, suggested that Liu Ju should start an uprising to remove Jiang. Liu Ju initially hesitated and wanted to speedily proceed to Ganquan Palace and explain himself to his father, but he found out that Jiang's messengers were already on their way to report the \"crime\".  So he decided to accept Shi's suggestion.

Liu Ju arranged for one of his men to impersonate a messenger from Emperor Wu and arrest Jiang Chong's party.  However, Su Wen managed to escape arrest. After they were subdued, Liu Ju personally executed Jiang. He then reported his actions to his mother, who authorised him the right to mobilise her palace guards and distribute weapons to any civilian supporters he could muster in preparation to defend himself against any retaliation from Jiang's co-conspirators. Meanwhile, Su Wen fled to Ganquan Palace and told Emperor Wu that the Crown Prince was going to overthrow him in a rebellion.  Emperor Wu, refusing to believe his benevolent son would commit treason and (correctly at this point) concluding that Prince Ju was merely angry at Jiang Chong.  So the Emperor decided to send a low-ranking eunuch to the capital [[Chang'an]] to summon Prince Ju to provide an explanation for his actions. This messenger did not dare to proceed to Chang'an, but instead falsely reported to Emperor Wu that he fled because Prince Ju was going to kill him. By now enraged, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (劉屈犛), to put down the rebellion.

Prince Ju also sent two messengers in attempts to mobilise regular armies. One was sent to a detachment of surrendered Xiongnu cavalry stationed outside the capital, but Emperor Wu's messenger had arrived just earlier and ordered the cavalry to attack Prince Ju instead. The other messenger was sent to the North Army in charge of guarding the capital, but the commander-in-charge, Ren An (任安), refused to get involved.  Without regular army support, Prince Ju's forces, consisting only palace guards and armed civilians, were no match for Liu Qumao's army.  Furthermore, after Emperor Wu's banner was displayed outside the capital city, it became clear that Emperor Wu was still in charge and Prince Ju did not have his father's authorisation.  So public support for the Crown Prince disappeared. The two sides then battled in the streets of Chang'an for five days, and Liu Qumao's forces prevailed.  Prince Ju was forced to flee the capital with two of his sons. His mother, Empress Wei, committed suicide after Emperor Wu sent messengers to seize her [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] as a punishment of supporting her son's uprising. The rest of Prince Ju's family were then killed, with the only exception of the months-old grandson [[Liu Bingyi]], who was thrown into prison.

Emperor Wu ordered that Prince Ju be hunted down, but after a junior official, Linghu Mao (令狐茂), risked his life and spoke on Prince Ju's behalf, Emperor Wu's anger began to subside, but he had not yet issued a pardon for his son. At this point, Liu Ju had fled to Hu County (湖縣, in modern [[Sanmenxia]], [[Henan]]) and took refuge in the home of a poor [[shoemaker]]. Knowing the financial burden imposed on his warm-hearted host, Liu Ju attempted to seek help from an old friend living in Hu County, but this exposed his whereabouts. Local officials quickly tracked down and surrounded the house. Seeing no chance of escape, Liu Ju committed suicide by hanging. His two sons and the family hosting them all died when government soldiers finally broke in and killed everyone. The officials in charge, Li Shou (李壽) and Zhang Fuchang (張富昌), then wasted no times to take Liu Ju's body to Chang'an and claim rewards from Emperor Wu, who had to keep his word despite great sorrow over his son's death.

== Posthumous developments ==
Eventually, Emperor Wu began to realize that the witchcraft cases during 91 BC were often false accusations. In 89 BC, when [[Tian Qianqiu]] (田千秋), then the superintendent of Emperor Gao's temple, filed a report claiming that \"a white-haired old man\" told him in a dream that for the offence of armed uprising, Prince Ju would at most be caned, not killed, as a punishment, Emperor Wu realised what had really happened.  Furious that the conspirators had abused his trust and plotted his son's death, he had Su Wen [[Death by burning|burned alive]], Jiang Chong's [[Nine familial exterminations|immediate and extended family executed]], and killed every official who had received promotions for tracking down the Crown Prince. He also promoted Tian Qianqiu to prime minister, and made major policy changes that supported the ideals supported by his dead son.  To express his regret over causing his son's death, Emperor Wu also built the Palace of Son-Grieving (思子宮) and Platform of Longing for Return (歸來望思台), officially [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitating]] Liu Ju's name.

Liu Ju's only surviving offspring, his grandson [[Liu Bingyi]], would eventually become emperor (as [[Emperor Xuan of Han|Emperor Xuan]]) in 74 BC following the death of Crown Prince Ju's childless younger brother [[Emperor Zhao of Han|Emperor Zhao]] and a brief reign by their nephew, [[Prince He of Changyi]].  Out of respect for Emperor Zhao, Emperor Xuan did not initially attempt to restore the title of his grandfather.  It was not until 73 BC that he restored Crown Prince Ju's title (but with the rather unflattering posthumous name of \"Li\", which means \"unrepentant\") and reburied his grandparents and parents.

A young woman living at the home of David Whitmer in Ohio in 1838 reported receiving a number of revelations about the downfall of Joseph Smith by looking through a black stone that she had found. Some disaffected church members followed after her.<ref>{{Citation

}} \"At this time a certain young woman, who was living at David Whitmer’s uttered a prophecy; which she said was given her, by looking through a black stone that she had found. This prophecy gave some altogether a new idea of things. She said, the reason why one third of the church would turn away from Joseph was, because that he was in transgression himself; and would fall from his office on account of the same; that David Whitmer or Martin Harris would fill Joseph’s place: and that the one, who did not succeed him, would be councillor to him who did. This girl soon became an object of great attention among those who were disaffected. Dr. Williams, the ex justice of the peace, became her scribe; and wrote her revelations for her. Jared Carter, who lived in the same house with David Whitmer, soon imbibed the same spirit; and I was informed, that he said in one of their meetings, that he had 'power to raise Joe. Smith to the highest heaven, or Sink him down to the lowest hell.' ... his confession was received, and he was forgiven. But the rest of his party continued obstinate They still held their secret meetings at David Whitmer’s; and when the young woman, who was their instructress was through giving what revelations she intended for the evening, she would jump out of her chair and dance over the floor, boasting of her power until she was perfectly exhausted. Her proselytes would also, in the most vehement manner, proclaim their purity and holiness, and the mighty power which they were going to have.\"</ref>

==Nauvoo Period 1839–1847==
In 1841, apostles [[Wilford Woodruff]] and [[George A. Smith]] confiscated several seer stones and [[grimoire]]s from convert William Mountford in [[Staffordshire|Staffordshire, England]]. The grimoires were destroyed and seer stones were sent to Nauvoo. Joseph Smith examined the stones and stated that they were \"Urim and Thummim as good as ever was upon the earth\" but that they had been \"consecrated to devils.\"<ref>Stapley, Johnathan.

A young woman living at the home of David Whitmer in Ohio in 1838 reported receiving a number of revelations about the downfall of Joseph Smith by looking through a black stone that she had found. Some disaffected church members followed after her.<ref>{{Citation

}} \"At this time a certain young woman, who was living at David Whitmer’s uttered a prophecy; which she said was given her, by looking through a black stone that she had found. This prophecy gave some altogether a new idea of things. She said, the reason why one third of the church would turn away from Joseph was, because that he was in transgression himself; and would fall from his office on account of the same; that David Whitmer or Martin Harris would fill Joseph’s place: and that the one, who did not succeed him, would be councillor to him who did. This girl soon became an object of great attention among those who were disaffected. Dr. Williams, the ex justice of the peace, became her scribe; and wrote her revelations for her. Jared Carter, who lived in the same house with David Whitmer, soon imbibed the same spirit; and I was informed, that he said in one of their meetings, that he had 'power to raise Joe. Smith to the highest heaven, or Sink him down to the lowest hell.' ... his confession was received, and he was forgiven. But the rest of his party continued obstinate They still held their secret meetings at David Whitmer’s; and when the young woman, who was their instructress was through giving what revelations she intended for the evening, she would jump out of her chair and dance over the floor, boasting of her power until she was perfectly exhausted. Her proselytes would also, in the most vehement manner, proclaim their purity and holiness, and the mighty power which they were going to have.\"</ref>

In 1841, apostles [[Wilford Woodruff]] and [[George A. Smith]] confiscated several seer stones and [[grimoire]]s from convert William Mountford in [[Staffordshire|Staffordshire, England]]. The grimoires were destroyed and seer stones were sent to Nauvoo. Joseph Smith examined the stones and stated that they were \"Urim and Thummim as good as ever was upon the earth\" but that they had been \"consecrated to devils.\"<ref>Stapley, Johnathan.

'''Noah Dietrich''' (February 28, 1889 – February 15, 1982) was an American businessman, who was the [[chief executive officer]] of the [[Howard Hughes]] business empire from 1925 to 1957.<ref name=obit/> (Even though these dates have been recorded as the official period of employment, Noah Dietrich continued to oversee and make executive decisions for the Hughes industries as late as 1970.) According to his own memoirs, he left the Hughes operation over a dispute involving putting more of his income on a [[capital gain]]s basis. The manuscript of his eventual memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', may have been a key, if inadvertent, source of novelist [[Clifford Irving]]'s infamous fake autobiography of Hughes.

==Early life==
Dietrich was born on February 28, 1889 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the son of German-born evangelical [[Lutheran]] minister John Dietrich, and the former Sarah Peters.<ref>[http://www.noahdietrich.com/bio.html] \"Noah Dietrich was born February 28, 1889 in Madison, Wisconsin and was the fourth of six children born to Sarah Peters and German-born evangelical Lutheran minister John Dietrich.\"</ref> He graduated from Janesville High School in 1906, married in 1910, and became a [[bank cashier]] in [[Maxwell, New Mexico]] for the next six months.  They then moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he became an [[auditor]] for the Los Angeles Suburban Land Co., and then the Janass Investment Co.  In 1917, he became an assistant [[comptroller]] for [[Edward L. Doheny]] Oil companies in [[New York City]].  Then Noah, along with his family now consisting of his wife and two daughters, decided to  move back to Los Angeles, where he worked for the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] firm of Haskins and Sells. There he passed the [[California Board of Accountancy]] exam in 1923.<ref name=obit/><ref name=\"Noah\">{{cite book |last1=Dietrich |first1=Noah |last2=Thomas |first2=Bob |title=Howard, The Amazing Mr. Hughes |date=1972 |publisher=Fawcett Publications, Inc. |location=Greenwich |pages=26-29}}</ref>

==Career==
===\"Noah Can Do It\"===
In Nov. 1925, at the age of 36, Dietrich met 19-year-old Hughes, who had gained control of [[Hughes Tool Company]] after buying out the other family heirs. Started by his father, [[Howard R. Hughes, Sr.]], Hughes Tool Company&nbsp;– or Toolco – manufactured oil drilling equipment, especially the multiple-edge, revolving-teeth roller cutter [[well drilling|drill bits]] the elder Hughes invented.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13-14,22-23,29-30}}

Hughes, according to Dietrich, was \"looking for someone with wide general knowledge,\" \"Someone who is resourceful and can solve problems.\"  Questions Hughes asked Dietrich included \"how a battleship finds the range on its target?\", and to \"Explain the principles of the internal combustion engine,\" both of which Dietrich was able to answer satisfactorily.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|23-24}}

Dietrich was hired as an executive assistant to explain the production and financial reports issued by Hughes' tool company, eventually becoming Hughes' personal delegate. In his memoir, Dietrich observed that Hughes had little interest in Toolco, other than as a source of revenue. \"The tool company,\" he quoted Hughes as saying, \"was my father's success. And it always will be.\"  The company's earnings, however, allowed Hughes to pursue his interest in Hollywood movies.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|33,76}}

When still in his early twenties, Hughes told Dietrich, \"My first objective is to become the world's number one golfer. Second, the top aviator, and third I want to become the world's most famous motion picture producer. Then, I want you to make me the richest man in the world.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|73}} 

In time, Dietrich came to serve as an executive for most of Hughes' enterprises, including [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA),<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|147}} [[RKO Pictures]]<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|237}} and [[Hughes Aircraft]].<ref name=obit/><ref name=Noah/>{{rp|255,257}}

Dietrich became Hughes' most indispensable executive&nbsp;– \"Noah can do it\" was, according to Dietrich's memoir, a frequent Hughes expression whenever difficult, if not impossible, wants or needs needed to be met. Some&nbsp;– such as when Dietrich arranged a stock ticker to be installed in a Hughes home&nbsp;– were merely difficult.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13}} Others&nbsp;– such as the time Dietrich arranged the shipment of Hughes' large private liquor stock from his Texas home to his California home during [[Prohibition]]&nbsp;– put him at serious risk.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|90-99}}

Dietrich guided the expansion of Hughes empire by using Hughes Tool Co. profits to purchase real estate, thus avoiding penalties for excess accumulated surplus.  Hughes also limited his salary to $50,000 per year, without dividend payments, thus limiting his income tax.  All of Hughes' major expenses, planes, automobiles, houses, etc., were also charged to Hughes Tool Co. as business expenses.  Hughes even said of Dietrich, \"He knows more about my business than I do,\" referring to Noah as a \"genius\".<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|102-104,147,192,254}}

Some of Dietrich's duties got him caught in the middle of disputes with members of Hughes' family. During a period when Hughes refused to talk to anyone outside a few business associates, Dietrich recalled, a Hughes' aunt Loomis accused Dietrich&nbsp;– who turned out to have been kept in the dark about Hughes' exact whereabouts himself&nbsp;– \"of hiding his body and running things\" himself. When Hughes returned, Dietrich wrote, he made a special point of calling this aunt. \"I didn't want her to continue believing that I was running the Hughes empire while I kept her nephew in the Deep-freeze.\" A few years later, while Hughes was recovering from injuries he sustained in the crash of his experimental [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11]] aircraft, Hughes refused a visit from his favorite aunt Annette Lummis, and her husband Dr. Fred Lummis. The uncle turned to Dietrich and said, \"Now I can better understand your problems in dealing with Hughes. I don't understand him at all.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|178-181,194-195}}

In 1946, Hughes put Dietrich in charge of Toolco.  Dietrich proceeded to modernize the company, and was able to increase profits to the point that Hughes Tool Co. made $285,000,000 in profits over the next 8 years.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|190-191}}

Dietrich also discussed in considerable detail the real impetus behind the government's investigation of [[Hughes Aircraft]] following World War II. Ostensibly, the probe involved Hughes' failure to deliver the infamous [[flying boat]], the ''Hercules'', a military transport aircraft, to the government on time. Dietrich wrote, however, that the real purpose of the probe may have been neutralizing Hughes, owner of TWA, while rival [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]&nbsp;– whose president, [[Juan Trippe]], had implored Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]] to carry it&nbsp;– pushed for a federal law establishing only one official American carrier of international air traffic, and Pan Am becoming that carrier.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|198-199}}

Dietrich discussed the famous Hughes counterattack before the Senate committee investigating him&nbsp;– and revealed that both his own and Hughes' hotel suites had been bugged during the hearings, allegedly at the behest of Brewster and Trippe. The hearings, and Hughes' legendary triumph over them, helped end both the legislation and Brewster's political career; On Hughes' orders, Dietrich poured money into a challenger's campaign a few years later.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|207-208}}

By 1948, Dietrich wrote that his duties were getting \"immensely onerous\", \"If an executive had to be fired, 'Noah can do it.' If millions had to be raised overnight, 'Noah can do it.' If a politico or a starlet had to be paid off, 'Noah can do it.' Noah was getting tired of doing it.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|253}}

===Falling out with Hughes===
Though Dietrich was pulling in a salary of $500,000 per year, his tax burden was 70% on the first $100,000 and then 93% for the remainder.  Dietrich wanted compensation based on a stock option, which was subject only to a tax of 25%. Yet, Dietrich wrote, Hughes \"simply could not bring himself to let anyone share in his ownership.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|22,254,262}}

In 1957, after working for Hughes for 32 years, Dietrich left the Hughes organization over a capital-gains dispute: Hughes had promised to make more of Dietrich's income on a capital gains basis. At the time of the falling-out, Hughes was trying to finance jets for TWA and decided the key was to inflate Hughes Tool profits in order to sell the company to pay for the jets, since Hughes had rejected all other financing solutions, because they threatened to dilute his TWA ownership.  At the same juncture, Hughes, Dietrich recalled, also did everything in his power to stop Dietrich's long-planned African safari with his two sons, the first long vacation Dietrich had taken in decades of working for Hughes.  Dietrich returned from Africa, he wrote, and finally agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan&nbsp;– on condition that Hughes finally implement the capital gains agreement. When Hughes refused, Dietrich immediately quit&nbsp;– stunning Hughes. (Dietrich quoted Hughes as saying, \"Noah, I can't exist without you!\")<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|15-19,293-294}}

Hughes didn't let him go without a fight. After pleading failed, Hughes tried to strong-arm Dietrich into reconsidering, going so far, Dietrich recorded, as changing the lock on Dietrich's office– a practice Hughes had followed any time top executives were fired or otherwise departed the Hughes operation, Dietrich recalled. Hughes also sought Dietrich's interest in their oil partnerships.  Dietrich wrote that he surrendered his interest just to be rid of Hughes, a move he later regretted, since the leases turned big profits eventually. Dietrich got a court order to reclaim many of his personal possessions from his old offices.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|295-298}}

===Post-Hughes career and memoirs===
After parting ways with Hughes, Dietrich, as a well-respected financial and executive advisor, served on several corporate and financial boards as well as traveled to many speaking engagements. His 1971 memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', provided many with the first genuine inside look into the world of Howard Hughes, including and especially his occasional lack of concern that things he wanted done often required breaches of ethics or even the law. Only when he was diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]] (the same illness that killed shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]]), did Dietrich finally retire in full.

Dietrich wrote of Hughes, \"Of all his possessions, TWA held a certain mystique for him.  He didn't give a damn about the tool company, except as a source of wealth.  Hughes Aircraft was an avocation for him, and outlet for his tendency to tinker.  RKO was a heady diversion, an opportunity to pursue his sensual enjoyments.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|290}}

==Personal life==
By 1936, he had divorced his first wife, and their two daughters were married.  By 1945, Dietrich had three children with his second wife.  By 1951, Dietrich was separated from his second wife.  After leaving Hughes in 1957, Dietrich married for a third time.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|140,188,257-258,301}}

In his book ''Howard'', Dietrich wrote, \"I much preferred the more exciting life,\" rather than the sedate life of a CPA.  He wrote the book \"to leave, for my children and grandchildren, a record of the role I played in a colorful subchapter of American history,\" and in part, so \"the American public should be informed on the uses and misuses of great wealth.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|11}}

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905773-1,00.html \"The Fabulous Hoax of Clifford Irving\"], ''Time''</ref> revealed in 1972 that a copy of an early draft of the manuscript for Dietrich's memoir, ghost-written by journalist James Phelan, may have fallen into Clifford Irving's hands, and identified the draft as a key element in Irving's being able to convince publishers and others that his hoax Hughes autobiography was genuine. \"The instances of duplicated material are numerous,\" the magazine wrote. \"In some cases, the books are virtually identical in detail. In others, they are substantively the same, although the Irving manuscript has been reworded and otherwise disguised. One curiosity: the writing in the Irving manuscript is much better than that in the hastily drafted Phelan version. It is ironic that Irving may be more convincing as a forger than as an author in his own right&nbsp;– just as Elmyr de Hory, Irving's [[Ibiza]] friend and the main character in his book Fake!, is much better at doing [[Picasso]]s and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modiglianis]] than he is at doing De Horys.\"  When he later wrote his own memoir, ''The Hoax'', Irving corroborated the hypothesis posited by the ''Time'' article, writing that he indeed obtained and a made a copy of a draft of Dietrich's manuscript, which he then used as source material for his fabricated Hughes autobiography.

Dietrich and Phelan eventually settled for $40,000 after Dietrich became dissatisfied with Phelan's work. He then turned the project over to another journalist, [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]], who finished the Dietrich memoir within six weeks.

==Death==
Dietrich died of heart failure in hospital on February 15, 1982, in [[Palm Springs, California]].  He was just two weeks short of his ninety-third birthday.<ref name=obit>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/obituaries/noah-dietrich-the-chief-aide-to-howard-hughes-is-dead.html |title=Noah Dietrich, The Chief Aide To Howard Hughes, Is Dead |author=Walter H.

==TV/movie adaptations==
Noah Dietrich has been portrayed within several adaptations:
*[[Ed Flanders]] played Dietrich against [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Hughes in the 1977 mini-series ''[[The Amazing Howard Hughes]]''. Released one year after Hughes' death, Dietrich's role is highlighted from his commencement with Hughes as Accountant, his subsequent contribution in restructuring Hughes Empire, and his later departure.
*[[Eli Wallach]] played Dietrich in the 2006 movie [[The Hoax (film)|''The Hoax'']], about author [[Clifford Irving]]'s faked Howard Hughes autobiography.
*[[John C. Reilly]] played Dietrich against [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Hughes within the 2004 movie ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]''. A criticism of this adaptation was that it downplayed the role Dietrich played in helping Hughes amass his fortune.
* [[Martin Sheen]] portrayed Dietrich in the 2016 film ''[[Rules Don't Apply]]''.

'''Noah Dietrich''' (February 28, 1889 – February 15, 1982) was an American businessman, who was the [[chief executive officer]] of the [[Howard Hughes]] business empire from 1925 to 1957.<ref name=obit/> (Even though these dates have been recorded as the official period of employment, Noah Dietrich continued to oversee and make executive decisions for the Hughes industries as late as 1970.) According to his own memoirs, he left the Hughes operation over a dispute involving putting more of his income on a [[capital gain]]s basis. The manuscript of his eventual memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', may have been a key, if inadvertent, source of novelist [[Clifford Irving]]'s infamous fake autobiography of Hughes.

==Early life==
Dietrich was born on February 28, 1889 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the son of German-born evangelical [[Lutheran]] minister John Dietrich, and the former Sarah Peters.<ref>[http://www.noahdietrich.com/bio.html] \"Noah Dietrich was born February 28, 1889 in Madison, Wisconsin and was the fourth of six children born to Sarah Peters and German-born evangelical Lutheran minister John Dietrich.\"</ref> He graduated from Janesville High School in 1906, married in 1910, and became a [[bank cashier]] in [[Maxwell, New Mexico]] for the next six months.  They then moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he became an [[auditor]] for the Los Angeles Suburban Land Co., and then the Janass Investment Co.  In 1917, he became an assistant [[comptroller]] for [[Edward L. Doheny]] Oil companies in [[New York City]].  Then Noah, along with his family now consisting of his wife and two daughters, decided to  move back to Los Angeles, where he worked for the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] firm of Haskins and Sells. There he passed the [[California Board of Accountancy]] exam in 1923.<ref name=obit/><ref name=\"Noah\">{{cite book |last1=Dietrich |first1=Noah |last2=Thomas |first2=Bob |title=Howard, The Amazing Mr. Hughes |date=1972 |publisher=Fawcett Publications, Inc. |location=Greenwich |pages=26-29}}</ref>

==Career==
===\"Noah Can Do It\"===
In Nov. 1925, at the age of 36, Dietrich met 19-year-old Hughes, who had gained control of [[Hughes Tool Company]] after buying out the other family heirs. Started by his father, [[Howard R. Hughes, Sr.]], Hughes Tool Company&nbsp;– or Toolco – manufactured oil drilling equipment, especially the multiple-edge, revolving-teeth roller cutter [[well drilling|drill bits]] the elder Hughes invented.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13-14,22-23,29-30}}

Hughes, according to Dietrich, was \"looking for someone with wide general knowledge,\" \"Someone who is resourceful and can solve problems.\"  Questions Hughes asked Dietrich included \"how a battleship finds the range on its target?\", and to \"Explain the principles of the internal combustion engine,\" both of which Dietrich was able to answer satisfactorily.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|23-24}}

Dietrich was hired as an executive assistant to explain the production and financial reports issued by Hughes' tool company, eventually becoming Hughes' personal delegate. In his memoir, Dietrich observed that Hughes had little interest in Toolco, other than as a source of revenue. \"The tool company,\" he quoted Hughes as saying, \"was my father's success. And it always will be.\"  The company's earnings, however, allowed Hughes to pursue his interest in Hollywood movies.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|33,76}}

When still in his early twenties, Hughes told Dietrich, \"My first objective is to become the world's number one golfer. Second, the top aviator, and third I want to become the world's most famous motion picture producer. Then, I want you to make me the richest man in the world.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|73}} 

In time, Dietrich came to serve as an executive for most of Hughes' enterprises, including [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA),<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|147}} [[RKO Pictures]]<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|237}} and [[Hughes Aircraft]].<ref name=obit/><ref name=Noah/>{{rp|255,257}}

Dietrich became Hughes' most indispensable executive&nbsp;– \"Noah can do it\" was, according to Dietrich's memoir, a frequent Hughes expression whenever difficult, if not impossible, wants or needs needed to be met. Some&nbsp;– such as when Dietrich arranged a stock ticker to be installed in a Hughes home&nbsp;– were merely difficult.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13}} Others&nbsp;– such as the time Dietrich arranged the shipment of Hughes' large private liquor stock from his Texas home to his California home during [[Prohibition]]&nbsp;– put him at serious risk.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|90-99}}

Dietrich guided the expansion of Hughes empire by using Hughes Tool Co. profits to purchase real estate, thus avoiding penalties for excess accumulated surplus.  Hughes also limited his salary to $50,000 per year, without dividend payments, thus limiting his income tax.  All of Hughes' major expenses, planes, automobiles, houses, etc., were also charged to Hughes Tool Co. as business expenses.  Hughes even said of Dietrich, \"He knows more about my business than I do,\" referring to Noah as a \"genius\".<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|102-104,147,192,254}}

Some of Dietrich's duties got him caught in the middle of disputes with members of Hughes' family. During a period when Hughes refused to talk to anyone outside a few business associates, Dietrich recalled, a Hughes' aunt Loomis accused Dietrich&nbsp;– who turned out to have been kept in the dark about Hughes' exact whereabouts himself&nbsp;– \"of hiding his body and running things\" himself. When Hughes returned, Dietrich wrote, he made a special point of calling this aunt. \"I didn't want her to continue believing that I was running the Hughes empire while I kept her nephew in the Deep-freeze.\" A few years later, while Hughes was recovering from injuries he sustained in the crash of his experimental [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11]] aircraft, Hughes refused a visit from his favorite aunt Annette Lummis, and her husband Dr. Fred Lummis. The uncle turned to Dietrich and said, \"Now I can better understand your problems in dealing with Hughes. I don't understand him at all.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|178-181,194-195}}

In 1946, Hughes put Dietrich in charge of Toolco.  Dietrich proceeded to modernize the company, and was able to increase profits to the point that Hughes Tool Co. made $285,000,000 in profits over the next 8 years.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|190-191}}

Dietrich also discussed in considerable detail the real impetus behind the government's investigation of [[Hughes Aircraft]] following World War II. Ostensibly, the probe involved Hughes' failure to deliver the infamous [[flying boat]], the ''Hercules'', a military transport aircraft, to the government on time. Dietrich wrote, however, that the real purpose of the probe may have been neutralizing Hughes, owner of TWA, while rival [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]&nbsp;– whose president, [[Juan Trippe]], had implored Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]] to carry it&nbsp;– pushed for a federal law establishing only one official American carrier of international air traffic, and Pan Am becoming that carrier.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|198-199}}

Dietrich discussed the famous Hughes counterattack before the Senate committee investigating him&nbsp;– and revealed that both his own and Hughes' hotel suites had been bugged during the hearings, allegedly at the behest of Brewster and Trippe. The hearings, and Hughes' legendary triumph over them, helped end both the legislation and Brewster's political career; On Hughes' orders, Dietrich poured money into a challenger's campaign a few years later.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|207-208}}

By 1948, Dietrich wrote that his duties were getting \"immensely onerous\", \"If an executive had to be fired, 'Noah can do it.' If millions had to be raised overnight, 'Noah can do it.' If a politico or a starlet had to be paid off, 'Noah can do it.' Noah was getting tired of doing it.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|253}}

===Falling out with Hughes===
Though Dietrich was pulling in a salary of $500,000 per year, his tax burden was 70% on the first $100,000 and then 93% for the remainder.  Dietrich wanted compensation based on a stock option, which was subject only to a tax of 25%. Yet, Dietrich wrote, Hughes \"simply could not bring himself to let anyone share in his ownership.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|22,254,262}}

In 1957, after working for Hughes for 32 years, Dietrich left the Hughes organization over a capital-gains dispute: Hughes had promised to make more of Dietrich's income on a capital gains basis. At the time of the falling-out, Hughes was trying to finance jets for TWA and decided the key was to inflate Hughes Tool profits in order to sell the company to pay for the jets, since Hughes had rejected all other financing solutions, because they threatened to dilute his TWA ownership.  At the same juncture, Hughes, Dietrich recalled, also did everything in his power to stop Dietrich's long-planned African safari with his two sons, the first long vacation Dietrich had taken in decades of working for Hughes.  Dietrich returned from Africa, he wrote, and finally agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan&nbsp;– on condition that Hughes finally implement the capital gains agreement. When Hughes refused, Dietrich immediately quit&nbsp;– stunning Hughes. (Dietrich quoted Hughes as saying, \"Noah, I can't exist without you!\")<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|15-19,293-294}}

Hughes didn't let him go without a fight. After pleading failed, Hughes tried to strong-arm Dietrich into reconsidering, going so far, Dietrich recorded, as changing the lock on Dietrich's office– a practice Hughes had followed any time top executives were fired or otherwise departed the Hughes operation, Dietrich recalled. Hughes also sought Dietrich's interest in their oil partnerships.  Dietrich wrote that he surrendered his interest just to be rid of Hughes, a move he later regretted, since the leases turned big profits eventually. Dietrich got a court order to reclaim many of his personal possessions from his old offices.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|295-298}}

===Post-Hughes career and memoirs===
After parting ways with Hughes, Dietrich, as a well-respected financial and executive advisor, served on several corporate and financial boards as well as traveling to many speaking engagements. His 1971 memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', provided many with the first genuine inside look into the world of Howard Hughes, including and especially his occasional lack of concern that things he wanted done often required breaches of ethics or even the law. Only when he was diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]] (the same illness that killed shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]]), did Dietrich finally retire in full.

Dietrich wrote of Hughes, \"Of all his possessions, TWA held a certain mystique for him.  He didn't give a damn about the tool company, except as a source of wealth.  Hughes Aircraft was an avocation for him, and outlet for his tendency to tinker.  RKO was a heady diversion, an opportunity to pursue his sensual enjoyments.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|290}}

==Personal life==
By 1936, he had divorced his first wife, and their two daughters were married.  By 1945, Dietrich had three children with his second wife.  By 1951, Dietrich was separated from his second wife.  After leaving Hughes in 1957, Dietrich married for a third time.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|140,188,257-258,301}}

In his book ''Howard'', Dietrich wrote, \"I much preferred the more exciting life,\" rather than the sedate life of a CPA.  He wrote the book \"to leave, for my children and grandchildren, a record of the role I played in a colorful subchapter of American history,\" and in part, so \"the American public should be informed on the uses and misuses of great wealth.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|11}}

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905773-1,00.html \"The Fabulous Hoax of Clifford Irving\"], ''Time''</ref> revealed in 1972 that a copy of an early draft of the manuscript for Dietrich's memoir, ghost-written by journalist James Phelan, may have fallen into Clifford Irving's hands, and identified the draft as a key element in Irving's being able to convince publishers and others that his hoax Hughes autobiography was genuine. \"The instances of duplicated material are numerous,\" the magazine wrote. \"In some cases, the books are virtually identical in detail.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905773-1,00.html \"The Fabulous Hoax of Clifford Irving\"], ''Time''</ref> revealed in 1972 that a copy of an early draft of the manuscript for Dietrich's memoir, ghost-written by journalist James Phelan, may have fallen into Clifford Irving's hands, and identified the draft as a key element in Irving's being able to convince publishers and others that his hoax Hughes autobiography was genuine. \"The instances of duplicated material are numerous,\" the magazine wrote. \"In some cases, the books are virtually identical in detail. In others, they are substantively the same, although the Irving manuscript has been reworded and otherwise disguised. One curiosity: the writing in the Irving manuscript is much better than that in the hastily drafted Phelan version. It is ironic that Irving may be more convincing as a forger than as an author in his own right&nbsp;– just as Elmyr de Hory, Irving's [[Ibiza]] friend and the main character in his book Fake!, is much better at doing [[Picasso]]s and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modiglianis]] than he is at doing De Horys.\"  When he later wrote his own memoir, ''The Hoax'', Irving corroborated the hypothesis posited by the ''Time'' article, writing that he indeed obtained and a made a copy of a draft of Dietrich's manuscript, which he then used as source material for his fabricated Hughes autobiography.

Dietrich and Phelan eventually settled for $40,000 after Dietrich became dissatisfied with Phelan's work. He then turned the project over to another journalist, [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]], who finished the Dietrich memoir within six weeks.

==Death==
Dietrich died of heart failure in hospital on February 15, 1982, in [[Palm Springs, California]].  He was just two weeks short of his ninety-third birthday.<ref name=obit>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/obituaries/noah-dietrich-the-chief-aide-to-howard-hughes-is-dead.html |title=Noah Dietrich, The Chief Aide To Howard Hughes, Is Dead |author=Walter H.

==TV/movie adaptations==
Noah Dietrich has been portrayed within several adaptations:
*[[Ed Flanders]] played Dietrich against [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Hughes in the 1977 mini-series ''[[The Amazing Howard Hughes]]''. Released one year after Hughes' death, Dietrich's role is highlighted from his commencement with Hughes as Accountant, his subsequent contribution in restructuring Hughes Empire, and his later departure.
*[[Eli Wallach]] played Dietrich in the 2006 movie [[The Hoax (film)|''The Hoax'']], about author [[Clifford Irving]]'s faked Howard Hughes autobiography.
*[[John C. Reilly]] played Dietrich against [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Hughes within the 2004 movie ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]''. A criticism of this adaptation was that it downplayed the role Dietrich played in helping Hughes amass his fortune.
* [[Martin Sheen]] portrayed Dietrich in the 2016 film ''[[Rules Don't Apply]]''.

== History ==
[[Image:PacificGuanoWorks WoodsHole bySSKilburn ca1865.png|left|thumb|Pacific Guano Works, Woods Hole, ca.1860s; engraving by [[Samuel Smith Kilburn|S.S. Kilburn]]]]

Historically, Woods Hole included one of the few good harbors (along with [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]]) on the southern side of Cape Cod (i.e. Great Harbor, contained by Penzance Point). The community became a center for whaling, shipping, and fishing, prior to its dominance today by tourism and marine research. At the end of the nineteenth century, Woods Hole was the home of the [[Pacific Guano Company]], which produced [[fertilizer]] from [[guano]] imported from islands in the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean, and the coast of South Carolina. After the firm went bankrupt in 1889, Long Neck–the peninsula on which their factory was located–was renamed Penzance Point and was developed with [[Shingle style architecture|shingle-style]] summer homes for bankers and lawyers from New York and Boston. Notable property owners on Penzance Point at the beginning of the twentieth century included Seward Prosser of New York's Bankers Trust Company; Francis Bartow, a partner in [[J. P. Morgan and Company]]; Joseph Lee, a partner in [[Lee, Higginson & Co.]]; and Franklin A. Park, an executive of [[Singer Sewing Machine]]. Other notable businessmen established homes on Gansett Point, Nobska Point, and at Quissett Harbor, further from the village center. [[Irving Langmuir]], the famous Scientist, also lived in Woods Hole and died there on August 16th, 1957.  Before 1898 the [http://www.woodsholeyachtclub.org Woods Hole Yacht Club] was formed.  In 1899 the [https://www.woodsholegolfclub.com/ Woods Hole Golf course] was started.  Around 1919 it was expanded to 18 holes.  In 1976 [https://www.woodsholefoundation.org/ The Woods Hole Foundation] was created.

==Geography==
Woods Hole is located at the southwest tip of the town of Falmouth (and of Cape Cod) at {{Coord|41|31|36|N|70|39|47|W|type:city}} (41.526730, -70.663184).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The term \"Woods Hole\" refers to a [[strait]] named [[Woods Hole (Passage)|Woods Hole]], which separates Cape Cod from the [[Elizabeth Islands]] (specifically, [[Uncatena Island]] and [[Nonamesset Island]]) and which boats, yachts, and small ferries can use to travel between [[Vineyard Sound]] and [[Buzzards Bay]]. The strait is known for its extremely [https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaacurrents/Stations?q=woods+hole strong current], approaching four [[knot (unit)|knots]].<ref>[http://www.mobilegeographics.com:81/locations/7064.html]</ref> It is one of four straits allowing maritime passage between Buzzards Bay and Vineyard Sound; the others are [[Canapitsit Channel]], [[Quick's Hole]] and [[Robinson's Hole]]. Published yearly is the [http://www.eldridgetide.com/ ''Eldridge Tide and Pilot Book''], which has a detailed reference section showing the complex pattern of tides and currents. Ferries operated by [[The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority]] run regularly between Woods Hole and Martha's Vineyard.  The present Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority was formed from the New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket Steamboat Company, which in turn was a consolidation of earlier companies dating to the early 19th century, just before the railroad arrived.<ref>[[The Woods Hole, Martha%27s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}

[[Image:Woods Hole, MA from the water.jpg|thumb|A view of [[downtown]] Woods Hole from the water, including [[Marine Biological Laboratory|MBL]] and [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|WHOI]] buildings]]

Much of Woods Hole centers around the enclosed harbor of Eel Pond. The [https://www.facebook.com/Eel-Pond-Bridge-187876691339687 Eel Pond Bridge], a [[bascule bridge|bascule]] [[drawbridge]] at the mouth of the harbor, allows boats to enter and exit the harbor according to a fixed schedule posted on the side of the bridge.

[[Nobska Light]], a [[lighthouse]] at [[Nobska Point]], is operated by the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the accompanying house is the home of the commander of the Coast Guard base at Little Harbor.

The local landmark The Knob is a rocky outcropping that overlooks Buzzards Bay and Quisset Harbor. It is a part of the privately owned Salt Pond bird sanctuaries.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Woods Hole CDP has a total area of {{convert|10.1|sqkm|order=flip}}. {{convert|5.5|sqkm|order=flip}} of it is land, and {{convert|4.6|sqkm|order=flip}} of it (45.24%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>

== Falmouth Road Race ==
The annual [[Falmouth Road Race]] brings thousands of runners to Woods Hole in August each year. The route of the {{convert|7|mi|adj=on}} race starts outside the front door of the Captain Kidd tavern and follows the shore of Vineyard Sound through Falmouth to the British Beer Company, another tavern, in Falmouth Heights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race History |url=https://falmouthroadrace.com/race-history/ |website=Falmouth Road Race |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Race Day |url=https://falmouthroadrace.com/race-day/ |website=Falmouth Road Race |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>

== Education ==
The [[Woods Hole School]] is the home of the Children's School of Science. Founded in 1913, this institution (locally known as \"CSS\" and \"Science School\") provides science classes for students between 8 and 15 years old that focus on scientific investigation by observation. Students regularly visit ecosystems around the village to study the organisms in their natural environments, such as the [[Sippewissett Salt Marsh]]. The Children's School of Science draws upon the talent brought to the village by the research institutions but also educates the children of both scientists and locals. 
Some mention of the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] is made in the 1975 blockbuster film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' as having been the center of research for the fictional character Matt Hooper. Hooper is described as a [[marine biologist]], focusing on the study of sharks. Coincidentally, a [[great white shark]] was spotted some years later near Woods Hole in September 2004.

Woods Hole is part of the Falmouth public school district, served by Mullen-Hall Elementary, Morse Pond Middle School, [[Lawrence Junior High School]], and [[Falmouth High School (Massachusetts)|Falmouth High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Falmouth Public Schools: District Information |url=http://www.falmouth.k12.ma.us/pages/Falmouth_Public_Schools/District/District_Information/District_Information |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Woods Hole students also often attend [[Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical High School]], [[Sturgis Charter Public School]], and [[Falmouth Academy]].{{Citation needed |reason=sentence inserted by Woods Hole local with knowledge, but no source for all 3 schools |date=January 2016}}

Historically, Woods Hole included one of the few good harbors (along with [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]]) on the southern side of Cape Cod (i.e. Great Harbor, contained by Penzance Point). The community became a center for whaling, shipping, and fishing, prior to its dominance today by tourism and marine research. At the end of the nineteenth century, Woods Hole was the home of the [[Pacific Guano Company]], which produced [[fertilizer]] from [[guano]] imported from islands in the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean, and the coast of South Carolina. After the firm went bankrupt in 1889, Long Neck–the peninsula on which their factory was located–was renamed Penzance Point and was developed with [[Shingle style architecture|shingle-style]] summer homes for bankers and lawyers from New York and Boston. Notable property owners on Penzance Point at the beginning of the twentieth century included Seward Prosser of New York's Bankers Trust Company; Francis Bartow, a partner in [[J. P. Morgan and Company]]; Joseph Lee, a partner in [[Lee, Higginson & Co.]]; and Franklin A. Park, an executive of [[Singer Sewing Machine]]. Other notable businessmen established homes on Gansett Point, Nobska Point, and at Quissett Harbor, further from the village center. [[Irving Langmuir]], the famous Scientist, also lived in Woods Hole and died there on August 16th, 1957.  Before 1898 the [http://www.woodsholeyachtclub.org Woods Hole Yacht Club] was formed.  In 1899 the [https://www.woodsholegolfclub.com/ Woods Hole Golf course] was started.  Around 1919 it was expanded to 18 holes.  In 1976 [https://www.woodsholefoundation.org/ The Woods Hole Foundation] was created.

==Geography==
Woods Hole is located at the southwest tip of the town of Falmouth (and of Cape Cod) at {{Coord|41|31|36|N|70|39|47|W|type:city}} (41.526730, -70.663184).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The term \"Woods Hole\" refers to a [[strait]] named [[Woods Hole (Passage)|Woods Hole]], which separates Cape Cod from the [[Elizabeth Islands]] (specifically, [[Uncatena Island]] and [[Nonamesset Island]]) and which boats, yachts, and small ferries can use to travel between [[Vineyard Sound]] and [[Buzzards Bay]]. The strait is known for its extremely [https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaacurrents/Stations?q=woods+hole strong current], approaching four [[knot (unit)|knots]].<ref>[http://www.mobilegeographics.com:81/locations/7064.html]</ref> It is one of four straits allowing maritime passage between Buzzards Bay and Vineyard Sound; the others are [[Canapitsit Channel]], [[Quick's Hole]] and [[Robinson's Hole]]. Published yearly is the [http://www.eldridgetide.com/ ''Eldridge Tide and Pilot Book''], which has a detailed reference section showing the complex pattern of tides and currents. Ferries operated by the [[The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority]] run regularly between Woods Hole and Martha's Vineyard.  The present Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority was formed from the New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket Steamboat Company, which in turn was a consolidation of earlier companies dating to the early 19th century, just before the railroad arrived.<ref>[[The Woods Hole, Martha%27s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}

[[Image:Woods Hole, MA from the water.jpg|thumb|A view of [[downtown]] Woods Hole from the water, including [[Marine Biological Laboratory|MBL]] and [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|WHOI]] buildings]]

Much of Woods Hole centers around the enclosed harbor of Eel Pond. The [https://www.facebook.com/Eel-Pond-Bridge-187876691339687 Eel Pond Bridge], a [[bascule bridge|bascule]] [[drawbridge]] at the mouth of the harbor, allows boats to enter and exit the harbor according to a fixed schedule posted on the side of the bridge.

[[Nobska Light]], a [[lighthouse]] at [[Nobska Point]], is operated by the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the accompanying house is the home of the commander of the Coast Guard base at Little Harbor.

The local landmark The Knob is a rocky outcropping that overlooks Buzzards Bay and Quisset Harbor. It is a part of the privately owned Salt Pond bird sanctuaries.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Woods Hole CDP has a total area of {{convert|10.1|sqkm|order=flip}}. {{convert|5.5|sqkm|order=flip}} of it is land, and {{convert|4.6|sqkm|order=flip}} of it (45.24%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>

== Falmouth Road Race ==
The annual [[Falmouth Road Race]] brings thousands of runners to Woods Hole in August each year. The route of the {{convert|7|mi|adj=on}} race starts outside the front door of the Captain Kidd tavern and follows the shore of Vineyard Sound through Falmouth to the British Beer Company, another tavern, in Falmouth Heights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race History |url=https://falmouthroadrace.com/race-history/ |website=Falmouth Road Race |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Race Day |url=https://falmouthroadrace.com/race-day/ |website=Falmouth Road Race |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>

== Education ==
The [[Woods Hole School]] is the home of the Children's School of Science. Founded in 1913, this institution (locally known as \"CSS\" and \"Science School\") provides science classes for students between 8 and 15 years old that focus on scientific investigation by observation. Students regularly visit ecosystems around the village to study the organisms in their natural environments, such as the [[Sippewissett Salt Marsh]]. The Children's School of Science draws upon the talent brought to the village by the research institutions but also educates the children of both scientists and locals. 
Some mention of the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] is made in the 1975 blockbuster film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' as having been the center of research for the fictional character Matt Hooper. Hooper is described as a [[marine biologist]], focusing on the study of sharks. Coincidentally, a [[great white shark]] was spotted some years later near Woods Hole in September 2004.

Woods Hole is part of the Falmouth public school district, served by Mullen-Hall Elementary, Morse Pond Middle School, [[Lawrence Junior High School]], and [[Falmouth High School (Massachusetts)|Falmouth High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Falmouth Public Schools: District Information |url=http://www.falmouth.k12.ma.us/pages/Falmouth_Public_Schools/District/District_Information/District_Information |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Woods Hole students also often attend [[Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical High School]], [[Sturgis Charter Public School]], and [[Falmouth Academy]].{{Citation needed |reason=sentence inserted by Woods Hole local with knowledge, but no source for all 3 schools |date=January 2016}}

As of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 925 people, 459 households, and 212 families residing in the CDP. The [[population density]] was 165.3/km² (427.9/mi²). There were 942 housing units at an average density of 168.4/km² (435.8/mi²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 94.70% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 1.62% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.54% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.84% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.22% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.08% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.97% of the population.

There were 459 households out of which 14.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.7% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 5.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 53.6% were non-families. 40.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 17.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.94 and the average family size was 2.58.

In the CDP, the population was spread out with 13.5% under the age of 18, 7.1% from 18 to 24, 25.7% from 25 to 44, 26.4% from 45 to 64, and 27.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48 years. For every 100 females, there are 94.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.7 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $47,604, and the median income for a family was $57,969. Males had a median income of $31,964 versus $31,875 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the CDP was $30,752. None of the families and 5.3% of the population were living below the [[poverty line]], including no under 18 and 6.4% of those over 64.

{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}
'''Common Intermediate Language''' ('''CIL'''), formerly called '''Microsoft Intermediate Language''' ('''MSIL''') or '''Intermediate Language''' ('''IL'''),<ref>{{cite web |url = https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code |title = Intermediate Language & execution}}</ref> is the [[intermediate language]] binary instruction set defined within the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI) specification.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf |page = 32 |title = ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)}}</ref> CIL instructions are executed by a CLI-compatible runtime environment such as the [[Common Language Runtime]]. Languages which target the CLI compile to CIL. CIL is [[object-oriented]], [[Stack machine|stack-based]] [[bytecode]]. Runtimes typically [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] compile CIL instructions into [[native code]].

CIL was originally known as Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) during the beta releases of the .NET languages. Due to standardization of [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and the CLI, the bytecode is now officially known as CIL.<ref>{{cite web

==General information==
During compilation of [[List of CLI languages|CLI programming languages]], the [[source code]] is translated into CIL code rather than into platform- or processor-specific [[object file|object code]]. CIL is a [[CPU]]- and platform-independent instruction set that can be executed in any environment supporting the Common Language Infrastructure,<ref>

</ref> such as the [[Common Language Runtime|.NET runtime]] on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], or the [[cross-platform]] [[Mono (software)|Mono]] runtime. In theory, this eliminates the need to distribute different executable files for different platforms and CPU types. CIL code is verified for safety during runtime, providing better security and reliability than natively compiled executable files.

The execution process looks like this:

#Source code is converted to CIL [[bytecode]] and a [[Assembly (CLI)|CLI assembly]] is created.
#Upon execution of a CIL assembly, its code is passed through the runtime's [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT compiler]] to generate native code. Ahead-of-time compilation may also be used, which eliminates this step, but at the cost of executable-file portability.
#The computer's processor executes the native code.

==Instructions==
{{See also|List of CIL instructions}}

CIL bytecode has [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s for the following groups of tasks:
*Load and store
*[[Arithmetic]]
*[[Type conversion]]
*[[Dynamic memory allocation|Object creation and manipulation]]
*[[stack (data structure)|Operand stack management (push / pop)]]
*[[branch (computer science)|Control transfer (branching)]]
*[[Subroutine|Method invocation and return]]
*[[Exception handling|Throwing exceptions]]
*[[Monitor (synchronization)|Monitor-based concurrency]]
*Data and function pointers manipulation needed for C++/CLI and unsafe C# code

==Computational model==
The Common Intermediate Language is object-oriented and [[stack-based]]. That means that data is pushed on a stack instead of pulled from registers as in most [[CPU architecture]]s.

In [[x86]] it might look like this:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"asm\">
add eax, edx
</syntaxhighlight>

The corresponding code in [[Intermediate language|IL]] can be rendered as this, where 0 is eax and 1 is edx:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
ldloc.0    // push local variable 0 onto stack
ldloc.1    // push local variable 1 onto stack
add        // pop and add the top two stack items then push the result onto the stack
stloc.0    // pop and store the top stack item to local variable 0
</syntaxhighlight>

Here are two locals that are pushed on the stack. When the add-instruction is called the operands get popped and the result is pushed. The remaining value is then popped and stored in the first local.

===Object-oriented concepts===
This extends to object-oriented concepts as well. You may create objects, call methods and use other types of members such as fields.

CIL is designed to be object-oriented and every [[Method (programming)|method]] needs (with some exceptions) to reside in a class. So does this static method:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
.class public Foo
{
    .method public static int32 Add(int32, int32) cil managed
    {
        .maxstack 2
        ldarg.0 // load the first argument;
        ldarg.1 // load the second argument;
        add     // add them;
        ret     // return the result;
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

This method does not require any instance of Foo to be declared because it is static. That means it belongs to the class and it may then be used like this in C#:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
int r = Foo.Add(2, 3);    // 5
</syntaxhighlight>

In CIL:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
ldc.i4.2
ldc.i4.3
call int32 Foo::Add(int32, int32)
stloc.0
</syntaxhighlight>

====Instance classes====

An instance class contains at least one constructor and some instance members. This class has a set of methods representing actions of a Car-object.
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
.class public Car
{
    .method public specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor(int32, int32) cil managed
    {
        /* Constructor */
    }

    .method public void Move(int32) cil managed
    {
        /* Omitting implementation */
    }

    .method public void TurnRight() cil managed
    {
        /* Omitting implementation */
    }

    .method public void TurnLeft() cil managed
    {
        /* Omitting implementation */
    }

    .method public void Brake() cil managed
    {
        /* Omitting implementation */
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

====Creating objects====

In C# class instances are created like this:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
Car myCar = new Car(1, 4); 
Car yourCar = new Car(1, 3); 
</syntaxhighlight>

And these statements are roughly the same as these instructions:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
ldc.i4.1
ldc.i4.4
newobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)
stloc.0    // myCar = new Car(1, 4);
ldc.i4.1
ldc.i4.3
newobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)
stloc.1    // yourCar = new Car(1, 3);
</syntaxhighlight>

====Invoking instance methods====

Instance methods are invoked like the one that follows:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
myCar.Move(3);
</syntaxhighlight>

In CIL:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
ldloc.0    // Load the object \"myCar\" on the stack
ldc.i4.3
call instance void Car::Move(int32)
</syntaxhighlight>

===Metadata===
{{Main|Metadata (CLI)}}
CLI records information about compiled classes as [[Metadata]]. Like the type library in the [[Component Object Model]], this enables applications to support and discover the interfaces, classes, types, methods, and fields in the assembly. The process of reading such metadata is called ''[[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]]''.

Metadata can be data in the form of '' attributes''. Attributes can be custom made by extending from the <code>Attribute</code> class. This is a very powerful feature. It allows the creator of the class the ability to adorn it with extra information that consumers of the class can use in various meaningful ways depending on the application domain.

==Example==
Below is a basic [[Hello, World]] program written in CIL. It will display the string \"Hello, world!\".
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
.assembly Hello {}
.assembly extern mscorlib {}
.method static void Main()
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 1
    ldstr \"Hello, world!\"
    call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
    ret
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The following code is more complex in number of opcodes.

''This code can also be compared with the corresponding code in the article about [[Java bytecode]].''
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    for (int i = 2; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 2; j < i; j++)
        {
             if (i % j == 0)
                 goto outer;
        }
        Console.WriteLine(i);
        outer:;
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

In CIL syntax it looks like this:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">
.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack  2
    .locals init (int32 V_0,
                  int32 V_1)

              ldc.i4.2
              stloc.0
              br.s       IL_001f
    IL_0004:  ldc.i4.2
              stloc.1
              br.s       IL_0011
    IL_0008:  ldloc.0
              ldloc.1
              rem
              brfalse.s  IL_001b
              ldloc.1
              ldc.i4.1
              add
              stloc.1
    IL_0011:  ldloc.1
              ldloc.0
              blt.s      IL_0008
              ldloc.0
              call       void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(int32)
    IL_001b:  ldloc.0
              ldc.i4.1
              add
              stloc.0
    IL_001f:  ldloc.0
              ldc.i4     0x3e8
              blt.s      IL_0004
              ret
}
</syntaxhighlight>

This is just a representation of how CIL looks like near VM-level. When compiled the methods are stored in tables and the instructions are stored as bytes inside the assembly, which is a [[Portable Executable]] (PE).

==Generation==
A CIL assembly and instructions are generated by either a compiler or a utility called the ''IL Assembler'' ([[ILAsm]]) that is shipped with the execution environment.

Assembled CIL can also be disassembled into code again using the ''IL Disassembler'' (ILDASM). There are other tools such as [[.NET Reflector]] that can decompile CIL into a high-level language (e.&nbsp;g. C# or [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic]]). This makes CIL a very easy target for reverse engineering. This trait is shared with [[Java bytecode]]. However, there are tools that can [[Obfuscated code|obfuscate]] the code, and do it so that the code cannot be easily readable but still be runnable.

==Execution==

===Just-in-time compilation===
[[Just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) involves turning the byte-code into code immediately executable by the CPU. The conversion is performed gradually during the program's execution. JIT compilation provides environment-specific optimization, runtime type safety, and assembly verification. To accomplish this, the JIT compiler examines the assembly metadata for any illegal accesses and handles violations appropriately.

===Ahead-of-time compilation===
[[Common Language Infrastructure|CLI]]-compatible execution environments also come with the option to do an [[Ahead-of-time compilation]] (AOT) of an assembly to make it execute faster by removing the JIT process at runtime.

In the [[.NET Framework]] there is a special tool called the [[Native Image Generator]] (NGEN) that performs the AOT. A different approach for AOT is [[CoreRT]] that allows the compilation of .Net Core code to a single executable with no dependency on a runtime. In [[Mono (programming)|Mono]] there is also an option to do an AOT.

==Pointer instructions - C++/CLI==
A notable difference from Java's bytecode is that CIL comes with ldind, stind, ldloca, and many call instructions which are enough for data/function pointers manipulation needed to compile C/C++ code into CIL.

<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">
class A {
   public: virtual void __stdcall meth() {}
};
void test_pointer_operations(int param) {
	int k = 0;
	int * ptr = &k;
	*ptr = 1;
	ptr = &param;
	*ptr = 2;
	A a;
	A * ptra = &a;
	ptra->meth();
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The corresponding code in CIL can be rendered as this:

<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">
.method assembly static void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvCdecl) 
        test_pointer_operations(int32 param) cil managed
{
  .vtentry 1 : 1
  // Code size       44 (0x2c)
  .maxstack  2
  .locals ([0] int32* ptr,
           [1] valuetype A* V_1,
           [2] valuetype A* a,
           [3] int32 k)
// k = 0;
  IL_0000:  ldc.i4.0 
  IL_0001:  stloc.3
// ptr = &k;
  IL_0002:  ldloca.s   k // load local's address instruction
  IL_0004:  stloc.0
// *ptr = 1;
  IL_0005:  ldloc.0
  IL_0006:  ldc.i4.1
  IL_0007:  stind.i4 // indirection instruction
// ptr = &param
  IL_0008:  ldarga.s   param // load parameter's address instruction
  IL_000a:  stloc.0
// *ptr = 2
  IL_000b:  ldloc.0
  IL_000c:  ldc.i4.2
  IL_000d:  stind.i4
// a = new A;
  IL_000e:  ldloca.s   a
  IL_0010:  call       valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvThiscall) 'A.{ctor}'(valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst) modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst))
  IL_0015:  pop
// ptra = &a;
  IL_0016:  ldloca.s   a
  IL_0018:  stloc.1
// ptra->meth();
  IL_0019:  ldloc.1
  IL_001a:  dup
  IL_001b:  ldind.i4 // reading the VMT for virtual call
  IL_001c:  ldind.i4
  IL_001d:  calli      unmanaged stdcall void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvStdcall)(native int)
  IL_0022:  ret

'''Common Intermediate Language''' ('''CIL'''), formerly called '''Microsoft Intermediate Language''' ('''MSIL''') or '''Intermediate Language''' ('''IL'''),<ref>{{cite web |url = https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code |title = Intermediate Language & execution}}</ref> is the [[intermediate language]] binary instruction set defined within the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI) specification.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf |page = 32 |title = ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)}}</ref> CIL instructions are executed by a CLI-compatible runtime environment such as the [[Common Language Runtime]]. Languages which target the CLI compile to CIL. CIL is [[object-oriented]], [[Stack machine|stack-based]] [[bytecode]]. Runtimes typically [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] compile CIL instructions into [[native code]].

CIL was originally known as Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) during the beta releases of the .NET languages. Due to standardization of [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and the CLI, the bytecode is now officially known as CIL.<ref>{{cite web

==General information==
During compilation of [[List of CLI languages|CLI programming languages]], the [[source code]] is translated into CIL code rather than into platform- or processor-specific [[object file|object code]]. CIL is a [[CPU]]- and platform-independent instruction set that can be executed in any environment supporting the Common Language Infrastructure,<ref>

</ref> such as the [[Common Language Runtime|.NET runtime]] on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], or the [[cross-platform]] [[Mono (software)|Mono]] runtime. In theory, this eliminates the need to distribute different executable files for different platforms and CPU types. CIL code is verified for safety during runtime, providing better security and reliability than natively compiled executable files.

The execution process looks like this:

#Source code is converted to CIL [[bytecode]] and a [[Assembly (CLI)|CLI assembly]] is created.
#Upon execution of a CIL assembly, its code is passed through the runtime's [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT compiler]] to generate native code. Ahead-of-time compilation may also be used, which eliminates this step, but at the cost of executable-file portability.
#The computer's processor executes the native code.

==Instructions==
{{See also|List of CIL instructions}}

CIL bytecode has [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s for the following groups of tasks:
*Load and store
*[[Arithmetic]]
*[[Type conversion]]
*[[Dynamic memory allocation|Object creation and manipulation]]
*[[stack (data structure)|Operand stack management (push / pop)]]
*[[branch (computer science)|Control transfer (branching)]]
*[[Subroutine|Method invocation and return]]
*[[Exception handling|Throwing exceptions]]
*[[Monitor (synchronization)|Monitor-based concurrency]]
*Data and function pointers manipulation needed for C++/CLI and unsafe C# code

==Computational model==
The Common Intermediate Language is object-oriented and [[stack-based]]. That means that data is pushed on a stack instead of pulled from registers as in most [[CPU architecture]]s.

In [[x86]] it might look like this:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"asm\">
add eax, edx
</syntaxhighlight>

The corresponding code in [[Intermediate language|IL]] can be rendered as this, where 0 is eax and 1 is edx:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
ldloc.0    // push local variable 0 onto stack
ldloc.1    // push local variable 1 onto stack
add        // pop and add the top two stack items then push the result onto the stack
stloc.0    // pop and store the top stack item to local variable 0
</syntaxhighlight>

Here are two locals that are pushed on the stack. When the add-instruction is called the operands get popped and the result is pushed. The remaining value is then popped and stored in the first local.

===Object-oriented concepts===
This extends to object-oriented concepts as well. You may create objects, call methods and use other types of members such as fields.

CIL is designed to be object-oriented and every [[Method (programming)|method]] needs (with some exceptions) to reside in a class. So does this static method:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
.class public Foo
{
    .method public static int32 Add(int32, int32) cil managed
    {
        .maxstack 2
        ldarg.0 // load the first argument;
        ldarg.1 // load the second argument;
        add     // add them;
        ret     // return the result;
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

This method does not require any instance of Foo to be declared because it is static. That means it belongs to the class and it may then be used like this in C#:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
int r = Foo.Add(2, 3);    // 5
</syntaxhighlight>

In CIL:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
ldc.i4.2
ldc.i4.3
call int32 Foo::Add(int32, int32)
stloc.0
</syntaxhighlight>

====Instance classes====

An instance class contains at least one constructor and some instance members. This class has a set of methods representing actions of a Car-object.
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
.class public Car
{
    .method public specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor(int32, int32) cil managed
    {
        /* Constructor */
    }

    .method public void Move(int32) cil managed
    {
        /* Omitting implementation */
    }

    .method public void TurnRight() cil managed
    {
        /* Omitting implementation */
    }

    .method public void TurnLeft() cil managed
    {
        /* Omitting implementation */
    }

    .method public void Brake() cil managed
    {
        /* Omitting implementation */
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

====Creating objects====

In C# class instances are created like this:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
Car myCar = new Car(1, 4); 
Car yourCar = new Car(1, 3); 
</syntaxhighlight>

And these statements are roughly the same as these instructions:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
ldc.i4.1
ldc.i4.4
newobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)
stloc.0    // myCar = new Car(1, 4);
ldc.i4.1
ldc.i4.3
newobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)
stloc.1    // yourCar = new Car(1, 3);
</syntaxhighlight>

====Invoking instance methods====

Instance methods are invoked like the one that follows:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
myCar.Move(3);
</syntaxhighlight>

In CIL:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
ldloc.0    // Load the object \"myCar\" on the stack
ldc.i4.3
call instance void Car::Move(int32)
</syntaxhighlight>

===Metadata===
{{Main|Metadata (CLI)}}
CLI records information about compiled classes as [[Metadata]]. Like the type library in the [[Component Object Model]], this enables applications to support and discover the interfaces, classes, types, methods, and fields in the assembly. The process of reading such metadata is called ''[[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]]''.

Metadata can be data in the form of '' attributes''. Attributes can be custom made by extending from the <code>Attribute</code> class. This is a very powerful feature. It allows the creator of the class the ability to adorn it with extra information that consumers of the class can use in various meaningful ways depending on the application domain.

==Example==
Below is a basic [[Hello, World]] program written in CIL. It will display the string \"Hello, world!\".
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
.assembly Hello {}
.assembly extern mscorlib {}
.method static void Main()
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 1
    ldstr \"Hello, world!\"
    call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
    ret
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The following code is more complex in number of opcodes.

''This code can also be compared with the corresponding code in the article about [[Java bytecode]].''
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    for (int i = 2; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 2; j < i; j++)
        {
             if (i % j == 0)
                 goto outer;
        }
        Console.WriteLine(i);
        outer:;
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

In CIL syntax it looks like this:
<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">
.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack  2
    .locals init (int32 V_0,
                  int32 V_1)

              ldc.i4.2
              stloc.0
              br.s       IL_001f
    IL_0004:  ldc.i4.2
              stloc.1
              br.s       IL_0011
    IL_0008:  ldloc.0
              ldloc.1
              rem
              brfalse.s  IL_001b
              ldloc.1
              ldc.i4.1
              add
              stloc.1
    IL_0011:  ldloc.1
              ldloc.0
              blt.s      IL_0008
              ldloc.0
              call       void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(int32)
    IL_001b:  ldloc.0
              ldc.i4.1
              add
              stloc.0
    IL_001f:  ldloc.0
              ldc.i4     0x3e8
              blt.s      IL_0004
              ret
}
</syntaxhighlight>

This is just a representation of how CIL looks like near VM-level. When compiled the methods are stored in tables and the instructions are stored as bytes inside the assembly, which is a [[Portable Executable]] (PE).

==Generation==
A CIL assembly and instructions are generated by either a compiler or a utility called the ''IL Assembler'' ([[ILAsm]]) that is shipped with the execution environment.

Assembled CIL can also be disassembled into code again using the ''IL Disassembler'' (ILDASM). There are other tools such as [[.NET Reflector]] that can decompile CIL into a high-level language (e.&nbsp;g. C# or [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic]]). This makes CIL a very easy target for reverse engineering. This trait is shared with [[Java bytecode]]. However, there are tools that can [[Obfuscated code|obfuscate]] the code, and do it so that the code cannot be easily readable but still be runnable.

==Execution==

===Just-in-time compilation===
[[Just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) involves turning the byte-code into code immediately executable by the CPU. The conversion is performed gradually during the program's execution. JIT compilation provides environment-specific optimization, runtime type safety, and assembly verification. To accomplish this, the JIT compiler examines the assembly metadata for any illegal accesses and handles violations appropriately.

===Ahead-of-time compilation===
[[Common Language Infrastructure|CLI]]-compatible execution environments also come with the option to do an [[Ahead-of-time compilation]] (AOT) of an assembly to make it execute faster by removing the JIT process at runtime.

In the [[.NET Framework]] there is a special tool called the [[Native Image Generator]] (NGEN) that performs the AOT. A different approach for AOT is [[CoreRT]] that allows the compilation of .Net Core code to a single executable with no dependency on a runtime. In [[Mono (programming)|Mono]] there is also an option to do an AOT.

==Pointer instructions - C++/CLI==
A notable difference from Java's bytecode is that CIL comes with ldind, stind, ldloca, and many call instructions which are enough for data/function pointers manipulation needed to compile C/C++ code into CIL.

<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">
class A {
   public: virtual void __stdcall meth() {}
};
void test_pointer_operations(int param) {
	int k = 0;
	int * ptr = &k;
	*ptr = 1;
	ptr = &param;
	*ptr = 2;
	A a;
	A * ptra = &a;
	ptra->meth();
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The corresponding code in CIL can be rendered as this:

<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">
.method assembly static void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvCdecl) 
        test_pointer_operations(int32 param) cil managed
{
  .vtentry 1 : 1
  // Code size       44 (0x2c)
  .maxstack  2
  .locals ([0] int32* ptr,
           [1] valuetype A* V_1,
           [2] valuetype A* a,
           [3] int32 k)
// k = 0;
  IL_0000:  ldc.i4.0 
  IL_0001:  stloc.3
// ptr = &k;
  IL_0002:  ldloca.s   k // load local's address instruction
  IL_0004:  stloc.0
// *ptr = 1;
  IL_0005:  ldloc.0
  IL_0006:  ldc.i4.1
  IL_0007:  stind.i4 // indirection instruction
// ptr = &param
  IL_0008:  ldarga.s   param // load parameter's address instruction
  IL_000a:  stloc.0
// *ptr = 2
  IL_000b:  ldloc.0
  IL_000c:  ldc.i4.2
  IL_000d:  stind.i4
// a = new A;
  IL_000e:  ldloca.s   a
  IL_0010:  call       valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvThiscall) 'A.{ctor}'(valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst) modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst))
  IL_0015:  pop
// ptra = &a;
  IL_0016:  ldloca.s   a
  IL_0018:  stloc.1
// ptra->meth();
  IL_0019:  ldloc.1
  IL_001a:  dup
  IL_001b:  ldind.i4 // reading the VMT for virtual call
  IL_001c:  ldind.i4
  IL_001d:  calli      unmanaged stdcall void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvStdcall)(native int)
  IL_0022:  ret
} // end of method 'Global Functions'::test_pointer_operations

'''Wickford''' is a town in the south of the English [[county (England)|county]] of [[Essex]], with a population of more than 33,000. Located approximately 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east of London, it falls within the [[Borough of Basildon]] along with the original town of [[Basildon]], [[Billericay]], [[Laindon]] and [[Pitsea]]. However, parts of Wickford fall under neighbouring districts such as Chelmsford and Rochford.

Wickford has become a [[commuter town]], serving the City of London through [[Wickford railway station|its railway station's]] direct connection to [[Liverpool Street station]] through the [[Shenfield to Southend Line|Southend Victoria line]], on which a train to London takes approximately 40 minutes. The town can also be easily reached via the road network by the [[A127 road|A127]] between London and [[Southend-on-Sea]] or by the [[A130 road|A130]] from [[Chelmsford]].

Wickford is a fairly small town with a main high street including a range of shops. It also has a swimming pool, library, open-air market and a community centre within the vicinity of the town centre.

Wickford also incorporates a small estate called [[Shotgate]], which is home to many residents. Shotgate features a row of village shops and a children's play area and park.

== History ==
Wickford has a history going back over two thousand years. There is evidence that the area itself was inhabited in [[prehistoric]] times probably by a tribe of Britons called [[Trinovantes]]. There was a Roman military marching camp on the Beauchamps Farm site, which was succeeded by a Roman villa. This is now the site of [[Beauchamps High School]]. This area on higher ground was the historic core of Wickford, the site of the manor house and the parish church of St Catherine's. Over time the commercial centre of Wickford has migrated westwards, towards the modern High Street on the other side of the [[River Crouch]].<ref name=time>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VZaIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT5|title=Wickford and Around Through Time

The place-name Wickford is first attested in a Saxon charter of 995, where it appears as ''Wicford''. It appears in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Wincfort''. The name means 'ford by a [[wych elm]] or ford by a dairy-farm'.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', pp. 516 and 515.</ref>

Before the 20th century Wickford was an agricultural village. At the time of the Domesday Survey, six land-holders were recorded. Historically there have been only two considerable estates in Wickford, the manor of Wickford Hall and the manor of Stilemans. [[Robert Wikeford]] or de Wickford (1330–90), [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], was born in Wickford, and his family are thought to have been Lords of the Manor of Wickford Hall.<ref>O'Flanagan, J. Roderick  ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors of Ireland'' London 1870</ref>

=== American relations ===
The village of [[Wickford, Rhode Island|Wickford]] in [[Rhode Island]], United States, is believed to have been named after this town.

Wickford was also the English birthplace of Elizabeth Reade (1615–72), the second wife of [[John Winthrop the Younger]] (1606–76), [[List of colonial governors of Connecticut|Governor of Connecticut]], and a step-daughter of [[Hugh Peter]] (1598–1660), a prominent supporter of the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary cause]] during the [[English Civil War]].

=== Naturism ===
Wickford became the birthplace of [[British Naturism|Naturism]] in the United Kingdom: in 1924 the English [[Gymnosophist]] Society was formed and had its home in the town.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3652246/Stark-naked-ambition.html|title=Stark naked ambition|last=Edwards|first=Adam|date=9 May 2006|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2 February 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

Around the town, in amongst the [[hedgerow]]s and fields, there are numerous [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] constructed as a part of [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|British anti-invasion preparations]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== 1958 flood ===
In 1958 Wickford town centre was hit by a flood which made national news headlines. The most striking image of the flood was a double-decker bus, left stranded at Halls Corner overnight, partly submerged by the floodwater.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001578/19580913/102/0036|title=Aftermath of Black Friday’s Fantastic Storms|last=|first=|date=13 September 1958|work=[[Illustrated London News]]|access-date=22 March 2019|issue=6223|pages=35-36|url-access=subscription |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref> A second flood in 1960 meant changes to the course of the River Crouch were made. This included turning the river into a concrete channel through the centre of the town, although this may be removed in the coming years, depending on the scale of the Wickford Masterplan (see below).

== Geography ==
[[File:Wickford river crouch.jpg|thumb|right|The [[River Crouch]] flows through Wickford in a concrete bank designed to protect the town from flooding.]]
For the most part, Wickford is flat and {{convert|10|m|ft}} above sea level. The highest point, on the outskirts of the town, is {{convert|74|m|ft}} above sea level. The [[River Crouch]] flows through the town, from the west to the east. The River Wick flows into the River Crouch from the south.

==The Master Plan==
[[File:Riverside Place Wickford.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Riverside Place Phase 1 complete]]

The Wickford Masterplan was first unveiled at the Wickford Community Centre in December 2004 and published in November 2005 by DTZ Pieda Consulting,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=1203&p=0|title=Wickford Masterplan 2005|accessdate=30 December 2009|publisher=Basildon Council}}</ref> at a budget of £125&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"echo1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4312054.Wickford_masterplan_comes_a_step_closer/|title=Basildon Council accepts sole bidder for Wickford masterplan tender|date=23 April 2009|accessdate=30 December 2009|publisher=Echo}}</ref> and many of the developments are currently in progress. At the heart of the proposals is the redevelopment of the High Street, which will be redesigned to be the town's premier meeting place. The Masterplan would create new public spaces, enhance the retail environment through the renewal of retail floor space and bring the market into the street scene, promoting urban living above shops and on the existing market site.

Adjacent to the River Crouch, a number of high quality residential developments promoted as the \"Town Centre Riverside Living\" complex would revitalise the riverside as a public asset and promotion of new eating and drinking opportunities. In addition, a new residential development to the west of Market Avenue will be constructed.

Promoting the station entrances on both sides of the railway line as key gateways to Wickford are also key areas of the plan, which would enhance transport interchange facilities and bring forward the car park site on Station Road for development as a new [[multi-storey car park]] and [[mixed-use development]]. As of present only the northern side of the station facing The Broadway is easily accessible, with the southern London-bound track only accessible from the outside though a small out-of-way footpath from Market Avenue as a courteous entrance for wheelchair-using passengers.

Public and health services would be improved under the scheme, with the re-organisation of existing health, library and community services into a new 'iconic' building to the east of Market Avenue as an integrated community service facility.

The Eastern Extension would create a better presence and new linkages to the east of the town centre by redeveloping the car park into a multi-storey development with residential and live-work uses and a new housing scheme to the east of Wickford Bypass. The Southern Gateway area, which surrounds London Road and the southern end of the High Street, are also planned to undergo a transition with a strong leisure and recreational theme, building on existing eating and drinking facilities and incorporating compatible residential uses.

Overall 650 apartments are planned to be built as part of the Masterplan as officially stated by [[councillor]] Tony Ball,<ref name=\"echo1\"/> although other sources opposed to the project claim this figure is closer to 735.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp_tally.htm|title=Masterplan – the current total|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Wickford Action Group}}</ref>

===Opposition===
The Masterplan has met with resistance with many residents of Wickford, mainly due to overall cost, and also the fear from some older residents that raising the level of the river could see repeats of the floods in 1958 and 1960.

There have also been criticism over the number of developments being constructed, which some say threaten to overdevelop and cause environmental and aesthetic damage to the town centre whilst providing minimal improvements to public services; one such group is the Wickford Action Group who has campaigned against many of the revisions made prior to the public approval of the plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp.htm|title=Masterplan – the current total|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Wickford action Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp.htm|title=Fears for Wickford|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Echo}}</ref>

===Progress===
Construction began in earnest in February 2007, which saw the demolition of many of the buildings in Lower Southend Road to make way for a new residential area. As of December 2009 this development has been partially completed (Riverside Place phase 1 + Riverside Court), however the [[compulsory purchase order]] of the post sorting office has been withdrawn leaving the fate of Riverside Place Phase 2 in doubt.

As of April 2010, the whole of the Masterplan project is facing serious delays and construction has halted due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4069123.Wickford_Masterplan_may_be_put_back_again/|title=Wickford Masterplan may be put back again|accessdate=12 March 2009|publisher=Echo News|date=23 January 2009}}</ref> In May 2009 the construction company Bradgate Developments released a statement assuring residents the project was still on track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/latestnews/WICKFORD-Builders-vow-flats-plan-ahead/article-984693-detail/article.html|title=WICKFORD: Builders vow flats plan will go ahead|accessdate=12 March 2009|publisher=This Is Total Essex.co.uk|date=12 May 2009}}</ref>

== Political career==
In 2007, Anderson was elected to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] as a Sinn Féin member for [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle]], along with [[Raymond McCartney]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Northern Ireland election | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/nielection/html/258.stm | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 9 March 2007 | accessdate = 21 March 2007}}</ref>

In May 2007, Anderson became one of the first Sinn Féin members to join the [[Northern Ireland Policing Board]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Policing Board – Martina Anderson MLA |url=http://www.nipolicingboard.org.uk/index/theboard/member.htm?id=6838 |publisher=NI Policing Board |date=31 May 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917044430/http://www.nipolicingboard.org.uk/index/theboard/member.htm?id=6838 |archivedate=17 September 2008 }}</ref>

In December 2007, Anderson said she was concerned that large numbers of [[migrant worker]]s from mainly Catholic countries were being classed as 'Catholic/nationalist' in monitoring forms, rather than 'other'.<ref name=\"newsletter.co.uk\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/Sinn-Fein-and-DUP-in.3602650.jp |title=Sinn Fein and DUP in job figures row - Belfast Newsletter |publisher=Newsletter.co.uk |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref> She said \"Given that the entire basis of the legislation around monitoring was put in place to identify imbalances in the workforce between the local Catholic/nationalist and Protestant/unionist communities it is therefore vital that given the addition of migrant workers in the workforce, that they should clearly be categorised as having a community background of 'other'.\"<ref name=\"newsletter.co.uk\"/>
Employment monitoring by the [[Equality Commission for Northern Ireland|Equality Commission]] records solely religion, and not political affiliation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalityni.org/sections/default.asp?cms=news_Press+Releases&cmsid=1_9&id=90&secid=1_1 |title=ECNI - Equality Commission, Northern Ireland |publisher=Equalityni.org |date=2015-08-30 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>

In May 2012 it was announced that she would be replacing [[Bairbre de Brún]], as MEP for [[Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)|Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18108215|title= Sinn Fein reshuffle as Martina Anderson takes on MEP role|work= BBC News |accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> Anderson retained her MEP seat in the 2014 election, topping the poll with 159,813 first-preference votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2014E&cons=192 |title=2014 European Election, Northern Ireland First Preference Votes |publisher=ElectionsIreland.org |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref>

In 1989, Anderson married fellow prisoner and IRA member Paul Kavanagh at [[Full Sutton (HM Prison)|Full Sutton Prison]]. By 1993, she was one of just two female [[category A prisoners]] in England, the other being fellow republican [[Ella O'Dwyer]].<ref>Sharrock, David, \"Fear and folly in She-Wing\" ''[[The Guardian]]''; 29 December 1993</ref> While at [[Durham (HM Prison)|Durham Prison]], Anderson obtained a [[first-class honours]] degree in [[social science]] from the [[Open University]].<ref name=\"fore\"/> In 1994, she was transferred from Durham to [[Maghaberry (HM Prison)|Maghaberry Prison]] in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"fore\"/> On 10 November 1998, Anderson was released under the terms of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].<ref name=\"times\"/>

== Political career==
In 2007, Anderson was elected to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] as a Sinn Féin member for [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle]], along with [[Raymond McCartney]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Northern Ireland election | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/nielection/html/258.stm | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 9 March 2007 | accessdate = 21 March 2007}}</ref>

In May 2007, Anderson became one of the first Sinn Féin members to join the [[Northern Ireland Policing Board]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Policing Board – Martina Anderson MLA |url=http://www.nipolicingboard.org.uk/index/theboard/member.htm?id=6838 |publisher=NI Policing Board |date=31 May 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917044430/http://www.nipolicingboard.org.uk/index/theboard/member.htm?id=6838 |archivedate=17 September 2008 }}</ref>

In December 2007, Anderson said she was concerned that large numbers of [[migrant worker]]s from mainly Catholic countries were being classed as 'Catholic/nationalist' in monitoring forms, rather than 'other'.<ref name=\"newsletter.co.uk\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/Sinn-Fein-and-DUP-in.3602650.jp |title=Sinn Fein and DUP in job figures row - Belfast Newsletter |publisher=Newsletter.co.uk |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref> She said \"Given that the entire basis of the legislation around monitoring was put in place to identify imbalances in the workforce between the local Catholic/nationalist and Protestant/unionist communities it is therefore vital that given the addition of migrant workers in the workforce, that they should clearly be categorised as having a community background of 'other'.\"<ref name=\"newsletter.co.uk\"/>
Employment monitoring by the [[Equality Commission for Northern Ireland|Equality Commission]] records solely religion, and not political affiliation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalityni.org/sections/default.asp?cms=news_Press+Releases&cmsid=1_9&id=90&secid=1_1 |title=ECNI - Equality Commission, Northern Ireland |publisher=Equalityni.org |date=2015-08-30 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>

She was selected by Sinn Féin to fight the [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle]] constituency at the 2010 Westminster General Election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.derryjournal.com/politics/Anderson-ready-to--fight.3734291.jp |title=Anderson ready to fight next election |newspaper=Derry Journal |date=2008-01-31 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref> She lost to the SDLP incumbent, [[Mark Durkan]], by 5,000 votes (11% of the vote). In May 2012 it was announced that she would be replacing [[Bairbre de Brún]], as MEP for [[Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)|Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18108215|title= Sinn Fein reshuffle as Martina Anderson takes on MEP role|work= BBC News |accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> Anderson retained her MEP seat in the 2014 election, topping the poll with 159,813 first-preference votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2014E&cons=192 |title=2014 European Election, Northern Ireland First Preference Votes |publisher=ElectionsIreland.org |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref>

In the [[2019 European Parliament election]]s, Anderson was returned on the fifth ballot, after [[Diane Dodds|Dianne Dodds]] of the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] and [[Naomi Long]] of [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance]].

[[File:Edward Doheny Testifying 2 crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Oil businessman [[Edward L. Doheny]] (at table, second from right) testifying before the Senate committee investigating the Teapot Dome oil leases, 1924]]

The '''Teapot Dome scandal''' was a [[bribery]] scandal involving the administration of United States President [[Warren G. Harding]] from 1921 to 1923. [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Albert Bacon Fall]] had leased [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[petroleum]] reserves at [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome]] in [[Wyoming]], and two locations in [[California]], to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding. The leases were the subject of a seminal investigation by Senator [[Thomas J. Walsh]]. Convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies, Fall became the first [[Cabinet of the United States|presidential cabinet]] member to go to prison; no one was convicted of paying the bribes.

Before the [[Watergate scandal]], Teapot Dome was regarded as the \"greatest and most sensational [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|scandal in the history of American politics]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |title=Graft and Oil: How Teapot Dome Became the Greatest Political Scandal of its Time |last=Cherny |first=Robert W |work=History Now |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]] |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709015531/http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |archivedate=July 9, 2010 }}</ref> It damaged the reputation of the Harding administration, which was already severely diminished by its controversial handling of the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1922]] and Harding's veto of the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act|Bonus Bill]] in 1922.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant-Eisenhower/Warren-G-Harding-Domestic-and-foreign-affairs.html | title = Grant-Eisenhower | contribution = Warren G Harding: Domestic & foreign affairs | publisher = President profiles}}.</ref> Congress subsequently passed legislation, enduring to this day, giving subpoena power to the House and Senate for review of tax records of any US citizen without regard to elected or appointed position, nor subject to White House interference.<ref name=Paletta9April>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-treasury-lawyers-discussed-trumps-tax-returns-before-democrats-request-mnuchin-says/2019/04/09/9693618e-5ad2-11e9-842d-7d3ed7eb3957_story.html |title=Mnuchin reveals White House lawyers consulted Treasury on Trump tax returns, despite law meant to limit political involvement |work=The Washington Post|date=9 April 2019|accessdate=9 April 2019|first=Damian|last=Paletta}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Teapot Rock postcard crop.jpg|thumb|Teapot Dome around the time of the scandal, featuring Teapot Rock (from postcard c. 1922)]]

In the early 20th century, the U.S. Navy largely converted from [[coal]] to [[fuel oil]]. To ensure that the Navy would always have enough fuel available, several oil-producing areas were designated as naval oil reserves by [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]]. In 1921, President Harding issued an [[executive order]] that transferred control of [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome Oil Field]] in [[Natrona County, Wyoming]], and the [[Elk Hills Oil Field|Elk Hills]] and [[Buena Vista Oil Field]]s in [[Kern County, California]], from the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. This was not implemented until 1922, when Interior Secretary Fall persuaded [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin C. Denby]] to transfer control.

Later in 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall leased the oil production rights at Teapot Dome to [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry F. Sinclair]] of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]]. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to [[Edward L. Doheny]] of [[Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company]]. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding. This manner of leasing was legal under the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ut/vernal_fo/lands___minerals.Par.6287.File.dat/MineralLeasingAct1920.pdf | title= Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 as Amended (re-transcribed 2007-08-07) | publisher= Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior | accessdate=2014-09-08 }}</ref>

The lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, which secretly made Fall a rich man. Fall had received a no-interest loan from Doheny of $100,000, <ref>{{cite web |date=November 23, 1926 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1926/11/25/archives/fall-and-doheny-fight-to-bar-senate-records-on-100000-cash-loan.html |title=FALL AND DOHENY FIGHT TO BAR SENATE RECORDS ON $100,000 CASH LOAN; VITAL POINT IS RAISED : Defense Halts Move to Bare Admissions Made by Doheny.

He received other gifts from Doheny and Sinclair totaling about $404,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|404000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn|US}}). This money changing hands was illegal, not the leases. Fall attempted to keep his actions secret, but the sudden improvement in his standard of living was suspect.

==Investigation and outcome==
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}
In April 1922, a Wyoming oil operator wrote to his Senator, [[John B. Kendrick]], angered that Sinclair had been given a contract to the lands in a secret deal. Kendrick did not respond, but two days later on April 15, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the deal.<ref>{{cite book | author = Davis, Margaret L | title= Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L.

La Follette Sr.]] of [[Wisconsin]] led an investigation by the Senate Committee on Public Lands. At first, La Follette believed Fall was innocent.

[[File:Albert B. Fall with map background.jpg|thumb|[[Albert B. Fall]] was the first U.S. cabinet official sentenced to prison.]]

Democrat [[Thomas J. Walsh]] of [[Montana]], the most junior minority member, led a lengthy inquiry.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=US Senate |title=Thomas J. Walsh: A Featured Biography |url=https://www.senate.gov/senators/FeaturedBios/Featured_Bio_Walsh.htm}}</ref> For two years, Walsh pushed forward while Fall stepped backward, covering his tracks as he went. No evidence of wrongdoing was initially uncovered, as the leases were legal enough, but records kept disappearing mysteriously. Fall had made the leases appear legitimate, but his acceptance of the money was his undoing. By 1924, the remaining unanswered question was how Fall had become so rich so quickly and easily.

Money from the bribes had gone to Fall's cattle ranch and investments in his business. Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had failed to cover up: Doheny's $100,000 loan to Fall. This discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained.

==Comparison==

The Teapot Dome scandal has historically been regarded as the worst such scandal in the United States – the \"[[high water mark]]\" of cabinet corruption. It is often used as a benchmark for comparison with subsequent scandals. In particular it has been compared to the [[Watergate scandal]], in which a cabinet member, Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], went to prison, the second time in American history that a member of cabinet has been incarcerated.<ref>{{cite book|title=Watergate & the Teapot Dome Scandal: The History and Legacy of America's Most Notorious Government Scandals|date=November 2, 2016|publisher=Charles River Editors |edition=Kindle |asin=B01N9IMB2P}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Uncovering a Coverup on Teapot Dome|last=Roberts|first=Chalmers M.|date=June 9, 1977|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

The '''Teapot Dome scandal''' was a [[bribery]] scandal involving the administration of United States President [[Warren G. Harding]] from 1921 to 1923. [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Albert Bacon Fall]] had leased [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[petroleum]] reserves at [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome]] in [[Wyoming]], and two locations in [[California]], to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding. The leases were the subject of a seminal investigation by Senator [[Thomas J. Walsh]]. Convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies, Fall became the first [[Cabinet of the United States|presidential cabinet]] member to go to prison; no one was convicted of paying the bribes.

Before the [[Watergate scandal]], Teapot Dome was regarded as the \"greatest and most sensational [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|scandal in the history of American politics]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |title=Graft and Oil: How Teapot Dome Became the Greatest Political Scandal of its Time |last=Cherny |first=Robert W |work=History Now |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]] |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709015531/http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |archivedate=July 9, 2010 }}</ref> It damaged the reputation of the Harding administration, which was already severely diminished by its controversial handling of the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1922]] and Harding's veto of the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act|Bonus Bill]] in 1922.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant-Eisenhower/Warren-G-Harding-Domestic-and-foreign-affairs.html | title = Grant-Eisenhower | contribution = Warren G Harding: Domestic & foreign affairs | publisher = President profiles}}.</ref> Congress subsequently passed legislation, enduring to this day, giving subpoena power to the House and Senate for review of tax records of any US citizen without regard to elected or appointed position, nor subject to White House interference.<ref name=Paletta9April>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-treasury-lawyers-discussed-trumps-tax-returns-before-democrats-request-mnuchin-says/2019/04/09/9693618e-5ad2-11e9-842d-7d3ed7eb3957_story.html |title=Mnuchin reveals White House lawyers consulted Treasury on Trump tax returns, despite law meant to limit political involvement |work=The Washington Post|date=9 April 2019|accessdate=9 April 2019|first=Damian|last=Paletta}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Teapot Rock postcard crop.jpg|thumb|Teapot Dome around the time of the scandal, featuring Teapot Rock (from postcard c. 1922)]]

In the early 20th century, the U.S. Navy largely converted from [[coal]] to [[fuel oil]]. To ensure that the Navy would always have enough fuel available, several oil-producing areas were designated as naval oil reserves by [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]]. In 1921, President Harding issued an [[executive order]] that transferred control of [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome Oil Field]] in [[Natrona County, Wyoming]], and the [[Elk Hills Oil Field|Elk Hills]] and [[Buena Vista Oil Field]]s in [[Kern County, California]], from the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. This was not implemented until 1922, when Interior Secretary Fall persuaded [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin C. Denby]] to transfer control.

Later in 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall leased the oil production rights at Teapot Dome to [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry F. Sinclair]] of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]]. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to [[Edward L. Doheny]] of [[Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company]]. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding. This manner of leasing was legal under the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ut/vernal_fo/lands___minerals.Par.6287.File.dat/MineralLeasingAct1920.pdf | title= Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 as Amended (re-transcribed 2007-08-07) | publisher= Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior | accessdate=2014-09-08 }}</ref>

The lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, which secretly made Fall a rich man. Fall had received a no-interest loan from Doheny of $100,000, <ref>{{cite web |date=November 23, 1926 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1926/11/25/archives/fall-and-doheny-fight-to-bar-senate-records-on-100000-cash-loan.html |title=FALL AND DOHENY FIGHT TO BAR SENATE RECORDS ON $100,000 CASH LOAN; VITAL POINT IS RAISED : Defense Halts Move to Bare Admissions Made by Doheny.

He received other gifts from Doheny and Sinclair totaling about $404,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|404000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn|US}}). This money changing hands was illegal, not the leases. Fall attempted to keep his actions secret, but the sudden improvement in his standard of living was suspect.

==Investigation and outcome==
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}
In April 1922, a Wyoming oil operator wrote to his Senator, [[John B. Kendrick]], angered that Sinclair had been given a contract to the lands in a secret deal. Kendrick did not respond, but two days later on April 15, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the deal.<ref>{{cite book | author = Davis, Margaret L | title= Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L.

[[File:Albert B. Fall with map background.jpg|thumb|[[Albert B. Fall]] was the first U.S. cabinet official sentenced to prison.]]

Democrat [[Thomas J. Walsh]] of [[Montana]], the most junior minority member, led a lengthy inquiry.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=US Senate |title=Thomas J. Walsh: A Featured Biography |url=https://www.senate.gov/senators/FeaturedBios/Featured_Bio_Walsh.htm}}</ref> For two years, Walsh pushed forward while Fall stepped backward, covering his tracks as he went. No evidence of wrongdoing was initially uncovered, as the leases were legal enough, but records kept disappearing mysteriously. Fall had made the leases appear legitimate, but his acceptance of the money was his undoing. By 1924, the remaining unanswered question was how Fall had become so rich so quickly and easily.

Money from the bribes had gone to Fall's cattle ranch and investments in his business. Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had failed to cover up: Doheny's $100,000 loan to Fall. This discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained. The Court invalidated the Elk Hills lease in February 1927, and the Teapot Dome lease in October. Both reserves were returned to the Navy.<ref name=revenues/>

The '''2005 Kashmir earthquake''' occurred at {{tooltip|08:50:39 Pakistan Standard Time|03:50:39 GMT}} on 8 October in Pakistan occupied [[POK]]. It was [[epicenter|centered]] near the city of [[Muzaffarabad]], and also affected Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province and Indian-administered [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. It registered a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.6 and had a maximum [[Modified Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of VIII (''Severe''). The earthquake also affected countries in the surrounding region where tremors were felt in [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[China|Chinese]] [[Xinjiang]]. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. It is considered the [[Lists_of_earthquakes#Deadliest_earthquakes|deadliest earthquake]] to hit [[South Asia]] since the [[1935 Quetta earthquake]].<ref name=\"Dawn_Quetta_2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/10/25/fea.htm|title=The great Quetta tragedy|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN Newspaper]]|date=25 October 2008}}</ref>

==Earthquake==
Kashmir lies in the area of collision of the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[India Plate|Indian tectonic plates]]. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable [[seismicity]] in the region. The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the [[moment magnitude scale]], with its epicentre about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad.

===Damage===
[[File:earthquake Information for Pakistan.png|thumb|left|Map depicting regional tectonic plates]]

Most of the devastation hit north Pakistan and [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]]. In Kashmir, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad.  Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.

The Pakistani government's official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could reach over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.

As Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck.  Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. Many people were also trapped in their homes and, because it was the month of [[Ramadan]], most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.

According to Pakistan's Interior Minister [[Aftab Ahmad Sherpao]], Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz \"made the appeal to survivors\" on 26 October to come down to valleys and cities for relief,<ref name=bloomberg>{{citation|title=Pakistan Asks Quake Survivors to Leave Mountains Before Winter|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aH5Z2m5aPhRw|first=Khalid|last=Qayum|date=26 October 2005|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]}}</ref> because bad weather, mountainous terrain, landslides and blocked roads are making it difficult for relief workers to reach each house and the winter snows are imminent.\"

In Islamabad, the Margalla Towers, an apartment complex in [[F-10, Islamabad|sector F-10]], collapsed and killed many of the residents. Four deaths were reported in [[Afghanistan]], including a young girl who died in [[Jalalabad]], after a wall collapsed on her. The quake was felt in [[Kabul]], but the effects were minimal there.

===Aftershocks===
There were many secondary earthquakes in the region, mainly to the northwest of the original epicentre. A series of strong aftershocks occurred near [[Muzaffarabad]].<ref>[http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/pak-in-panic-as-quake-rocks-kashmir/153050 \"Pak in panic as quake rocks Kashmir\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208171252/http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/pak-in-panic-as-quake-rocks-kashmir/153050 |date=8 December 2015 }} Reuters, ''The Financial Express'', 19 October 2005.

==Response==
{{Main|International response to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake}}
[[File:pakistan aid.jpg|thumb|Pakistani soldiers carry tents away from a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter]]

The national and international humanitarian response to the crisis was extensive. In the initial phases of response, the Pakistan Medical corps, Corps of Engineers, Army aviation and a large number of infantry units played important roles. Lt. Gen Afzal, Maj. Gen. Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj. Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co-ordination. The relief work in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and [[Jaipal Singh]]. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international [[NGO]]s with high pay scales. The rest of the money pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called [[Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority]], which was made by then military regime to accommodate retired high military officials and while keeping the command of the reconstruction and rehabilitation authority directly under the military. The basic infrastructure, including tertiary care, health, education, road networks, water supply, waste management and other basic needs, was still underdeveloped and had not reached pre-earthquake status in the region.

The '''2005 Kashmir earthquake''' occurred at {{tooltip|08:50:39 Pakistan Standard Time|03:50:39 GMT}} on 8 October in Pakistan-administered [[Azad Kashmir]]. It was [[epicenter|centered]] near the city of [[Muzaffarabad]], and also affected Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province and Indian-administered [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. It registered a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.6 and had a maximum [[Modified Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of VIII (''Severe''). The earthquake also affected countries in the surrounding region where tremors were felt in [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[China|Chinese]] [[Xinjiang]]. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. It is considered the [[Lists_of_earthquakes#Deadliest_earthquakes|deadliest earthquake]] to hit [[South Asia]] since the [[1935 Quetta earthquake]].<ref name=\"Dawn_Quetta_2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/10/25/fea.htm|title=The great Quetta tragedy|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN Newspaper]]|date=25 October 2008}}</ref>

==Earthquake==
Kashmir lies in the area of collision of the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[India Plate|Indian tectonic plates]]. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable [[seismicity]] in the region. The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the [[moment magnitude scale]], with its epicentre about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad.

===Damage===
[[File:earthquake Information for Pakistan.png|thumb|left|Map depicting regional tectonic plates]]

Most of the devastation hit north Pakistan and [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]]. In Kashmir, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad.  Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.

The Pakistani government's official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could reach over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.

As Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck.  Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. Many people were also trapped in their homes and, because it was the month of [[Ramadan]], most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.

'''Crook''' is a historic [[market town]] in [[County Durham]], in the North East of England.

Located a couple of miles north of the [[River Wear]], Crook lies about 9 miles (14.5&nbsp;km) south-west of the historic city of [[Durham, England|Durham]], 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) north-west of [[Bishop Auckland]] and 2 miles (3.5&nbsp;km) from [[Willington, County Durham|Willington]]. The A690 road from Durham turns into the A689 leading up through [[Wolsingham]] and [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] into the upper reaches of [[Weardale]] (an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]). Located on the edge of [[Weardale]], Crook is consequently sometimes referred to as the \"Gateway to Weardale\".

The centre of Crook, a designated conservation area, features a variety of shops and businesses with the market held on Tuesdays and Saturdays. There are two prominent churches, the centrally located St Catherine's CE and Our Lady Immaculate & St Cuthbert's RC on Church Hill. On top of the hills to the east sits Crook Golf Club. For a town of its size Crook also features a good selection of pubs, cafes and restaurants.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}

Crook is the 10th largest settlement in County Durham and the 35th largest in the [[North East of England]] as of 2016.

==History==
Crook first appeared as an agricultural village around 1795 although its surrounding districts – Billy Row, Stanley, White Lea, Roddymoor and Helmington Row – were established much earlier.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\">[http://www.dur.ac.uk/4schools/Localhistory/history.htm  The development of Crook: some background history<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112031124/http://www.dur.ac.uk/4schools/Localhistory/history.htm |date=12 January 2008 }}</ref> In these days Crook was predominantly farmland; however, it also had an Inn and a blacksmith shop, consequently the primary field of employment was within the agricultural industry. 40 years later; Crook became a mining village, and thrived as the coal was very close to the surface<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/> and soon there were over 20 mines around the Crook area, and by the end of the nineteenth century the town had developed rapidly in population and economy. However a lot of the population in the area had declined in the following century as the coal mines and industries closed with over 34% of the population being unemployed.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/>

Crook's football team, [[Crook Town F.C.]], have won the [[FA Amateur Cup]] five times, most recently beating [[Enfield F.C.]] in 1964, before the cup was abolished in 1974. This record is second only to Crook's near neighbours, [[Bishop Auckland F.C.]]. The club have also reached the third round of the [[FA Cup]] and formed a key role in the development of [[FC Barcelona]], playing a number of friendly matches in the 1910s and 1920s.

The town is also home to oldest purpose built Cinema in the North, built as the Electric Palace and opened on 21 November 1910. Currently the building is a Car Parts and Accessories shop but a group was set up in 2015 with the intention of restoring the building back to a working cinema. Much of the original interior features remain inside.

In 2014, [[Lidl]] announced they were to open a new store in Crook, on the site of the former [[Co-op Food]] store on New Road, the store opened in June 2017. In September 2016, [[Aldi]] announced plans to open a new store in the town on Elliott street, which was to create 30 new jobs. The store opened in October 2019.

Crook has a backdrop of traditional and modern buildings. The tallest building in the town is the Council Building. It has 5 floors and at about 100&nbsp;ft, it is a prominent feature of the Crook skyline. However, the council building is dwarfed by Crook's surrounding hills, which completely surround the town except on the south side. The tallest stands at 300 metres above the town, about 980&nbsp;ft. The highest point in the town is on West Road where the height is 210 metres (about 690&nbsp;ft).

Approximately 2 miles to the west of Crook on the A689 towards Wolsingham and Weardale, 400 yards past the roundabout junction with the A68, is the surviving [[World War II]] [[Harperley POW Camp 93]], a ''Scheduled Ancient Monument'' within [[English Heritage]].

== Culture ==

Crook hosts various annual events including Crook Carnival, Crook Community Christmas Event and the Crookfest music festival.

Crook Carnival is held in early July and features a parade, rides, stalls and live music. Crook Community Christmas Event held at the end of November also features a parade and the switching on of the town's Christmas lights.

Crookfest is an all day music festival held on the Sunday of the early May Bank Holiday weekend within Crook AFC's Sir Tom Cowie Millfield ground. It is organised by Marshall Rippon on behalf of the football club and features around 20 bands over 3 stages with marquees erected on the pitch.

Malcolm Dixon (born 1953) is an actor best known as Strutter in the 1981 movie Time Bandits. He has had many roles that take advantage of his 4'1\" size, such as Ewoks and dwarfs. Before becoming an actor, Dixon worked in Jim Henson's Creature Shop.[citation needed]

'''Pterobranchia''' is a [[clade]] of small worm-shaped animals. They belong to the [[Hemichordata]], and live in [[secretion|secreted]] tubes on the [[ocean floor]].

==Biology==
Pterobranchs are small worm-like filter-feeders, living on the ocean floor, often in relatively deep waters. Like their relatives, the [[acorn worm]]s, their body is divided into three parts: an anterior [[proboscis]], a collar, and a trunk. The proboscis is wide and flattened at the tip, and in most species contains glands that secrete a tube of organic material in which the pterobranch spends its adult life. The animals are mostly colonial, with several [[zooid]]s living together in a cluster of tubes. In some species, the individual zooids within the colony are connected by [[stolon]]s. The single member in the genus ''[[Atubaria]]'' is unusual in lacking the tubes typical of other pterobranchs,<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1026–1027|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}</ref> but is regarded as a questionable species and is no longer considered valid.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=5049775 | pmid=27701429 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0162564 | volume=11 | title=The Global Diversity of Hemichordata | year=2016 | journal=PLoS One | page=e0162564 | last1 = Tassia | first1 = MG | last2 = Cannon | first2 = JT | last3 = Konikoff | first3 = CE | last4 = Shenkar | first4 = N | last5 = Halanych | first5 = KM | last6 = Swalla | first6 = BJ}}</ref>

The collar bears a number of large arms, each of which includes a row of tentacles along one side. The number of arms varies between species, with anything from one to nine pairs. The tentacles are covered in cilia and aid in filtering food from the water. The trunk includes a simple tubular gut, and is curved over so that the [[anus]] projects upwards, lying dorsal to the collar. ''Cephalodiscus'' and ''Atubaria'' have a single pair of gill slits in the [[pharynx]], although ''Rhabdopleura'' has none.<ref name=IZ/>

==Biology==
Pterobranchs are small worm-like filter-feeders, living on the ocean floor, often in relatively deep waters. Like their relatives, the [[acorn worm]]s, their body is divided into three parts: an anterior [[proboscis]], a collar, and a trunk. The proboscis is wide and flattened at the tip, and in most species contains glands that secrete a tube of organic material in which the pterobranch spends its adult life. The animals are mostly colonial, with several [[zooid]]s living together in a cluster of tubes. In some species, the individual zooids within the colony are connected by [[stolon]]s. The single member in the genus ''[[Atubaria]]'' is unusual in lacking the tubes typical of other pterobranchs,<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1026–1027|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}</ref> but is regarded as a questionable species and is no longer considered valid.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=5049775 | pmid=27701429 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0162564 | volume=11 | title=The Global Diversity of Hemichordata | year=2016 | journal=PLoS One | page=e0162564 | last1 = Tassia | first1 = MG | last2 = Cannon | first2 = JT | last3 = Konikoff | first3 = CE | last4 = Shenkar | first4 = N | last5 = Halanych | first5 = KM | last6 = Swalla | first6 = BJ}}</ref>

The collar bears a number of large arms, each of which includes a row of tentacles along one side. The number of arms varies between species, with anything from one to nine pairs. The tentacles are covered in cilia and aid in filtering food from the water. The trunk includes a simple tubular gut, and is curved over so that the [[anus]] projects upwards, lying dorsal to the collar. ''Cephalodiscus'' and ''Atubaria'' have a single pair of gill slits in the [[pharynx]], although ''Rhabdopleura'' has none.<ref name=IZ/>

''Dynasty Warriors 9'' is a [[hack and slash]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] with [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements. The game revamps the gameplay of the series with the introduction of the [[open world]] environment. A traversable map of China is implemented which the player can [[nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] on foot, horseback or boat, the game focuses on livable environments such as cities and towns as well as places where large battles take place. The characters' move-set combinations is also revised.<ref name=\"FamInt\">{{cite web | title=『真・三國無双8』発表＆『無双☆スターズ』に新キャラ“周倉”参戦を開発陣に直撃！(1/3) | work=[[Famitsu]] | date=December 17, 2016 | accessdate=December 18, 2016 | url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201612/17123164.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Gematsu\" />

The player can invade and infiltrate enemy fortifications with the utilization of a grappling hook. A day-night cycle and dynamic weather system is also featured in the game. Time and weather now change in real time, and enemy vision is affected at night-time or when it is raining. The map will advance in time when main story missions are completed, but are described as having a \"high degree of difficulty\" which can be lowered by completing associated side missions.<ref name=\"Gematsu2\" />

The player can customize and decorate hideouts with furniture bought from merchants.

=== Gameplay mechanics ===
The gameplay mechanics of ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' is radically overhauled from its predecessors.  Flow Attacks take the place of Normal Attacks from previous games, and in place of Charge Attacks are Trigger Attacks, which are performed by pressing the right trigger button and any face button.  Trigger attacks allows the player to stun an opponent, knock down an opponent, or send them airborne; each player also has a unique fourth reactive attack, known as a Special Attack, that has a longer cooldown before they may be used. Trigger Attacks may be followed up by a Flow Attack combo, which can, in turn, combo into another Trigger Attack.  Additionally, the player have access to a Reactive Attack, used whenever the player presses the right button when prompted to do so; this attack allows the player to charge into enemies, counter enemy attacks, or finish off weakened enemies. Musou Attacks return from previous games, and their mechanics are identical to ''Dynasty Warriors'' series games prior to ''Dynasty Warriors 6''. The player also have access to an airborne Musou Attack, which depletes only a small portion of the Musou gauge. New to ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' is the Stamina Gauge, a gauge that gradually replenishes until full. The stamina gauge is depleted upon double jumping, wall jumping, or in other selectable circumstances.

Characters will automatically draw their weapons when close to an enemy, or put away their weapons when they are no longer near them; however, the player may manually draw or withdraw their weapon by pressing on the left analog stick. Some actions, such as initiating conversations in towns and villages, may only be done when their weapons are not drawn. When a character does not have their weapon drawn, the player may also crouch and sneak behind groups of enemies.

All characters also have access to a bow, which they may access by pressing down on the directional pad. The player may acquire different types of ammunition over the course of the game, which may be selected by pressing left and right on the directional pad and fired by pressing the flow attack button.  These come into play when sneaking into enemies, hunting wildlife, or initiating specialized attacks.

Horses return from previous games; the player may buy horses and ride them to level up their attributes.  While on a horse, the player may have the horse automatically take them to the next recommended destination by pressing the left trigger button, or make their horse sprint by pressing the right shoulder button. Like characters, horses have their own stamina gauge, which depletes when sprinting but replenishes when they are not.

All 83 characters from ''[[Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires]]'' returned. New characters also were introduced, one of whom made his first appearance in the spin-off ''[[Warriors All-Stars]]''.<ref name=\"FamInt\" /><ref name=\"Gematsu\" /> Other than playable characters, there are four [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) who have unique designs but wield generic weapons common to other NPCs.<ref>{{cite web | author=Sato | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/01/26/dynasty-warriors-9-details-unique-npcs-xiahou-ji-dong-bai-hua-xiong-yuan-shu/ | title=Dynasty Warriors 9 Details Its Unique NPCs Xiahou Ji, Dong Bai, Hua Xiong, And Yuan Shu | work=[[Siliconera]] | date=January 26, 2018 | accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref>

=== Story mode ===
Story Mode in ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' retells the story of ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' in a series of 13 chapters, from the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] to the [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|fall of Shu]] in the final chapter. Each playable character has a story set within a subset of these chapters, corresponding roughly to the time in history where they were historically relevant; no character has a story that spans the full 13 chapters, and some characters will have longer stories than others. Each character has their own individual ending, roughly corresponding to their historical death or the point in which they were no longer historically relevant.

At the start of the game, the player may only select the patriarchs of the three kingdoms: [[Liu Bei]], [[Cao Cao]], and [[Sun Jian]]; additional characters are unlocked for the most part by completing the first chapter a character is playable in with a different character. The progression of each character in their own story is kept separately, allowing the player to switch between different characters at any time. All characters share a common pool of acquired weapons, items, and map knowledge, but must be leveled separately.

=== Free Mode ===
Free Mode in ''Dynasty Warriors 9'', unlocked once the story of any character is complete, allows the player to play as any character in any chapter that has been previously completed by any character, without regard to historical context. The player may only have either a Story Mode save or a Free Mode save for a particular character; if a character has a Free Mode save, they must replay their Story Mode from the beginning if a new Story Mode game is started with that character.

In an interview with ''[[Famitsu]]'' in May 2016, Omega Force brand manager [[Kenichi Ogasawara]] commented that \"the evolution from ''[[Dynasty Warriors 7]]'' to ''[[Dynasty Warriors 8|8]]'' was insufficient\", and hoped that the announcement of their next game in the series would \"have a great impact\".<ref>{{cite web | last=Ramsey | first=Robert | title=Dynasty Warriors 9 Announcement will 'Have a Greater Impact than You Can Imagine' | work=[[Push Square]] | date=May 18, 2016 | accessdate=December 18, 2016 | url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2016/05/dynasty_warriors_9_announcement_will_have_a_greater_impact_than_you_can_imagine}}</ref>

The game was revealed later in the year in December during a \"Greatest Games Lineup in History\" broadcast, with Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Asia (SCEJA) president Atsushi Morita introducing the title; Koei Tecmo's western branches followed and announced the game alongside Japan. For the first time in the series, ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' featured an [[open world]] environment, allowing players to enter and exit towns and freely explore the map of mainland China with considerable differences in elevation. A ''Famitsu'' interview with Koei Tecmo's Masaki Furusawa and Akihiro Suzuki revealed that all 83 characters that appeared in ''Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires'' would appear in the game.

In September 2017, Koei Tecmo declared that the game was scheduled to be released in early 2018.

'''''Keith Broke His Leg''''' is an American [[comedy]] [[web series]] created by [[Keith Powell]].  It premiered its first six episodes on August 25, 2015 through its official website, and released subsequent episodes intermittently through September 2016.<ref name=\"tvinsider.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/35426/30-rocks-toofer-breaks-out-watch-first-episodes-of-keith-powells-new-series-exclusive/|title=30 Rock‘s Toofer Breaks Out: Watch First Episodes of Keith Powell’s New Series (Exclusive) – TV Insider|work=TV Insider}}</ref> Set in Powell's home, and inspired by his real life, the show follows Keith through a series of visits with his friends and family while he recuperates from an unknown accident that left his right leg broken. Most guest actors who appear in the show play a parody version of themselves, including [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Fiona Gubelmann]], [[Malcolm Barrett (actor)|Malcolm Barrett]], [[Leonard Robinson]], and [[Alexandra Krosney]].  Powell writes, directs, and produces all episodes in addition to starring.

Upon its release, the show received much publicity due to Powell blogging for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', which highlighted each episode of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-powell/|title=Keith Powell|publisher=}}</ref>  The blogs discussed race, politics, relationships, friendship, marriage, and other current events as it relates to specific moments in the web series.  Particularly, his blog post highlighting the \"You Talk White\" phenomenon (promoting the episode \"Baller\") received widespread attention on ''[[NPR]]'', ''[[HuffPost Live]]'', and various international news blogs.<ref>http://feeds.feedburner.com/ttbook</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-powell/you-talk-white-being-blac_b_8284582.html|title='You Talk White:' Being Black and Articulate|date=13 October 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref><ref>http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/30-rock-twofer-keith-powell-broke-his-leg/564268cb99ec6d499100015c</ref><ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/black-30-rock-actor-claims-police-said-he-was-privileged-to-live-in-a-nice-neighbourhood-a6746516.html</ref>

== Series overview ==
The series is a semi-autobiographical comedy about ''[[30 Rock]]'' star Keith Powell's self-discovery when he is suddenly stripped of his ability to be mobile. After an accident, Keith is forced to see the world in a new way when his wife, his friends, and especially his agent don't make life easy for the incapacitated. What results is a series of visits with the floura and fauna of the Hollywood comedy world, with most of the actors playing parodies of themselves. The style of the show is slower-paced and more observational than traditional comedies, with elements of drama, surrealism, and philosophy throughout. Powell has described the show as contemplative with \"earned\" jokes.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/blog/post/behind-the-video-keith-powell-on-truth-race-and-ea|title=Behind the video: Keith Powell on truth, race & earned jokes|work=Vimeo}}</ref>

== Production ==
Powell self-funded the first season, citing the personal nature of the project and his reluctance to initially crowdfund.  He wrote an article on [[IndieWire]] detailing his process.<ref name=\"keithpowell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/30-rock-star-keith-powell-secret-to-making-a-great-web-series-on-a-tiny-budget-20150918|title='30 Rock' Star Keith Powell's Secret to Making a Great Se – Indiewire|author=Keith Powell|date=18 September 2015|work=Indiewire}}</ref>

The series is filmed on location in [[Los Angeles, California]] in Powell's real life home.  Additionally, the home was featured on [[HGTV]]'s \"[[House Hunters]] Renovation\" and \"House Hunters Where Are They Now?\"

The color palette of the show is highly saturated, highlighting the colors blue and red.  Powell has stated that the entire production time took longer than usual due to the low budget of the series.  In addition, Powell employed the use of drone cameras to take the place of cranes and dollies, and the series was shot exclusively on DSLR cameras.<ref name=\"keithpowell\"/>

The theme song is composed by [[30 Rock]] co-composer Giancarlo Vulcano, inspired by the Motown sound of the 1960s.  Vulcano also collaborated with Powell for the score of ''[[My Name Is David]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giancarlovulcano.com/|title=GIANCARLOVULCANO.COM|publisher=}}</ref>

== Reception ==
After the release of the first six episodes, [[Tubefilter]] called the series a \"sleek, well shot, reasonably funny web series\" and concluded \"it's a nice way to spend an hour.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2015/08/25/keith-powell-broke-his-leg-web-series/|title=Keith Powell Of ‘30 Rock’ Breaks A Leg In New Web Series|work=Tubefilter}}</ref>  [[TV Insider]] stated \"For seven seasons, Keith Powell was 30 Rock’s uptight and under-appreciated “Toofer” Spurlock, but now, the man who battled Frank Rossitano for the right to wear Harvard gear and battled Tracy Jordan over a certain word is stepping, with the help of crutches, into his own spotlight.\"<ref name=\"tvinsider.com\"/>  Review & Roast pointed out that Powell and Knox \"played well off each other and it was obvious they had real chemistry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewandroast.com/keith-broke-his-leg/review/|title=Review – Review and Roast|work=Review and Roast}}</ref> Reviewing the show at the [[Raindance Film Festival]], Vodzilla noted the show's dry pace, stating, \"That mundane approach makes for a relatable series which lacks in laugh-out-loud moments but builds up to them with a restraint and gentle tone that makes them more satisfying... there’s surprising substance here.\" <ref>http://vodzilla.co/reviews/raindance-web-fest-2016-reviews-il-sonnambulo-keith-broke-his-leg-match-not-found-almost-asian/</ref>

'''''Keith Broke His Leg''''' is an American [[comedy]] [[web series]] created by [[Keith Powell]].  It premiered its first six episodes on August 25, 2015 through its official website, and released subsequent episodes intermittently through September 2016.<ref name=\"tvinsider.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/35426/30-rocks-toofer-breaks-out-watch-first-episodes-of-keith-powells-new-series-exclusive/|title=30 Rock‘s Toofer Breaks Out: Watch First Episodes of Keith Powell’s New Series (Exclusive) – TV Insider|work=TV Insider}}</ref> Set in Powell's home, and inspired by his real life, the show follows Keith through a series of visits with his friends and family while he recuperates from an unknown accident that left his right leg broken.

The style of the show is slower-paced and more observational than traditional comedies, with elements of drama, surrealism, and philosophy throughout. Powell has described the show as contemplative with \"earned\" jokes.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/blog/post/behind-the-video-keith-powell-on-truth-race-and-ea|title=Behind the video: Keith Powell on truth, race & earned jokes|work=Vimeo}}</ref>

== Production ==
Powell self-funded the first season, citing the personal nature of the project and his reluctance to initially crowdfund.  He wrote an article on [[IndieWire]] detailing his process.<ref name=\"keithpowell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/30-rock-star-keith-powell-secret-to-making-a-great-web-series-on-a-tiny-budget-20150918|title='30 Rock' Star Keith Powell's Secret to Making a Great Se – Indiewire|author=Keith Powell|date=18 September 2015|work=Indiewire}}</ref>

The series is filmed on location in [[Los Angeles, California]] in Powell's real life home.  Additionally, the home was featured on [[HGTV]]'s \"[[House Hunters]] Renovation\" and \"House Hunters Where Are They Now?\"

The color palette of the show is highly saturated, highlighting the colors blue and red.  Powell has stated that the entire production time took longer than usual due to the low budget of the series.  In addition, Powell employed the use of drone cameras to take the place of cranes and dollies, and the series was shot exclusively on DSLR cameras.<ref name=\"keithpowell\"/>

The theme song is composed by [[30 Rock]] co-composer Giancarlo Vulcano, inspired by the Motown sound of the 1960s.  Vulcano also collaborated with Powell for the score of ''[[My Name Is David]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giancarlovulcano.com/|title=GIANCARLOVULCANO.COM|publisher=}}</ref>

== Reception ==
After the release of the first six episodes, [[Tubefilter]] called the series a \"sleek, well shot, reasonably funny web series\" and concluded \"it's a nice way to spend an hour.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2015/08/25/keith-powell-broke-his-leg-web-series/|title=Keith Powell Of ‘30 Rock’ Breaks A Leg In New Web Series|work=Tubefilter}}</ref>  [[TV Insider]] stated \"For seven seasons, Keith Powell was 30 Rock’s uptight and under-appreciated “Toofer” Spurlock, but now, the man who battled Frank Rossitano for the right to wear Harvard gear and battled Tracy Jordan over a certain word is stepping, with the help of crutches, into his own spotlight.\"<ref name=\"tvinsider.com\"/>  Review & Roast pointed out that Powell and Knox \"played well off each other and it was obvious they had real chemistry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewandroast.com/keith-broke-his-leg/review/|title=Review – Review and Roast|work=Review and Roast}}</ref> Reviewing the show at the [[Raindance Film Festival]], Vodzilla noted the show's dry pace, stating, \"That mundane approach makes for a relatable series which lacks in laugh-out-loud moments but builds up to them with a restraint and gentle tone that makes them more satisfying... there’s surprising substance here.\" <ref>http://vodzilla.co/reviews/raindance-web-fest-2016-reviews-il-sonnambulo-keith-broke-his-leg-match-not-found-almost-asian/</ref>

===Awards and nominations===
In 2016, Powell won the Best Actor (Comedy) award at the [[New York Television Festival]].<ref>http://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/new-york-television-festival-award-winners-nytvf-1201741579/</ref>

The '''Kannapolis Cannon Ballers''' are a [[Minor League Baseball]] team of the [[South Atlantic League]] and the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]]. They are located in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]] and beginning in 2020, will play their home games at [[Atrium Health Ballpark]].  The team was established in 1995 as the '''Piedmont Phillies'''. From 1996 to 2000, they were known as the '''Piedmont Boll Weevils'''. From 2001 to 2019, they were known as the '''Kannapolis Intimidators''', after [[NASCAR]] driver [[Dale Earnhardt]], who was known as \"The Intimidator\", purchased a share of the team before the 2001 season.

==Team history==

The Intimidators franchise moved to Kannapolis in 1995 from [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], where it had been a [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] affiliate of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] since the franchise's beginning in 1963. Debate raged in the Kannapolis area over what to name the team, with team officials finally deciding to call the team the Piedmont Phillies for the 1995 season.

A name-the-team contest in the fall of 1995 drew thousands of entries, and the team settled on the [[boll weevil]] as the team's new mascot, indicative of Kannapolis' history as a [[textile]] mill town (Kannapolis natives are even called \"lintheads\"). The Piedmont Boll Weevils kept that mascot until after the 2000 season, when [[NASCAR]] racer [[Dale Earnhardt]] purchased a share in the team's ownership. It was then that the name was changed to the Kannapolis Intimidators, in honor of Earnhardt's nickname.<ref name=\"Earnhardt\">{{cite web |publisher=The Earnhardt Connection |url=http://www.daleearnhardt.net/dei/intimidators/index.htm |title=TEC {{!}} Kannapolis Intimidators |website=Daleearnhardt.net |date=November 22, 2000 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref> The team's logo was designed by [[Sam Bass (artist)|Sam Bass]], who has designed paint schemes and uniforms on many NASCAR, IndyCar, and NHRA race cars.<ref name=\"Earnhardt\" /> It was also during that off-season that the team's parent club changed from the Phillies to the [[Chicago White Sox]], making the Intimidators the third White Sox farm team to be located in the Carolinas, following the [[Charlotte Knights]] and the [[Winston-Salem Warthogs]].

Earnhardt, who drove the number 3 car in NASCAR, [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|was killed in an accident]] at the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] in February 2001.<ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Rodman |url=http://www.nascar.com/2001/NEWS/02/18/earnhardt_stewart/index.html |title=Earnhardt dies following Daytona 500 accident – February 21, 2001 |website=NASCAR.com |date=2001-02-21 |accessdate=2012-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010219102746/http://www.nascar.com/2001/NEWS/02/18/earnhardt_stewart/index.html |archivedate=February 19, 2001}}</ref> Following Earnhardt's death, the Intimidators avoided assigning the number 3 for team uniforms. Team manager [[Razor Shines]], originally slated to wear the number, changed his uniform number to 43. The team officially retired number 3 on May 15, 2002, in memory of their former co-owner, similar to the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] retiring the number 26 (the 26th man) in honor of former owner [[Gene Autry]].

From 1995 to 2019, the team played in [[Intimidators Stadium]] (formerly Fieldcrest Cannon and later CMC-NorthEast Stadium) in Kannapolis. \"The Cannon\" was still under construction when the Piedmont Phillies began play in 1995. Upon completion in late 1995, during the winter, the stadium seated 4,700 fans. The stadium changed names on April 3, 2012, under a new naming rights agreement for the 2012 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kannapolis.intimidators.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120403&content_id=27861788&vkey=news_t487&fext=.jsp&sid=t487 |title=Name Game: Welcome to CMC-NorthEast Stadium |publisher=Kannapolis Intimidators |website=[[MiLB.com]] |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> For 2016, the naming rights deal quietly ended, with the name reverting to Intimidators Stadium.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20090114&content_id=41000294&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_t487&sid=t487 |title=Our Ballpark {{!}} Kannapolis Intimidators Content}}</ref>

Current or former [[Major League Baseball]] players to pass through Kannapolis include [[Jimmy Rollins]] and [[Dave Coggin]] of the Philadelphia Phillies, as well as [[Jack Egbert]], [[Gordon Beckham]], [[Chris Getz]], [[Brent Morel]], and [[Clayton Richard]] of the Chicago White Sox. [[Marlon Byrd]], [[Jorge Padilla]], [[Ryan Madson]], and [[Brett Myers]] played for the 2000 Piedmont Boll Weevils.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=df2afdb7 |title=Baseball Reference: 2000 Piedmont Boll Weevils |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref> Also, [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Ricky Williams]] played for the Boll Weevils during the late 1996 and 1997 seasons while he was also playing [[college football]] for the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=2466f7c0 |title=Baseball Reference: 1996 Piedmont Boll Weevils |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref>

On October 30, 2018, ground was broken on a [[Kannapolis Sports and Entertainment Venue|new ballpark]] in downtown Kannapolis as part of a mixed-use redevelopment plan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/10/31/new-kannapolis-ballpark-breaks-ground/ |title=New Kannapolis Ballpark Breaks Ground |last=Speddon |first=Zach |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=October 31, 2018 |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}</ref> The stadium is scheduled to be ready for the team's 2020 season opener on April 16, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kannapolis Ballpark Opener: April 16, 2020 |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/08/22/kannapolis-ballpark-opener-april-16-2020/ |accessdate=August 22, 2019 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=August 22, 2019}}</ref>

With the move, the team announced in February 2019 that it would seek ideas for a new name to be introduced at the same time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independenttribune.com/news/intimidators-launch-name-change-contest/article_d80eed34-2a23-11e9-a43a-f7046eacc62d.html |title=Intimidators launch name change contest |work=[[Independent Tribune]] |date=February 6, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019}}</ref> The new owners cited their inability to widely market the Intimidator name due its association with Earnhardt, and trademark rights held by his estate. On October 23, 2019, the team unveiled its new identity as the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers: the team sought a name that could reflect on both the city's heritage and its association with auto racing. \"Cannons\" was among the most popular suggestions, and it was refined into \"Cannon Ballers\" in order to evoke a theme of [[human cannonball]] acts—reflecting Earnhardt's legacy as a risk-taker. The mascot — a baseball-headed stuntman — has a mustache modeled upon that of Earnhardt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.sportslogos.net/2019/10/23/launching-the-kannapolis-cannon-ballers/|title=Launching the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers|website=Chris Creamer's SportsLogos.net|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=New for 2020: Kannapolis Cannon Ballers |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/10/23/new-for-2020-kannapolis-cannon-ballers/ |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> A public vote was held to determine the mascot's name, with \"Boomer Baller\" announced as the winner on January 15, 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independenttribune.com/cit/meet-boomer-the-kannapolis-cannon-ballers-mascot/article_0d510370-f8ba-57ee-87a9-c4fb9a88d3b7.html|title=Meet Boomer, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers mascot|last=Thompson|first=Adam|work=Independent Tribune|date=January 15, 2020|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>

==Ownership==
Smith Family Baseball, owned by [[Illinois]] businessman Dale Smith and his son Brad (the team's President) bought the team from [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] and motorsports magnate [[Bruton Smith]] in December 2004. [[Larry Hedrick|Larry]] and Sue Hedrick, the owners who bought the Spartanburg Phillies in 1993 and eventually moved them to Kannapolis, retained a minority share of the team's ownership.

A group led by Reese L. Smith III announced the purchase of the Intimidators in 2015, subject to approval by the South Atlantic League, Minor League Baseball and the [[Commissioner of Baseball]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independenttribune.com/news/intimidators-baseball-team-in-kannapolis-under-new-ownership/article_2586cfc6-eab9-11e5-b0ec-63705c1e5287.html |title=Intimidators baseball team in Kannapolis under new ownership |work=[[Independent Tribune]] |date=2016-03-15 |accessdate=2016-03-15}}</ref> The Kannapolis city council voted to transfer the lease of the stadium to Intimidators Baseball Club LLC.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.salisburypost.com/2016/03/16/191051/ |title=Kannapolis Intimidators have new owners, big plans |last=Smith |first=Deirdre |work=[[Salisbury Post]] |date=2016-03-16 |accessdate=2016-03-16}}</ref>

The '''Kannapolis Cannon Ballers''' are a [[Minor League Baseball]] team of the [[South Atlantic League]] and the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]]. They are located in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]] and beginning in 2020, will play their home games at [[Atrium Health Ballpark]].  The team was established in 1995 as the '''Piedmont Phillies'''. From 1996 to 2000, they were known as the '''Piedmont Boll Weevils'''. From 2001 to 2019, they were known as the '''Kannapolis Intimidators''', after [[NASCAR]] driver [[Dale Earnhardt]], who was known as the \"The Intimidator\", purchased a share of the team before the 2001 season.

==Team history==

The Intimidators franchise moved to Kannapolis in 1995 from [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], where it had been a [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] affiliate of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] since the franchise's beginning in 1963. Debate raged in the Kannapolis area over what to name the team, with team officials finally deciding to call the team the Piedmont Phillies for the 1995 season.

A name-the-team contest in the fall of 1995 drew thousands of entries, and the team settled on the [[boll weevil]] as the team's new mascot, indicative of Kannapolis' history as a [[textile]] mill town (Kannapolis natives are even called \"lintheads\"). The Piedmont Boll Weevils kept that mascot until after the 2000 season, when [[NASCAR]] racer [[Dale Earnhardt]] purchased a share in the team's ownership. It was then that the name was changed to the Kannapolis Intimidators, in honor of Earnhardt's nickname.<ref name=\"Earnhardt\">{{cite web |publisher=The Earnhardt Connection |url=http://www.daleearnhardt.net/dei/intimidators/index.htm |title=TEC {{!}} Kannapolis Intimidators |website=Daleearnhardt.net |date=November 22, 2000 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref> The team's logo was designed by [[Sam Bass (artist)|Sam Bass]], who has designed paint schemes and uniforms on many NASCAR, IndyCar, and NHRA race cars.<ref name=\"Earnhardt\" /> It was also during that off-season that the team's parent club changed from the Phillies to the [[Chicago White Sox]], making the Intimidators the third White Sox farm team to be located in the Carolinas, following the [[Charlotte Knights]] and the [[Winston-Salem Warthogs]].

Earnhardt, who drove the number 3 car in NASCAR, [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|was killed in an accident]] at the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] in February 2001.<ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Rodman |url=http://www.nascar.com/2001/NEWS/02/18/earnhardt_stewart/index.html |title=Earnhardt dies following Daytona 500 accident – February 21, 2001 |website=NASCAR.com |date=2001-02-21 |accessdate=2012-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010219102746/http://www.nascar.com/2001/NEWS/02/18/earnhardt_stewart/index.html |archivedate=February 19, 2001}}</ref> Following Earnhardt's death, the Intimidators avoided assigning the number 3 for team uniforms. Team manager [[Razor Shines]], originally slated to wear the number, changed his uniform number to 43. The team officially retired number 3 on May 15, 2002, in memory of their former co-owner, similar to the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] retiring the number 26 (the 26th man) in honor of former owner [[Gene Autry]].

From 1995 to 2019, the team played in [[Intimidators Stadium]] (formerly Fieldcrest Cannon and later CMC-NorthEast Stadium) in Kannapolis. \"The Cannon\" was still under construction when the Piedmont Phillies began play in 1995. Upon completion in late 1995, during the winter, the stadium seated 4,700 fans. The stadium changed names on April 3, 2012, under a new naming rights agreement for the 2012 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kannapolis.intimidators.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120403&content_id=27861788&vkey=news_t487&fext=.jsp&sid=t487 |title=Name Game: Welcome to CMC-NorthEast Stadium |publisher=Kannapolis Intimidators |website=[[MiLB.com]] |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> For 2016, the naming rights deal quietly ended, with the name reverting to Intimidators Stadium.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20090114&content_id=41000294&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_t487&sid=t487 |title=Our Ballpark {{!}} Kannapolis Intimidators Content}}</ref>

On October 30, 2018, ground was broken on a [[Kannapolis Sports and Entertainment Venue|new ballpark]] in downtown Kannapolis as part of a mixed-use redevelopment plan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/10/31/new-kannapolis-ballpark-breaks-ground/ |title=New Kannapolis Ballpark Breaks Ground |last=Speddon |first=Zach |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=October 31, 2018 |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}</ref> The stadium is scheduled to be ready for the team's 2020 season opener on April 16, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kannapolis Ballpark Opener: April 16, 2020 |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/08/22/kannapolis-ballpark-opener-april-16-2020/ |accessdate=August 22, 2019 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=August 22, 2019}}</ref>

With the move, the team announced in February 2019 that it would seek ideas for a new name to be introduced at the same time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independenttribune.com/news/intimidators-launch-name-change-contest/article_d80eed34-2a23-11e9-a43a-f7046eacc62d.html |title=Intimidators launch name change contest |work=[[Independent Tribune]] |date=February 6, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019}}</ref> The new owners cited their inability to widely market the Intimidator name due its association with Earnhardt, and trademark rights held by his estate. On October 23, 2019, the team unveiled its new identity as the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers: the team sought a name that could reflect on both the city's heritage and its association with auto racing. \"Cannons\" was among the most popular suggestions, and it was refined into \"Cannon Ballers\" in order to evoke a theme of [[human cannonball]] acts—reflecting Earnhardt's legacy as a risk-taker. The mascot — a baseball-headed stuntman — has a mustache modeled upon that of Earnhardt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.sportslogos.net/2019/10/23/launching-the-kannapolis-cannon-ballers/|title=Launching the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers|website=Chris Creamer's SportsLogos.net|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=New for 2020: Kannapolis Cannon Ballers |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/10/23/new-for-2020-kannapolis-cannon-ballers/ |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> A public vote was held to determine the mascot's name, with \"Boomer Baller\" announced as the winner on January 15, 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independenttribune.com/cit/meet-boomer-the-kannapolis-cannon-ballers-mascot/article_0d510370-f8ba-57ee-87a9-c4fb9a88d3b7.html|title=Meet Boomer, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers mascot|last=Thompson|first=Adam|work=Independent Tribune|date=January 15, 2020|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>

==Ownership==
Smith Family Baseball, owned by [[Illinois]] businessman Dale Smith and his son Brad (the team's President) bought the team from [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] and motorsports magnate [[Bruton Smith]] in December 2004. [[Larry Hedrick|Larry]] and Sue Hedrick, the owners who bought the Spartanburg Phillies in 1993 and eventually moved them to Kannapolis, retained a minority share of the team's ownership.

A group led by Reese L. Smith III announced the purchase of the Intimidators in 2015, subject to approval by the South Atlantic League, Minor League Baseball and the [[Commissioner of Baseball]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independenttribune.com/news/intimidators-baseball-team-in-kannapolis-under-new-ownership/article_2586cfc6-eab9-11e5-b0ec-63705c1e5287.html |title=Intimidators baseball team in Kannapolis under new ownership |work=[[Independent Tribune]] |date=2016-03-15 |accessdate=2016-03-15}}</ref> The Kannapolis city council voted to transfer the lease of the stadium to Intimidators Baseball Club LLC.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.salisburypost.com/2016/03/16/191051/ |title=Kannapolis Intimidators have new owners, big plans |last=Smith |first=Deirdre |work=[[Salisbury Post]] |date=2016-03-16 |accessdate=2016-03-16}}</ref>
