They are traditionally made of wooden [[stave (wood)|staves]] and bound by wood or metal hoops. \n\nModern wooden barrels for wine-making are made of French common oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''), white [[Oak (wine)|oak]] (''[[Quercus petraea]]''), or American white oak (''[[Quercus alba]]'') and typically have standard sizes: \"[[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] type\" {{convert|225|L|USgal impgal}}, \"[[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] type\" {{convert|228|L|USgal impgal}} and \"[[Cognac]] type\" {{convert|300|L|USgal impgal}}. Modern barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different [[types of plastic]], such as [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]].\n\nSomeone who makes barrels is called a \"barrel maker\" or [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]]. Barrels are only one product of cooperage. Coopers also make [[bucket]]s, vats, [[Tub (container)|tubs]], [[butter churn]]s, [[hogshead]]s, [[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkins]], [[keg]]s, kilderkins, [[English units of wine casks#Tierce|tierces]], [[rundlet]]s, [[Puncheon (barrel)|puncheons]], pipes, [[Tun (volume)|tuns]], [[butt (unit)|butts]], pins, [[watering trough|troughs]] and [[Breaker (container)|breakers]].\n\nBarrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol [[arrack]], and [[sake]]. They are also employed to hold maturing beverages such as [[wine]], [[Cognac (brandy)|cognac]], [[Armagnac (drink)|armagnac]], [[sherry]], [[port wine|port]], [[whiskey]], and [[beer]]. Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include [[gunpowder]], [[Salt-cured meat|meat]], fish, paint, honey, nails and [[tallow]]. Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space. The term barrel can also refer to roughly cylindrical containers or drums made of modern materials like plastic, steel or aluminium. Barrels were often used for storage and preservation as reflected in the archaeological record<ref>https://jefpat.maryland.gov/Pages/mac-lab/curators-choice/2019-curators-choice/2019-04-fish-in-a-barrel.aspx</ref>.\n\nThe barrel has also been used as a [[Barrel (unit)|standard size of measure]] referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity. For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of {{convert|36|impgal|L USgal}}. Wine was shipped in barrels of {{convert|119|L|USgal impgal}}. A barrel of oil, defined as {{convert|42|USgal|impgal L}}, is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels. The barrel has also come into use as a [[generic term]] for a wooden cask of any size.\n\n==History==\nAn [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian wall-painting]] in the tomb of [[Hesy-Ra]], dating to 2600 BC, shows a wooden tub made of staves, bound together with wooden hoops, and used to measure corn.<ref>Kenneth Kilby (1989), ''The cooper and his trade'', Fresno, California, Linden Publishing, p.91. {{ISBN|0-941936-16-3}}</ref> Another Egyptian tomb painting dating to 1900 BC shows a cooper and tubs made of staves in use at the grape harvest.<ref>Diane Twede, \"The cask age: the technology and history of wooden barrels\", Packaging Technology and Science, 2005, 18, p.253 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pts.696]</ref> Palm-wood casks were also reported in use in ancient [[Babylon]]. In Europe, buckets and casks dating to 200 BC have been found preserved in the mud of lake villages.<ref>Kilby, p.93</ref> A lake village near [[Glastonbury]] dating to the late [[Iron Age]] has yielded one complete tub and a number of wooden staves.\n\nThe [[ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Pliny the Elder]] reports that cooperage in Europe originated with the [[Gauls]] in Alpine villages where they stored their beverages in wooden casks bound with hoops. Pliny identified three different types of coopers: ordinary coopers, wine coopers and coopers who made large casks.<ref>Kilby, p.96</ref> Large casks contain more and bigger staves and are correspondingly more difficulty to assemble. Roman coopers tended to be independent tradesmen, passing their skills on to their sons. The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] records wooden [[pithos|''pithoi'']] were lined with pitch to stop leakage and preserve the wine.<ref>Kilby, p.98</ref>\n\nBarrels were sometimes used for military purposes. [[Julius Caesar]] used [[catapults]] to hurl burning barrels of tar into towns under siege to start fires.<ref>Kilby, p.99</ref> The Romans also used empty barrels to make [[pontoon bridge|pontoon bridges]] to cross rivers.\n[[File:Gestapelde tonnen Zeesluisweg (links) hoek Schokkerweg bij reder Vrolijk te Scheveningen Den Haag.jpg|thumb|Pyramidal pile of herring barrels in [[Scheveningen]], the Netherlands]]\nEmpty casks were used to line the walls of shallow wells from at least Roman times. Such casks were found in 1897 during archaeological excavation in Britain of Roman [[Silchester]]. They were made of [[Abies alba|Pyrenean silver fir]] and the staves were one and a half inches thick and featured grooves where the heads fitted. They had Roman numerals scratched on the surface of each stave to help with reassembly.<ref>Kilby, p.99</ref>\n\nIn [[Anglo-Saxon]] Britain wooden barrels were used to store ale, butter, honey and [[mead]]. Drinking containers were also made from small staves of [[oak]], [[yew]] or [[pine]]. These items required considerable craftsmanship to hold liquids and might be bound with finely worked precious metals. They were highly valued items and were sometimes buried with the dead as [[grave goods]].<ref>Kilby, p.102</ref> Churns, buckets and tubs made from staves have been excavated from peat bogs and lake villages in Europe. A large keg and a bucket were found in the Viking [[Gokstad ship]] excavated near Oslo Fiord in 1880.\n\n==Uses today==\n\n===Beverage maturing===\n[[File:Lightmatter wine barrels.jpg|thumb|Wine barrels in Napa Valley, California]]\n\nAn \"aging barrel\" is used to [[Aging of wine|age wine]]; [[Distilled beverage|distilled spirits]] such as [[whiskey]], [[brandy]], or [[rum]]; [[beer]]; [[tabasco sauce]]; or (in smaller sizes) [[traditional balsamic vinegar]]. When a wine or spirit ages in a barrel, small amounts of [[oxygen]] are introduced as the barrel lets some air in (compare to [[microoxygenation]] where oxygen is deliberately added). Oxygen enters a barrel when [[water]] or [[ethanol|alcohol]] is lost due to [[evaporation]], a portion known as the \"angels' share\". In an environment with 100% relative [[humidity]], very little water evaporates and so most of the loss is alcohol, a useful trick if one has a wine with very high proof. Most beverages are topped up from other barrels to prevent significant oxidation, although others such as [[vin jaune]] and [[sherry]] are not.\n\nBeverages aged in wooden barrels take on some of the compounds in the barrel, such as [[vanillin]] and wood [[tannins (wine)|tannins]]. The presence of these compounds depends on many factors, including the place of origin, how the staves were cut and dried, and the degree of \"toast\" applied during manufacture. Barrels used for aging are typically made of French or American [[Oak (wine)|oak]], but [[chestnut]] and [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] are also used. Some Asian beverages (e.g., Japanese [[sake]]) use [[Cryptomeria|Japanese cedar]], which imparts an unusual, minty-piney flavor. In Peru and Chile, a grape distillate named ''[[pisco]]'' is either aged in oak or in [[earthenware]].\n\n====Wine====\nSome wines are fermented \"on barrel\", as opposed to in a neutral container like steel or wine-grade [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] (high-density polyethylene) tanks. Wine can also be fermented in large wooden tanks, which\u2014when open to the atmosphere\u2014are called \"open-tops\". Other wooden cooperage for storing wine or spirits range from smaller barriques to huge casks, with either [[elliptic]]al or round heads.\n\nThe tastes yielded by French and American species of oak are slightly different, with French oak being subtler, while American oak gives stronger aromas.<ref name=oak>[http://www.robertmondavi.com/WineFacts/oakBarrel.asp Oak Barrels: French vs. American] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602161329/http://www.robertmondavi.com/winefacts/oakbarrel.asp |date=2007-06-02 }}</ref> To retain the desired measure of oak influence, a [[winery]] will replace a certain percentage of its barrels every year, although this can vary from 5 to 100%. Some winemakers use \"200% new oak\", where the wine is put into new oak barrels twice during the aging process. [[Bulk wine]]s are sometimes more cheaply flavored by soaking in [[oak chips]] or added commercial oak flavoring instead of being aged in a barrel because of the much lower cost.\n\n====Sherry====\n[[File:FLOR-ValdiviaJerez59.jpg|thumb|[[Sherry]] [[wine barrel|barrel]] made with glass barrel head to show the layer of [[flor]] floating on top of the aging wine]]\n[[Sherry]] is stored in {{convert|600|l|adj=on}} casks made of North American oak, which is slightly more porous than French or Spanish oak. The casks, or butts, are filled five-sixths full, leaving \"the space of two fists\" empty at the top to allow [[flor]] to develop on top of the wine. Sherry is also commonly swapped between barrels of different ages, a process that is known as ''[[solera]]''.\n\n====Whiskey====\n[[File:Beam Rack House.jpg|thumb|Charred [[white oak]] barrels are filled with new [[bourbon whiskey]] and resting in a rack house for a period of typically 4 to 9 years (for good-quality bourbon), with the [[char]] giving the bourbon its characteristic copper color.]]\n\nLaws in several jurisdictions require that whiskey be aged in wooden barrels. The law in the United States requires that \"[[straight whiskey]]\" (with the exception of [[corn whiskey]]) must be stored for at least two years in new, charred oak containers.<ref name=\"cfrb1i\">{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=21224b7c634d83e0fa329bfd18bb85dc&rgn=div8&view=text&node=27:1.0.1.1.3.3.25.2&idno=27 |title=27 C.F.R. sec 5.22(b)(1)(i) |website=Ecfr.GPOAccess.gov |accessdate=2010-08-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817003820/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=21224b7c634d83e0fa329bfd18bb85dc&rgn=div8&view=text&node=27%3A1.0.1.1.3.3.25.2&idno=27 |archivedate=2012-08-17 }}</ref> Other forms of whiskey aged in used barrels cannot be called \"straight\".<ref name=\"cfrb1i\"/>\n\nInternational laws require any whisky bearing the label \"[[Scotch whisky|Scotch]]\" to be distilled and matured in [[Scotland]] for a minimum of three years and one day in oak casks.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh43.htm | title = ASIL Insight: WTO Protections for Food Geographic Indications | accessdate = 2007-08-25 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814193958/http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh43.htm| archivedate= 14 August 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nBy Canadian law,<ref name=B.02.020>[https://archive.is/20120709161352/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/F-27/C.R.C.-c.870/section-B.02.020.html \"Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870) \u2013 Canadian Whisky, Canadian Rye Whisky or Rye Whisky (B.02.020)\"].

These finishing barrels frequently aged a different spirit (such as rum) or wine. Other distillers, particularly those producing Scotch, often disassemble five used bourbon barrels and reassemble them into four casks with different barrel ends for aging Scotch, creating a type of cask referred to as a [[hogshead]].<ref>\"Casks (barrels, butts, punchons, pipes, barriques, and hogsheads)\", [http://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/2014-07-28/481/bws/casks-barrels-butts-punchons-pipes-barriques-and-hogsheads Difford's Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222134205/http://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/2014-07-28/481/bws/casks-barrels-butts-punchons-pipes-barriques-and-hogsheads |date=2015-12-22 }}. (Access date December 17, 2015.)</ref>\n\n====Brandy====\nMaturing is very important for a good [[brandy]], which is typically aged in oak casks. The wood used for those barrels is selected because of its ability to transfer certain aromas to the spirit. [[Cognac (brandy)|Cognac]] is aged only in oak casks made from wood from the [[Forest of Tron\u00e7ais]] and more often from the Limousin forests.\n\n====Tequila====\nSome types of [[tequila]] are aged in oak barrels to mellow its flavor. \"Reposado\" tequila is aged for up to one year, \"A\u00f1ejo\" tequila is aged for up to three years, and \"Extra A\u00f1ejo\" tequila is aged for at least three years. Like with other spirits, longer aging results in a more pronounced flavor.\n\n====Balsamic vinegar====\n[[Traditional balsamic vinegar]] is aged in a series of wooden barrels.\n\n====Tabasco sauce====\nSince its invention in 1868, the pepper mash used to make [[Tabasco sauce]] is aged for three years in previously used oak whiskey barrels.\n{{anchor|AngelsShare|Angels|Share}}\n\n====Beer====\n{{See also|Barrel-aged beer}}\n[[File:Schaenke im Schottenhammel Faesser Zapfzeug.JPG|thumb|Beer barrels at the Munich [[Oktoberfest]]]]\n[[Beer]]s are sometimes aged in barrels which were previously used for maturing wines or spirits. This is most common in darker beers such as stout, which is sometimes aged in oak barrels identical to those used for whiskey. Whisky distiller Jameson notably purchases barrels used by Franciscan Well brewery for their Shandon Stout to produce a whisky branded as \"Jameson Caskmates\". [[Cask ale]] is aged in the barrel (usually steel) for a short time before serving. Extensive barrel aging is required of many [[sour beer]]s.\n\n====Soft drinks====\n[[Vernors]] [[ginger ale]] is marketed as having a \"barrel-aged\" flavor, and the syrup used to produce the beverage was originally aged in oak barrels when first manufactured in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Vernors\">{{cite web|last1=L\u00f3pez-Alt|first1=J.

The ambient [[humidity]] tends to affect the composition of this share. Drier conditions tend to make the barrels evaporate more water, strengthening the spirit. However, in higher humidities, more alcohol than water will evaporate, therefore reducing the alcoholic strength of the product. This alcoholic evaporate encourages the growth of a darkly colored fungus, the angels' share fungus, ''[[Baudoinia compniacensis]]'', which tends to appear on the exterior surfaces of most things in the immediate area.<ref name=baudoinia>{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=B.|title=The mystery of the warehouse stains (Animacules)|journal=Microbe|date=March 2009|volume=4|issue=3|pages=104\u2013105|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/jscott/projects/baudoinia/Microbe-March_2009.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201547/http://individual.utoronto.ca/jscott/projects/baudoinia/Microbe-March_2009.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03}}</ref><ref name=\"louisville\">{{cite web |url=http://www.louisvilleky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/692CEED8-7BDC-48F4-8D37-51B9AF4DA1DD/0/Agingwarehousesfullreport.pdf |title=Whiskey Aging Warehouses and the Effects to Surrounding Residential Neighborhoods in Louisville, Ky. |date=September 4, 2012 |first1=Hannah |last1=Byland |location=Louisville, Kentucky |publisher=Louisville, Kentucky government |accessdate=July 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043831/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/692CEED8-7BDC-48F4-8D37-51B9AF4DA1DD/0/Agingwarehousesfullreport.pdf |archivedate=May 10, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Water storage===\nWater barrels are often used to collect the [[rain]]water from dwellings (so that it may be used for irrigation or other purposes).

This facilitates [[rolling]] a well-built wooden barrel on its side and allows the roller to change directions with little friction, compared to a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. It also helps to distribute [[stress (physics)|stress]] evenly in the material by making the container more curved{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

Before serving the beer, a [[spile]] is hammered into the shive and a [[beer tap#Cask beer tap|tap]] into the keystone.\n\nThe wooden parts that make up a barrel are called '''staves''', the top and bottom are both called '''heads''' or '''headers''', and the rings that hold the staves together are called '''hoops'''. The latter are usually made of galvanized iron, though historically they were made of flexible bits of wood called [[withy|withies]]. While wooden hoops could require barrels to be \"fully hooped\", with hoops stacked tightly together along the entire top and bottom third of a barrel, iron-hooped barrels only require a few hoops on each end.\n\nWine barrels typically come in two hoop configurations. An American barrel features 6 hoops, from top to center: '''head- or chime hoop''', '''quarter hoop''' and '''bilge hoop''' (times two), while a French barrel features 8, including a so-called '''French hoop''', located between the quarter- and bilge hoops (see \"wine barrel parts\" illustration).\nThe opening at the center of a barrel is called '''[[bung hole]]''' and the stopper used to seal it is a '''[[bung]]'''. The latter is generally made of white silicone.\n\n==Sizes==\n{{Main article|Barrel (unit)}}\nA barrel is one of several [[units of measurement|units]] of [[volume]], with dry barrels, fluid barrels (UK beer barrel, US beer barrel), oil barrel, etc. The volume of some barrel units is double others, with various volumes in the range of about {{convert|100|\u2013|200|l}}.\n\n===English wine casks===\n{{English wine casks}}\nPre-1824 definitions continued to be used in the US, the [[wine gallon]] of 231 cubic inches being the standard [[gallon]] for liquids (the corn gallon of 268.8 cubic inches for solids).

The terms \"[[keg]]\" and \"cask\" refer to containers of any size, the distinction being that kegs are used for [[Draught beer|beers]] intended to be served using external gas cylinders. [[Cask ale]]s undergo part of their fermentation process in their containers, called casks.\n\nCasks are available in several sizes, and it is common to refer to \"a [[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkin]]\" or \"a kil\" ([[kilderkin]]) instead of a cask.\n\nThe modern US beer barrel is {{convert|31|USgal|L|5}}, half a gallon less than the traditional wine barrel.

This practice seems to have been prevalent up till the 1980s. Older hardware stores probably still have some of these barrels.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==See also==<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=50em}}\n* [[Bankruptcy barrel]]\n* [[Barrel racing]]\n* [[Barrel (unit)]]\n* [[Cask ale]]\n* [[Cooper (profession)]]\n* [[Drum (container)]]\n* [[Drunkard's cloak]]\n* [[hogshead]]\n* [[Storage tank]]\n* [[English wine cask units|tierce]]\n* [[Wine barrel]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Barrels}}\n{{Wiktionary|barrel|cask}}\n* [http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-ove2.htm Origin of \"over a barrel\"]\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Barrel}}\n* [http://www.homebrewing.com/articles/barrel-basics.php Barrel Basics]\n* [http://www.vareli.gr/varelia-videos.php Barrel Construction]\n* [https://woodenshell.co.uk/blog/19-how-to-store-and-maintain-oak-barrel.html How to store and maintain oak barrel]\n{{Packaging}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Beer vessels and serving]]\n[[Category:Food storage containers]]\n[[Category:Gardening aids]]\n[[Category:Shipping containers]]\n[[Category:Wine packaging and storage]]\n[[Category:Containers]]\n[[Category:Oil storage]]\n[[Category:storage vessels]]\n[[Category:liquid containers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hollow cylindrical container}}\n{{about|the container|use as a unit of measure|Barrel (unit)|the gun part|Gun barrel|other uses}}\n{{Redirect|Cask}}\n[[File:Oak-wine-barrel-at-toneleria-nacional-chile.jpg|thumb|Traditional oak barrels made by Chilean cooperage Toneler\u00eda Nacional]]\n[[File:Castle Rock Brewery - Nottingham - England - 2004-11-04.jpg|thumb|Modern stainless steel casks and kegs outside the [[Tynemill|Castle Rock]] [[microbrewery]] in [[Nottingham]], [[England]]]]\n[[File:MESAP 2015. - ba\u010dva.jpg|thumb|Wooden wine barrel at an exhibition in [[Croatia]]]]\n\nA '''barrel''' or '''cask''' is a hollow [[cylindrical]] container with a bulging center, longer than it is wide. They are traditionally made of wooden [[stave (wood)|staves]] and bound by wood or metal hoops. \n\nModern wooden barrels for wine-making are made of French common oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''), white [[Oak (wine)|oak]] (''[[Quercus petraea]]''), or American white oak (''[[Quercus alba]]'') and typically have standard sizes: \"[[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] type\" {{convert|225|L|USgal impgal}}, \"[[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] type\" {{convert|228|L|USgal impgal}} and \"[[Cognac]] type\" {{convert|300|L|USgal impgal}}. Modern barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different [[types of plastic]], such as [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]].\n\nSomeone who makes barrels is called a \"barrel maker\" or [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]]. Barrels are only one product of cooperage. Coopers also make [[bucket]]s, vats, [[Tub (container)|tubs]], [[butter churn]]s, [[hogshead]]s, [[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkins]], [[keg]]s, kilderkins, [[English units of wine casks#Tierce|tierces]], [[rundlet]]s, [[Puncheon (barrel)|puncheons]], pipes, [[Tun (volume)|tuns]], [[butt (unit)|butts]], pins, [[watering trough|troughs]] and [[Breaker (container)|breakers]].\n\nBarrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol [[arrack]], and [[sake]]. They are also employed to hold maturing beverages such as [[wine]], [[Cognac (brandy)|cognac]], [[Armagnac (drink)|armagnac]], [[sherry]], [[port wine|port]], [[whiskey]], and [[beer]]. Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include [[gunpowder]], [[Salt-cured meat|meat]], fish, paint, honey, nails and [[tallow]]. Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space. The term barrel can also refer to roughly cylindrical containers or drums made of modern materials like plastic, steel or aluminium.\n\nThe barrel has also been used as a [[Barrel (unit)|standard size of measure]] referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity. For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of {{convert|36|impgal|L USgal}}. Wine was shipped in barrels of {{convert|119|L|USgal impgal}}. A barrel of oil, defined as {{convert|42|USgal|impgal L}}, is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels. The barrel has also come into use as a [[generic term]] for a wooden cask of any size.\n\n==History==\nAn [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian wall-painting]] in the tomb of [[Hesy-Ra]], dating to 2600 BC, shows a wooden tub made of staves, bound together with wooden hoops, and used to measure corn.<ref>Kenneth Kilby (1989), ''The cooper and his trade'', Fresno, California, Linden Publishing, p.91. {{ISBN|0-941936-16-3}}</ref> Another Egyptian tomb painting dating to 1900 BC shows a cooper and tubs made of staves in use at the grape harvest.<ref>Diane Twede, \"The cask age: the technology and history of wooden barrels\", Packaging Technology and Science, 2005, 18, p.253 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pts.696]</ref> Palm-wood casks were also reported in use in ancient [[Babylon]]. In Europe, buckets and casks dating to 200 BC have been found preserved in the mud of lake villages.<ref>Kilby, p.93</ref> A lake village near [[Glastonbury]] dating to the late [[Iron Age]] has yielded one complete tub and a number of wooden staves.\n\nThe [[ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Pliny the Elder]] reports that cooperage in Europe originated with the [[Gauls]] in Alpine villages where they stored their beverages in wooden casks bound with hoops. Pliny identified three different types of coopers: ordinary coopers, wine coopers and coopers who made large casks.<ref>Kilby, p.96</ref> Large casks contain more and bigger staves and are correspondingly more difficulty to assemble. Roman coopers tended to be independent tradesmen, passing their skills on to their sons. The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] records wooden [[pithos|''pithoi'']] were lined with pitch to stop leakage and preserve the wine.<ref>Kilby, p.98</ref>\n\nBarrels were sometimes used for military purposes. [[Julius Caesar]] used [[catapults]] to hurl burning barrels of tar into towns under siege to start fires.<ref>Kilby, p.99</ref> The Romans also used empty barrels to make [[pontoon bridge|pontoon bridges]] to cross rivers.\n[[File:Gestapelde tonnen Zeesluisweg (links) hoek Schokkerweg bij reder Vrolijk te Scheveningen Den Haag.jpg|thumb|Pyramidal pile of herring barrels in [[Scheveningen]], the Netherlands]]\nEmpty casks were used to line the walls of shallow wells from at least Roman times. Such casks were found in 1897 during archaeological excavation in Britain of Roman [[Silchester]]. They were made of [[Abies alba|Pyrenean silver fir]] and the staves were one and a half inches thick and featured grooves where the heads fitted. They had Roman numerals scratched on the surface of each stave to help with reassembly.<ref>Kilby, p.99</ref>\n\nIn [[Anglo-Saxon]] Britain wooden barrels were used to store ale, butter, honey and [[mead]]. Drinking containers were also made from small staves of [[oak]], [[yew]] or [[pine]]. These items required considerable craftsmanship to hold liquids and might be bound with finely worked precious metals. They were highly valued items and were sometimes buried with the dead as [[grave goods]].<ref>Kilby, p.102</ref> Churns, buckets and tubs made from staves have been excavated from peat bogs and lake villages in Europe. A large keg and a bucket were found in the Viking [[Gokstad ship]] excavated near Oslo Fiord in 1880.\n\n==Uses today==\n\n===Beverage maturing===\n[[File:Lightmatter wine barrels.jpg|thumb|Wine barrels in Napa Valley, California]]\n\nAn \"aging barrel\" is used to [[Aging of wine|age wine]]; [[Distilled beverage|distilled spirits]] such as [[whiskey]], [[brandy]], or [[rum]]; [[beer]]; [[tabasco sauce]]; or (in smaller sizes) [[traditional balsamic vinegar]]. When a wine or spirit ages in a barrel, small amounts of [[oxygen]] are introduced as the barrel lets some air in (compare to [[microoxygenation]] where oxygen is deliberately added). Oxygen enters a barrel when [[water]] or [[ethanol|alcohol]] is lost due to [[evaporation]], a portion known as the \"angels' share\". In an environment with 100% relative [[humidity]], very little water evaporates and so most of the loss is alcohol, a useful trick if one has a wine with very high proof. Most beverages are topped up from other barrels to prevent significant oxidation, although others such as [[vin jaune]] and [[sherry]] are not.\n\nBeverages aged in wooden barrels take on some of the compounds in the barrel, such as [[vanillin]] and wood [[tannins (wine)|tannins]]. The presence of these compounds depends on many factors, including the place of origin, how the staves were cut and dried, and the degree of \"toast\" applied during manufacture. Barrels used for aging are typically made of French or American [[Oak (wine)|oak]], but [[chestnut]] and [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] are also used. Some Asian beverages (e.g., Japanese [[sake]]) use [[Cryptomeria|Japanese cedar]], which imparts an unusual, minty-piney flavor. In Peru and Chile, a grape distillate named ''[[pisco]]'' is either aged in oak or in [[earthenware]].\n\n====Wine====\nSome wines are fermented \"on barrel\", as opposed to in a neutral container like steel or wine-grade [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] (high-density polyethylene) tanks. Wine can also be fermented in large wooden tanks, which\u2014when open to the atmosphere\u2014are called \"open-tops\". Other wooden cooperage for storing wine or spirits range from smaller barriques to huge casks, with either [[elliptic]]al or round heads.\n\nThe tastes yielded by French and American species of oak are slightly different, with French oak being subtler, while American oak gives stronger aromas.<ref name=oak>[http://www.robertmondavi.com/WineFacts/oakBarrel.asp Oak Barrels: French vs. American] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602161329/http://www.robertmondavi.com/winefacts/oakbarrel.asp |date=2007-06-02 }}</ref> To retain the desired measure of oak influence, a [[winery]] will replace a certain percentage of its barrels every year, although this can vary from 5 to 100%. Some winemakers use \"200% new oak\", where the wine is put into new oak barrels twice during the aging process. [[Bulk wine]]s are sometimes more cheaply flavored by soaking in [[oak chips]] or added commercial oak flavoring instead of being aged in a barrel because of the much lower cost.\n\n====Sherry====\n[[File:FLOR-ValdiviaJerez59.jpg|thumb|[[Sherry]] [[wine barrel|barrel]] made with glass barrel head to show the layer of [[flor]] floating on top of the aging wine]]\n[[Sherry]] is stored in {{convert|600|l|adj=on}} casks made of North American oak, which is slightly more porous than French or Spanish oak. The casks, or butts, are filled five-sixths full, leaving \"the space of two fists\" empty at the top to allow [[flor]] to develop on top of the wine. Sherry is also commonly swapped between barrels of different ages, a process that is known as ''[[solera]]''.\n\n====Whiskey====\n[[File:Beam Rack House.jpg|thumb|Charred [[white oak]] barrels are filled with new [[bourbon whiskey]] and resting in a rack house for a period of typically 4 to 9 years (for good-quality bourbon), with the [[char]] giving the bourbon its characteristic copper color.]]\n\nLaws in several jurisdictions require that whiskey be aged in wooden barrels.

These finishing barrels frequently aged a different spirit (such as rum) or wine. Other distillers, particularly those producing Scotch, often disassemble five used bourbon barrels and reassemble them into four casks with different barrel ends for aging Scotch, creating a type of cask referred to as a [[hogshead]].<ref>\"Casks (barrels, butts, punchons, pipes, barriques, and hogsheads)\", [http://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/2014-07-28/481/bws/casks-barrels-butts-punchons-pipes-barriques-and-hogsheads Difford's Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222134205/http://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/2014-07-28/481/bws/casks-barrels-butts-punchons-pipes-barriques-and-hogsheads |date=2015-12-22 }}. (Access date December 17, 2015.)</ref>\n\n====Brandy====\nMaturing is very important for a good [[brandy]], which is typically aged in oak casks. The wood used for those barrels is selected because of its ability to transfer certain aromas to the spirit. [[Cognac (brandy)|Cognac]] is aged only in oak casks made from wood from the [[Forest of Tron\u00e7ais]] and more often from the Limousin forests.\n\n====Tequila====\nSome types of [[tequila]] are aged in oak barrels to mellow its flavor. \"Reposado\" tequila is aged for up to one year, \"A\u00f1ejo\" tequila is aged for up to three years, and \"Extra A\u00f1ejo\" tequila is aged for at least three years. Like with other spirits, longer aging results in a more pronounced flavor.\n\n====Balsamic vinegar====\n[[Traditional balsamic vinegar]] is aged in a series of wooden barrels.\n\n====Tabasco sauce====\nSince its invention in 1868, the pepper mash used to make [[Tabasco sauce]] is aged for three years in previously used oak whiskey barrels.\n{{anchor|AngelsShare|Angels|Share}}\n\n====Beer====\n{{See also|Barrel-aged beer}}\n[[File:Schaenke im Schottenhammel Faesser Zapfzeug.JPG|thumb|Beer barrels at the Munich [[Oktoberfest]]]]\n[[Beer]]s are sometimes aged in barrels which were previously used for maturing wines or spirits. This is most common in darker beers such as stout, which is sometimes aged in oak barrels identical to those used for whiskey. Whisky distiller Jameson notably purchases barrels used by Franciscan Well brewery for their Shandon Stout to produce a whisky branded as \"Jameson Caskmates\". [[Cask ale]] is aged in the barrel (usually steel) for a short time before serving. Extensive barrel aging is required of many [[sour beer]]s.\n\n====Soft drinks====\n[[Vernors]] [[ginger ale]] is marketed as having a \"barrel-aged\" flavor, and the syrup used to produce the beverage was originally aged in oak barrels when first manufactured in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Vernors\">{{cite web|last1=L\u00f3pez-Alt|first1=J.

The ambient [[humidity]] tends to affect the composition of this share. Drier conditions tend to make the barrels evaporate more water, strengthening the spirit. However, in higher humidities, more alcohol than water will evaporate, therefore reducing the alcoholic strength of the product. This alcoholic evaporate encourages the growth of a darkly colored fungus, the angels' share fungus, ''[[Baudoinia compniacensis]]'', which tends to appear on the exterior surfaces of most things in the immediate area.<ref name=baudoinia>{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=B.|title=The mystery of the warehouse stains (Animacules)|journal=Microbe|date=March 2009|volume=4|issue=3|pages=104\u2013105|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/jscott/projects/baudoinia/Microbe-March_2009.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201547/http://individual.utoronto.ca/jscott/projects/baudoinia/Microbe-March_2009.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03}}</ref><ref name=\"louisville\">{{cite web |url=http://www.louisvilleky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/692CEED8-7BDC-48F4-8D37-51B9AF4DA1DD/0/Agingwarehousesfullreport.pdf |title=Whiskey Aging Warehouses and the Effects to Surrounding Residential Neighborhoods in Louisville, Ky. |date=September 4, 2012 |first1=Hannah |last1=Byland |location=Louisville, Kentucky |publisher=Louisville, Kentucky government |accessdate=July 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043831/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/692CEED8-7BDC-48F4-8D37-51B9AF4DA1DD/0/Agingwarehousesfullreport.pdf |archivedate=May 10, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Water storage===\nWater barrels are often used to collect the [[rain]]water from dwellings (so that it may be used for irrigation or other purposes).

This facilitates [[rolling]] a well-built wooden barrel on its side and allows the roller to change directions with little friction, compared to a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. It also helps to distribute [[stress (physics)|stress]] evenly in the material by making the container more curved{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

Before serving the beer, a [[spile]] is hammered into the shive and a [[beer tap#Cask beer tap|tap]] into the keystone.\n\nThe wooden parts that make up a barrel are called '''staves''', the top and bottom are both called '''heads''' or '''headers''', and the rings that hold the staves together are called '''hoops'''. The latter are usually made of galvanized iron, though historically they were made of flexible bits of wood called [[withy|withies]]. While wooden hoops could require barrels to be \"fully hooped\", with hoops stacked tightly together along the entire top and bottom third of a barrel, iron-hooped barrels only require a few hoops on each end.\n\nWine barrels typically come in two hoop configurations. An American barrel features 6 hoops, from top to center: '''head- or chime hoop''', '''quarter hoop''' and '''bilge hoop''' (times two), while a French barrel features 8, including a so-called '''French hoop''', located between the quarter- and bilge hoops (see \"wine barrel parts\" illustration).\nThe opening at the center of a barrel is called '''[[bung hole]]''' and the stopper used to seal it is a '''[[bung]]'''. The latter is generally made of white silicone.\n\n==Sizes==\n{{Main article|Barrel (unit)}}\nA barrel is one of several [[units of measurement|units]] of [[volume]], with dry barrels, fluid barrels (UK beer barrel, US beer barrel), oil barrel, etc. The volume of some barrel units is double others, with various volumes in the range of about {{convert|100|\u2013|200|l}}.\n\n===English wine casks===\n{{English wine casks}}\nPre-1824 definitions continued to be used in the US, the [[wine gallon]] of 231 cubic inches being the standard [[gallon]] for liquids (the corn gallon of 268.8 cubic inches for solids).
