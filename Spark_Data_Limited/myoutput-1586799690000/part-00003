The Mediterranean climate covers [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], coastal [[Croatia]], coastal [[Slovenia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], [[Greece]], as well as the Mediterranean islands. Those areas of Mediterranean climate present similar vegetations and landscapes throughout, including dry [[hill]]s, small [[plain]]s, [[pine]] [[forest]]s and [[olive]] [[tree]]s.\n\nCooler climates can be found in certain parts of Southern European countries, for example within the mountain ranges of Spain and Italy. Additionally, the north coast of Spain experiences a wetter Atlantic climate.\n\n==Flora==\n{{multiple image | direction=vertical | width=220\n| image1=Floristic regions in Europe (english).png\n| caption1=The European floristic regions\n| image2=Agricultura ganaderia europa.png\n| caption2={{legend|#333399|'''Mediterranean agriculture''' in coastal and peri-coastal regions}}\n}}\n\nSouthern Europe's [[flora]] is that of the Mediterranean Region, one of the [[phytochoria]] recognized by [[Armen Takhtajan]]. The Mediterranean and Submediterranean climate regions in Europe are found in much of Southern Europe, mainly in Southern Portugal, most of Spain, the southern coast of [[France]], Italy, the Croatian coast, much of Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Greece, and the Mediterranean islands.<ref>[[:de:Wolfgang Frey|Wolfgang Frey]] and [[:de:Rainer L\u00f6sch|Rainer L\u00f6sch]]; ''Lehrbuch der Geobotanik.

In yellow the south-west of Europe, and in violet the south-east.]]\nThe [[Phoenicians]] originally expanded from [[Canaan]] [[port]]s, dominating trade in the [[Mediterranean]] by the 8th century BC. [[Carthage]] was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]] and [[Sardinia]], which created conflicts of interest with [[Etruria]]. Its colonies later reached the [[Mediterranean Sea|Western Mediterranean]], such as [[C\u00e1diz]] in Spain and most notably [[Carthage]] in North Africa, and even the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The civilisation spread across the Mediterranean between 1500 BC and 300 BC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/phoenicia/|title=Phoenicia|encyclopedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref>\n\nThe period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the rise of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout [[Asia]]. The [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean Basin]] in a vast empire based on [[Roman law]] and [[Roman legion]]s. It promoted trade, tolerance, and Greek culture. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the [[Western Roman Empire]] based in Rome, and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] based in Constantinople. The attacks of the [[Goths]] led to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]]. During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the Byzantine Empire. In Western Europe, [[Germanic peoples]] moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established [[Barbarian kingdoms|kingdoms]] and empires of their own.\n\nThe period known as the [[Crusades]], a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back into Christian rule, began. Several [[Crusader states]] were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the [[Silk Road]] and open the way for the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers. The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] for Christendom. The [[late Middle Ages]] represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused [[Demography|demographic]] catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and [[War of aggression|wars of conquest]] kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In the [[Balkans]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], a Turkish state originating in [[Anatolia]], encroached steadily on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.\n\n===Post-Middle Ages===\n[[File:Iberian Union Empires2.png|thumb|[[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colonies]]\nBeginning roughly in the 12th century in [[Florence]], and later spreading through Europe with the development of the [[printing press]], a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and [[theology]], with the Arabic texts and thought<ref>e.g. [[Averroes#Commentaries on Aristotle and Plato]] written in the 12th century, which was mentioned in ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' [http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display?Italian?Inferno?4?121?151?45?1?????1?

The Catholic reconquest of Portugal and Spain led to a series of oceanic explorations resulting in the [[Age of Discovery]] that established direct links with Africa, the Americas, and Asia. During this period, Iberian forces engaged in a worldwide struggle with Islamic societies; the battlefronts in this Ibero-Islamic World War stretched from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] into the [[Indian Ocean]], finally involving the islands of [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Truxillo |first1=Charles A. |title=By the Sword and the Cross: The Historical Evolution of the Catholic World Monarchy in Spain and the New World, 1492-1825}}</ref> Eventually this ecumenical conflict ended when new players\u2014England, Holland and France\u2014replaced Spain and Portugal as the main agents of European imperialism in the mid-17th century.\n\nEuropean overseas expansion led to the rise of [[colonial empire]]s, producing the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard J.

Balkan nations began to regain independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Italy unified into a nation state. The [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 ended the [[Temporal power (papal)|Papal temporal power]].\n\n===20th century===\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in Southeastern Europe as the [[Great Powers]] took up sides. The Allies defeated the [[Central Powers]] in 1918. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The Nazi regime under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and along with [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] sought to gain control of the continent by the [[Second World War]].\nFollowing the Allied victory in the Second World War, Europe was divided by the [[Iron Curtain]]. The countries in Southeastern Europe were dominated by the [[Soviet Union]] and became [[communist state]]s. The major non-communist Southern European countries joined a US-led military alliance ([[NATO]]) and formed the [[European Economic Community]] amongst themselves. The countries in the Soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the economic bloc called [[Comecon]]. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] was neutral. The common attribute of the eastern countries is that all of them have experiences about [[socialism]], but nevertheless, the beginning of the 1990s was just roughly the same. For some of them becoming independent was the major challenge, while others needed to face with poverty and deep dictatorship also Economically, parallel with the political changes, and the democratic transition, \u2013 as a rule of law states \u2013 the previous command economies were transformed via the legislation into market economies, and set up or renewed the major macroeconomic factors: budgetary rules, national audit, national currency, central bank. Generally, they shortly encountered the following problems: high inflation, high unemployment, low economic growth and high government debt. By 2000 these economies were stabilized, and sooner or later between 2004 and 2013 some of them joined the European Union, and Slovenia introduced the euro.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=V\u00e9rtesy|first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3|date=2018|title=Macroeconomic Legal Trends in the EU11 Countries|url=https://www.dialogcampus.hu/users/default/dialogcampus/uploads/elektronikus_konyvek/pga2018_01_09_vertesy.pdf|journal=Public Governance, Administration and Finances Law Review|volume=Vol. 3.

The [[European Union]] (EU) involved the division of powers, with taxation, health, and education handled by the nation states, while the EU had charge of market rules, competition, legal standards and environmentalism. The Soviet economic and political system collapsed, leading to the end of communism in the satellite countries in 1989, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. As a consequence, [[Maastricht Treaty|Europe's integration deepened]], the continent became depolarised, and the European Union expanded to subsequently include many of the formerly communist European countries \u2013 [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] (2007) and [[Croatia]] (2013).\n\n==Languages==\n{{See also|Languages of Europe}}\n\nThe following table shows the languages in Southern Europe that are spoken by at least five million people in the region:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:55%;\"\n|-\n! width=10%|Language\n! style=\"width:15%;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|Speakers{{efn|Both native and second language speakers residing in Southern Europe only.}}\n! width=25%|Principal Southern European <br /> country / countries\n|-\n| [[Italian language|Italian]] || 59,400,000<ref>{{e18|ita|Italian}}</ref>|| Italy <br />Malta <br />San Marino <br />Vatican City \n|-\n| [[Spanish language|Spanish]] || 46,000,000+<ref>{{e18|spa|Spanish }}</ref>|| Spain <br />Andorra <br />Gibraltar\n|-\n| [[Serbo-Croatian]] || 21,000,000+<ref>{{cite web |url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805212/94485/excerpt/9780521294485_excerpt.pdf |title=The Slavic Languages |work=Cambridge Language Surveys |page=7 |accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref> || Serbia <br />Croatia <br />Bosnia and Herzegovina <br />Montenegro <br />\n|-\n| [[Greek language|Greek]] || 13,432,490<ref>{{e18|ell|Greek }}</ref>|| Greece <br />Cyprus \n|-\n| [[Turkish language|Turkish]] || 12,649,247<ref>{{e18|tur|Turkish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/Start.do|title=Turkish Statistical Institute|website=www.turkstat.gov.tr}}</ref> || Turkey <br />Bulgaria <br />Cyprus <br />\n|-\n| [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] || 10,000,000<ref>{{e18|por|Portuguese }}</ref>|| Portugal <br />Andorra \n|-\n| [[Catalan language|Catalan]] || 10,000,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/number-of-catalan-speakers-rising-despite-adverse-context|title=Number of Catalan speakers rising despite adverse context|website=www.catalannewsagency.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.iec.cat/cruscat/publicacions/informe/|title=Informe sobre la Situaci\u00f3 de la Llengua Catalana - Xarxa CRUSCAT.

''(See the [[Latin Arch]].)''\nBy far the most common Romance languages in Southern Europe are Italian (spoken by over 50 million people in Italy, Malta, San Marino, and the Vatican) and Spanish, which is spoken by over 40 million people in Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar. Other common Romance languages include Portuguese (spoken in Portugal and Andorra), Catalan (spoken in eastern Spain, Andorra, Southwestern France, and the [[Sardinia]]n town of [[Alghero]] in Italy), [[Galician language|Galician]] (spoken in northwestern Spain) and [[Occitan]], which is spoken in the [[Val d'Aran]] in Catalonia, in the [[Occitan Valleys]] in Italy and in southern France.\n\n===Other languages===\nThe [[Hellenic languages]] or [[Greek language]] are widely spoken in Greece and Cyprus. Additionally, other varieties of Greek are spoken in small communities in parts of other European countries.\n\nEnglish is used as a second language in parts of Southern Europe. As a primary language, however, English has only a small presence in Southern Europe, only in Gibraltar (alongside Spanish) and Malta (secondary to Maltese). English is also widely spoken in Cyprus.\n\nThere are other language groupings in Southern Europe. [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is spoken in Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro,  Serbia and parts of Italy (particularly by the [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb]] people in [[Southern Italy]]) and Greece, and [[Serbo-Croatian]] is spoken in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro. [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] is spoken in Slovenia, Italy (in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]) and Croatia (in [[Istria]]) and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] is spoken in North Macedonia. [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is a [[Semitic language]] that is the official language of Malta, descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]], but written in the Latin script with heavy Latin and Italian influences. The [[Basque language]] is spoken in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], a region in northern Spain and southwestern France.\n\n==Transport==\n\nThe following table shows the busiest airports in Southern Europe in 2016.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Rank|| style=\"width:80px;\"|Country|| style=\"width:220px;\"|Airport|| style=\"width:125px;\"|City||Passengers (2015) ||Passengers (2016) ||Change<br /><small>2015-2016</small>\n|-\n|1|| [[Turkey]]{{efn|Turkey is a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] country located mainly in [[Western Asia]] with only 3% of its total land area, and 14% of its total population in [[Southeastern Europe]].}}||[[\u0130stanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport]]|| [[\u0130stanbul]]||61,322,729<ref name=\"Paris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.paris.fr/portail/accueil/Portal.lut?page_id=6587&document_type_id=5&document_id=16468&portlet_id=14974 |work=Mairie de Paris |title=Paris Partners: 'Les pactes d'amiti\u00e9 et de coop\u00e9ration' |accessdate=December 1, 2008}}</ref>||60,119,215<ref name=Paris/>||{{decrease}}{{0}}2.0%\n|-\n|2|| [[Spain]] ||[[Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas Airport]]|| [[Madrid]]||46,824,838<ref name=Spain>[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?pagename=Estadisticas/Home Spain AENA Airport Statistics]</ref>||50,420,583<ref name=Spain/>||{{increase}}{{0}}7.7%\n|-\n|3|| [[Spain]] ||[[Barcelona El Prat Airport]]|| [[Barcelona]]||39,711,237<ref name=Spain/>||44,154,693<ref name=Spain/>||{{increase}}11.2%\n|-\n|4|| [[Spain]] ||[[Palma de Mallorca Airport]]|| [[Palma, Majorca|Palma de Mallorca]]||23,745,023<ref name=Spain/>||26,253,882<ref name=Spain/>||{{increase}}10.6%\n|-\n|5|| [[Portugal]] ||[[Lisbon Portela Airport]]|| [[Lisbon]]||20,090,418<ref name=Portugal>[http://www.ana.pt/en-US/Topo/institucional/aboutANA/Publications/AnnualReports/Pages/AnnualRerports.aspx Portugal Airport Statistics]</ref>||22,449,289<ref>http://www.presstur.com/empresas---negocios/aviacao/aeroporto-de-lisboa-atingiu-22449-milhoes-de-passageiros-de-voos-comerciais-em-2016/</ref>||{{increase}}11.7%\n|-\n|6|| [[Greece]] ||[[Athens International Airport]]|| [[Athens]]||18,087,377<ref name=Athens>[http://www.aia.gr/company-and-business/the-company/facts-and-figures/ AIA traffic statistics]</ref>||20,017,530<ref name=Athens/>||{{increase}}10.7%\n|-\n|7|| [[Italy]] ||[[Malpensa Airport]]|| [[Milan]]||18,582,043<ref name=Italy>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131208020646/http://www.assaeroporti.com/statistiche/ |title=Statistiche - Assaeroporti|website=www.assaeroporti.com]</ref>||19,420,690<ref name=Italy/>||{{increase}}{{0}}4.5%\n|-\n|8|| [[Spain]] ||[[M\u00e1laga Airport]]|| [[M\u00e1laga]]||14,404,206<ref name=Spain/>||16,672,776<ref name=Spain/>\n||{{increase}}15.7%\n|-\n|9|| [[Spain]] ||[[Alicante Airport]]|| [[Alicante]]||10,575,288<ref name=\"Spain\" />||12,344,945<ref name=\"Spain\" />||{{increase}}16.7%\n|-\n|}\n==Religion==\n\n[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The religious distribution in 1054<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartileonline.eu/carte/1025738/dragan-brujia-vodia-kroz-svet-vizantijeDragan|title=Vodi\u010d kroz svet Vizantije (Guide to the Byzantine World)|accessdate=|author=Dragan Bruji\u0107|authorlink=|year=2005|publisher=Beograd|page=51|language=|quote=|df=}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>]]\n\nThe predominant religion in Southern Europe is [[Christianity]].

Southern Europe can be subdivided in:\n\n*[[Southwestern Europe]]: the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Andorra]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]), including the [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. \n\n*[[Southcentral Europe]]:  The Italian peninsula ([[Italy]] and the micro-states of [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]])\n\n*[[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]]: [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[East Thrace]] (part of European [[Turkey]]), [[Greece]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/place/Balkans Article in ''Britannica'']</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20970684|title=New five-euro note has goddess|date=27 October 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>Library of Congress.

The Mediterranean climate covers [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], coastal [[Croatia]], coastal [[Slovenia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], [[Greece]], as well as the Mediterranean islands. Those areas of Mediterranean climate present similar vegetations and landscapes throughout, including dry [[hill]]s, small [[plain]]s, [[pine]] [[forest]]s and [[olive]] [[tree]]s.\n\nCooler climates can be found in certain parts of Southern European countries, for example within the mountain ranges of Spain and Italy. Additionally, the north coast of Spain experiences a wetter Atlantic climate.\n\n==Flora==\n{{multiple image | direction=vertical | width=220\n| image1=Floristic regions in Europe (english).png\n| caption1=The European floristic regions\n| image2=Agricultura ganaderia europa.png\n| caption2={{legend|#333399|'''Mediterranean agriculture''' in coastal and peri-coastal regions}}\n}}\n\nSouthern Europe's [[flora]] is that of the Mediterranean Region, one of the [[phytochoria]] recognized by [[Armen Takhtajan]]. The Mediterranean and Submediterranean climate regions in Europe are found in much of Southern Europe, mainly in Southern Portugal, most of Spain, the southern coast of [[France]], Italy, the Croatian coast, much of Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Greece, and the Mediterranean islands.<ref>[[:de:Wolfgang Frey|Wolfgang Frey]] and [[:de:Rainer L\u00f6sch|Rainer L\u00f6sch]]; ''Lehrbuch der Geobotanik.

In yellow the south-west of Europe, and in violet the south-east.]]\nThe [[Phoenicians]] originally expanded from [[Canaan]] [[port]]s, dominating trade in the [[Mediterranean]] by the 8th century BC. [[Carthage]] was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]] and [[Sardinia]], which created conflicts of interest with [[Etruria]]. Its colonies later reached the [[Mediterranean Sea|Western Mediterranean]], such as [[C\u00e1diz]] in Spain and most notably [[Carthage]] in North Africa, and even the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The civilisation spread across the Mediterranean between 1500 BC and 300 BC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/phoenicia/|title=Phoenicia|encyclopedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref>\n\nThe period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the rise of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout [[Asia]]. The [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean Basin]] in a vast empire based on [[Roman law]] and [[Roman legion]]s. It promoted trade, tolerance, and Greek culture. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the [[Western Roman Empire]] based in Rome, and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] based in Constantinople. The attacks of the [[Goths]] led to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]]. During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the Byzantine Empire. In Western Europe, [[Germanic peoples]] moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established [[Barbarian kingdoms|kingdoms]] and empires of their own.\n\nThe period known as the [[Crusades]], a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back into Christian rule, began. Several [[Crusader states]] were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the [[Silk Road]] and open the way for the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers. The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] for Christendom. The [[late Middle Ages]] represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused [[Demography|demographic]] catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and [[War of aggression|wars of conquest]] kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In the [[Balkans]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], a Turkish state originating in [[Anatolia]], encroached steadily on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.\n\n===Post-Middle Ages===\n[[File:Iberian Union Empires2.png|thumb|[[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colonies]]\nBeginning roughly in the 12th century in [[Florence]], and later spreading through Europe with the development of the [[printing press]], a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and [[theology]], with the Arabic texts and thought<ref>e.g. [[Averroes#Commentaries on Aristotle and Plato]] written in the 12th century, which was mentioned in ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' [http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display?Italian?Inferno?4?121?151?45?1?????1?

The Catholic reconquest of Portugal and Spain led to a series of oceanic explorations resulting in the [[Age of Discovery]] that established direct links with Africa, the Americas, and Asia. During this period, Iberian forces engaged in a worldwide struggle with Islamic societies; the battlefronts in this Ibero-Islamic World War stretched from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] into the [[Indian Ocean]], finally involving the islands of [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Truxillo |first1=Charles A. |title=By the Sword and the Cross: The Historical Evolution of the Catholic World Monarchy in Spain and the New World, 1492-1825}}</ref> Eventually this ecumenical conflict ended when new players\u2014England, Holland and France\u2014replaced Spain and Portugal as the main agents of European imperialism in the mid-17th century.\n\nEuropean overseas expansion led to the rise of [[colonial empire]]s, producing the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard J.

Balkan nations began to regain independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Italy unified into a nation state. The [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 ended the [[Temporal power (papal)|Papal temporal power]].\n\n===20th century===\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in Southeastern Europe as the [[Great Powers]] took up sides. The Allies defeated the [[Central Powers]] in 1918. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The Nazi regime under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and along with [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] sought to gain control of the continent by the [[Second World War]].\nFollowing the Allied victory in the Second World War, Europe was divided by the [[Iron Curtain]]. The countries in Southeastern Europe were dominated by the [[Soviet Union]] and became [[communist state]]s. The major non-communist Southern European countries joined a US-led military alliance ([[NATO]]) and formed the [[European Economic Community]] amongst themselves. The countries in the Soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the economic bloc called [[Comecon]]. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] was neutral. The common attribute of the eastern countries is that all of them have experiences about [[socialism]], but nevertheless, the beginning of the 1990s was just roughly the same. For some of them becoming independent was the major challenge, while others needed to face with poverty and deep dictatorship also Economically, parallel with the political changes, and the democratic transition, \u2013 as a rule of law states \u2013 the previous command economies were transformed via the legislation into market economies, and set up or renewed the major macroeconomic factors: budgetary rules, national audit, national currency, central bank. Generally, they shortly encountered the following problems: high inflation, high unemployment, low economic growth and high government debt. By 2000 these economies were stabilized, and sooner or later between 2004 and 2013 some of them joined the European Union, and Slovenia introduced the euro.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=V\u00e9rtesy|first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3|date=2018|title=Macroeconomic Legal Trends in the EU11 Countries|url=https://www.dialogcampus.hu/users/default/dialogcampus/uploads/elektronikus_konyvek/pga2018_01_09_vertesy.pdf|journal=Public Governance, Administration and Finances Law Review|volume=Vol. 3.

The [[European Union]] (EU) involved the division of powers, with taxation, health, and education handled by the nation states, while the EU had charge of market rules, competition, legal standards and environmentalism. The Soviet economic and political system collapsed, leading to the end of communism in the satellite countries in 1989, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. As a consequence, [[Maastricht Treaty|Europe's integration deepened]], the continent became depolarised, and the European Union expanded to subsequently include many of the formerly communist European countries \u2013 [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] (2007) and [[Croatia]] (2013).\n\n==Languages==\n{{See also|Languages of Europe}}\n\nThe following table shows the languages in Southern Europe that are spoken by at least five million people in the region:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:55%;\"\n|-\n! width=10%|Language\n! style=\"width:15%;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|Speakers{{efn|Both native and second language speakers residing in Southern Europe only.}}\n! width=25%|Principal Southern European <br /> country / countries\n|-\n| [[Italian language|Italian]] || 59,400,000<ref>{{e18|ita|Italian}}</ref>|| Italy <br />Malta <br />San Marino <br />Vatican City \n|-\n| [[Spanish language|Spanish]] || 46,000,000+<ref>{{e18|spa|Spanish }}</ref>|| Spain <br />Andorra <br />Gibraltar\n|-\n| [[Serbo-Croatian]] || 21,000,000+<ref>{{cite web |url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805212/94485/excerpt/9780521294485_excerpt.pdf |title=The Slavic Languages |work=Cambridge Language Surveys |page=7 |accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref> || Serbia <br />Croatia <br />Bosnia and Herzegovina <br />Montenegro <br />\n|-\n| [[Greek language|Greek]] || 13,432,490<ref>{{e18|ell|Greek }}</ref>|| Greece <br />Cyprus \n|-\n| [[Turkish language|Turkish]] || 12,649,247<ref>{{e18|tur|Turkish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/Start.do|title=Turkish Statistical Institute|website=www.turkstat.gov.tr}}</ref> || Turkey <br />Bulgaria <br />Cyprus <br />\n|-\n| [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] || 10,000,000<ref>{{e18|por|Portuguese }}</ref>|| Portugal <br />Andorra \n|-\n| [[Catalan language|Catalan]] || 10,000,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/number-of-catalan-speakers-rising-despite-adverse-context|title=Number of Catalan speakers rising despite adverse context|website=www.catalannewsagency.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.iec.cat/cruscat/publicacions/informe/|title=Informe sobre la Situaci\u00f3 de la Llengua Catalana - Xarxa CRUSCAT.

''(See the [[Latin Arch]].)''\nBy far the most common Romance languages in Southern Europe are Italian (spoken by over 50 million people in Italy, Malta, San Marino, and the Vatican) and Spanish, which is spoken by over 40 million people in Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar. Other common Romance languages include Portuguese (spoken in Portugal and Andorra), Catalan (spoken in eastern Spain, Andorra, Southwestern France, and the [[Sardinia]]n town of [[Alghero]] in Italy), [[Galician language|Galician]] (spoken in northwestern Spain) and [[Occitan]], which is spoken in the [[Val d'Aran]] in Catalonia, in the [[Occitan Valleys]] in Italy and in southern France.\n\n===Other languages===\nThe [[Hellenic languages]] or [[Greek language]] are widely spoken in Greece and Cyprus. Additionally, other varieties of Greek are spoken in small communities in parts of other European countries.\n\nEnglish is used as a second language in parts of Southern Europe. As a primary language, however, English has only a small presence in Southern Europe, only in Gibraltar (alongside Spanish) and Malta (secondary to Maltese). English is also widely spoken in Cyprus.\n\nThere are other language groupings in Southern Europe. [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is spoken in Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro,  Serbia and parts of Italy (particularly by the [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb]] people in [[Southern Italy]]) and Greece, and [[Serbo-Croatian]] is spoken in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro. [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] is spoken in Slovenia, Italy (in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]) and Croatia (in [[Istria]]) and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] is spoken in North Macedonia. [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is a [[Semitic language]] that is the official language of Malta, descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]], but written in the Latin script with heavy Latin and Italian influences. The [[Basque language]] is spoken in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], a region in northern Spain and southwestern France.\n\n==Transport==\n\nThe following table shows the busiest airports in Southern Europe in 2016.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Rank|| style=\"width:80px;\"|Country|| style=\"width:220px;\"|Airport|| style=\"width:125px;\"|City||Passengers (2015) ||Passengers (2016) ||Change<br /><small>2015-2016</small>\n|-\n|1|| [[Turkey]]{{efn|Turkey is a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] country located mainly in [[Western Asia]] with only 3% of its total land area, and 14% of its total population in [[Southeastern Europe]].}}||[[\u0130stanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport]]|| [[\u0130stanbul]]||61,322,729<ref name=\"Paris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.paris.fr/portail/accueil/Portal.lut?page_id=6587&document_type_id=5&document_id=16468&portlet_id=14974 |work=Mairie de Paris |title=Paris Partners: 'Les pactes d'amiti\u00e9 et de coop\u00e9ration' |accessdate=December 1, 2008}}</ref>||60,119,215<ref name=Paris/>||{{decrease}}{{0}}2.0%\n|-\n|2|| [[Spain]] ||[[Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas Airport]]|| [[Madrid]]||46,824,838<ref name=Spain>[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?pagename=Estadisticas/Home Spain AENA Airport Statistics]</ref>||50,420,583<ref name=Spain/>||{{increase}}{{0}}7.7%\n|-\n|3|| [[Spain]] ||[[Barcelona El Prat Airport]]|| [[Barcelona]]||39,711,237<ref name=Spain/>||44,154,693<ref name=Spain/>||{{increase}}11.2%\n|-\n|4|| [[Spain]] ||[[Palma de Mallorca Airport]]|| [[Palma, Majorca|Palma de Mallorca]]||23,745,023<ref name=Spain/>||26,253,882<ref name=Spain/>||{{increase}}10.6%\n|-\n|5|| [[Portugal]] ||[[Lisbon Portela Airport]]|| [[Lisbon]]||20,090,418<ref name=Portugal>[http://www.ana.pt/en-US/Topo/institucional/aboutANA/Publications/AnnualReports/Pages/AnnualRerports.aspx Portugal Airport Statistics]</ref>||22,449,289<ref>http://www.presstur.com/empresas---negocios/aviacao/aeroporto-de-lisboa-atingiu-22449-milhoes-de-passageiros-de-voos-comerciais-em-2016/</ref>||{{increase}}11.7%\n|-\n|6|| [[Greece]] ||[[Athens International Airport]]|| [[Athens]]||18,087,377<ref name=Athens>[http://www.aia.gr/company-and-business/the-company/facts-and-figures/ AIA traffic statistics]</ref>||20,017,530<ref name=Athens/>||{{increase}}10.7%\n|-\n|7|| [[Italy]] ||[[Malpensa Airport]]|| [[Milan]]||18,582,043<ref name=Italy>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131208020646/http://www.assaeroporti.com/statistiche/ |title=Statistiche - Assaeroporti|website=www.assaeroporti.com]</ref>||19,420,690<ref name=Italy/>||{{increase}}{{0}}4.5%\n|-\n|8|| [[Spain]] ||[[M\u00e1laga Airport]]|| [[M\u00e1laga]]||14,404,206<ref name=Spain/>||16,672,776<ref name=Spain/>\n||{{increase}}15.7%\n|-\n|9|| [[Spain]] ||[[Alicante Airport]]|| [[Alicante]]||10,575,288<ref name=\"Spain\" />||12,344,945<ref name=\"Spain\" />||{{increase}}16.7%\n|-\n|}\n==Religion==\n\n[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The religious distribution in 1054<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartileonline.eu/carte/1025738/dragan-brujia-vodia-kroz-svet-vizantijeDragan|title=Vodi\u010d kroz svet Vizantije (Guide to the Byzantine World)|accessdate=|author=Dragan Bruji\u0107|authorlink=|year=2005|publisher=Beograd|page=51|language=|quote=|df=}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>]]\n\nThe predominant religion in Southern Europe is [[Christianity]].
