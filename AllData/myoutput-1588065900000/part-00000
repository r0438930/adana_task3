It joins the town centre of Kingston in the [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]] to [[Hampton Court Park]], [[Bushy Park]], and the village of [[Hampton Wick]] in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]. In 2005 it was carrying approximately 50,000 vehicles per day with up to 2,000 vehicles per hour in each direction during peak times.\n\nKingston Bridge is on the reach above [[Teddington Lock]] and close to and downstream of the mouth of the [[Hogsmill]] River, a minor tributary of the Thames. The [[Thames Path]] crosses the river here and the bridge is the end point for the [[Thames Down Link]] long distance footpath from [[Box Hill and Westhumble railway station|Box Hill station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspublications.nsf/f2d920e015d1183d80256c670041a50b/359f0ef32e86608b80257212004640cd/$FILE/TDLroute.pdf |title=Thames Down Link |publisher=Surrey County Council |accessdate=6 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622015653/http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspublications.nsf/f2d920e015d1183d80256c670041a50b/359f0ef32e86608b80257212004640cd/%24FILE/TDLroute.pdf |archivedate=22 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil [[Putney Bridge]] was opened in 1729, Kingston Bridge was the only crossing of the river between [[London Bridge]] and [[Staines Bridge]].\n\nAccording to 16th-century antiquarian [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], the bridge existed in the centuries when [[Anglo-Saxon England]] existed (after Roman Britain and before 1066).
