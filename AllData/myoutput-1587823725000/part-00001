The seal depicts a seated figure that is possibly [[Three-headed|tricephalic]] (having three heads). It was once thought to be [[ithyphallic]], an interpretation that is now mostly discarded.

He may represent a [[horned deity]].\n\nIt is ''[[wiktionary:purported|purported]]'' to be one of the earliest depictions of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shiva]], or a \"proto-Shiva\" deity.  The name given to the seal, \"[[pashupati]]\", meaning \"lord of animals\", is one of Shiva's [[Epithet|epithets]].  It has also been associated with the [[Vedic]] god [[Rudra]], generally regarded as an early form of Shiva.  Rudra is associated with asceticism, [[yoga]], and [[linga]]; regarded as a lord of animals; and Shiva may be depicted with three heads.
