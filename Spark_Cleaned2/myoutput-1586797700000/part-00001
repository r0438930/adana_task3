Her mother points out four mysterious slashes on her nightgown. The following morning she is consoled by her best friend, Nancy Thompson, and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz. The two stay at Tina's house when Tina's mother goes out of town, but their sleepover is interrupted by Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane. When Tina falls asleep, she dreams of being chased by the disfigured man. Rod is awoken by Tina's thrashing and sees her dragged and fatally slashed by an unseen force; he flees as Nancy and Glen awaken to find Tina covered in blood and dead.\n\nThe next day, Rod is arrested by Nancy's father, Lieutenant Don Thompson, despite his pleas of innocence. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class. While masquerading as Tina, the man chases her to the boiler room where she is cornered and burns her arm on a pipe. The burn startles her awake in class and she notices a burn mark on her arm. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and is nearly drowned by the man. Nancy goes to Rod at the police station, who tells her about what happened to Tina and his own similar dreams; this makes Nancy believe that the man is responsible for Tina's death.\n\nNancy invites Glen to watch over her as she falls asleep. In her dream, she sees the man prepare to kill Rod in his cell, but then he turns his attention towards her. Nancy runs away and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. The man kills Rod by wrapping bed sheets around his neck like a noose. Nancy and Glen find his body hanging in his cell. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes her dream. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a sleep disorders clinic, where, in a dream, Nancy grabs the man's fedora and pulls it from the dream into reality.\n\nMarge begins to drink and smoke heavily and bars the windows at home. She reveals to Nancy that the man, [[Freddy Krueger|Fred Krueger]] was an insane child murderer who was released on a technicality and then burned alive by Marge, Don, and other parents (who lived on their street) seeking vigilante justice. Nancy realizes that Krueger, now a vengeful ghost, desires revenge and to satiate his psychopathic needs. She tries to call Glen to warn him, but his father prevents her from speaking to him. Glen falls asleep and is sucked into his bed by Krueger, and a large fountain of blood is released in his room. Now alone, Nancy puts Marge to sleep and asks Don, who is across the street investigating Glen's death, to break into the house in twenty minutes. She rigs booby traps around the house, and grabs Krueger out of the dream and into the real world. The booby traps affect Krueger enough that Nancy is able to light him on fire with a Molotov cocktail and lock him in the basement. Nancy rushes to the door for help. The police arrive to find that Krueger has escaped from the basement. Nancy and Don go upstairs to find a burning Krueger smothering Marge in her bedroom. After Don puts out the fire, Krueger and Marge vanish into the bed.\n\nWhen Don leaves the room, Krueger rises from the bed behind Nancy. Realizing that Krueger is powered by his victim's fear of him, Nancy calmly turns her back to him and Krueger evaporates when he attempts to lunge at her.\n\nNancy steps outside into a bright and foggy morning where all of her friends and her mother are still alive. As she gets into Glen's convertible to go to school, the top (patterned like Krueger's sweater) suddenly comes down and locks them in as the car drives uncontrollably down the street. Three girls in white dresses playing jump rope are heard chanting Krueger's nursery rhyme as Marge is grabbed by Krueger through the front door window.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\nThe cast of ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' included a crew of veteran actors such as Robert Englund and John Saxon and several aspiring young actors like Johnny Depp and Heather Langenkamp.\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Heather Langenkamp]] as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]]\n* [[John Saxon]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Donald Thompson|Lt.

Craven chose to make Krueger's sweater red and green after reading an article in a 1982 ''[[Scientific American]]'' that said these two colors were the most clashing colors to the human retina.<ref name=\"cinefantastique\"/>\n\nCraven strove to make Krueger different from other horror film villains of the era. \"A lot of the killers were wearing masks: [[Leatherface]], [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]],\" he recalled in 2014. \"I wanted my villain to have a mask, but be able to talk and taunt and threaten. So I thought of him being burned and scarred.\" He also felt the killer should use something other than a knife because it was too common. \"So I thought, 'How about a glove with steak knives?'

I wanted somebody who was an actor rather than a stuntman, somebody who could convey a sense of evil and who was very enthusiastic about getting to an evil state. You really have to get malicious and malevolent and a lot of actors just don't want to get there; their heart isn't in it.

Her mother points out four mysterious slashes on her nightgown. The following morning she is consoled by her best friend, Nancy Thompson, and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz. The two stay at Tina's house when Tina's mother goes out of town, but their sleepover is interrupted by Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane. When Tina falls asleep, she dreams of being chased by the disfigured man. Rod is awoken by Tina's thrashing and sees her dragged and fatally slashed by an unseen force; he flees as Nancy and Glen awaken to find Tina covered in blood and dead.\n\nThe next day, Rod is arrested by Nancy's father, Lieutenant Don Thompson, despite his pleas of innocence. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class. While masquerading as Tina, the man chases her to the boiler room where she is cornered and burns her arm on a pipe. The burn startles her awake in class and she notices a burn mark on her arm. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and is nearly drowned by the man. Nancy goes to Rod at the police station, who tells her about what happened to Tina and his own similar dreams; this makes Nancy believe that the man is responsible for Tina's death.\n\nNancy invites Glen to watch over her as she falls asleep. In her dream, she sees the man prepare to kill Rod in his cell, but then he turns his attention towards her. Nancy runs away and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. The man kills Rod by wrapping bed sheets around his neck like a noose. Nancy and Glen find his body hanging in his cell. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes her dream. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a sleep disorders clinic, where, in a dream, Nancy grabs the man's fedora and pulls it from the dream into reality.\n\nMarge begins to drink and smoke heavily and bars the windows at home. She reveals to Nancy that the man, [[Freddy Krueger|Fred Krueger]] was an insane child murderer who was released on a technicality and then burned alive by Marge, Don, and other parents (who lived on their street) seeking vigilante justice. Nancy realizes that Krueger, now a vengeful ghost, desires revenge and to satiate his psychopathic needs. She tries to call Glen to warn him, but his father prevents her from speaking to him. Glen falls asleep and is sucked into his bed by Krueger, and a large fountain of blood is released in his room. Now alone, Nancy puts Marge to sleep and asks Don, who is across the street investigating Glen's death, to break into the house in twenty minutes. She rigs booby traps around the house, and grabs Krueger out of the dream and into the real world. The booby traps affect Krueger enough that Nancy is able to light him on fire with a Molotov cocktail and lock him in the basement. Nancy rushes to the door for help. The police arrive to find that Krueger has escaped from the basement. Nancy and Don go upstairs to find a burning Krueger smothering Marge in her bedroom. After Don puts out the fire, Krueger and Marge vanish into the bed.\n\nWhen Don leaves the room, Krueger rises from the bed behind Nancy.

It has since been released on [[DVD]], first in 1999 in the United States as part of the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' Collection box set (along with the other six sequels), and once again in a restored Infinifilm special edition in 2006, containing various special features with contributions from Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon and the director of photography.\n\nThe special edition consisted of two DVDs, one with the film picture and sound restored (DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1, and original mono audio track) and another DVD with special features. Along with the restored version of the film, DVD one also had two commentaries, and other nightmares (if not all) from the film's sequels (two through seven and ''Freddy Vs. Jason''). It also included additional, extended or alternate scenes of the film, such as one scene where Marge reveals to Nancy that she had another sibling who was killed by Freddy. These unused clips and scenes were not included or added to the DVD film but could be viewed separately from the DVD's menus.\n\nOn April 13, 2010, the film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] by [[Warner Home Video]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Warner_Brothers/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%281984%29_Announced_for_Blu-ray_/4030 |title=A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)' Announced for Blu-ray |author=High-Def Digest |date=January 7, 2010 <!-- at 01:45 PM ET --> |publisher=High Def Digest |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128032545/http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Warner_Brothers/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%281984%29_Announced_for_Blu-ray_/4030 |archive-date=November 28, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> with all the same extras from the 2006 special edition;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/35246/the-original-a-nightmare-elm-street-coming-blu-ray |title=The Original A Nightmare on Elm Street Coming to Blu-ray! |author=[[Dread Central]] |date=January 7, 2010 |work=Dread Central |accessdate=January 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100110064813/https://dreadcentral.com/news/35246/the-original-a-nightmare-elm-street-coming-blu-ray| archivedate=January 10, 2010| url-status= live}}</ref> a DVD box set containing all of the films up to that point was released on the same day.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/35251/new-elm-street-box-set-coming-wait-until-you-see-cover |title=New Elm Street Box Set Coming!
