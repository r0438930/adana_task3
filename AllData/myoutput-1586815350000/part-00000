Malcolm of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' said that despite some tracks feeling dull and monotonous, he praised Joe for maintaining his New York roots while mixing it with his newfound Miami influence through his performance, concluding that \"Sequels rarely live up to the original, and ''J.O.S.E. 2'' is no exception.
