In the 6th century BCE, the [[mahajanapadas]] emerged in several parts of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe region was the historical centre of the [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]], [[Maurya]], [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]], [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] empires that ruled much of the Indian sub-continent at their prime. In medieval India, it was incorporated into the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and then the [[British Raj|British]] empire. After independence in 1947, the states joined the Indian Union and took their current form after the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956. Today, they continue to face problems of overpopulation, environmental degradation and pervasive corruption despite significant economic and social progress.\n\nAfter the [[Kalinga War]] the Maurya king [[Ashoka]] sent emissaries to spread Buddhism across Asia. The famous university of Nalanda was in [[Bihar]]. Chinese travellers visited Buddhist and Hindu temples and libraries in the universities of Magadha Empire. The Emperor of Kalinga Mahameghavahana Aira [[Kharavela]] was one of the most powerful monarchs of ancient India. The [[Jain]] thirkhankar [[Mahaveer]] was born here and founded [[Jainism]].\n[[File:Konark Sun Temple Front view.jpg|thumb|right|[[Konark Sun Temple]] built by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in [[Odisha]]]]\nIslamic invasions in the 13th century resulted in the collapse of Hindu kings and most Buddhists, especially in [[East Bengal]], converted to Islam. East India including Bihar and West Bengal was part of the Mughal Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries. Odisha remained a powerful Hindu dynasty under the rule of Soma/Keshari Dynasty, Eastern Ganga Dynasty, Surya Dynasty till the end of the 16th century. The mighty [[Nalanda University]] existed at [[Nalanda]] which was destroyed by [[Bakhtiar Khilji]] during the 12th century and also defeated [[Sena Dynasty]]. [[Sher Shah Suri]], who became king of India after defeating [[Humayun]], founded the city of [[Patna]] on the ruins of ancient [[Pataliputra]].\n\n[[Islam]] arrived during the 6th\u20137th century AD and became dominant gradually since the early 13th century with the advent of Muslim rulers as well as [[Sunni]] missionaries such as [[Shah Jalal]] in the region. Later, Muslim rulers, starting from the [[Delhi Sultanate]] initiated the preaching of Islam by building mosques. From the 14th century onward, it was ruled by the [[Bengal Sultanate]], founded by king [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]], beginning a period of the country's economic prosperity and military dominance over the regional empires, which was referred by the Europeans to as the richest country to trade with.<ref>Nanda, J.

The European traders established their trade centres in the famous ports of [[Balasore]], [[Pipili]], [[Palur]] in the Odisha Coast during the rule of the last independent Hindu king Gajapati Prataprudra Dev. The Portuguese were in Chittagong, Dutch in Chinsura, French in Pondicherry and the English founded [[Calcutta]]. In 1756, the [[British East India Company]] defeated the local Indian Muslim rulers in [[Plassey]] and established British Rule in the subcontinent. Its capital Calcutta grew into one of the world's greatest ports. Tea from Calcutta was off-loaded by American separatists in the [[American War of Independence]] in the 1770s. In the 19th century, Calcutta's traders and merchants traded with the rest of the British Empire, continental Europe, the United States and China. Indentured Indian labourers from Bihar, sailed to new homes in [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], [[Guyana]], [[Surinam]] and South Africa.\n\nIndia's independence movement had strong roots in East India. The feudal land system, established through the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, was unpopular among the peasant cultivators and the numerous agricultural labourers found all over Bihar and Bengal (Khetmazdoors). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 started in [[Bengal]]. British war propaganda asserted there were atrocities by the mutinous soldiers in the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]]. Eventually the British prevailed, and Calcutta remained capital of Britain's Asian dominions until 1911. During [[Gandhi]]'s independence movement, the Bihari village of Champaran was an important supporter of non-violent resistance. Great poets of the stature of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] championed the movement for self-rule.\n\nThe Partition also had its roots in undivided Eastern India. The [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was founded in [[Dhaka]] in 1906. In the 1937 provincial elections, it came to power in Bengal in alliance with the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. in 1944, it gained an absolute majority in the Bengal Assembly, and Hussein Suhrawardy became the [[Chief Minister]]. After widespread communal violence during the [[Direct Action Day]] protests in [[Calcutta]], leading to further communal violence across [[British India]], the creation of Pakistan became inevitable. In 1947, further communal violence displaced millions as independence and [[Partition of India|partition]] of British India occurred. Some Bihari and Bengali Muslims fled to the newly created [[East Pakistan]]. Most East Bengal Hindus fled to India.\n\nThe 1950s saw industrial progress in East India. These were cut short with the conflict in neighbouring [[East Pakistan]] and by the [[Communist]] movement at home. In 1971, in the course of Bangladesh's independence struggle, millions of refugees poured into East India. From the turn of the 21st century, [[West Bengal]]'s economic growth has been rapid, and it now ranks as the fourth largest GDP contributor after Maharashtra, according to the [[List of Indian states by GDP]] and is now one of the fastest-growing economies among the states of India.\n\n[[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]] struggled with economic issues during the [[British Raj|British rule]] and in the beginning of [[History of the Republic of India|post independent India]]. But in recent years, these two states have shown impressive growth record and developed steadily. The economic boom since 2005 started to spread new malls, highways, airports and IT office complexes, but not evenly across the region. Jharkhand became a separate state on 15 November 2000. In the modern times, these states have seen rapid transformation and home to several mineral and metal based industries,<ref>{{cite web|author=Govt. of Odisha|url=http://orissaminerals.gov.in/website/StateIndustry.aspx?GL=sip&PL=3|title=Department of Steel and Mines, Government of Odisha, India|publisher=odisha.gov.in|accessdate=26 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616044015/http://www.orissaminerals.gov.in/website/StateIndustry.aspx?GL=sip&PL=3|archivedate=16 June 2016}}</ref> [[Talcher Super Thermal Power Station|coal based thermal powers units]], [[Paradip Refinery|oil refineries]], [[Paradip Port|ports]], textile industries and well established [[Education in Odisha|public and private educational institutes]].

One of the first great universities in recorded history was the ancient [[Nalanda University]] located in Bihar and another institute of higher learning was the ancient [[Puspagiri University]] recently discovered in Odisha. Education in the eastern part of India has seen rapid transformation. Several new educational institutes have been established to cater the needs of students.

The Muslims constitute a very large minority in West Bengal with 27% of the population and 17% in Bihar. Hindus form 94% of total population of Odisha. Christians are the largest minority in Odisha with 3% of the state population\n\n[[Durga]], [[Jagannath]], [[Shiva]] and [[Rama]] are particularly popular [[Hindu]] deities in this region.\n[[Durga]] and [[Kali]] are patron deities of Bengal and Mithila whereas [[Jagannath]] or [[Vishnu]] is patron [[god]] among [[Odia people]]. [[Rama]] and [[Hanuman]] are most revered in Bihar. [[Shiva]] is popular in all areas of eastern states.\n\nAmong tribals of the region [[Hinduism]] is the dominant religion. Some tribals also follow their indigenous religions (Sarana).\nThere are several places of pilgrimage for [[Hinduism]]. [[Puri]] in Odisha is one of the four holy City/Dham of Hindu religion and particularly known for [[Rath Yatra]] festival. [[Bhubaneswar]] is considered to be the \"City of Temples\".[[Konark]] houses an old [[sun temple]].\n\n[[Bihar Sharif]] is an important pilgrimage centre for Muslims all over Bihar.\n\nIn Bihar Village Harinagar Bajrang Bali temple is very famous for Hindu people.\n\n[[Dakshineswar Kali Temple]] is a famous historical [[Kali]] temple in [[West Bengal]]. [[Kalighat Kali Temple]] in [[Kolkata]] is the most important of all [[Shakti Peethas]] in India. [[Belur Math]] in [[Kolkata]] is the headquarters of the Ramkrishna Mission founded by [[Swami Vivekananda]].\n\nIn Bihar, [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] is known for temple for salvation of ancestors. Other places are Sultanganj in [[Bhagalpur]] and [[Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga]] in [[Deoghar]], Jharkhand. [[Bodh Gaya]] is the city sacred to [[Buddhism]]. There are also other cities sacred to [[Jainism|Jains]] in [[Bihar]] and Jharkhand.\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n'''West Bengal'''\n\n[[Bengali cuisine]] is a culinary style originating in [[Bengal]] which is now divided between the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and today's [[Bangladesh]]. Other regions, such as [[Tripura]], and the [[Barak Valley]] region of [[Assam]] (in India) including some parts of  [[Jharkhand]] and [[Bihar]] also have large native [[Bengali people|Bengali]] populations and share this cuisine. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet, Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the [[Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine|French]] cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.\n\nBengali food has inherited a large number of influences, both foreign and pan-Indian, arising from a historical and strong trade links with many parts of the world. Bengal fell under the sway of various Turkic rulers from the early thirteenth century onwards, and was then governed by the British for two centuries (1757\u20131947).\n\n'''Odisha'''\n\n[[Odia cuisine]] refers to the cooking of the eastern [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The flavours are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% of the population of Odisha is [[vegetarian]], and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly [[mustard oil]], but in festivals [[ghee]] is used. ''[[Panch phutana]]'', a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella) is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while ''[[garam masala]]'' (curry powder) and ''haladi'' (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. [[Pakhala]], a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and garlic in major places like [[Puri]] and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners.\n\nOdisha has a culinary tradition spanning centuries if not millennia. The kitchen of the famous [[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Jagannath temple]] in Puri is reputed to be the largest in the world, with a thousand cooks, working around 752 wood-burning clay hearths called ''chulas'', to feed over 10,000 people everyday.\n\n<gallery>\nMacher Jhol.JPG|A traditional Bengali fish meal&nbsp;\u2013 Rice with Macher Jhol (Literally translated to \"Fish's gravy\")\nGreen Jackfruit & Potato Curry - Kolkata 2011-02-11 1000.JPG|Green jackfruit and potato curry, [[Kolkata]]\nFile:Bengali orange rasgulla.jpg| ''[[Kamalabhog]]'' Roshogolla from West Bengal\nFile:Bikalkar rasagola.gif| [[Bikalananda Kar|Bikali Kar]] Rasagola from Odisha\nChenapoda.jpg|[[Chhena Poda]] from Odisha\nRasmalai Secretlondon 09.jpg|[[Rasmalai]], a sweet dish popular in Odisha and West Bengal\nChenagaja.jpg|[[Chhena Gaja]] from Odisha\nBaleswari khaja pheni Oriya cuisine.jpg|[[Khaja]], a sweet dish popular in Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal\nChandrakanti.jpg|[[Chandrakanti]] sweet from Odisha\n</gallery>\n\n'''Bihar'''\n\n[[Bihari cuisine]] is eaten mainly in [[Bihar]], as well as regions where Bihari people have settled namely, [[Jharkhand]], eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]], [[Fiji]], some cities of [[Pakistan]], [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]] and the Caribbean.

It performed during marriage in the house of Bride and groom.\n\n'''Chhau dance (or Chau dance)''' is a form of tribal martial dance originating in [[Mayurbhanj]], the princely state of Odisha. It is also seen in the Indian states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. There are three regional variations of the dance. Seraikella Chau was developed in [[Seraikella]], the administrative head of the [[Seraikela Kharsawan]] district of [[Jharkhand]]; Purulia Chau in [[Purulia district]] of West Bengal; and Mayurbhanj Chau in [[Mayurbhanj district]] of Odisha.\n\n''' [[Ghumura Dance]]'''\nArchaeological evidence shows<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Heroic Dance Ghumura, Edited by Sanjay Kumar, Mahabir Sanskrutika, 2002</ref> cave paintings from the pre-historic period discovered by Gudahandi of [[Kalahandi]] and Yogi Matha of [[Nuapada district]] that represent the Ghumura and Damru, among other instruments. These paintings date to as early as 8000 BCE and from such painting the antiquity of musical instrument Ghumura and Damru can be imagined. The origin of Ghumura goes back to ancient times. There is a beautiful waterfall in the river valley of Indravati which was initially recognised by Chindak Naagas of Chakrakot.<ref>Epigraphica Indica, IX, p. 179</ref> Many believe that Ghumura dance originated from this river valley and gradually spread into the areas between Indravati and Mahanadi, indicating this dance form belongs to the 10th century CE.\n\nThe [[western Odisha]] has also great variety of dance forms unique to Odisha culture. The children's verses are known as \"Chhiollai\", \"Humobauli\" and \"Dauligit\". The adolescent poems are \"Sajani\", \"Chhata\", \"Daika\", \"Bhekani\". The eternal youth composes \"Rasarkeli\", \"Jaiphul\", \"Maila Jada\", \"Bayamana\", \"Gunchikuta\" and \"Dalkhai\". The work-man's poetry comprises \"Karma\" and \"Jhumer\", both pertaining to Lord Vishwakarma and the \"Karamashani\" goddess.

They are performed on a variety of occasions and their rhymes and rhythms change accordingly.\n\nBengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as from the broader Indian dance tradition. Dance forms of Bihar are another expression of rich traditions and ethnic identity. There are several folk dance forms that can keep one enthralled, such as dhobi nach, jhumarnach, manjhi, gondnach, jitiyanach, more morni, dom-domin, bhuiababa, rah baba, kathghorwa nach, jat jatin, launda nach, bamar nach, jharni, jhijhia, natua nach, bidapad nach, sohrai nach, and gond nach.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Rabindra Sangeet}}\n[[File:Rabindranath Tagore Ra-Tha seal initials.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Black-and-white close-up photograph of a piece of wood boldly painted in unmixed solid strokes of black and white in a stylised semblance to \"ro\" and \"tho\" from the Bengali syllabary.]]\n{{Culture of Bengal}}\nRabindra Sangeet, also known as Tagore Songs, are songs written and composed by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

Many singers in [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]] base their entire careers on the singing of Tagore musical masterpieces.

However, Odissi songs were written even before the Odia language developed. Odissi music has a rich legacy dating back to the 2nd century BCE, when king [[Kharvela]], the ruler of Odisha ([[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]) patronised this music and dance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/august-2007/engpdf/Page108-111.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410055911/http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/august-2007/engpdf/Page108-111.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nLike Hindustani and Carnatic systems, Odissi music is a separate system of Indian classical music and is having all the essential as well as potential ingredients of Indian Classical form. But it has not come to limelight due to apathy from the time of British rule in Odisha, want of its proper study, revival, propagation, etc. Despite the fact, the traditional music form could be saved and maintained in its pristine form. Thanks to the musicians particularly of Jaga Akhadas of Puri district, who could develop and maintain the music. The music movement of Odisha, however, took a different turn after independence.\n\nLike other aspects of her culture, music of the sacred land (Odisha) is charming, colourful, variegated encompassing various types. The existing musical tradition of Odisha, the cumulative experience of the last two thousand five hundred years if not more, can broadly be grouped under five categories such as: (1) Tribal Music, (2) Folk Music, (3) Light Music, (4) Light-Classical Music, (5) Classical Music, which need a short elucidations for better understanding the subject in all India context.\n\nThe tribal music as the title signifies is confined to the tribals living mainly in the hilly and jungle regions and sparsely in the coastal belt of Odisha. Odisha has the third largest concentration of tribes constituting about one fourth of the total population.

In the 6th century BCE, the [[mahajanapadas]] emerged in several parts of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe region was the historical centre of the [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]], [[Maurya]], [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]], [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] empires that ruled much of the Indian sub-continent at their prime. In medieval India, it was incorporated into the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and then the [[British Raj|British]] empire. After independence in 1947, the states joined the Indian Union and took their current form after the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956. Today, they continue to face problems of overpopulation, environmental degradation and pervasive corruption despite significant economic and social progress.\n\nAfter the [[Kalinga War]] the Maurya king [[Ashoka]] sent emissaries to spread Buddhism across Asia. The famous university of Nalanda was in [[Bihar]]. Chinese travellers visited Buddhist and Hindu temples and libraries in the universities of Magadha Empire. The Emperor of Kalinga Mahameghavahana Aira [[Kharavela]] was one of the most powerful monarchs of ancient India. The [[Jain]] thirkhankar [[Mahaveer]] was born here and founded [[Jainism]].\n[[File:Konark Sun Temple Front view.jpg|thumb|right|[[Konark Sun Temple]] built by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in [[Odisha]]]]\nIslamic invasions in the 13th century resulted in the collapse of Hindu kings and most Buddhists, especially in [[East Bengal]], converted to Islam. East India including Bihar and West Bengal was part of the Mughal Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries. Odisha remained a powerful Hindu dynasty under the rule of Soma/Keshari Dynasty, Eastern Ganga Dynasty, Surya Dynasty till the end of the 16th century. The mighty [[Nalanda University]] existed at [[Nalanda]] which was destroyed by [[Bakhtiar Khilji]] during the 12th century and also defeated [[Sena Dynasty]]. [[Sher Shah Suri]], who became king of India after defeating [[Humayun]], founded the city of [[Patna]] on the ruins of ancient [[Pataliputra]].\n\n[[Islam]] arrived during the 6th\u20137th century AD and became dominant gradually since the early 13th century with the advent of Muslim rulers as well as [[Sunni]] missionaries such as [[Shah Jalal]] in the region. Later, Muslim rulers, starting from the [[Delhi Sultanate]] initiated the preaching of Islam by building mosques. From the 14th century onward, it was ruled by the [[Bengal Sultanate]], founded by king [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]], beginning a period of the country's economic prosperity and military dominance over the regional empires, which was referred by the Europeans to as the richest country to trade with.<ref>Nanda, J.

The European traders established their trade centres in the famous ports of [[Balasore]], [[Pipili]], [[Palur]] in the Odisha Coast during the rule of the last independent Hindu king Gajapati Prataprudra Dev. The Portuguese were in Chittagong, Dutch in Chinsura, French in Pondicherry and the English founded [[Calcutta]]. In 1756, the [[British East India Company]] defeated the local Indian Muslim rulers in [[Plassey]] and established British Rule in the subcontinent. Its capital Calcutta grew into one of the world's greatest ports. Tea from Calcutta was off-loaded by American separatists in the [[American War of Independence]] in the 1770s. In the 19th century, Calcutta's traders and merchants traded with the rest of the British Empire, continental Europe, the United States and China. Indentured Indian labourers from Bihar, sailed to new homes in [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], [[Guyana]], [[Surinam]] and South Africa.\n\nIndia's independence movement had strong roots in East India. The feudal land system, established through the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, was unpopular among the peasant cultivators and the numerous agricultural labourers found all over Bihar and Bengal (Khetmazdoors). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 started in [[Bengal]]. British war propaganda asserted there were atrocities by the mutinous soldiers in the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]]. Eventually the British prevailed, and Calcutta remained capital of Britain's Asian dominions until 1911. During [[Gandhi]]'s independence movement, the Bihari village of Champaran was an important supporter of non-violent resistance. Great poets of the stature of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] championed the movement for self-rule.\n\nThe Partition also had its roots in undivided Eastern India. The [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was founded in [[Dhaka]] in 1906. In the 1937 provincial elections, it came to power in Bengal in alliance with the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. in 1944, it gained an absolute majority in the Bengal Assembly, and Hussein Suhrawardy became the [[Chief Minister]]. After widespread communal violence during the [[Direct Action Day]] protests in [[Calcutta]], leading to further communal violence across [[British India]], the creation of Pakistan became inevitable. In 1947, further communal violence displaced millions as independence and [[Partition of India|partition]] of British India occurred. Some Bihari and Bengali Muslims fled to the newly created [[East Pakistan]]. Most East Bengal Hindus fled to India.\n\nThe 1950s saw industrial progress in East India. These were cut short with the conflict in neighbouring [[East Pakistan]] and by the [[Communist]] movement at home. In 1971, in the course of Bangladesh's independence struggle, millions of refugees poured into East India. From the turn of the 21st century, [[West Bengal]]'s economic growth has been rapid, and it now ranks as the fourth largest GDP contributor after Maharashtra, according to the [[List of Indian states by GDP]] and is now one of the fastest-growing economies among the states of India.\n\n[[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]] struggled with economic issues during the [[British Raj|British rule]] and in the beginning of [[History of the Republic of India|post independent India]]. But in recent years, these two states have shown impressive growth record and developed steadily. The economic boom since 2005 started to spread new malls, highways, airports and IT office complexes, but not evenly across the region. Jharkhand became a separate state on 15 November 2000. In the modern times, these states have seen rapid transformation and home to several mineral and metal based industries,<ref>{{cite web|author=Govt. of Odisha|url=http://orissaminerals.gov.in/website/StateIndustry.aspx?GL=sip&PL=3|title=Department of Steel and Mines, Government of Odisha, India|publisher=odisha.gov.in|accessdate=26 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616044015/http://www.orissaminerals.gov.in/website/StateIndustry.aspx?GL=sip&PL=3|archivedate=16 June 2016}}</ref> [[Talcher Super Thermal Power Station|coal based thermal powers units]], [[Paradip Refinery|oil refineries]], [[Paradip Port|ports]], textile industries and well established [[Education in Odisha|public and private educational institutes]].

One of the first great universities in recorded history was the ancient [[Nalanda University]] located in Bihar and another institute of higher learning was the ancient [[Puspagiri University]] recently discovered in Odisha.

The Muslims constitute a very large minority in West Bengal with 27% of the population and 17% in Bihar. Hindus form 94% of total population of Odisha. Christians are the largest minority in Odisha with 3% of the state population\n\n[[Durga]], [[Jagannath]], [[Shiva]] and [[Rama]] are particularly popular [[Hindu]] deities in this region.\n[[Durga]] and [[Kali]] are patron deities of Bengal and Mithila whereas [[Jagannath]] or [[Vishnu]] is patron [[god]] among [[Odia people]]. [[Rama]] and [[Hanuman]] are most revered in Bihar. [[Shiva]] is popular in all areas of eastern states.\n\nAmong tribals of the region [[Hinduism]] is the dominant religion. Some tribals also follow their indigenous religions (Sarana).\nThere are several places of pilgrimage for [[Hinduism]]. [[Puri]] in Odisha is one of the four holy City/Dham of Hindu religion and particularly known for [[Rath Yatra]] festival. [[Bhubaneswar]] is considered to be the \"City of Temples\".[[Konark]] houses an old [[sun temple]].\n\n[[Bihar Sharif]] is an important pilgrimage centre for Muslims all over Bihar.\n\nIn Bihar Village Harinagar Bajrang Bali temple is very famous for Hindu people.\n\n[[Dakshineswar Kali Temple]] is a famous historical [[Kali]] temple in [[West Bengal]]. [[Kalighat Kali Temple]] in [[Kolkata]] is the most important of all [[Shakti Peethas]] in India. [[Belur Math]] in [[Kolkata]] is the headquarters of the Ramkrishna Mission founded by [[Swami Vivekananda]].\n\nIn Bihar, [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] is known for temple for salvation of ancestors. Other places are Sultanganj in [[Bhagalpur]] and [[Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga]] in [[Deoghar]], Jharkhand. [[Bodh Gaya]] is the city sacred to [[Buddhism]]. There are also other cities sacred to [[Jainism|Jains]] in [[Bihar]] and Jharkhand.\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n'''West Bengal'''\n\n[[Bengali cuisine]] is a culinary style originating in [[Bengal]] which is now divided between the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and today's [[Bangladesh]]. Other regions, such as [[Tripura]], and the [[Barak Valley]] region of [[Assam]] (in India) including some parts of  [[Jharkhand]] and [[Bihar]] also have large native [[Bengali people|Bengali]] populations and share this cuisine. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet, Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the [[Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine|French]] cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.\n\nBengali food has inherited a large number of influences, both foreign and pan-Indian, arising from a historical and strong trade links with many parts of the world. Bengal fell under the sway of various Turkic rulers from the early thirteenth century onwards, and was then governed by the British for two centuries (1757\u20131947).\n\n'''Odisha'''\n\n[[Odia cuisine]] refers to the cooking of the eastern [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The flavours are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% of the population of Odisha is [[vegetarian]], and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly [[mustard oil]], but in festivals [[ghee]] is used. ''[[Panch phutana]]'', a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella) is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while ''[[garam masala]]'' (curry powder) and ''haladi'' (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. [[Pakhala]], a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and garlic in major places like [[Puri]] and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners.\n\nOdisha has a culinary tradition spanning centuries if not millennia. The kitchen of the famous [[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Jagannath temple]] in Puri is reputed to be the largest in the world, with a thousand cooks, working around 752 wood-burning clay hearths called ''chulas'', to feed over 10,000 people everyday.\n\n<gallery>\nMacher Jhol.JPG|A traditional Bengali fish meal&nbsp;\u2013 Rice with Macher Jhol (Literally translated to \"Fish's gravy\")\nGreen Jackfruit & Potato Curry - Kolkata 2011-02-11 1000.JPG|Green jackfruit and potato curry, [[Kolkata]]\nFile:Bengali orange rasgulla.jpg| ''[[Kamalabhog]]'' Roshogolla from West Bengal\nFile:Bikalkar rasagola.gif| [[Bikalananda Kar|Bikali Kar]] Rasagola from Odisha\nChenapoda.jpg|[[Chhena Poda]] from Odisha\nRasmalai Secretlondon 09.jpg|[[Rasmalai]], a sweet dish popular in Odisha and West Bengal\nChenagaja.jpg|[[Chhena Gaja]] from Odisha\nBaleswari khaja pheni Oriya cuisine.jpg|[[Khaja]], a sweet dish popular in Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal\nChandrakanti.jpg|[[Chandrakanti]] sweet from Odisha\n</gallery>\n\n'''Bihar'''\n\n[[Bihari cuisine]] is eaten mainly in [[Bihar]], as well as regions where Bihari people have settled namely, [[Jharkhand]], eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]], [[Fiji]], some cities of [[Pakistan]], [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]] and the Caribbean.

It performed during marriage in the house of Bride and groom.\n\n'''Chhau dance (or Chau dance)''' is a form of tribal martial dance originating in [[Mayurbhanj]], the princely state of Odisha. It is also seen in the Indian states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. There are three regional variations of the dance. Seraikella Chau was developed in [[Seraikella]], the administrative head of the [[Seraikela Kharsawan]] district of [[Jharkhand]]; Purulia Chau in [[Purulia district]] of West Bengal; and Mayurbhanj Chau in [[Mayurbhanj district]] of Odisha.\n\n''' [[Ghumura Dance]]'''\nArchaeological evidence shows<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Heroic Dance Ghumura, Edited by Sanjay Kumar, Mahabir Sanskrutika, 2002</ref> cave paintings from the pre-historic period discovered by Gudahandi of [[Kalahandi]] and Yogi Matha of [[Nuapada district]] that represent the Ghumura and Damru, among other instruments. These paintings date to as early as 8000 BCE and from such painting the antiquity of musical instrument Ghumura and Damru can be imagined. The origin of Ghumura goes back to ancient times. There is a beautiful waterfall in the river valley of Indravati which was initially recognised by Chindak Naagas of Chakrakot.<ref>Epigraphica Indica, IX, p. 179</ref> Many believe that Ghumura dance originated from this river valley and gradually spread into the areas between Indravati and Mahanadi, indicating this dance form belongs to the 10th century CE.\n\nThe [[western Odisha]] has also great variety of dance forms unique to Odisha culture. The children's verses are known as \"Chhiollai\", \"Humobauli\" and \"Dauligit\". The adolescent poems are \"Sajani\", \"Chhata\", \"Daika\", \"Bhekani\". The eternal youth composes \"Rasarkeli\", \"Jaiphul\", \"Maila Jada\", \"Bayamana\", \"Gunchikuta\" and \"Dalkhai\". The work-man's poetry comprises \"Karma\" and \"Jhumer\", both pertaining to Lord Vishwakarma and the \"Karamashani\" goddess.

They are performed on a variety of occasions and their rhymes and rhythms change accordingly.\n\nBengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as from the broader Indian dance tradition. Dance forms of Bihar are another expression of rich traditions and ethnic identity. There are several folk dance forms that can keep one enthralled, such as dhobi nach, jhumarnach, manjhi, gondnach, jitiyanach, more morni, dom-domin, bhuiababa, rah baba, kathghorwa nach, jat jatin, launda nach, bamar nach, jharni, jhijhia, natua nach, bidapad nach, sohrai nach, and gond nach.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Rabindra Sangeet}}\n[[File:Rabindranath Tagore Ra-Tha seal initials.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Black-and-white close-up photograph of a piece of wood boldly painted in unmixed solid strokes of black and white in a stylised semblance to \"ro\" and \"tho\" from the Bengali syllabary.]]\n{{Culture of Bengal}}\nRabindra Sangeet, also known as Tagore Songs, are songs written and composed by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

Many singers in [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]] base their entire careers on the singing of Tagore musical masterpieces.

However, Odissi songs were written even before the Odia language developed.

The existing musical tradition of Odisha, the cumulative experience of the last two thousand five hundred years if not more, can broadly be grouped under five categories such as: (1) Tribal Music, (2) Folk Music, (3) Light Music, (4) Light-Classical Music, (5) Classical Music, which need a short elucidations for better understanding the subject in all India context.\n\nThe tribal music as the title signifies is confined to the tribals living mainly in the hilly and jungle regions and sparsely in the coastal belt of Odisha. Odisha has the third largest concentration of tribes constituting about one fourth of the total population. They are distributed over 62 tribal communities.\n\nOdisha is the treasure house of Folk Songs which are sung on different festivals and specific occasions in their own enjoyment. Folk music in general is the expression of the ethos and mores of the folk communities. Of the bewildering variety of folk music of Odisha, mention may be made of Geeta, Balipuja Geeta, Kela Keluni Geeta, Dalkhai Geeta, Kendra Geeta, Jaiphula Geeta, Ghumura Geeta, Ghoda Nacha and Danda Nacha Geeta, Gopal Ugala and Osa-Parva-Geeta etc.\n\nBhajan, Janan, Oriya songs based on ragas, Rangila Chaupadi etc. are grouped under Light classical music, which forms an important segment of Oriya music. Sri Geetagovinda, Anirjukta Pravadha, Divya Manusi Prabandha, Chautisa, Chhanda, Chaupadi (now known as Odissi), Champu, Malasri, Sariman, nVyanjani, Chaturang, Tribhang, Kuduka Geeta, Laxana and Swaramalika are the various sub-forms, which individually or collectively constitute the traditional [[Odissi music]]. These sub-forms of the traditional Odissi music, can be categorised under the classical music of Odisha.\n\n==Sports==\n\nThe [[East Zone cricket team]] is a [[first class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]] team that represents Eastern India in the [[Duleep Trophy]] and [[Deodhar Trophy]].
