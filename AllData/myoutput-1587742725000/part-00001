After the boys perform this prank on stage at a [[Colorado Republican caucuses, 2012|2012 Colorado]] [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|Republican Presidential Debate]], the entire fourth grade class of South Park Elementary is required to take a safety education class in which Professor Lamont teaches them the dangers of memetic trends with a [[Red Asphalt|graphic educational video]] showing people dying gruesome deaths when they are hit by [[train]]s while \"[[Tebowing]]\". Despite this, and a report by the ''[[Denver Post]]'' that Faith Hilling is considered pass\u00e9 and has been replaced with the newer trend of dragging one's nude buttocks across the floor or ground, or \"[[Taylor Swift]]ing\", Stan and his friends continue Faith Hilling, even coming into conflict with Taylor Swifters.\n\nProfessor Lamont is then informed by two unidentified men of a new Internet meme being practiced by another species: photos of cats with their heads poking through slices of bread. Lamont sees this as evidence that cats are evolving to become as intelligent as humans. This is a reference to Chapter eleven of Richard Dawkins book on evolution, [[The Selfish Gene]], in which he suggests ideas, or as he calls them \"memes\", are the new replicators and a new kind of evolution. As this and newer memes continue to emerge among both people and cats, which in some instances results in the deaths of participants, the boys continue Faith Hilling, but after taunts and jeers by spectators, they are eventually forced, one by one, to come to terms with the fact that doing so is no longer in style.\n\nAt the same time, Lamont and other humans attempt to communicate with the cats, which are now apparently [[talking animals#Cats|capable of speech]]; the humans feel this represents a danger to mankind and will eventually lead to war between the two species.\n\nThe boys attempt to remain current by participating in newer memes, including one that combines elements from previous memes and involves dragging one's nude buttocks across the floor while holding a cat with its head poking through a slice of bread. The boys attempt to perform this stunt at another Colorado Republican debate, but after Cartman storms the stage with his cat, he finds himself unable to continue, seeing that it is beneath him to adopt a meme simply because it is new. He aborts the intended prank, and instead takes a stand by doing what he really wants. He pulls his shirt out to simulate breasts, and begins to sing a number that spurs both the crowd and the Republicans ([[Rick Santorum]], [[Mitt Romney]], and [[Newt Gingrich]]) to join him in a massive act of group Faith Hilling.\n\nThe episode concludes with a reporter claiming that the messages behind these latest memes is unclear, but it does not matter as long as audiences are given a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with breasts, a practice known as \"[[Pandering (politics)|pandering]]\". As he goes on about the practice of \"[[Journalism|reporting]]\", a [[train]] appears out of nowhere and immediately kills him.\n\n== Reception ==\nEric Goldman of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 7/10 \"Good\" rating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/29/south-park-faith-hilling-review|title=South Park: \"Faith Hilling\" Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=2012-03-28|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref> Ryan McGee of ''[[The A.V.
