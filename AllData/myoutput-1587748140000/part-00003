The company was formed by Stoklasa in 2004 while living in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], but is based in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as of 2011. It attracted significant attention in 2009 through Stoklasa's 70-minute video review of the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''. The review was posted in seven parts on [[YouTube]], and was presented by his character \"Harry S. Plinkett\". While Stoklasa had published other video reviews of several [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]] before that, his ''The Phantom Menace'' and subsequent [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel]] reviews were praised for both content and presentation.\n\nNumerous other series have been produced by RedLetterMedia, including several review-based web series (''Half in the Bag'', ''Best of the Worst'', and ''re:View''), short comedies (''The Nerd Crew'') and [[web series]] (''The Grabowskis''). Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and Red Letter Media affiliates have been largely horror and comedy, such as ''Feeding Frenzy'', ''The Recovered'', ''Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant'' and ''[[Space Cop]]''. Alongside Stoklasa and Bauman, Red Letter Media also employs Rich Evans as a full-time actor and stagehand for their projects. Stoklasa, Bauman, Evans and friends Jack Packard, Josh Davis and Jessi Nakles appear as cast members for the vast majority of their releases.\n\n==Mr. Plinkett {{anchor|Mr. Plinkett}}==\nStoklasa created his first video review for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' after watching the film again in 2008. Stoklasa believed his own voice sounded \"too boring\" for the review and adopted the persona of Harry S. Plinkett, a character he had previously used in several short films (originally played by Rich Evans).<ref name=\"popmatters\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/122310-red-letter-medias-fresh-spin-on-the-crazed-youtube-reviewer/ | title = RedLetterMedia's Spin on the Crazed YouTube Reviewer | magazine = [[PopMatters]] | date = March 16, 2010 | accessdate = March 16, 2010 | first = L.B. | last = Jefferies }}</ref> The character first appeared in ''You're Invited!

He demonstrates this by asking his friends to describe characters from the original trilogy and ''Phantom Menace'' without referring to the characters' physical appearances or occupations. Juxtaposed with the colorful personality descriptions they give for the characters [[Han Solo]] and [[C-3PO]], Stoklasa's friends are unable to come up with similarly definite descriptions for the ''Phantom Menace'' characters [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].<ref name=\"dailybeast\"/><ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa believes that many of the decisions made by Jinn's character are highly questionable.<ref name=\"cinemablend\"/> He further suggests that the character is entirely unnecessary to the plot and overall story save to have a final climactic lightsaber battle.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> He notes Lucas' attempt to add more concurrent plot elements in each of the successive ''Star Wars'' films, which he refers to as \"The Ending Multiplication Effect\".<ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa then illustrates the chaotic and confusing nature of ending the film by pulling together four concurrent plot threads, each with a radically different tone, unclear objectives, and an overall lack of proper character motivation.\n\n===Reception===\nStoklasa's reviews have been considered part of an emerging art form that hybridize [[mashup (video)|mashup]] with video essays, as they use a combination of footage from the movie in question and other related sources.\n\nLiterary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that Plinkett enacts a kind of ''[[d\u00e9tournement]]'' by recontextualizing images that would otherwise serve as ''Star Wars'' marketing material (such as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews). Defined by [[Guy Debord]] as \"the reuse of preexisting artistic elements in a new ensemble\", ''d\u00e9tournement'' is a way of generating meaning out of cultural texts that is antithetical to their original intent.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 109|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Kirbach argues that Stoklasa uses this tactic to construct a subversive narrative that frames George Lucas as \"a lazy, out-of-touch, and thoroughly unchallenged filmmaker\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 108|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nKirbach also argues that Plinkett's popularity can be explained, in part, as a form of [[catharsis]]. Because he is portrayed as insane, the Plinkett shtick \"legitimates our nerd-rage by literalizing it\".<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\">{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 112|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Plinkett enrolls George Lucas in an ongoing [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] drama as the castrating father figure, a father figure we are invited to rage against owing to his flagrant ineptitude. But aside from raw catharsis, Kirbach claims that Plinkett's insanity is also a critique of the film industry itself. By fictionalizing his critic, Stoklasa constructs a character who is unable to speak at a safe distance from the text he analyzes. \"Plinkett becomes the figure of a consumer culture that has been force-fed Hollywood schlock beyond its carrying capacity,\" Kirbach writes.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 111|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> And further:\n\n{{quote|Stoklasa's major conceit\u2014that someone would have to be \"crazy\" to watch movies the way Plinkett does\u2014also implies a barely hidden inverse: that the film industry has induced a consumerist fantasy in people who ''don't'' watch movies this way. Plinkett's obscenity and jokiness are without a doubt designed to garner viewership, but they are also Stoklasa's apology for\u2014or defense against\u2014a culture that already construes his level of passion as pathological. This central irony leads us to question what is actually more insane: the consumer who rejects the expressions of a massive culture industry, or the massive culture industry itself. Plinkett satirizes the kind of consumer such a system generates: psychotic, sexist, homicidal.<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] noted that the Mr. Plinkett reviews are an example of \"amazing film scholarship\" on the ''Star Wars'' prequels that demonstrate how much of the ''Star Wars'' universe is squandered by them.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/patton-oswalt-silver-screen-fiend-interview | title = Patton Oswalt on Movie Addiction, Star Wars, and the One Film He'd Watch on Loop | first = Jennifer | last = Wood | date = January 27, 2015 | accessdate = January 27, 2015 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called the reviews \"legendary\" and described them as being more popular than the actual films.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/george-lucas-movies-hate-defence/ |title=Why it's time to stop hating George Lucas |work= The Daily Telegraph |first=Chris|last=Bell|date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate= December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the reviews have also been criticized by ''Star Wars'' fans.

Among the low-budget features Stoklasa and Bauman have produced and directed on Red Letter Media are the action-comedy film ''[[Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant]]'', made in 2005 and available on [[Netflix]]<ref name=\"heeb\" /> (currently only available for DVD rental, not for streaming); ''The Recovered'', a horror thriller starring [[Tina Krause]]; and ''Feeding Frenzy'', a 2010 [[genre]]-[[parody|spoof]] of puppet monster movies like ''[[Gremlins]]''. ''Feeding Frenzy'' featured Rich Evans as Mr. Plinkett; Evans originated the character in short films, and this feature was filmed before the popularity of the ''Phantom Menace'' review.<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> Stoklasa's short films are usually dark comedies. Plinkett, played by Evans, appeared in several of them, starting with \"You're Invited\".\n\nStoklasa created and starred in five seasons of the web sitcom ''The Grabowskis'', opposite Dixie Jacobs, about an exaggeratedly trashy and unpleasant sitcom family. Installments of the series were only a few seconds long at first (comically giving more screen time to the lengthy intro than the episode itself), but grew to full episode length over time.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the company announced via a short video that it had completed the feature-length film ''[[Space Cop]]'', which had been in production for at least seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redlettermedia.com/shorts/space-cop-trailer/|title=Space Cop Trailer #1 - Red Letter Media|website=redlettermedia.com}}</ref> ''Space Cop'' stars Evans in the titular role alongside Stoklasa, who wrote and directed the film. It was made available on January 12, 2016, on Blu-ray for $25 through Red Letter Media's [[Bandcamp]] page. The first run sold out in a matter of hours.\n\n==''Half in the Bag''==\n''Half in the Bag'' is a regularly released series in which Stoklasa and Bauman review films in a more traditional format, albeit with a haphazard and [[Fourth wall|fourth wall breaking]] overarching plot. Stoklasa has described it as a cross between ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert]]'' and a 1980s [[sitcom]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, with himself and Bauman playing [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] repairmen who discuss movies whilst finding increasingly convoluted ways of avoiding their scheduled repair work on Mr. Plinkett's VCR.\n\nThe show often features Plinkett portrayed by Evans. Fans often call this iteration of the character \"Fake Plinkett\", but Stoklasa has noted that Evans was the first person to portray Plinkett, with Stoklasa's later portrayal based on Evans's performance. [[Tim Heidecker]], who hosts a satirical movie review show ''[[On Cinema]]'', makes a cameo in episode 37 as the owner of the VCR repair shop who bequeaths employment to Jay and Mike.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1C7UCMmF5g |title=Half in the Bag: Episode 37 - Special guest star Tim Heidecker |last=RedLetterMedia |date=2012-08-07 |access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nStoklasa stated that this series would not replace the Plinkett reviews. The first episode premiered on March 12, 2011, with a review of ''[[Drive Angry]]'' and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.\n\n[[Graham Linehan]] praised Red Letter Media in an interview with [[United Kingdom|British]] comedian and writer [[Richard Herring]] on ''[[Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast]]''.

Panels typically consist of any combination of Mike Stoklasa, Jay Bauman, Rich Evans, Jessi Nakles, Jack Packard, Josh \"The Wizard\" Davis, or special guests. Panel participants then individually decide upon which film or video represents the \"Best of the Worst\". Viewing material that is deemed to be insulting, offensive, or especially poor is often destroyed in a creative fashion. Methods of destruction have included dissolving a VHS tape in [[acetone]], forcing a DVD through a [[paper shredder]], dragging a tape around the streets tied to the bumper of a car, and cooking a tape on a charcoal grill alongside cheeseburgers.\n\nCanadian visual effects artists Colin Cunningham and Jim Maxwell, who have worked on numerous television series' and feature films, frequently appear as recurring guests. Special guests on the show have included screenwriters [[Max Landis]] and [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], comic book artist [[Freddie Williams II|Freddie Williams]], actors [[Macaulay Culkin]] and [[Patton Oswalt]], comedian Gillian Bellinger and indie film auteur Len Kabasinski.\n\nSome episodes feature the \"Wheel of the Worst\", in which a wheel is spun to select which films/videos will be watched.<ref name=\"MakeUseOf\"/> Wheel selections are often videos that are either extremely bizarre (such as \"Dog Sitter\", a movie made to appeal to dogs), low budget instructional films, educational films and those which have little modern relevance (such as Chinese-language instructional tapes about how to use [[AOL]]). Videos featured on Wheel of the Worst are most frequently found on VHS tapes. The ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' praised ''Best of the Worst'' for being Red Letter Media's most entertaining series.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140117/entlife/701179987/|title= Hibernating? Chill out with offbeat shows, DVDs |newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |author=Sean Stangland |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe show occasionally features other gimmicks to randomly select viewing material such as the \"Choose-And-Lose\" and the [[Plinko|Plinketto Board]]. Another subsection of Best of the Worst includes the \"Black Spine Edition\" where the group randomly selects VHS tapes which are missing informational or identification labels on the side of the cassette.\n\nSometimes the crew will review a specific film which they have previously viewed off camera and recommend to fans of poorly-conceived and poorly-executed [[B movie]]s. They refer to reviews of this nature as their \"Spotlight Series\". The first of these reviews featured the film ''Hollywood Cop'' by director [[Amir Shervan]] was released on YouTube on June 21, 2017. In this format, low budget indie movies ''Suburban Sasquatch'', ''Lycan Colony'' and ''The Last Vampire on Earth'' have also been featured.\n\nIn 2019, the crew introduced a 'Hall of Fame' for Best of the Worst, intended to represent the best things that have appeared on the show. There have only been three additions to the hall of fame thus far; actor [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and low-budget films ''Surviving Edged Weapons'' and ''[[Creating Rem Lezar]]''.\n\n==''re:View''==\nOn May 24, 2016, the company released the first episode of a new series called ''re:View''. Compared to the company's other shows, the format is a much more stripped down and straight forward approach to film critique. Two members of Red Letter Media sit in front of a red curtain and offer thoughts and insight on a film that they both enjoy. Films chosen for this feature are often either [[cult film|cult classics]] such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' and ''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'', or well renowned genre-defining films like ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. Clips of the film being discussed are interwoven, typically to lend emphasis to a specific point being made, or to showcase some of the most memorable moments from the film. ''re:View'' has also featured ''[[Star Trek]]'' films and episodes, a particular favorite of Stoklasa's.\n\nFor an episode featuring ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', the screenwriter of the film, [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], appeared as a guest and spoke about many behind the scenes aspects of the production. A similar insight into the background of a film the Red Letter Media crew enjoyed was shared in a two-part interview series with ''[[Samurai Cop]]'' lead [[Matt Hannon]], though this occurred prior to the creation of the ''re:View'' branding and format. Former child star [[Macaulay Culkin]] made a guest appearance in a 2018 episode reviewing ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'', and has continued to recur in both this series as well as Best of the Worst.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM7_oyCZqj0|title=Hackers - reView|first=|last=RedLetterMedia|date=5 November 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/macaulay-culkin-ueberraschender-auftritt-bei-youtube-kritikern-1144705/|title=Macaulay Culkin: \u00dcberraschender Auftritt bei YouTube-Kritikern|date=24 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Nerd Crew: A Pop Culture Podcast''==\nThe first episode being uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 5 January 2017, ''The Nerd Crew'' parodies [[pop culture]] \"[[fanboyism]]\" and video series such as [[Screen Junkies]], [[Collider (website)|Collider]], and [[John Campea|''The John Campea Show'']], with Stoklasa, Bauman and Evans playing \"[[wikt:man child|manchild]]ren\" demonstrating excessive enthusiasm over ''[[Star Wars]]'', the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and other content aimed primarily at a juvenile audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/05/the-frenzied-fraud-of-forced-fandom/|title=The Frenzied Fraud of Forced Fandom|date=1 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref> [[Product placement]], [[native advertising]] and general subservience to entertainment mega-corporations are all satirized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/diese-drei-filmnerds-zerstoeren-rogue-one-und-disney-mit-nur-einem-youtube-video-736791/|title=Diese drei Filmnerds zerst\u00f6ren \"Rogue One\" und Disney mit nur einem YouTube-Video|date=9 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinokadr.ru/blog/2017/12/16/5411.shtml|title=5 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438: \"\u0413\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\", \"\u0425\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0446\u044b\", \"\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\" \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0438 \u0427\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438|website=kinokadr.ru}}</ref>\n\n== Commentary tracks ==\nSince 2012, Red Letter Media has produced commentary tracks for various films, releasing them on [[Bandcamp]].<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\">{{Cite web|url=https://redlettermedia.bandcamp.com/audio|title=Red Letter Media commentary tracks|last=|first=|date=|website=Red Letter Media|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-25}}</ref> These began with three commentary tracks by Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett, but the company has since released tracks by Stoklasa, Bauman, and Evans as themselves.\n\n;Commentary tracks (listed in order of release)<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\"/>\n{{div col}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''\n*''[[Samurai Cop]]''\n*''[[Ghostbusters II]]''\n*''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''\n*''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''\n*''[[The Terminator]]''\n*''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''\n*''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''\n*''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''\n*''[[Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]''\n*''[[Gremlins]]''\n*''[[Rogue One]]''\n*''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]''\n*''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (film)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[Jingle All the Way]]''\n*''[[Army of Darkness]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==''Previously Recorded''==\nIn July 2014, Red Letter Media affiliates Rich Evans and Jack Packard began a YouTube Video game review channel under the name ''Previously Recorded'' or ''Pre-Rec''.

The company was formed by Stoklasa in 2004 while living in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], but is based in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as of 2011. It attracted significant attention in 2009 through Stoklasa's 70-minute video review of the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''. The review was posted in seven parts on [[YouTube]], and was presented by his character \"Harry S. Plinkett\". While Stoklasa had published other video reviews of several [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]] before that, his ''The Phantom Menace'' and subsequent [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel]] reviews were praised for both content and presentation.\n\nNumerous other series have been produced by RedLetterMedia, including several review-based web series (''Half in the Bag'', ''Best of the Worst'', and ''re:View''), short comedies (''The Nerd Crew'') and [[web series]] (''The Grabowskis''). Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and Red Letter Media affiliates have been largely horror and comedy, such as ''Feeding Frenzy'', ''The Recovered'', ''Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant'' and ''[[Space Cop]]''. Alongside Stoklasa and Bauman, Red Letter Media also employs Rich Evans as a full-time actor and stagehand for their projects. Stoklasa, Bauman, Evans and friends Jack Packard, Josh Davis and Jessi Nakles appear as cast members for the vast majority of their releases.\n\n==Mr. Plinkett {{anchor|Mr. Plinkett}}==\nStoklasa created his first video review for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' after watching the film again in 2008. Stoklasa believed his own voice sounded \"too boring\" for the review and adopted the persona of Harry S. Plinkett, a character he had previously used in several short films (originally played by Rich Evans).<ref name=\"popmatters\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/122310-red-letter-medias-fresh-spin-on-the-crazed-youtube-reviewer/ | title = RedLetterMedia's Spin on the Crazed YouTube Reviewer | magazine = [[PopMatters]] | date = March 16, 2010 | accessdate = March 16, 2010 | first = L.B. | last = Jefferies }}</ref> The character first appeared in ''You're Invited!

After that, he would write a 20-30 page script for it in the Plinkett character, voice it, and edit it together along with some improvisations.<ref name=\"gp-interview\">{{cite web |url=http://geekpropaganda.net/?p=1100 |title=Red Letter Media's Mike Stoklasa |publisher=geekpropaganda.net |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210112234/http://geekpropaganda.net/?p=1100 |archivedate=February 10, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n'''''The Phantom Menace'''''\n\nStoklasa's review of ''The Phantom Menace'' was published to YouTube on December 10, 2009, and quickly became popular, receiving over 5 million views since its release.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> The video was widely linked to by many people across the internet, including celebrities such as [[Damon Lindelof]] and [[Simon Pegg]].<ref name=\"popmatters\"/><ref name=\"cinemablend\">{{cite web | url =http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Epic-70-Minute-Review-Of-Star-Wars-The-Phantom-Menace-16207.html | title = Epic 70-Minute Review Of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace | publisher = Cinema Blend | date = December 17, 2009 | accessdate =March 17, 2010 | first = Eric | last = Eisenberg }}</ref> In comparison to his earlier ''Star Trek'' movie reviews, which lasted 30 to 40 minutes, the ''Phantom Menace'' review had a total run time of approximately 70 minutes.<ref name=\"cinemablend\"/> The review took between seven and ten days to complete.<ref name=\"heeb\">{{cite web | url = http://www.heebmagazine.com/man-behind-epic-_phantom-menace_-review-speaks/ | title = Man Behind Epic Phantom Menace Review Speaks | work = [[Heeb (magazine)|Heeb]] | author=Abrams, Brian | date = January 4, 2010 | accessdate = March 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n{{By whom|date=July 2017}} Stoklasa believes that the film has no real protagonist or strong characters in general. He demonstrates this by asking his friends to describe characters from the original trilogy and ''Phantom Menace'' without referring to the characters' physical appearances or occupations. Juxtaposed with the colorful personality descriptions they give for the characters [[Han Solo]] and [[C-3PO]], Stoklasa's friends are unable to come up with similarly definite descriptions for the ''Phantom Menace'' characters [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].<ref name=\"dailybeast\"/><ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa believes that many of the decisions made by Jinn's character are highly questionable.<ref name=\"cinemablend\"/> He further suggests that the character is entirely unnecessary to the plot and overall story save to have a final climactic lightsaber battle.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> He notes Lucas' attempt to add more concurrent plot elements in each of the successive ''Star Wars'' films, which he refers to as \"The Ending Multiplication Effect\".<ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa then illustrates the chaotic and confusing nature of ending the film by pulling together four concurrent plot threads, each with a radically different tone, unclear objectives, and an overall lack of proper character motivation.\n\n===Reception===\nStoklasa's reviews have been considered part of an emerging art form that hybridize [[mashup (video)|mashup]] with video essays, as they use a combination of footage from the movie in question and other related sources.\n\nLiterary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that Plinkett enacts a kind of ''[[d\u00e9tournement]]'' by recontextualizing images that would otherwise serve as ''Star Wars'' marketing material (such as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews). Defined by [[Guy Debord]] as \"the reuse of preexisting artistic elements in a new ensemble\", ''d\u00e9tournement'' is a way of generating meaning out of cultural texts that is antithetical to their original intent.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 109|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Kirbach argues that Stoklasa uses this tactic to construct a subversive narrative that frames George Lucas as \"a lazy, out-of-touch, and thoroughly unchallenged filmmaker\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 108|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nKirbach also argues that Plinkett's popularity can be explained, in part, as a form of [[catharsis]]. Because he is portrayed as insane, the Plinkett shtick \"legitimates our nerd-rage by literalizing it\".<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\">{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 112|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Plinkett enrolls George Lucas in an ongoing [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] drama as the castrating father figure, a father figure we are invited to rage against owing to his flagrant ineptitude. But aside from raw catharsis, Kirbach claims that Plinkett's insanity is also a critique of the film industry itself. By fictionalizing his critic, Stoklasa constructs a character who is unable to speak at a safe distance from the text he analyzes. \"Plinkett becomes the figure of a consumer culture that has been force-fed Hollywood schlock beyond its carrying capacity,\" Kirbach writes.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 111|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> And further:\n\n{{quote|Stoklasa's major conceit\u2014that someone would have to be \"crazy\" to watch movies the way Plinkett does\u2014also implies a barely hidden inverse: that the film industry has induced a consumerist fantasy in people who ''don't'' watch movies this way. Plinkett's obscenity and jokiness are without a doubt designed to garner viewership, but they are also Stoklasa's apology for\u2014or defense against\u2014a culture that already construes his level of passion as pathological. This central irony leads us to question what is actually more insane: the consumer who rejects the expressions of a massive culture industry, or the massive culture industry itself. Plinkett satirizes the kind of consumer such a system generates: psychotic, sexist, homicidal.<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] noted that the Mr. Plinkett reviews are an example of \"amazing film scholarship\" on the ''Star Wars'' prequels that demonstrate how much of the ''Star Wars'' universe is squandered by them.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/patton-oswalt-silver-screen-fiend-interview | title = Patton Oswalt on Movie Addiction, Star Wars, and the One Film He'd Watch on Loop | first = Jennifer | last = Wood | date = January 27, 2015 | accessdate = January 27, 2015 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called the reviews \"legendary\" and described them as being more popular than the actual films.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/george-lucas-movies-hate-defence/ |title=Why it's time to stop hating George Lucas |work= The Daily Telegraph |first=Chris|last=Bell|date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate= December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the reviews have also been criticized by ''Star Wars'' fans. Stoklasa stated that he feels \"''Star Wars'' to some people is like a religion so they respond to attacks on it as such.\"<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> One fan wrote a 108-page-long point-by-point response to the ''Phantom Menace'' review, taking issue with many of Stoklasa's criticisms,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-fan-writes-108page-rebuttal-red-letter-medias-phantom-menace-review/ |title='Star Wars' Fan Writes 108-Page Rebuttal to Red Letter Media's 'Phantom Menace' Review |publisher=/Film |first=Germain |last=Lussier |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 }}</ref> which Stoklasa mocked in an announcement video for his ''Revenge of the Sith'' review.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTpWzg4aiEU |title= Episode 3 Review is now up ...|publisher=[[YouTube]] |author=Red Letter Media |accessdate=June 3, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDirector [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]], whilst critiquing [[CinemaSins|CinemaSins']] ''Everything Wrong With ...'' video of his film, ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'', for bad film criticism masked under the guise of \"satire\", praised Red Letter Media for good film criticism and satire, stating that \"Red Letter Media's Phantom Menace review IS satire.

Among the low-budget features Stoklasa and Bauman have produced and directed on Red Letter Media are the action-comedy film ''[[Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant]]'', made in 2005 and available on [[Netflix]]<ref name=\"heeb\" /> (currently only available for DVD rental, not for streaming); ''The Recovered'', a horror thriller starring [[Tina Krause]]; and ''Feeding Frenzy'', a 2010 [[genre]]-[[parody|spoof]] of puppet monster movies like ''[[Gremlins]]''. ''Feeding Frenzy'' featured Rich Evans as Mr. Plinkett; Evans originated the character in short films, and this feature was filmed before the popularity of the ''Phantom Menace'' review.<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> Stoklasa's short films are usually dark comedies. Plinkett, played by Evans, appeared in several of them, starting with \"You're Invited\".\n\nStoklasa created and starred in five seasons of the web sitcom ''The Grabowskis'', opposite Dixie Jacobs, about an exaggeratedly trashy and unpleasant sitcom family. Installments of the series were only a few seconds long at first (comically giving more screen time to the lengthy intro than the episode itself), but grew to full episode length over time.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the company announced via a short video that it had completed the feature-length film ''[[Space Cop]]'', which had been in production for at least seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redlettermedia.com/shorts/space-cop-trailer/|title=Space Cop Trailer #1 - Red Letter Media|website=redlettermedia.com}}</ref> ''Space Cop'' stars Evans in the titular role alongside Stoklasa, who wrote and directed the film. It was made available on January 12, 2016, on Blu-ray for $25 through Red Letter Media's [[Bandcamp]] page. The first run sold out in a matter of hours.\n\n==''Half in the Bag''==\n''Half in the Bag'' is a regularly released series in which Stoklasa and Bauman review films in a more traditional format, albeit with a haphazard and [[Fourth wall|fourth wall breaking]] overarching plot. Stoklasa has described it as a cross between ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert]]'' and a 1980s [[sitcom]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, with himself and Bauman playing [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] repairmen who discuss movies whilst finding increasingly convoluted ways of avoiding their scheduled repair work on Mr. Plinkett's VCR.\n\nThe show often features Plinkett portrayed by Evans. Fans often call this iteration of the character \"Fake Plinkett\", but Stoklasa has noted that Evans was the first person to portray Plinkett, with Stoklasa's later portrayal based on Evans's performance. [[Tim Heidecker]], who hosts a satirical movie review show ''[[On Cinema]]'', makes a cameo in episode 37 as the owner of the VCR repair shop who bequeaths employment to Jay and Mike.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1C7UCMmF5g |title=Half in the Bag: Episode 37 - Special guest star Tim Heidecker |last=RedLetterMedia |date=2012-08-07 |access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nStoklasa stated that this series would not replace the Plinkett reviews. The first episode premiered on March 12, 2011, with a review of ''[[Drive Angry]]'' and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.\n\n[[Graham Linehan]] praised Red Letter Media in an interview with [[United Kingdom|British]] comedian and writer [[Richard Herring]] on ''[[Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast]]''. He spoke particularly about the ''Half in the Bag'' review of ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'', which he described as \"brilliant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzsR1e5NFl4&t=48m20s|title=Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast - with Graham Linehan #111|first=|last=Richard Herring|date=26 August 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==''Best of the Worst''==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2019}}\n{{overly detailed|date=August 2019}}\n}}\n\n''Best of the Worst'' is a regularly-released series in which members of Red Letter Media watch and review multiple films ranging from B-movies to instructional videos, sometimes sent in by fans.<ref name=MakeUseOf>{{cite web |url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/red-letter-media-cinema-themed-comedy-for-film-fans-stuff-to-watch/ |title=Red Letter Media: Cinema-Themed Comedy For Film Fans [Stuff to Watch] |publisher=MakeUseOf |author=Tim Brookes |date=December 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117003120/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/red-letter-media-cinema-themed-comedy-for-film-fans-stuff-to-watch/ |archivedate=January 17, 2014 |df= }}</ref> After viewing and riffing on the films, a rotating panel of four sit to discuss what they just watched, typically expressing further contempt or ridicule for what they have just seen, though occasionally offering praise for films that show uncommon quality or effort. Panels typically consist of any combination of Mike Stoklasa, Jay Bauman, Rich Evans, Jessi Nakles, Jack Packard, Josh \"The Wizard\" Davis, or special guests. Panel participants then individually decide upon which film or video represents the \"Best of the Worst\". Viewing material that is deemed to be insulting, offensive, or especially poor is often destroyed in a creative fashion. Methods of destruction have included dissolving a VHS tape in [[acetone]], forcing a DVD through a [[paper shredder]], dragging a tape around the streets tied to the bumper of a car, and cooking a tape on a charcoal grill alongside cheeseburgers.\n\nCanadian visual effects artists Colin Cunningham and Jim Maxwell, who have worked on numerous television series' and feature films, frequently appear as recurring guests. Special guests on the show have included screenwriters [[Max Landis]] and [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], comic book artist [[Freddie Williams II|Freddie Williams]], actors [[Macaulay Culkin]] and [[Patton Oswalt]], comedian Gillian Bellinger and indie film auteur Len Kabasinski.\n\nSome episodes feature the \"Wheel of the Worst\", in which a wheel is spun to select which films/videos will be watched.<ref name=\"MakeUseOf\"/> Wheel selections are often videos that are either extremely bizarre (such as \"Dog Sitter\", a movie made to appeal to dogs), low budget instructional films, educational films and those which have little modern relevance (such as Chinese-language instructional tapes about how to use [[AOL]]). Videos featured on Wheel of the Worst are most frequently found on VHS tapes. The ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' praised ''Best of the Worst'' for being Red Letter Media's most entertaining series.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140117/entlife/701179987/|title= Hibernating? Chill out with offbeat shows, DVDs |newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |author=Sean Stangland |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe show occasionally features other gimmicks to randomly select viewing material such as the \"Choose-And-Lose\" and the [[Plinko|Plinketto Board]]. Another subsection of Best of the Worst includes the \"Black Spine Edition\" where the group randomly selects VHS tapes which are missing informational or identification labels on the side of the cassette.\n\nSometimes the crew will review a specific film which they have previously viewed off camera and recommend to fans of poorly-conceived and poorly-executed [[B movie]]s. They refer to reviews of this nature as their \"Spotlight Series\". The first of these reviews featured the film ''Hollywood Cop'' by director [[Amir Shervan]] was released on YouTube on June 21, 2017. In this format, low budget indie movies ''Suburban Sasquatch'', ''Lycan Colony'' and ''The Last Vampire on Earth'' have also been featured.\n\nIn 2019, the crew introduced a 'Hall of Fame' for Best of the Worst, intended to represent the best things that have appeared on the show. There have only been three additions to the hall of fame thus far; actor [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and low-budget films ''Surviving Edged Weapons'' and ''[[Creating Rem Lezar]]''.\n\n==''re:View''==\nOn May 24, 2016, the company released the first episode of a new series called ''re:View''. Compared to the company's other shows, the format is a much more stripped down and straight forward approach to film critique. Two members of Red Letter Media sit in front of a red curtain and offer thoughts and insight on a film that they both enjoy. Films chosen for this feature are often either [[cult film|cult classics]] such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' and ''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'', or well renowned genre-defining films like ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. Clips of the film being discussed are interwoven, typically to lend emphasis to a specific point being made, or to showcase some of the most memorable moments from the film. ''re:View'' has also featured ''[[Star Trek]]'' films and episodes, a particular favorite of Stoklasa's.\n\nFor an episode featuring ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', the screenwriter of the film, [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], appeared as a guest and spoke about many behind the scenes aspects of the production. A similar insight into the background of a film the Red Letter Media crew enjoyed was shared in a two-part interview series with ''[[Samurai Cop]]'' lead [[Matt Hannon]], though this occurred prior to the creation of the ''re:View'' branding and format. Former child star [[Macaulay Culkin]] made a guest appearance in a 2018 episode reviewing ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'', and has continued to recur in both this series as well as Best of the Worst.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM7_oyCZqj0|title=Hackers - reView|first=|last=RedLetterMedia|date=5 November 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/macaulay-culkin-ueberraschender-auftritt-bei-youtube-kritikern-1144705/|title=Macaulay Culkin: \u00dcberraschender Auftritt bei YouTube-Kritikern|date=24 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Nerd Crew: A Pop Culture Podcast''==\nThe first episode being uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 5 January 2017, ''The Nerd Crew'' parodies [[pop culture]] \"[[fanboyism]]\" and video series such as [[Screen Junkies]], [[Collider (website)|Collider]], and [[John Campea|''The John Campea Show'']], with Stoklasa, Bauman and Evans playing \"[[wikt:man child|manchild]]ren\" demonstrating excessive enthusiasm over ''[[Star Wars]]'', the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and other content aimed primarily at a juvenile audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/05/the-frenzied-fraud-of-forced-fandom/|title=The Frenzied Fraud of Forced Fandom|date=1 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref> [[Product placement]], [[native advertising]] and general subservience to entertainment mega-corporations are all satirized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/diese-drei-filmnerds-zerstoeren-rogue-one-und-disney-mit-nur-einem-youtube-video-736791/|title=Diese drei Filmnerds zerst\u00f6ren \"Rogue One\" und Disney mit nur einem YouTube-Video|date=9 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinokadr.ru/blog/2017/12/16/5411.shtml|title=5 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438: \"\u0413\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\", \"\u0425\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0446\u044b\", \"\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\" \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0438 \u0427\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438|website=kinokadr.ru}}</ref>\n\n== Commentary tracks ==\nSince 2012, Red Letter Media has produced commentary tracks for various films, releasing them on [[Bandcamp]].<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\">{{Cite web|url=https://redlettermedia.bandcamp.com/audio|title=Red Letter Media commentary tracks|last=|first=|date=|website=Red Letter Media|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-25}}</ref> These began with three commentary tracks by Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett, but the company has since released tracks by Stoklasa, Bauman, and Evans as themselves.\n\n;Commentary tracks (listed in order of release)<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\"/>\n{{div col}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''\n*''[[Samurai Cop]]''\n*''[[Ghostbusters II]]''\n*''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''\n*''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''\n*''[[The Terminator]]''\n*''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''\n*''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''\n*''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''\n*''[[Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]''\n*''[[Gremlins]]''\n*''[[Rogue One]]''\n*''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]''\n*''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (film)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[Jingle All the Way]]''\n*''[[Army of Darkness]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==''Previously Recorded''==\nIn July 2014, Red Letter Media affiliates Rich Evans and Jack Packard began a YouTube Video game review channel under the name ''Previously Recorded'' or ''Pre-Rec''.
