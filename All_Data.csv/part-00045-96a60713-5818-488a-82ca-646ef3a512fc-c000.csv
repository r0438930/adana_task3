{{main article|iOS|iOS 8|iOS 9|iOS 10|iOS 11|iOS 12}}
{{further information|iOS version history}}

The sixth-generation iPod touch features iOS, Apple's [[mobile operating system]]. The [[Graphical user interface|user interface]] of iOS is based on the concept of [[Direct manipulation interface|direct manipulation]], using [[multi-touch]] gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as ''swipe'', ''tap'', ''pinch'', and ''reverse pinch'', all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its Multi-Touch interface. Internal [[accelerometer]]s are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).

The sixth-generation iPod Touch ships with iOS 8.4, which was released on June 30, 2015 along with [[Apple Music]]. It can play music, movies, television shows, audiobooks, and [[podcast]]s and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. However, the [[Apple earbuds#Apple EarPods|EarPods]] that come with the sixth-generation iPod touch do not include a remote or microphone. The Voice Control feature can also be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].

The sixth-generation iPod touch supports [[iOS 9]] that was released in September 2015, [[iOS 10]] that was released in September 2016, [[iOS 11]] that was released in September 2017 and [[iOS 12]] that was released in September 2018. The sixth-generation iPod touch support for iOS 12 made this the first iPod touch model to support five major versions of iOS so far from iOS 8 to iOS 12. As of January 2020, the 6th generation iPod touch simply states \"Any Version\" under the Max-supported version category within the device info. 

The sixth-generation iPod touch will not be supported by the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, [[iOS 13]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://betaprofiles.com/support-devices/|title=Supported Devices {{!}} Beta Profiles|date=June 3, 2019|website=Apple Beta Profiles}}</ref>

===Hardware===
The sixth-generation iPod touch features the [[Apple A8]] and [[Apple M8]] motion co-processor chipset with [[64-bit computing|64-bit architecture]] which is the same chip on iPad Mini 4, Apple TV 4th Gen, iPhone 6 and the HomePod but it is slightly underclocked at 1.1&nbsp;GHz (the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are clocked at 1.4&nbsp;GHz while the iPad mini 4 was clocked at 1.5 GHz) due to its small battery. It has 1GB of [[Mobile DDR|LPDDR3]] RAM, twice the amount as the previous generation iPod touch.<ref name=wired>{{cite web|last1=Barret|first1=Brian|title=Stop Everything: You Might Actually Want a New iPod touch|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/07/new-ipod-touch-2/|website=[[Wired.com]]|accessdate=July 16, 2015|date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> 

Apple's [[Metal (API)|Metal]] graphics technology is also compatible with the iPod touch 6th generation. The iPod touch features an 8MP rear iSight camera with video which can record in 1080p at 30fps, or 120fps in slow-motion mode that records at 720p. The camera also supports a burst mode and has an LED flash. Unlike the 5th-generation version,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kee |first=Edwin |url=http://www.ubergizmo.com/2012/09/ipod-touch-5g/ |title=iPod touch (2012) enters the fifth generation |publisher=Ubergizmo |date=December 26, 2012 |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref> the rear camera on the 6th-generation iPod touch lacks a sapphire crystal lens.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPod+Touch+6th+Generation+Teardown/44378#s99494|title= Apple iPod touch 6 generation disassembly |publisher=[[iFixit]] |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref> The front camera is unchanged from the previous generation, a 1.2MP sensor and can record video up to 720p. It is the first iPod touch that is available with 128 GB of storage, partially filling the void left behind by the [[iPod Classic]] which offered 160 GB of storage at the time it was discontinued.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

===Design===
The exterior design of the sixth-generation iPod touch is largely identical to that of its predecessor, with the exception of the iPod touch Loop button, which was removed. It is available in silver, gold, space gray, pink, blue, and a [[Product Red]] version which is only available at Apple Stores and the Apple Online Store, although each color's shade is slightly different from the previous generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/5VkzOgmM79/ |title=Instagram |publisher=Instagram |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=January 2020}}

===Accessories===
The sixth-generation iPod touch comes with a [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning]] Charging cable. This model also comes with the [[EarPods]] without Remote and Mic. This iPod touch is compatible with Apple's [[AirPods]] wireless headphones, which were announced at the September 7 [[Apple Special Event (September 7, 2016)|2016 Apple Special Event]] along with the iPhone 7, and released in late December 2016. It's also compatible with the [[EarPods with Lightning Connector]] that came out at the same time the iPhone 7 did, and the remote functions are active.

==Reception==
Nate Ralph from [[CNET]] praised the device's camera quality and noted the iPod touch's exceptional performance, but criticized it for its middling battery life and small display, and stated that he considered it \"largely redundant\" due to smartphones and tablets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/apple-ipod-touch-2015/|title=Apple iPod Touch 2015 review|last=Ralph|first=Nate|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=August 22, 2015}}</ref> Sascha Segan from ''PCMag'' has also noted the poor battery life, but stated that the iPod touch is still the best option for anyone who would prefer a handheld media player that doesn't require an intimate relationship with a cellular carrier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488093,00.asp|title=Apple iPod touch (2015)|last=Segan|first=Sascha|website=pcmag.com|date=July 22, 2015}}</ref>

'''''Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH''''' is a 1971 [[children's book]] by [[Robert C. O'Brien (author)|Robert C. O'Brien]], with illustrations by Zena Bernstein. The winner of the 1972 [[Newbery Medal]], the story was [[Film adaptation|adapted for film]] in 1982 as ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''.

The novel relates the plight of a widowed field mouse, Mrs. Frisby, who seeks the aid of a group of former [[laboratory rat]]s in rescuing her home from destruction by a farmer's plow, saving her son from pneumonia, and of the history of the rats' escape from the laboratory and development of a literate and technological society.

The work was inspired by the research of [[John B. Calhoun]] on mouse and rat population dynamics at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] from the 1940s to the 1960s.<ref name=\"NYT\">Fountain, Henry, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDB1E39F93AA1575AC0A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print \"J.

==Plot summary==
Mrs. Frisby is the head of a family of field mice. Her son Timothy is ill with pneumonia just as the farmer Mr. Fitzgibbon begins preparation for spring plowing in the garden where the Frisby family lives. Normally she would move her family, but Timothy would not survive the cold trip to their summer home. Mrs. Frisby obtains medicine from her friend Mr. Ages, an older white mouse. On the return journey, she saves the life of Jeremy, a young crow, from Dragon, the farmer's cat– the same cat who killed her husband, Jonathan. Jeremy suggests she seek help in moving Timothy from an owl who dwells in the forest. Jeremy flies Mrs. Frisby to the owl's tree, but the owl says he cannot help until he finds out that she is the widow of Jonathan Frisby. He suggests that Mrs. Frisby seek help from the rats who live in a rosebush near her.

Mrs. Frisby discovers the rats have a literate and mechanized society. They have technology such as elevators, have tapped the electricity grid to provide lighting and heating and have acquired other human skills, such as storing food for the winter. Their leader, Nicodemus, tells Mrs. Frisby of the rats' capture by scientists working for a laboratory located at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) and the subsequent experiments that the humans performed on the rats, which increased the rats' intelligence to the point of being able to read, write and operate complicated machines, as well as enhancing their longevity and strength. This increased intelligence and strength allowed them to escape from the NIMH laboratories and migrate to their present location. Jonathan Frisby and Mr. Ages were the only two survivors of a group of eight [[mice]] who had been part of the experiments at NIMH and made the rats' escape possible. Out of their respect and unending gratitude for Jonathan, the rats agree to move Mrs. Frisby's house to a location safe from the plow.

Nicodemus also tells Mrs. Frisby about \"The Plan\", which is to abandon their lifestyle of dependence on humans, which some rats regard as theft, for a new, independent farming colony. One rat, Jenner, disagreed vehemently with The Plan and left the colony with a group of followers at some point prior to Mrs. Frisby's arrival.

To move the Frisby home, the rats have to drug Dragon, as it is too dangerous to work in the open with the cat wandering nearby. However, Mr. Ages has a broken leg and cannot dash to Dragon's bowl to put in the drug. Since the rats are too big to fit into the hole in the wall to enter the house, Mrs. Frisby volunteers to go. Unfortunately, she is caught by the family's son, Billy, who puts her in a cage. While captured, Mrs. Frisby overhears the Fitzgibbons discussing an incident at a nearby hardware store in which a group of rats was electrocuted after seemingly attempting to steal a small motor. This has attracted the attention of a group of men who have offered to exterminate the rat colony on Fitzgibbons' land free of charge for him.

At night, the rat Justin comes to save Mrs. Frisby and manages to get her out of the cage. Mrs. Frisby warns Justin of what she learned while captured; they assume that the rats at the hardware store were all from Jenner's group and that the group of men were from NIMH and are looking for them specifically.

The successful house move allows the mouse family to remain so that Timothy has time to recover before moving to their summer home. Although the rats have not yet had time to move everything they needed for The Plan, they manage to destroy their underground rooms and create the vision that they are just regular rats by placing rubbish in the remaining rooms. As the others move, ten rats stay back so the exterminators would not think the rat hole has been abandoned. When the exterminators fill the rat hole with toxic gas, eight of the ten rats manage to escape, while two rats die in the hole. It is not revealed exactly who these two are.

Once Timothy recovers, Mrs. Frisby and her family move to their summer home and Mrs. Frisby tells her children the full story of their father and the rats of NIMH.

==Reception==
In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1966 to 1975, children's author [[John Rowe Townsend]] wrote, \"It seems to me that the fact that all the animals talk and behave intelligently from the beginning of the story detracts from the spectacular development of the laboratory rats... ''Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH'' is a pleasing book, but I find it mildly frustrating; it might have been something more than it is.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=John Rowe |authorlink=John Rowe Townsend |chapter=A Decade of Newbery Books in Perspective |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newberycaldecott0000unse/page/148 148-149] |title=Newbery and Caldecott Medal Books: 1966-1975 |editor-last=Kingman |editor-first=Lee |publisher=[[The Horn Book Magazine|The Horn Book, Incorporated]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=1975 |isbn=0-87675-003-X |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/newberycaldecott0000unse/page/148 }}</ref>

==Related works==
After his death, O'Brien's daughter, [[Jane Leslie Conly]], wrote two other novels based on the rats of NIMH. ''[[Racso and the Rats of NIMH]]'' tells the story of a city rat who runs away to join the new colony, befriending Timothy, while saving the colony from a flood along the way. In ''[[R-T, Margaret, and the Rats of NIMH]]'', the rats rescue two lost human children who in turn help to save the colony before winter.

==Adaptations==

In 1982, the animated film ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' was released, directed by [[Don Bluth]]. The film adds a mystical element completely absent from the novel, with Nicodemus portrayed as a wise, bearded old wizard with magic powers and an enchanted amulet, rather than an equal of the other rats. The character of Jenner is made a villain who is still present with the rats, rather than having left them before the story begins. The crow Jeremy has much greater prominence as [[comic relief]] in the film than he has in the book. Additionally, the Frisby family name was changed to \"Brisby\" to avoid trademark infringement with the [[Frisbee]].<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite book |last=Cawley |first=John |title=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |date=October 1991 |chapter=The Secret of N.I.M.H. |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8 |chapter-url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBnimh.html}}</ref>

'''Town Sports International Holdings'''

In June 2015 Walsh was named Chairman of the Board of Town Sports International Holdings. The Company was burning $5 million a month and was in the midst of 17 consecutive quarters of same-store sales declines.  The Company was burdened with $300 million of debt that could not be repaid with the current levels of cash flow. This led Moody's rating agency to describe Town's capital structure as \"untenable\" and they downgraded the debt to a \"Caa2\" rating. The stock price declined to 92 cents per share while the Company's debt traded down to 36 cents on the dollar.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Town-Sports-CFR-to-Caa2-outlook-negative--PR_343821|title=Moody's downgrades Town Sports' CFR to Caa2; outlook negative|date=February 16, 2016|work=Moodys.com|access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref> In September 2016 Walsh became Chief Executive Officer.<ref name=\":0\" /> While industry experts predicted bankruptcy or a sale,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/06/nysc-owner-seeks-a-sale-but-alls-not-gym-dandy/|title=NYSC owner seeks a sale, but all’s not gym-dandy|date=March 7, 2015|work=New York Post|access-date=May 11, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Walsh vowed to Town's shareholders that he would never give up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.townsportsinternational.com/static-files/da8171a6-e2e2-4cda-b82a-f2296531c66d|title=Letter from the Chairman 2015}}</ref> After 17 consecutive quarters of declines in same store sales the company then posted 5 consecutive quarters of same-store sales increases and the stock price increased more than 1,000% to $11 per share in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Walsh was born in San Diego, California, the eldest of three brothers.  His father was in the [[U.S. Navy]] and his mother was a school teacher. 
[[File:Patrick Walsh .jpg|thumb|Patrick Walsh the 2018 EY Entrepreneur of the Year award winner in the New York region.]]
The Walsh family left California and moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1977 and Walsh grew up in [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]], the home of the [[New England Patriots]]. Walsh remains a die-hard Patriots fan to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/get-your-mind-right-with-boston-sports-clubs-and-gronk-fitness-300378152.html|title=Get Your Mind Right with Boston Sports Clubs and Gronk Fitness|last=Clubs|first=Boston Sports|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=May 17, 2018}}</ref> Walsh studied economics at [[Wesleyan University]] and played football and baseball<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://athletics.wesleyan.edu/sports/bsb/1994-95/bios/walsh_pat_bbf0|title=Pat Walsh|website=Wesleyan Athletics|language=en|access-date=May 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://athletics.wesleyan.edu/sports/fball/1994-95/bios/walsh_pat_0ml0|title=Pat Walsh|website=Wesleyan Athletics|language=en|access-date=May 11, 2018}}</ref> until he suffered a severe back injury playing football. He transferred to [[Boston College]] after his freshman year and graduated with a degree in accounting.

==Proof Outline==

[[File:A_simple_Markov_network.png|thumb|right|A simple Markov network for demonstrating that any Gibbs random field satisfies every Markov property.]]

It is a trivial matter to show that a Gibbs random field satisfies every [[Markov random field#Definition|Markov property]]. As an example of this fact, see the following:

In the image to the right, a Gibbs random field over the provided graph has the form <math>\\Pr(A,B,C,D,E,F) \\propto f_1(A,B,D)f_2(A,C,D)f_3(C,D,F)f_4(C,E,F)</math>. If variables <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> are fixed, then the global Markov property requires that: <math>A, B \\perp E, F | C, D</math> (see [[conditional independence]]), since <math>C, D</math> forms a barrier between <math>A, B</math> and <math>E, F</math>.

With <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> constant, <math>\\Pr(A,B,E,F|C=c,D=d) \\propto [f_1(A,B,d)f_2(A,c,d)] \\cdot [f_3(c,d,F)f_4(c,E,F)] = g_1(A,B)g_2(E,F)</math> where <math>g_1(A,B) = f_1(A,B,d)f_2(A,c,d)</math> and <math>g_2(E,F) = f_3(c,d,F)f_4(c,E,F)</math>. This implies that <math>A, B \\perp E, F | C, D</math>.

To establish that every positive probability distribution that satisfies the local Markov property is also a Gibbs random field, the following lemma, which provides a means for combining different factorizations, needs to be proven:

[[File:Merging_two_factorizations_of_a_positive_mass_function.png|thumb|right|Lemma 1 provides a means for combining factorizations as shown in this diagram. Note that in this image, the overlap between sets is ignored.]]

'''Lemma 1'''

Let <math>U</math> denote the set of all random variables under consideration, and let <math>\\Theta, \\Phi_1, \\Phi_2, \\dots, \\Phi_n \\subseteq U</math> and <math>\\Psi_1, \\Psi_2, \\dots, \\Psi_m \\subseteq U</math> denote arbitrary sets of variables. (Here, given an arbitrary set of variables <math>X</math>, <math>X</math> will also denote an arbitrary assignment to the variables from <math>X</math>.)

If

<math>\\Pr(U) = f(\\Theta)\\prod_{i=1}^n g_i(\\Phi_i) = \\prod_{j=1}^m h_j(\\Psi_j)</math>

for functions <math>f, g_1, g_2, \\dots g_n</math> and <math>h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_m</math>, then there exist functions <math>h'_1, h'_2, \\dots, h'_m</math> and <math>g'_1, g'_2, \\dots, g'_n</math> such that

<math>\\Pr(U) = \\bigg(\\prod_{j=1}^m h'_j(\\Theta \\cap \\Psi_j)\\bigg)\\bigg(\\prod_{i=1}^n g'_i(\\Phi_i)\\bigg)</math>

In other words, <math>\\prod_{j=1}^m h_j(\\Psi_j)</math> provides a template for further factorization of <math>f(\\Theta)</math>.

{{Collapse top|title = Proof of Lemma 1}}

In order to use <math>\\prod_{j=1}^m h_j(\\Psi_j)</math> as a template to further factorize <math>f(\\Theta)</math>, all variables outside of <math>\\Theta</math> need to be fixed. To this end, let <math>\\bar{\\theta}</math> be an arbitrary fixed assignment to the variables from <math>U \\setminus \\Theta</math> (the variables not in <math>\\Theta</math>). For an arbitrary set of variables <math>X</math>, let <math>\\bar{\\theta}[X]</math> denote the assignment <math>\\bar{\\theta}</math> restricted to the variables from <math>X \\setminus \\Theta</math>. 

Moreover, to factorize only <math>f(\\Theta)</math>, the other factors <math>g_1(\\Phi_1), g_2(\\Phi_2), ..., g_n(\\Phi_n)</math> need to be rendered moot for the variables from <math>\\Theta</math>. To do this, the factorization 

<math>\\Pr(U) = f(\\Theta)\\prod_{i=1}^n g_i(\\Phi_i)</math> 

will be re-expressed as  

<math>\\Pr(U) = \\bigg(f(\\Theta)\\prod_{i=1}^n g_i(\\Phi_i \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Phi_i])\\bigg)\\bigg(\\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{g_i(\\Phi_i)}{g_i(\\Phi_i \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Phi_i])}\\bigg)</math>

For each <math>i = 1, 2, ..., n</math>: <math>g_i(\\Phi_i \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Phi_i])</math> is <math>g_i(\\Phi_i)</math> where all variables outside of <math>\\Theta</math> have been fixed to the values prescribed by <math>\\bar{\\theta}</math>. 

Let 
<math>f'(\\Theta) = f(\\Theta)\\prod_{i=1}^n g_i(\\Phi_i \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Phi_i])</math>
and 
<math>g'_i(\\Phi_i) = \\frac{g_i(\\Phi_i)}{g_i(\\Phi_i \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Phi_i])}</math>
for each <math>i = 1, 2, \\dots, n</math> so

<math>\\Pr(U) = f'(\\Theta)\\prod_{i=1}^n g'_i(\\Phi_i) = \\prod_{j=1}^m h_j(\\Psi_j)</math>

What is most important is that <math>g'_i(\\Phi_i) = \\frac{g_i(\\Phi_i)}{g_i(\\Phi_i \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Phi_i])} = 1</math> when the values assigned to <math>\\Phi_i</math> do not conflict with the values prescribed by <math>\\bar{\\theta}</math>, making <math>g'_i(\\Phi_i)</math> \"disappear\" when all variables not in <math>\\Theta</math> are fixed to the values from <math>\\bar{\\theta}</math>.

Fixing all variables not in <math>\\Theta</math> to the values from <math>\\bar{\\theta}</math> gives

<math>\\Pr(\\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}) = f'(\\Theta) \\prod_{i=1}^n g'_i(\\Phi_i \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Phi_i]) = \\prod_{j=1}^m h_j(\\Psi_j \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Psi_j])</math>

Since <math>g'_i(\\Phi_i \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Phi_i]) = 1</math>,
 
<math>f'(\\Theta) = \\prod_{j=1}^m h_j(\\Psi_j \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Psi_j])</math>

Letting 
<math>h'_j(\\Theta \\cap \\Psi_j) = h_j(\\Psi_j \\cap \\Theta, \\bar{\\theta}[\\Psi_j]) </math>
gives:

<math>f'(\\Theta) = \\prod_{j=1}^m h'_j(\\Theta \\cap \\Psi_j)</math>
which finally gives:

<math>\\Pr(U) = \\bigg(\\prod_{j=1}^m h'_j(\\Theta \\cap \\Psi_j)\\bigg)\\bigg(\\prod_{i=1}^n g'_i(\\Phi_i)\\bigg)</math>

==Proof Outline==

[[File:A_simple_Markov_network.png|thumb|right|A simple Markov network for demonstrating that any Gibbs random field satisfies every Markov property.]]

It is a trivial matter to show that a Gibbs random field satisfies every [[Markov random field#Definition|Markov property]]. As an example of this fact, see the following:

In the image to the right, a Gibbs random field over the provided graph has the form <math>\\Pr(A,B,C,D,E,F) \\propto f_1(A,B,D)f_2(A,C,D)f_3(C,D,F)f_4(C,E,F)</math>. If variables <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> are fixed, then the global Markov property requires that: <math>A, B \\perp E, F | C, D</math> (see [[conditional independence]]), since <math>C, D</math> forms a barrier between <math>A, B</math> and <math>E, F</math>.

With <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> constant, <math>\\Pr(A,B,E,F|C=c,D=d) \\propto [f_1(A,B,d)f_2(A,c,d)] \\cdot [f_3(c,d,F)f_4(c,E,F)] = g_1(A,B)g_2(E,F)</math> where <math>g_1(A,B) = f_1(A,B,d)f_2(A,c,d)</math> and <math>g_2(E,F) = f_3(c,d,F)f_4(c,E,F)</math>. This implies that <math>A, B \\perp E, F | C, D</math>.

To establish that every positive probability distribution that satisfies the local Markov property is also a Gibbs random field, the following lemma, which provides a means for combining different factorizations, needs to be proven:

[[File:Merging_two_factorizations_of_a_positive_mass_function.png|thumb|right|Lemma 1 provides a means for combining factorizations as shown in this diagram. Note that in this image, the overlap between sets is ignored.]]

'''Lemma 1'''

Let <math>U</math> denote the set of all random variables under consideration, and let <math>\\Theta, \\Phi_1, \\Phi_2, \\dots, \\Phi_n \\subseteq U</math> and <math>\\Psi_1, \\Psi_2, \\dots, \\Psi_m \\subseteq U</math> denote arbitrary sets of variables. (Here, given an arbitrary set of variables <math>X</math>, <math>X</math> will also denote an arbitrary assignment to the variables from <math>X</math>.)

If

<math>\\Pr(U) = f(\\Theta)\\prod_{i=1}^n g_i(\\Phi_i) = \\prod_{j=1}^m h_j(\\Psi_j)</math>

for functions <math>f, g_1, g_2, \\dots g_n</math> and <math>h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_m</math>, then there exist functions <math>h'_1, h'_2, \\dots, h'_m</math> and <math>g'_1, g'_2, \\dots, g'_n</math> such that

<math>\\Pr(U) = \\bigg(\\prod_{j=1}^m h'_j(\\Theta \\cap \\Psi_j)\\bigg)\\bigg(\\prod_{i=1}^n g'_i(\\Phi_i)\\bigg)</math>

In other words, <math>\\prod_{j=1}^m h_j(\\Psi_j)</math> provides a template for further factorization of <math>f(\\Theta)</math>.

'''Alexandre Bigot''' (5 November 1862 – 27 April 1927) was a French ceramicist.  He was primarily a ceramics manufacturer; producing the designs of many artists and architects of the French [[Art Nouveau]] movement; including: [[Jules Lavirotte]], [[Hector Guimard]], [[Louis Majorelle]], [[Henri Sauvage]], [[Henry van de Velde]], [[Auguste Perret]], Andre Arfidson, [[Anatole de Baudot]] and more.

Bigot was a physics and chemistry instructor who became interested in ceramics in 1889 after viewing Chinese porcelain at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris.  With his knowledge of chemistry, Bigot was able to create glazes with a large variety of colors and finishes.<ref name=\"Turner 1996, p. 47-8\">Turner 1996, p. 47-8</ref>

Bigot's firm was based at Rue des Petites Ecuries, Paris and he also created a ceramics factory in Mer in 1889 which employed as many as 150 people.  [[Samuel Bing]], a German art dealer in Paris, displayed works by Bigot, among others, and was responsible for exposing the Art Nouveau style.  Bigot’s Parisian firm closed in 1914 due to a decline in the popularity of Art Nouveau.<ref name=\"Turner 1996, p. 47-8\" />

==Early life and Discovery of Ceramics==
Alexandre Bigot was trained in the sciences before eventually excelling in the arts. He obtained a degree in [[physics]] in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexandre Bigot céramiste|url=http://lartnouveau.com/artistes/bigot.htm|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> He also held a doctorate in [[chemistry]] and was interested very early on in creating enamels resembling natural gems.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=La biographie d’Alexandre Bigot par Hélène Bedague - Club des collectionneurs de céramique |url=http://www.lesceramophiles.org/actu/la-biographie-dalexandre-bigot-par-helene-bedague.html|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> After a brief stint in the studio of Paul Beyer (1873-1945) in [[Switzerland]], and recognizing the limits imposed on setting up a laboratory in Paris, in 1889 Bigot set up his first kiln in Aunay, his hometown (today called [[Aulnay]]), now a district within the city limits of [[Mer]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|language=fr|author=|last=B|first=thierry|title=Alexandre Bigot - Céramique Art nouveau|url=http://thierryb.over-blog.com/article-16656495.html|website=le blog de thierry B|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The same year, he became one of a number of artists of his generation who were attracted to the eastern ceramic wares that they saw at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle of 1889 in Paris]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|language=fr |author-link=Priscille de Lassus |title=Sur les pas d'Alexandre Bigot, céramiste des rues de Paris |journal=[[Dossier de l'art]] |volume=259 |issue=La sculpture polychrome |date=May 2018 |pages=76–79 }}</ref> Among Bigot's contemporaries who saw these examples was Jean-Joseph Carriès, who like Bigot had his own studio and was engaged in research on ceramics, knowledge which he began to refine upon meeting Bigot.<ref>{{cite book|language = fr|title = Encyclopédie de l'art|location = Paris, France|publisher = Librairie générale française|year = 1991|isbn = 2-253-05303-1|pages = 186–187}}</ref> The two artists began a correspondence on the subject and Bigot became extremely interested in Carriès' work.{{Sfn|Simier|5=2007|p=74, 90|id=Simier}} Bigot's knowledge of chemistry allowed him to become an adviser to [[Ernest Chaplet]] for his sculpture and Carriès as well as a collaborator with the chemist [[Henry Le Chatelier]].<ref name=\":2\" /> On the practical side (turning and modeling), he benefitted from the advice of [[Raphaël Tessier]] (1860-1937).<ref name=\":1\" />

==Career in Ceramics==
In 1894, Bigot presented his pieces for the first time at the Salon of the Société nationale des Beaux-Arts. The ceramics used a simple form ornamented with matte enamel using shades of yellow, green, and brown, often with the effect of crystallization. In 1895, he participated in the inaugural exposition of Siegfried Bing's La Maison de l'Art Nouveau, which gave its name to the style.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|language=fr|author=Arlette Barré-Despond|title=Dictionnaire international des arts appliqués et du design|location=Paris|publisher=[[Éditions du Regard]]|date=1996|isbn=2-84105-024-6}}</ref>

The year 1897 marked a turning point. Architectural ceramics were reaching the pinnacle of their popularity and Bigot took the opportunity to found his own company, ''A. Bigot et Cie''. This enterprise, which employed up to 150 workers and counted 10 industrial kilns, produced numerous trinkets, vases and vessels which were on display in his shop, which he transferred in Paris from the rue d'Assas to the rue des Petites-Écuries.

Along with Emile Muller, Bigot thus became the principal figure in architectural ceramics in France, and from 1898 he worked to integrate ceramics with façades of reinforced concrete. This architectural outlet explains, by implication, the membership of his company in the Union Syndicale des architetes, but also the relaxation of the urban regulations of 1882 which favored the appearance of projecting elements, such as oriel bays, that broke up the uniformity of façades.

The collaboration with [[Hector Guimard]] at the end of the decade marked the beginning of Bigot's fame with architectural ceramics. Before then his work had been confined essentially to baths and restaurants. But in 1898, Guimard's Castel Beranger emerged as the manifesto of Art Nouveau in architecture and its ceramics were commissioned from Bigot, who decorated the façade with picturesque details and covered the entrance breezeway with highly plastic molded panels designed to evoke the atmosphere of a grotto. The material became thus emblematic of the new style before Art Nouveau's decline about 1910.

'''Alexandre Bigot''' (5 November 1862 – 27 April 1927) was a French ceramicist.  He was primarily a ceramics manufacturer; producing the designs of many artists and architects of the French [[Art Nouveau]] movement; including: [[Jules Lavirotte]], [[Hector Guimard]], [[Louis Majorelle]], [[Henri Sauvage]], [[Henry van de Velde]], [[Auguste Perret]], Andre Arfidson, [[Anatole de Baudot]] and more.

Bigot was a physics and chemistry instructor who became interested in ceramics in 1889 after viewing Chinese porcelain at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris.  With his knowledge of chemistry, Bigot was able to create glazes with a large variety of colors and finishes.<ref name=\"Turner 1996, p. 47-8\">Turner 1996, p. 47-8</ref>

Bigot's firm was based at Rue des Petites Ecuries, Paris and he also created a ceramics factory in Mer in 1889 which employed as many as 150 people.  [[Samuel Bing]], a German art dealer in Paris, displayed works by Bigot, among others, and was responsible for exposing the Art Nouveau style.  Bigot’s Parisian firm closed in 1914 due to a decline in the popularity of Art Nouveau.<ref name=\"Turner 1996, p. 47-8\" />

==Early life and Discovery of Ceramics==
Alexandre Bigot was trained in the sciences before eventually excelling in the arts. He obtained a degree in [[physics]] in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexandre Bigot céramiste|url=http://lartnouveau.com/artistes/bigot.htm|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> He also held a doctorate in [[chemistry]] and was interested very early on in creating enamels resembling natural gems.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=La biographie d’Alexandre Bigot par Hélène Bedague - Club des collectionneurs de céramique |url=http://www.lesceramophiles.org/actu/la-biographie-dalexandre-bigot-par-helene-bedague.html|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> After a brief stint in the studio of Paul Beyer (1873-1945) in [[Switzerland]], and recognizing the limits imposed on setting up a laboratory in Paris, in 1889 Bigot set up his first kiln in Aunay, his hometown (today called [[Aulnay]]), now a district within the city limits of [[Mer]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|language=fr|author=|last=B|first=thierry|title=Alexandre Bigot - Céramique Art nouveau|url=http://thierryb.over-blog.com/article-16656495.html|website=le blog de thierry B|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The same year, he became one of a number of artists of his generation who were attracted to the eastern ceramic wares that they saw at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle of 1889 in Paris]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|language=fr |author-link=Priscille de Lassus |title=Sur les pas d'Alexandre Bigot, céramiste des rues de Paris |journal=[[Dossier de l'art]] |volume=259 |issue=La sculpture polychrome |date=May 2018 |pages=76–79 }}</ref> Among Bigot's contemporaries who saw these examples was Jean-Joseph Carriès, who like Bigot had his own studio and was engaged in research on ceramics, knowledge which he began to refine upon meeting Bigot.<ref>{{cite book|language = fr|title = Encyclopédie de l'art|location = Paris, France|publisher = Librairie générale française|year = 1991|isbn = 2-253-05303-1|pages = 186–187}}</ref> The two artists began a correspondence on the subject and Bigot became extremely interested in Carriès' work.{{Sfn|Simier|5=2007|p=74, 90|id=Simier}} Bigot's knowledge of chemistry allowed him to become an adviser to [[Ernest Chaplet]] for his sculpture and Carriès as well as a collaborator with the chemist [[Henry Le Chatelier]].<ref name=\":2\" /> On the practical side (turning and modeling), he benefitted from the advice of [[Raphaël Tessier]] (1860-1937).<ref name=\":1\" />

==Career in Ceramics==
In 1894, Bigot presented his pieces for the first time at the Salon of the Société nationale des Beaux-Arts. The ceramics used a simple form ornamented with matte enamel using shades of yellow, green, and brown, often with the effect of crystallization. In 1895, he participated in the inaugural exposition of Siegfried Bing's La Maison de l'Art Nouveau, which gave its name to the style.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|language=fr|name=Arlette Barré-Despond|title=Dictionnaire international des arts appliqués et du design|location=Paris|publisher=[[Éditions du Regard]]|date=1996|isbn=2-84105-024-6}}</ref>

The year 1897 marked a turning point. Architectural ceramics were reaching the pinnacle of their popularity and Bigot took the opportunity to found his own company, ''A. Bigot et Cie''. This enterprise, which employed up to 150 workers and counted 10 industrial kilns, produced numerous trinkets, vases and vessels which were on display in his shop, which he transferred in Paris from the rue d'Assas to the rue des Petites-Écuries.

Along with Emile Muller, Bigot thus became the principal figure in architectural ceramics in France, and from 1898 he worked to integrate ceramics with façades of reinforced concrete. This architectural outlet explains, by implication, the membership of his company in the Union Syndicale des architetes, but also the relaxation of the urban regulations of 1882 which favored the appearance of projecting elements, such as oriel bays, that broke up the uniformity of façades.

The collaboration with [[Hector Guimard]] at the end of the decade marked the beginning of Bigot's fame with architectural ceramics. Before then his work had been confined essentially to baths and restaurants. But in 1898, Guimard's Castel Beranger emerged as the manifesto of Art Nouveau in architecture and its ceramics were commissioned from Bigot, who decorated the façade with picturesque details and covered the entrance breezeway with highly plastic molded panels designed to evoke the atmosphere of a grotto. The material became thus emblematic of the new style before Art Nouveau's decline about 1910.

Colonel '''James Morris Colquhoun Colvin''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (26 August 1870 – 7 December 1945) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of a [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force.

==Early life==
Colvin was born in [[Bijnor]], [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], [[British India]] to James Colquhoun Colvin of the Manor House, [[Sutton Veny]], Wiltshire, and Camilla Fanny Marie Morris, who was the eldest daughter of the Rev. Edward Morris. Colvin's father serviced with the [[Bengal Civil Service]]. He was awarded the [[India Mutiny]] medal for defending the House of [[Arrah]]. The Colvin family had been involved for a long time in various capacities in the British [[East Indies]], serving as soldiers and administrators. Colvin's extended family members included Sir [[John Russell Colvin]], Lieutenant-Governor of the [[North-West Provinces]] during the Indian Mutiny, and his sons [[Auckland Colvin|Sir Auckland]], [[K.C.S.I.]] and Sir Elliot Graham, K.C.S.I.<ref name=\"VCO\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vconline.org.uk/james-m-c-colvin-vc/4586227191 |title= James Morris Colquhoun Colvin VC |website=vconline.org.uk |url-status=live |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> Their most notable cousin was the English writer and curator Sir [[Sidney Colvin]],<ref>{{cite book |chapter= 15 |page= 112 |title= The Corbould Genealogy |year=1935 |first=George C.

==Military service==
He was educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. There, for distinguished proficiency, he was awarded the Pollock Gold Medal and Memoir as a Cadet Senior Under Officer. He was also awarded the Regulation Sword for exemplary conduct. A travelling clock, aneroid barometer, thermometer and compass were awarded to him for maths and mechanics. [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge]] presented the awards after inspecting cadets at RMA Woolwich, on 26&nbsp;July 1889.<ref name=\"VCO\"/>

On 27&nbsp;July 1889, Colvin joined the Royal Engineers as a [[second lieutenant]]. Three years later, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 27&nbsp;July 1892. He served in the [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]] [[Chitral expedition|Relief Force]] in 1895 with the 4th Company, [[Bengal Sappers and Miners]].<ref name=\"VCO\"/><ref>Hart′s Army list, 1903</ref> He served on the North West Frontier of India with the Malakand Field Force in 1897–1898, and took part in operations in [[Bajaur District|Bajaur]], and in the [[Mohmand District|Mohmand]] country and in [[Buner District|Buner]]. He was mentioned in dispatches.<ref name=\"VCO\"/>  

===Mohmand Campaign===
Colvin was 27 years old, and a [[lieutenant]] in the [[British Army]] [[Corps of Royal Engineers]] during the [[Mohmand campaign of 1897–98]] in [[India]] when his actions resulted in him subsequently being awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].<br/>
Colvin was in the [[Mohmand Valley]], North West [[British India]], with Lieutenant [[Thomas Colclough Watson]] on the night of 16/17 September 1897. Watson collected a party of volunteers and led them into the village of Bilot. They attempted to dislodge the enemy who were inflicting losses on the British. Although Watson had been incapacitated by his wounds, undeterred, Lieutenant Colvin made two additional attempts to clear enemy fighters from the village. \"He was conspicuous during the whole night for his devotion to his men, in the most exposed positions and under very heavy fire.\"<ref name=\"VCOO\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/bbcolvij.htm |title=James Colvin, VC |website=victoriacross.org.uk |url-status=live |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> See also [[James Smith (VC)|James Smith]].<br />

The award of the Victoria Cross was published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 20&nbsp;May 1898. The citation read;

{{Quote|Lieutenant James Morris Colquhoun Colvin, Lieut., Royal Engineers. On the same occasion, after Lieutenant Watson had been incapacitated by his wounds from further effort, Lieutenant Colvin continued the fight and persisted in two more attempts to clear the enemy out of the dark and still burning village. He was conspicuous during the whole night for his devotion to his men in the most exposed positions under a heavy fire from the enemy.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26968|pages=3165–3165|date=20 May 1898}}</ref>}}
Queen Victoria invested Colvin with the Victoria Cross on 19th&nbsp;July 1898 at Windsor Castle. <ref name=\"VCO\"/>.

Two others who served with Colvin were also awarded a Victoria Cross—Lieutenant Thomas Colclough Watson and Corporal James Smith, The Buffs ( East Kent Regiment ).{{efn| The ''London Gazette'' citation for Watson reads:\"This Officer, on the 16th September 1897, at the village of Bilot, in the Mamund Valley, collected a few men of the Buffs ( East Kent Regiment ) and of No. 4 Company, Bengal Sappers and Miners, and led them into the dark and burning village to dislodge some of the enemy who were inflicting loss on our troops. After being wounded and driven back, he made a second attempt to clear the village, and only desisted after a second repulse and being again hit and severely wounded.\"}}

{{efn|The citation for Smith reads:\"On the night of the 16th-17th September 1897, Corporal Smith, with a party of the Buffs, responded to Lieutenant Watson's call for volunteers, and followed that Officer into the burning village of Bilot, driving off the enemy with the bayonet. Afterwards, although wounded, he continued firing steadily and coolly, and also helped to carry the wounded to the place prepared for them. When Lieutenant Watson left, in order to fetch assistance for the wounded, Corporal Smith held the position till that Officer's return, exposing his life freely in watching the enemy and directing the fire of his men.\"}}<ref name=\"VCOO\"/>

Colvin served with the Malakand Field Force, 1897–98, where he took part in operations in Bajaur, the Mohmand Country and in Bruner (mentioned-in-Despatches L.G. 11 January 1898).

===Second Boer War===

Colonel '''James Morris Colquhoun Colvin''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (26 August 1870 – 7 December 1945) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of a [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force.

==Early life==
Colvin was born in [[Bijnor]], [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], [[British India]] to James Colquhoun Colvin of the Manor House, [[Sutton Veny]], Wiltshire, and Camilla Fanny Marie Morris, who was the eldest daughter of the Rev. Edward Morris. Colvin's father serviced with the [[Bengal Civil Service]]. He was awarded the [[India Mutiny]] medal for defending the House of [[Arrah]]. The Colvin family had been involved for a long time in various capacities in the British [[East Indies]], serving as soldiers and administrators. Colvin's extended family members included Sir [[John Russell Colvin]], Lieutenant-Governor of the [[North-West Provinces]] during the Indian Mutiny, and his sons [[Auckland Colvin|Sir Auckland]], [[K.C.S.I.]] and Sir Elliot Graham, K.C.S.I.<ref name=\"VCO\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vconline.org.uk/james-m-c-colvin-vc/4586227191 |title= James Morris Colquhoun Colvin VC |website=vconline.org.uk |url-status=live |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> Their most notable cousin was the English writer and curator Sir [[Sidney Colvin]],<ref>{{cite book |chapter= 15 |page= 112 |title= The Corbould Genealogy |year=1935 |first=George C.

==Military service==
He was educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. There, for distinguished proficiency, he was awarded the Pollock Gold Medal and Memoir as a Cadet Senior Under Officer. He was also awarded the Regulation Sword for exemplary conduct. A travelling clock, aneroid barometer, thermometer and compass were awarded to him for maths and mechanics. [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge]] presented the awards after inspecting cadets at RMA Woolwich, on 26&nbsp;July 1889.<ref name=\"VCO\"/>

On 27&nbsp;July 1889, Colvin joined the Royal Engineers as a [[second lieutenant]]. Three years later, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 27&nbsp;July 1892. He served in the [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]] [[Chitral expedition|Relief Force]] in 1895 with the 4th Company, [[Bengal Sappers and Miners]].<ref name=\"VCO\"/><ref>Hart′s Army list, 1903</ref> He served on the North West Frontier of India with the Malakand Field Force in 1897–1898, and took part in operations in [[Bajaur District|Bajaur]], and in the [[Mohmand District|Mohmand]] country and in [[Buner District|Buner]]. He was mentioned in dispatches.<ref name=\"VCO\"/>  

===Mohmand Campaign===
Colvin was 27 years old, and a [[lieutenant]] in the [[British Army]] [[Corps of Royal Engineers]] during the [[Mohmand campaign of 1897–98]] in [[India]] when his actions resulted in him subsequently being awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].<br/>
Colvin was in the [[Mohmand Valley]], North West [[British India]], with Lieutenant [[Thomas Colclough Watson]] on the night of 16/17 September 1897. Watson collected a party of volunteers and led them into the village of Bilot. They attempted to dislodge the enemy who were inflicting losses on the British. Although Watson had been incapacitated by his wounds, undeterred, Lieutenant Colvin made two additional attempts to clear enemy fighters from the village. \"He was conspicuous during the whole night for his devotion to his men, in the most exposed positions and under very heavy fire.\"<ref name=\"VCOO\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/bbcolvij.htm |title=James Colvin, VC |website=victoriacross.org.uk |url-status=live |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> .<br />

The award of the Victoria Cross was published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 20&nbsp;May 1898. The citation read;

{{Quote|Lieutenant James Morris Colquhoun Colvin, Lieut., Royal Engineers. On the same occasion, after Lieutenant Watson had been incapacitated by his wounds from further effort, Lieutenant Colvin continued the fight and persisted in two more attempts to clear the enemy out of the dark and still burning village. He was conspicuous during the whole night for his devotion to his men in the most exposed positions under a heavy fire from the enemy.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26968|pages=3165–3165|date=20 May 1898}}</ref>}}
Queen Victoria invested Colvin with the Victoria Cross on 19th&nbsp;July 1898 at Windsor Castle. <ref name=\"VCO\"/>.

Two others who served with Colvin were also awarded a Victoria Cross—Lieutenant Thomas Colclough Watson and Corporal [[James Smith (VC)|James Smith]], The Buffs ( East Kent Regiment ).{{efn| The ''London Gazette'' citation for Watson reads:\"This Officer, on the 16th September 1897, at the village of Bilot, in the Mamund Valley, collected a few men of the Buffs ( East Kent Regiment ) and of No. 4 Company, Bengal Sappers and Miners, and led them into the dark and burning village to dislodge some of the enemy who were inflicting loss on our troops. After being wounded and driven back, he made a second attempt to clear the village, and only desisted after a second repulse and being again hit and severely wounded.\"}}

{{efn|The citation for Smith reads:\"On the night of the 16th-17th September 1897, Corporal Smith, with a party of the Buffs, responded to Lieutenant Watson's call for volunteers, and followed that Officer into the burning village of Bilot, driving off the enemy with the bayonet. Afterwards, although wounded, he continued firing steadily and coolly, and also helped to carry the wounded to the place prepared for them. When Lieutenant Watson left, in order to fetch assistance for the wounded, Corporal Smith held the position till that Officer's return, exposing his life freely in watching the enemy and directing the fire of his men.\"}}<ref name=\"VCOO\"/>

Colvin served with the Malakand Field Force, 1897–98, where he took part in operations in Bajaur, the Mohmand Country and in Bruner (mentioned-in-Despatches L.G. 11 January 1898).

'''Edward Alfred Evans''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC}} (4 March 1941 – 12 April 2020) was an Australian senior public servant and economist. From 1993 through 2001, he was [[Departmental secretary|Secretary]] of the [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Department of the Treasury]].

Evans entered into the debate attracting much attention at the time about the significance of the national [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account deficit]] (CAD), arguing that key aspects of worries about the CAD were misplaced. His central argument was that while it was true that the CAD reflected the difference between national savings and investments, more attention should be given to the ways that funds were invested rather than to worries about the need to increase savings.<ref>Ian Henderson. 2001.

As secretary of the Treasury, he was ''ex officio'' member of the boards of several financial institutions.  He was a director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia between 1993 and 1996, and a member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia from 10 May 1993 to 26 April 2001.<ref>Reserve Bank of Australia, '[https://www.rba.gov.au/about-rba/history/rba-board-members.html Past and Present Reserve Bank Board Members'], accessed 13 April 2020.</ref>

Evans was appointed [[Departmental secretary|secretary]] of the Treasury in March 1993<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=8844|archivedate=25 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225080155/http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=8844|title=Statement by the Prime Minister, the Hon P.J.

Evans entered into the debate attracting much attention at the time about the significance of the national [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account deficit]] (CAD), arguing that key aspects of worries about the CAD were misplaced. His central argument was that while it was true that the CAD reflected the difference between national savings and investments, more attention should be given to the ways that funds were invested rather than to worries about the need to increase savings.<ref>Ian Henderson. 2001.

As secretary of the Treasury, he was ''ex officio'' member of the boards of several financial institutions.

==Political and environmental activism==
While in [[Pennington, New Jersey]], Peter Benchley wrote the novel [[Jaws (novel)|''Jaws'']], which became a critical and commercial success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scene4.com/archivesqv6/2014/nov-2014/1114/patrickwalsh1114.html|title=PETER BENCHLEY Patrick Walsh Scene4 Magazine November 2014|website=www.scene4.com|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> The process of researching ‘Jaws’ and the aftermath of the novel’s success and film adaptation left both Peter and Wendy Benchley with a profound interest in sharks and ocean conservation.

Unnoticed by the crew, the [[great white shark]] being filmed got its teeth entangled in the rope that Peter Benchley’s cage was suspended by and was struggling to break free. Wendy was the only one on-board the crew’s boat to notice and she successfully attempted to free the rope from the shark’s mouth before it was severed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benchley |first=Peter |date=2003 |title=Shark Trouble: True Stories About Sharks and the Sea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7r6SDwAAQBAJ&ppis=_c&lpg=PP1&dq=Shark%20Trouble%3A%20True%20Stories%20About%20Sharks%20and%20the%20Sea&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q=wendy&f=false |location= |publisher= |page=45 |isbn=0385901356}}</ref>

While in [[Pennington, New Jersey]], Peter Benchley wrote the novel [[Jaws (novel)|''Jaws'']], which became a critical and commercial success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scene4.com/archivesqv6/2014/nov-2014/1114/patrickwalsh1114.html|title=PETER BENCHLEY Patrick Walsh Scene4 Magazine November 2014|website=www.scene4.com|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> The process of researching ‘Jaws’ and the aftermath of the novel’s success and film adaptation left Peter Benchley with a profound interest in sharks and ocean conservation. The couple subsequently became involved in conservation efforts and traveled internationally to meet with researchers and go [[Shark cage diving|cage diving]] with sharks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sharks on Cape Cod: Just how scared should we be? |last =Swiden |first=Neil|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2019/07/09/sharks-cape-just-how-scared-should/ozDKUj8vEfeFd00BeSGpHJ/story.html|date=July 9, 2019 |accessdate=October 19, 2019 |work=Boston Globe}}</ref> Benchley served as a Board member of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF) from 1986 to 2006<ref>{{cite web |title=Great White Sharks: From Terror of the Seas to Admired Creatures|url=https://guardianlv.com/2014/07/great-white-sharks-from-terror-of-the-seas-to-admired-creatures/|date=July 31, 2015 |accessdate=October 19, 2019}}</ref> and Peter was an EDF spokesperson.

===John Worboys case===

In 2007, aged 19, Symonds was driven home from a [[King's Road]] nightclub by taxi-driver [[John Worboys]], who in 2009 was convicted of multiple sexual assaults on his passengers. She later recalled Worboys offering her champagne and vodka, which she believed was spiked and, after returning home, \"vomiting and laughing hysterically before passing out until 3pm the next day\". Symonds was one of fourteen women who testified against Worboys at his trial. She subsequently told ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' that he was \"a sad, wicked man who is a danger to society. I feel so angry that he pleaded not guilty and made us go through the pain of giving evidence in court\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4987303/John-Worboys-Victim-Carrie-Symonds-story.html|title=John Worboys: Victim Carrie Symonds' story|last=Gammell|first=Caroline|date=13 March 2009 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235 |access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>

'''''Lights of New York''''' is a 1928 American [[crime drama]] film starring [[Helene Costello]], [[Cullen Landis]] and [[Eugene Pallette]], and directed by [[Bryan Foy]]. Filmed in the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] sound system, it is the first [[sound film|all-talking]] full-length feature film, released by [[Warner Bros.]], who had introduced the first feature-length film with synchronized sound ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' two years earlier. The film, which cost $23,000 to produce ([[Low budget|\"B\" picture]]), grossed over $1,000,000. The enthusiasm with which audiences greeted the talkies was so great that by the end of 1929, Hollywood was producing sound films exclusively.

== Plot ==
When [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]s Jake Jackson (Walter Percival) and Dan Dickson (Jere Delaney), who have been hiding out in a small upstate New York town, learn that they finally can return to New York City, they try to convince a young kid named Eddie Morgan (Cullen Landis) and his friend, a local barber named Gene (Eugene Palette) to come with them.

With a promise from Jackson and Dickson that they will help the young men establish a barbershop in the city, Eddie asks his mother, Mrs. Morgan (Mary Carr), who owns the town's Morgan Hotel, to loan them $5,000 of her savings. Eddie and Gene set up the barbershop in New York City but soon learn that it is merely a front for a [[speakeasy]].

Frustrated and yearning for a return to the quiet life, Gene and Eddie vow to go home as soon as they earn enough to pay back Mrs. Morgan. Eddie is in love with Kitty Lewis (top-billed Helene Costello), his hometown sweetheart, who preceded him to New York. Now she is a performer at ''The Night Hawk'', a nightclub owned by Hawk Miller (Wheeler Oakman), notorious bootlegger who controls the speakeasy behind the barbershop. Although Hawk's longtime mistress, Molly Thompson (Gladys Brockwell), warns him not to pursue Kitty, he coldly dismisses her, saying that their relationship is over.

After a police officer is killed in a bootlegging raid of a supply of Old Century liquor, Hawk tells his henchmen, Sam (Tom Dugan) and Collins (Tom McGuire), that they must find someone to take the blame to keep the police from closing him down. They suggest that Hawk frame Eddie, thereby \"killing two birds with one stone.\" When Eddie comes to the club to visit Kitty, Hawk summons him to his office and asks him to hide his supply of Old Century, saying that it is only temporary, in case the police raid his club. When Detective Crosby (Robert Elliott) comes to the club to question Hawk and implies that he is behind the policeman's murder, Hawk says that the only person he knows who has a supply of Old Century is Eddie.

A short time later, Hawk goes to the barbershop and is killed by an unknown assailant. Fearing that they will be blamed, Eddie and Gene put Hawk's body in a barber chair and rub his face with shaving cream just as Crosby arrives at the shop. After Eddie leaves, a nervous Gene pretends to shave Hawk, but the body slides from the chair, revealing its identity to Crosby. Although Gene swears that the absent Eddie is innocent, Crosby deduces that Eddie has gone to Kitty's apartment and follows him there. Crosby is about to arrest Eddie and Kitty, when Molly arrives and reveals that she killed Hawk because he no longer wanted her. As there was a reward for the killer of the policeman, dead or alive, Crosby tells Molly that things will not go badly for her. Now freed from their obligation to Hawk, Kitty and Eddie take the next train home.

== Production ==
Directed by Foy from a script written by Murray Roth and comedian [[Hugh Herbert]], ''Lights of New York'' was originally intended to be a two-reel film with a budget of $12,000, as the studio had not yet committed to regular production of full-length talking films. However, with studio heads [[Harry Warner|Harry]] and [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] out of the country to oversee the European premiere of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the crew gradually elaborated the plot as the seven-day shooting schedule progressed. Louis Halper, who was in charge of the studio while the Warners were away, eventually wired Jack Warner for the additional money needed to finish the film.<ref name=\"sperling\">{{Cite book

Upon discovering that Foy had shot four reels more than promised, Jack Warner ordered him to cut the film back to the original two. Foy later said that the Warners' initial rejection was possibly based on their plans to make the first all-talkie a prestige picture. In an effort to keep the movie off the shelf, Foy screened the picture for an exhibitor friend, who immediately offered to buy it outright for $25,000. Upon hearing this, the Warners asked [[Albert Warner]] to view the film, and his praise of ''Lights'' convinced Jack and Harry that their decision was premature, securing the film's release.<ref name=\"eyman\" />

== Reception ==
Contemporary critical reception of ''Lights of New York'' was decidedly cool. A ''[[New York Times]]'' review, while acknowledging the film's place as \"the alpha of what may develop as the new language of the screen\", called the plot \"crude in the extreme\" and the direction wooden, only singling out the musical interludes for praise.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Hall | first = Mordaunt | author-link = Mordaunt Hall | title = Seven Reels of Speech | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = July 9, 1928 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1928/07/09/archives/seven-reels-of-speech.html | accessdate = February 20, 2015}}</ref> \"Ordinary cast and production\", reported ''[[Film Daily]]''. \"Discard the talking element, and it is just a second-rate [[melodrama|meller]].\"<ref>{{cite news |date=July 15, 1928 |title=Lights of New York |url= |journal=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |page=6 |accessdate= }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was even more harsh in its dismissal, labeling the production \"[[hokum]]ed junk.\" \"In a year from now everyone concerned ''[...]'' will run for the river before looking at it again.\"<ref name=\"song\">{{Cite book | last = Barrios | first = Richard | title = A Song In The Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1995 | location =  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/songindarkbirtho00barr/page/47 47–48] | url = https://archive.org/details/songindarkbirtho00barr/page/47 | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-19-508811-5 | url-access = registration }}</ref> Oliver Claxton of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' also panned the film. \"It would have been better silent, and much better unseen.

=== Box office ===
The criticism did not keep audiences away, although demand may have been driven more by the novelty of the first \"all-talking\" feature film than the film's dramatic qualities. A preview engagement in [[Pasadena, California]], resulted in lines around the block, and the first week's gross at New York City's [[Mark Strand Theater]] amounted to $47,000.<ref name=\"sperling\" /> Upon nationwide release, the film grossed $1.2 million, making the film a box-office success.<ref name=\"eyman\" />

According to Warner Bros records the film had domestic rentals of $1,160,000 and foreign rentals of $92,000.<ref name=\"Warners\"/>

== Preservation status ==
The film and the Vitaphone soundtrack still survive in complete form.  In a formal ceremony on July 24, 1946, Albert Warner presented a print of ''Lights of New York'' to the [[Library of Congress]] as part of a yearlong celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the premiere of the Warner Bros. studio's first sound features.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Frick| first = Caroline| title = Saving Cinema: The Politics of Preservation| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2011| pages = 68| isbn = 0-19-536811-8}}</ref>

The '''American gentry''' were members of the [[American upper class]]es, particularly early in the settlement of the [[United States]].

The [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial American]] use of ''[[gentry]]'' followed the British usage (i.e., [[landed gentry]]) before the independence of the United States. The [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] was commonly evidenced in [[Landed property|land holdings]] by estate owners in Virginia, Maryland and the Carolinas. North of Maryland, there were few large comparable rural estates, except in the Dutch domains in the [[Hudson Valley]] of New York.

The families of Virginia (see [[First Families of Virginia]]) who formed the Virginia gentry class, such as General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s ancestors, were among the earliest settlers in Virginia. Lee's family of [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]] was considered among the oldest of the Virginia [[Gentleman#Robert E. Lee|gentry class]]. Lee's family is one of Virginia's first families, originally arriving in the [[Colony of Virginia]] from the [[Kingdom of England]] in the early 17th century. The family's founder was [[Richard Lee I]], [[Esquire]], \"the Immigrant\" (1618–64), from the county of [[Shropshire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Freeman|1934}}</ref> Robert E. Lee's mother grew up at [[Shirley Plantation]], one of the most elegant homes in Virginia. His maternal great-great grandfather, [[Robert \"King\" Carter]] of [[Corotoman]], was the wealthiest man in [[Thirteen Colonies|the colonies]] when he died in 1732. 

[[Thomas Jefferson]], the patron of American [[agrarianism]], wrote in his ''Notes on Virginia'' (1785), \"Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of [[God]], if He ever had a chosen people, whose breasts He has made His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.\"  Jefferson who spent much of his childhood at [[Tuckahoe Plantation]] was a great-grandson of [[William Randolph]], a colonist and land owner who arrived in Virginia from England in the mid-17th century.

The [[First Families of Virginia]] originated with colonists from England who primarily settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and other navigable waters in the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the 17th century. As there was a propensity to marry within their narrow social scope for many generations, many descendants bear surnames which became common in the growing colony.

Many of the original English colonists considered members of the First Families of Virginia emigrated to the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642–1660). Royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II is reputed to have called Virginia his \"Old Dominion\", a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \"distressed Cavaliers\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Many Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. Thus, it came to be that the First Families of Virginia often refer to Virginia as \"Cavalier Country\". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but they had settled Virginia and so remained in Virginia.

Most of such early settlers in Virginia were so-called \"Second Sons\".  [[Primogeniture]] favored first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Virginia evolved in a society of second or third sons of English aristocracy who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of the southern elite in America.

Many of the great Virginia dynasties traced their roots to families like the [[Lee family|Lees]] and the Fitzhughs, who traced their lineage to England's county families and baronial legacies. Some, however, came from much more humble origins; such families as the Shackelfords, who gave their name to a Virginia hamlet, rose from modest beginnings in England to a place in the Virginia firmament. Some families, like the Gilliams, arrived in Virginia in the 17th century as [[indentured servants]]; by the late 18th century they had amassed several large plantations, including [[Weston Manor]], and became landed gentry in the colony.  Families such as the [[Mathews family|Mathews]] from later [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish immigration]] also formed political dynasties in Old Virginia. At the same time, other once-great families were decimated not only by the [[English Civil War]], but also by the enormous power of the London merchants to whom they were in debt and who could move markets \"with the stroke of a pen.\"

The [[Colonial families of Maryland]] were the leading families in the [[Province of Maryland]]. Several also had interests in the [[Colony of Virginia]], and the two are sometimes referred to as the [[Chesapeake Colonies]]. Many of the early settlers came from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in England, although the Maryland families were composed of a variety of European nationalities, e.g. French, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, and Swedish, in addition to English.

The Carroll family is an example of a prominent political family from Maryland, of Irish descent and origin in the ancient kingdom of Éile, commonly anglicized Ely, as a branch of the ruling O'Carroll family. Another is the Mason family of Virginia, who descended from the progenitor of the Mason family, [[George Mason I]], a [[Cavalier]] member of the [[Parliament of England]] born in Worcestershire, England.  The Riggin family of Maryland who also had holdings on the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is of Irish descent and origin in the [[Kingdom of Munster]]. Riggin, sometimes spelled Riggen or Regan is an anglicization of the [[Irish language|Irish]] surname Reagh.  The Riggins are descended from [[Cormac na Haoine MacCarthy Reagh]], the 13th prince of [[Carbery (barony)|Carbery]]. Their ancestral home, [[Kilbrittain|Kilbrittain Castle]] near [[Kinsale]] was the principal seat of the [[MacCarthy Reagh]] family, Princes of Carbery, from the early 15th century.<ref>https://www.geni.com/people/Teague-Riggin-Sr/6000000006348527210</ref><ref>https://www.colonial-settlers-md-va.us/getperson.php?personID=I094665&tree=Tree1</ref>

[[Charles I of England]] granted the province [[County palatine|palatinate]] status under [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]]. The foundational charter created an aristocracy of [[lords of the manor]] for Maryland. Maryland was uniquely created as a colony for [[Catholic church|Catholic]] aristocracy and [[landed gentry]], but [[Anglicanism]] eventually came to dominate, partly through influence from neighboring Virginia.

==Biography==

Lyfe Jennings was born on June 3, 1978 in [[Toledo, Ohio]] to a working-class family and was the middle of five kids. As stated in  \"Ghetto Superman\" and \"More Than A Girl\" from ''[[The Phoenix (Lyfe Jennings album)|The Phoenix]]'', Lyfe lost his father at a young age. When he was a teenager, Lyfe Jennings started to perform with the group called \"The Dotsons\". \"The Dotsons\" consisted of himself, his brother, and two cousins. In the beginning of the 90s, however, the band disbanded. During this time, Lyfe  began to get into legal trouble and his musical career came to a halt when he was sent to prison at then age of 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/events/2008/feb/01/407/|title=Lyfe Jennings: Friday, Feb. 1, 9 p.m. -|website=lasvegassun.com}}</ref>

==Career==

===2002-2005===

In 2002, after serving 10 years in prison, Lyfe returned to his musical aspirations. Two days after his December 2002 release from prison, he recorded a four-song demo CD.After a month post release, he performed at the Apollo. He was booed as he walked onto the stage, but when the Apollo audience heard his gritty falsetto and lyrical songwriting, they were swayed to the tune of five amateur-night victories in a row. Lyfe sold about 1,000 copies of his four-song demo CD during his Apollo \"residency.\" His growing success, influenced Lyfe to move to [[New York City]] and pursue a major-label deal. [[Columbia Records]] provided him with a contract and released his debut, [[Lyfe 268-192]] in August 2004. A year after its original release, the album was reissued with a new version of \"Hypothetically\" added as bonus track featuring American Idol winner, Fantasia.

===2005-2013===

Lyfe released a more hip-hop-oriented follow-up ''[[The Phoenix (Lyfe Jennings album)|The Phoenix]]'' arrived in August 2006, with [[Three 6 Mafia]] and [[Young Buck]] making guest appearances. ''[[Lyfe Change]]'' released in April 2008, featuring a handful of new production associates as well as a verse from rapper [[T.I.]]. Subsequently, Lyfe accepted a new deal with [[Warner Bros.]] and began working on another album, tentatively titled Sooner or Later, which he stated would be his last. The album was finally released in August 2010 and featured guest spots from [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], [[Warryn Campbell]], Fabolous, [[Bobby Valentino (American musician)|Bobby Valentino]], [[Ludacris]], [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]], and [[Jazmine Sullivan]]. Lyfe completed another prison stint for his actions stemming from a 2008 domestic dispute.

===2013-Present===

He returned to music in October 2013 with ''[[Lucid (album)|Lucid]]'', released on the Mass Appeal label. Like all of his previous studio releases, it peaked in the Top 10 of Billboard's R&B chart. Tree of Lyfe, recorded primarily in his home studio, followed in June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/308649/lyfe-jennings/biography|title=Lyfe Jennings|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/jennings-lyfe|title=Jennings, Lyfe - Dictionary definition of Jennings, Lyfe - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/lyfe-jennings/3035923|title=Lyfe Jennings Biography - ARTISTdirect Music|website=www.artistdirect.com}}</ref> On his new album, ''Tree of Lyfe'', Lyfe Jennings describes it as his most personal work to date and produced the majority of the album at  his home studio in Greenwood, Mississippi . When asked about his current musical mindset, Lyfe Jennings response is one of reflection and experience, \"Everybody feels like they have to reinvent themselves. I don’t think you can reinvent the truth. It is what it is. I’m not focused on reinvention. I want to go deeper. This album reaffirms the reasons why people started loving this music in the first place.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s2smagazine.com/2015/03/26/exclusive-s2s-visits-lyfe-jennings-at-home-talks-fatherhood-music-sings-new-song-love-video/|title=[EXCLUSIVE] S2S Visits Lyfe Jennings At Home [VIDEO] - S2SMagazine.com|work=S2SMagazine.com|access-date=April 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416004215/http://s2smagazine.com/2015/03/26/exclusive-s2s-visits-lyfe-jennings-at-home-talks-fatherhood-music-sings-new-song-love-video/|archive-date=April 16, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jetmag.com/entertainment/radio-active/jet-interview-lyfe-jennings/|title=JET Interview with Lyfe Jennings|work=JetMag.com}}</ref>

==Biography==

Lyfe Jennings was born on June 3, 1978 in [[Toledo, Ohio]] to a working-class family and was the middle of five kids. As stated in  \"Ghetto Superman\" and \"More Than A Girl\" from ''[[The Phoenix (Lyfe Jennings album)|The Phoenix]]'', Lyfe lost his father at a young age. When he was a teenager, Lyfe Jennings started to perform with the group called \"The Dotsons\". \"The Dotsons\" consisted of himself, his brother, and two cousins. In the beginning of the 90s, however, the band disbanded. During this time, Lyfe  began to get into legal trouble and his musical career came to a halt when he was sent to prison at then age of 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/events/2008/feb/01/407/|title=Lyfe Jennings: Friday, Feb. 1, 9 p.m. -|website=lasvegassun.com}}</ref>

==Career==

===2002-2005===

In 2002, after serving 10 years in prison, Lyfe returned to his musical aspirations. Two days after his December 2002 release from prison, he recorded a four-song demo CD.After a month post release, he performed at the Apollo. He was booed as he walked onto the stage, but when the Apollo audience heard his gritty falsetto and lyrical songwriting, they were swayed to the tune of five amateur-night victories in a row. Lyfe sold about 1,000 copies of his four-song demo CD during his Apollo \"residency.\" His growing success, influenced Lyfe to move to [[New York City]] and pursue a major-label deal. [[Columbia Records]] provided him with a contract and released his debut, [[Lyfe 268-192]] in August 2004. A year after its original release, the album was reissued with a new version of \"Hypothetically\" added as bonus track featuring American Idol winner, Fantasia.

===2005-2013===

Lyfe released a more hip-hop-oriented follow-up ''[[The Phoenix (Lyfe Jennings album)|The Phoenix]]'' arrived in August 2006, with [[Three 6 Mafia]] and [[Young Buck]] making guest appearances. [[Lyfe Change]] released in April 2008, featuring a handful of new production associates as well as a verse from [[T.I.]] Jennings. Subsequently, Lyfe accepted a new deal with [[Warner Bros.]] and began working on another album, tentatively titled Sooner or Later, which he stated would be his last. The album was finally released in August 2010 and featured guest spots from [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], [[Warryn Campbell]], Fabolous, [[Bobby Valentino (American musician)|Bobby Valentino]], [[Ludacris]], [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]], and [[Jazmine Sullivan]]. Lyfe completed another prison stint for his actions stemming from a 2008 domestic dispute.

===2013-Present===

He returned to music in October 2013 with ''[[Lucid (album)|Lucid]]'', released on the Mass Appeal label. Like all of his previous studio releases, it peaked in the Top 10 of Billboard's R&B chart. Tree of Lyfe, recorded primarily in his home studio, followed in June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/308649/lyfe-jennings/biography|title=Lyfe Jennings|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/jennings-lyfe|title=Jennings, Lyfe - Dictionary definition of Jennings, Lyfe - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/lyfe-jennings/3035923|title=Lyfe Jennings Biography - ARTISTdirect Music|website=www.artistdirect.com}}</ref> On his new album, ''Tree of Lyfe'', Lyfe Jennings describes it as his most personal work to date and produced the majority of the album at  his home studio in Greenwood, Mississippi . When asked about his current musical mindset, Lyfe Jennings response is one of reflection and experience, \"Everybody feels like they have to reinvent themselves. I don’t think you can reinvent the truth. It is what it is. I’m not focused on reinvention. I want to go deeper. This album reaffirms the reasons why people started loving this music in the first place.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s2smagazine.com/2015/03/26/exclusive-s2s-visits-lyfe-jennings-at-home-talks-fatherhood-music-sings-new-song-love-video/|title=[EXCLUSIVE] S2S Visits Lyfe Jennings At Home [VIDEO] - S2SMagazine.com|work=S2SMagazine.com|access-date=April 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416004215/http://s2smagazine.com/2015/03/26/exclusive-s2s-visits-lyfe-jennings-at-home-talks-fatherhood-music-sings-new-song-love-video/|archive-date=April 16, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jetmag.com/entertainment/radio-active/jet-interview-lyfe-jennings/|title=JET Interview with Lyfe Jennings|work=JetMag.com}}</ref>

The organization is the originator of the [[Housing First]] model of addressing homelessness among people with severe psychiatric disabilities and substance use disorders. In Los Angeles, California in 1988, the \"Housing First\" Program at Beyond Shelter  was launched by Tanya Tull in response to a sharp increase in the number of homeless families with children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.ashoka.org/fellow/tanya-tull|title=Profile for Tanya Tull, Ashoka Fellowship|year=2009|accessdate=February 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140212234946/http://usa.ashoka.org/fellow/tanya-tull|archivedate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> As an innovative model, [[Housing First]] has been nationally successful at addressing homelessness largely due to its focus on consumer choice.<ref name=\"Tsemberis, S. 2004 p. 651-656\">Tsemberis, S., Gulcur, L. and Nakae, M. (2004). Housing first, consumer choice and harm reduction for homeless individuals with a dual diagnosis. American Journal of Public Health, 94, 4, p. 651-656.</ref>  Consumers choose the neighborhoods they want to live in, how their apartments are furnished, and all other decisions regarding the use of their new homes.  Consumers also determine the frequency, duration, and intensity of the support and treatment services they receive.  Consumers feel secure knowing housing will be held for them during relapse, psychiatric crisis or short incarcerations.  Most importantly though, consumers know they have a voice and often attend Tenant Advisory Council meetings, which provides a forum for input into the program and solicits ideas for changes to meet new needs.<ref>[http://www.pathwaystohousing.org/content/housing_and_services Pathways to Housing - Housing and Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326163219/http://pathwaystohousing.org/content/housing_and_services |date=2010-03-26 }} Retrieved October 27, 2010.</ref>

Using this consumer-driven approach, Pathways to Housing has achieved remarkable success in housing retention for its target population.  In one federally funded longitudinal random assignment study, 80% of the participants assigned to Pathways to Housing were in stable housing after 12 months compared to 24% for the three-step [https://web.archive.org/web/20071224145153/http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/programs/coc/ Continuum of Care] programs.<ref name=\"Tsemberis, S. 2004 p. 651-656\"/> Housing serves approximately 700 individuals living in supported scattered-site apartments throughout [[New York City]]; [[Westchester County, New York]]; [[the District of Columbia]], [[Burlington, Vermont]] and [[Philadelphia]].

== History ==
In a widely cited article entitled Pathways to Housing, published in 2000, Tsemberis and Eisenberg reported on a study undertaken from 1993 to 1997 examining the effectiveness of a five-year (1993-1997)  Pathways to Housing supported housing program on 242 clients with severe psychiatric disabilities and addictions in New York City. During that time Pathways to Housing provided \"immediate access to independent scatter-site apartments for individuals with psychiatric disabilities who were homeless and living on the street.\" With an 88 percent retention rate, the \"supported housing program achieved better housing tenure than did the comparison group.\"<ref name=Tsemberis2000>{{cite journal|last1=Tsemberis |first1=S|last2=Eisenberg|first2= RF|title=Pathways to housing: supported housing for street-dwelling homeless individuals with psychiatric disabilities|journal=Psychiatric Services|date=April 2000|volume=51|number=4|pages=487–493|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.51.4.487|pmid=10737824}}</ref>

By 2007 Pathways to Housing had an annual operating budget of $15M and was funded by grants from city, state and federal government, individual contributions, foundation grants and corporate support.<ref name=\"2007report\">{{cite report|url=http://www.pathwaystohousing.org/Articles/PTHPublications/FINAL_AnnualReport_2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Pathways to Housing 2007 Annual Report|year=2007|publisher=Pathways to Housing}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> By 2012 Pathways to Housing had successfully housed over 3,000 people with 85-90% retention since 2002.<ref name=\"2012report\">{{cite report|url=http://pathwaystohousing.org/wp-content/themes/pathways/assets/files/2012_Annual_Report.pdf|format=PDF|title=Pathways to Housing 2012 Annual Report|year=2012|publisher=Pathways to Housing|accessdate=February 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222023950/http://pathwaystohousing.org/wp-content/themes/pathways/assets/files/2012_Annual_Report.pdf|archivedate=February 22, 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, Pathways to Housing set up a mobile video exhibit at nine locations in New York City where there were over 36,000 homeless people in 2009.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/home/home.shtml \"NYC Homeless Counts\"], ''New York City Department of Homeless Services'', 2009.</ref>  The exhibit featured an image of a homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk in downtown Manhattan projected on to a building.  Words also projected asked passersby to send a text message to help get him off the streets.  A text message sent triggered a new video loop in which the man gets up and walks in the door of his new apartment. The idea is to convey visually the organization’s approach to combatting homelessness, which emphasizes getting people who are homeless into housing first and then tackling issues like mental health and addiction.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/09/video-installation-encour_n_492377.html \"Video Installation Encourages Homeless Activism In New York City\"], ''Huffington Post'', March 9, 2010.</ref><ref>Memmott, Mark.

Most importantly though, consumers know they have a voice and often attend Tenant Advisory Council meetings, which provides a forum for input into the program and solicits ideas for changes to meet new needs.<ref>[http://www.pathwaystohousing.org/content/housing_and_services Pathways to Housing - Housing and Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326163219/http://pathwaystohousing.org/content/housing_and_services |date=2010-03-26 }} Retrieved October 27, 2010.</ref>

Using this consumer-driven approach, Pathways to Housing has achieved remarkable success in housing retention for its target population.

During that time Pathways to Housing provided \"immediate access to independent scatter-site apartments for individuals with psychiatric disabilities who were homeless and living on the street.\" With an 88 percent retention rate, the \"supported housing program achieved better housing tenure than did the comparison group.\"<ref name=Tsemberis2000>{{cite journal|last1=Tsemberis |first1=S|last2=Eisenberg|first2= RF|title=Pathways to housing: supported housing for street-dwelling homeless individuals with psychiatric disabilities|journal=Psychiatric Services|date=April 2000|volume=51|number=4|pages=487–493|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.51.4.487|pmid=10737824}}</ref>

Cilices were originally made from sackcloth or coarse animal hair so they would irritate the skin. Other features were added to make cilices more uncomfortable, such as thin wires or twigs. In modern religious circles, cilices are simply any device worn for the same purposes.

==Etymology==

The word ''cilice'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''cilicium'', a covering made of goat's hair from [[Cilicia]], a Roman [[province]] in south-east [[Asia Minor]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cilice|title= Cilice|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> The reputed first Scriptural use of this exact term is in the [[Vulgate]] (Latin) translation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 35:13, ''\"Ego autem, cum mihi molesti essent, induebar cilicio.\"''  (\"But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth\" in the King James Bible).  The term is translated as ''hair-cloth'' in the [[Douay–Rheims Bible]], and as ''sackcloth'' in the [[King James Bible]] and [[Book of Common Prayer]].  Sackcloth can also mean [[burlap]], but is often mentioned as a symbol of [[mourning]] and was probably a form of hairshirt. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Use==
[[Image:St Aspais Melun - cilice.jpg|thumb|300px|Cilice of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]] at St. Aspais Church, [[Melun]], [[France]]]]
[[File:Ivan the Terrible's cilice 02 by shakko.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Ivan the Terrible]]'s cilice (16th century). The tsar wanted to die like a monk.]]

There is some evidence, based on analyses of both clothing represented in art and preserved skin imprint patterns at [[Çatalhöyük]] in Turkey, that the usage of the cilice predates written history. This finding has been mirrored at [[Göbekli Tepe]], another [[Anatolia|Anatolian]] site, indicating the widespread manufacturing of cilices. Ian Hodder has argued that \"self-injuring clothing was an essential component of the Catalhöyük culturo-ritual entanglement, representing 'cleansing' and 'lightness'.\"<ref>Ian Hodder, \"Çatalhöyük: The Leopard's Tale\", Thames & Hudson, 2006.</ref>

In Biblical times, it was the [[Jewish]] custom to wear a hairshirt (sackcloth) when mourning (Genesis 37:34, 2 Samuel 3:31, Esther 4:1), but not in order to cause harm to oneself, which is forbidden in the Jewish religion.{{cn|date=February 2020}} In the [[New Testament]], [[John the Baptist]] wore \"a garment of camel’s hair\" (Matthew 3:4). Historically, some [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations have worn sackcloth to [[mortification of the flesh|mortify the flesh]] or as [[penance]] for adorning oneself.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

Cilices have been used for centuries in the [[Catholic Church]] as a mild form of bodily penance akin to [[fasting]]. [[Thomas Becket]] was wearing a hairshirt when he was [[martyr]]ed,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barlow|first=Frank|title=Thomas Becket|publisher=The Folio Society|year=2002|isbn=|location=London|pages=299, 314}}</ref> [[St. Patrick]] reputedly wore a cilice, [[Charlemagne]] was buried in a hairshirt{{cn|date=February 2020}}, and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany, famously wore one in the [[Walk to Canossa]] during the [[Investiture Controversy]]{{cn|date=February 2020}}. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was found to be wearing a hairshirt at the time of his death in 1460.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]], [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius Loyola]] and [[Thérèse of Lisieux|St. Therese of Lisieux]] are known to have used them{{cn|date=February 2020}}.

Allen Jr.|John Allen]], an American Catholic writer, its practice in the Catholic Church is \"more widespread than many observers imagine\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=173}}

Some high church Anglicans, including [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], wore hairshirts as a part of their spirituality.<ref name=\"KnightMason2006\"/>

In the Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]], influenced by the [[Evangelical revival in Scotland|evangelical revival]], penitents were dressed in sackcloth and called in front of the [[chancel]], where they were asked to admit their sins.<ref name=\"Yates2014\"/>

In some Methodist churches, on [[Ash Wednesday]], communicants, along with receiving ashes, also receive a piece of sackcloth \"as a reminder of our own sinful ways and need for repentance\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsrushville.org/2017/03/11/sackcloth/|title=Sackcloth|last=Ice|first=Roy E.|date=11 March 2017|publisher=St Paul's United Methodist Church|language=English|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref>

The sensationalized depiction in the novel has been criticized for its inaccuracy in subsequent books and by Opus Dei itself, which issued a press release responding to the movie's depiction of the practice, claiming \"In reality, they cause a fairly low level of discomfort comparable to fasting.

Cilices were originally made from sackcloth or coarse animal hair so they would irritate the skin. Other features were added to make cilices more uncomfortable, such as thin wires or twigs. In modern religious circles, cilices are simply any device worn for the same purposes.

==Etymology==

The word ''cilice'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''cilicium'', a covering made of goat's hair from [[Cilicia]], a Roman [[province]] in south-east [[Asia Minor]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cilice|title= Cilice|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> The reputed first Scriptural use of this exact term is in the [[Vulgate]] (Latin) translation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 35:13, ''\"Ego autem, cum mihi molesti essent, induebar cilicio.\"''  (\"But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth\" in the King James Bible).  The term is translated as ''hair-cloth'' in the [[Douay–Rheims Bible]], and as ''sackcloth'' in the [[King James Bible]] and [[Book of Common Prayer]].  Sackcloth can also mean [[burlap]], but is often mentioned as a symbol of [[mourning]] and was probably a form of hairshirt. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Use==
[[Image:St Aspais Melun - cilice.jpg|thumb|300px|Cilice of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]] at St. Aspais Church, [[Melun]], [[France]]]]
[[File:Ivan the Terrible's cilice 02 by shakko.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Ivan the Terrible]]'s cilice (16th century). The tsar wanted to die like a monk.]]

There is some evidence, based on analyses of both clothing represented in art and preserved skin imprint patterns at [[Çatalhöyük]] in Turkey, that the usage of the cilice predates written history. This finding has been mirrored at [[Göbekli Tepe]], another [[Anatolia|Anatolian]] site, indicating the widespread manufacturing of cilices. Ian Hodder has argued that \"self-injuring clothing was an essential component of the Catalhöyük culturo-ritual entanglement, representing 'cleansing' and 'lightness'.\"<ref>Ian Hodder, \"Çatalhöyük: The Leopard's Tale\", Thames & Hudson, 2006.</ref>

In Biblical times, it was the [[Jewish]] custom to wear a hairshirt (sackcloth) when mourning (Genesis 37:34, 2 Samuel 3:31, Esther 4:1), but not in order to cause harm to oneself, which is forbidden in the Jewish religion.{{cn|date=February 2020}} In the [[New Testament]], [[John the Baptist]] wore \"a garment of camel’s hair\" (Matthew 3:4). Historically, some [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations have worn sackcloth to [[mortification of the flesh|mortify the flesh]] or as [[penance]] for adorning oneself.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

Cilices have been used for centuries in the [[Catholic Church]] as a mild form of bodily penance akin to [[fasting]]. [[Thomas Becket]] was wearing a hairshirt when he was [[martyr]]ed{{cn|date=February 2020}}, [[St. Patrick]] reputedly wore a cilice, [[Charlemagne]] was buried in a hairshirt{{cn|date=February 2020}}, and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany, famously wore one in the [[Walk to Canossa]] during the [[Investiture Controversy]]{{cn|date=February 2020}}. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was found to be wearing a hairshirt at the time of his death in 1460.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]], [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius Loyola]] and [[Thérèse of Lisieux|St. Therese of Lisieux]] are known to have used them{{cn|date=February 2020}}. In modern times they have been used by [[Mother Teresa]], [[Pio of Pietrelcina|St. Padre Pio]], and [[Pope Paul VI]].<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=16367|title=Opus Dei|date=17 May 2006|work=opusdei.us}}</ref> In the [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] convent of St. Teresa in Livorno, Italy, members of [[Opus Dei]] who are celibate (about 30% of the membership), and the [[Franciscan]] Brothers and Sisters of the Immaculate Conception continue an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] use of the cilice.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=165, 169, 171–173}} According to [[John L. Allen Jr.|John Allen]], an American Catholic writer, its practice in the Catholic Church is \"more widespread than many observers imagine\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=173}}

Some high church Anglicans, including [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], wore hairshirts as a part of their spirituality.<ref name=\"KnightMason2006\"/>

In the Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]], influenced by the [[Evangelical revival in Scotland|evangelical revival]], penitents were dressed in sackcloth and called in front of the [[chancel]], where they were asked to admit their sins.<ref name=\"Yates2014\"/>

In some Methodist churches, on [[Ash Wednesday]], communicants, along with receiving ashes, also receive a piece of sackcloth \"as a reminder of our own sinful ways and need for repentance\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsrushville.org/2017/03/11/sackcloth/|title=Sackcloth|last=Ice|first=Roy E.|date=11 March 2017|publisher=St Paul's United Methodist Church|language=English|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
[[File:Cilice3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Closeup of a metal cilice with inwardly-pointing [[Tine (structural)|tines]]]]
In [[Dan Brown|Dan Brown's]] novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', one of the [[Antagonist (literature)|antagonists]], an [[Albinism|albino]] [[Types of membership of Opus Dei|numerary]] named [[List of The Da Vinci Code characters#Silas|Silas]] associated with the religious organization [[Opus Dei]], wears a cilice in the form of a spiked belt around his thigh. The sensationalized depiction in the novel has been criticized for its inaccuracy in subsequent books and by Opus Dei itself, which issued a press release responding to the movie's depiction of the practice, claiming \"In reality, they cause a fairly low level of discomfort comparable to fasting. There is no blood, no injury, nothing to harm a person's health, nothing traumatic. If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it.\"<ref name=\"press release\"/>{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=162–163}}

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />

== Reproduction ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. 

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

'''Stéphane Auguste Ernest N. Demol''' (born 11 March 1966) is a Belgian former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and a current [[Manager (association football)|manager]].

He amassed [[Belgian First Division A]] totals of 120 games and 11 goals over the course of seven seasons, mainly with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] and [[Standard Liège]] with which he won eight major titles combined. He also competed professionally in Italy, Portugal, France, Greece and Switzerland.

Demol represented [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]]. In 2000 he started a managerial career, going on to work in several countries.

==Club career==
Born in [[Watermael-Boitsfort]], [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]], Demol joined local [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]]'s youth system at the age of 14, moving to the first-team setup four years later and scoring four [[Belgian First Division A]] goals in just 17 matches in [[1985–86 Belgian First Division|his first full professional season]], as the [[Brussels|capital]] side renewed their domestic supremacy.

Demol soon became noticed by several clubs abroad, moving to Italy for [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna FC]], but his breakthrough would arrive the following year, in Portugal with [[FC Porto]]: he scored an astonishing 11 [[Primeira Liga]] goals, and helped his team [[1989–90 Primeira Liga|win the national championship]].

Demol moved countries again after just one year, now signing with French side [[Toulouse FC]], but he returned in late 1991 to his country after joining [[Standard Liège]], where he helped to consecutive [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] qualifications, finishing second to Anderlecht in [[1992–93 Belgian First Division|his second year]].

Aged 27, Demol signed with [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge KSV]], but did not receive regular playing time. He subsequently returned for another abroad spell, being equally unsuccessful for [[S.C. Braga]], [[Panionios G.S.S.|Panionios GSS]], [[FC Lugano]] and [[Sporting Toulon Var]] (the latter in the [[Ligue 2|French second division]]).

Demol ended his career in 2000 at 34, after playing one year apiece with [[F.C. Verbroedering Dender Eendracht Hekelgem|FC Denderleeuw]] and amateurs SK Halle, in which he began his manager career. In 2005, after several brief head coaching spells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=248361.html|title=Egaleo eager to shine|publisher=UEFA.com|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=23 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=727674.html|title=Demol models 2008 range|publisher=UEFA.com|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=23 December 2009}}</ref> he became assistant manager at former club Standard Liège, helping it to [[2005–06 Belgian First Division|another runner-up position]], trailing, once again, Anderlecht.

On 2 November 2009, Demol quit [[R. Charleroi S.C.]] due to poor results.<ref>[http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=46289 Demol: «Nos points de vue respectifs étaient divergents» (Demol: «We had different points of view»)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104023821/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=46289 |date=4 November 2009 }}; Footgoal, 2 November 2009 (in French)</ref> On 15 February 2012, he was appointed at [[RWDM Brussels FC|FC Brussels]].

==International career==
Demol played 38 matches for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] and scored one goal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/miscellaneous/belg-recintlp.html|title=Belgium – Record International Players|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]|author=Mamrud, Roberto|date=16 July 2009|accessdate=20 August 2009}}</ref> heading home in the [[Single-elimination tournament|round-of-16]] clash against the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Mexico]] (4–3 after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]]).<ref name=\"MD\">{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1986/06/16/pagina-5/1140749/pdf.html|title=4–3: La prórroga clasificó a Bélgica|trans-title=4–3: Extra time qualified Belgium|publisher=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|language=es|date=16 June 1986|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>

In 2006, his good friend and ex-teammate [[René Vandereycken]] became the Red Devils' coach, and he invited Demol to become its assistant manager. He left the post two years later, returning to club action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportmagazine.knack.be/sport/voetbal-nationaal/vandereycken-zoekt-job-in-het-buitenland/article-normal-162593.html|title=Vandereycken zoekt job in het buitenland|trans-title=Vandereycken looking for job abroad|publisher=Sport Voetbal Magazine|language=nl|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>

Braga]], [[Panionios G.S.S.|Panionios GSS]], [[FC Lugano]] and [[Sporting Toulon Var]] (the latter in the [[Ligue 2|French second division]]).

Demol ended his career in 2000 at 34, after playing one year apiece with [[F.C. Verbroedering Dender Eendracht Hekelgem|FC Denderleeuw]] and amateurs SK Halle, in which he began his manager career. In 2005, after several brief head coaching spells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=248361.html|title=Egaleo eager to shine|publisher=UEFA.com|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=23 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=727674.html|title=Demol models 2008 range|publisher=UEFA.com|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=23 December 2009}}</ref> he became assistant manager at former club Standard Liège, helping it to [[2005–06 Belgian First Division|another runner-up position]], trailing, once again, Anderlecht.

On 2 November 2009, Demol quit [[R. Charleroi S.C.]] due to poor results.<ref>[http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=46289 Demol: «Nos points de vue respectifs étaient divergents» (Demol: «We had different points of view»)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104023821/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=46289 |date=4 November 2009 }}; Footgoal, 2 November 2009 (in French)</ref> On 15 February 2012, he was appointed at [[RWDM Brussels FC|FC Brussels]].

==International career==
Demol played 38 matches for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] and scored one goal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/miscellaneous/belg-recintlp.html|title=Belgium – Record International Players|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]|author=Mamrud, Roberto|date=16 July 2009|accessdate=20 August 2009}}</ref> heading home in the [[Single-elimination tournament|round-of-16]] clash against the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Mexico]] (4–3 after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]]).<ref name=\"MD\">{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1986/06/16/pagina-5/1140749/pdf.html|title=4–3: La prórroga clasificó a Bélgica|trans-title=4–3: Extra time qualified Belgium|publisher=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|language=es|date=16 June 1986|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>

In 2006, his good friend and ex-teammate [[René Vandereycken]] became the Red Devils' coach, and he invited Demol to become its assistant manager. He left the post two years later, returning to club action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportmagazine.knack.be/sport/voetbal-nationaal/vandereycken-zoekt-job-in-het-buitenland/article-normal-162593.html|title=Vandereycken zoekt job in het buitenland|trans-title=Vandereycken looking for job abroad|publisher=Sport Voetbal Magazine|language=nl|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>

{{pull quote|Welcome to the 21st Century.

Hauben describes the distinction to Internet users in general by saying:<ref>{{cite web|last1=DeLoach|first1=Amelia|title=What is a Netizen?|url=http://www.december.com/cmc/mag/1996/sep/netizen.html|accessdate=6 June 2015|date=September 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The need for a Netizens Association|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/text/netizen-a-call.html|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=March 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hauben|first1=Michael|last2=Hauben|first2=Ronda|title=What is a Netizen?|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/606/527|publisher=first monday|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=November 1995}}</ref>
{{pull quote|Netizens are not just anyone who comes on-line, and they are especially not people who come on-line for isolated gain or profit. They are not people who come to the Net thinking it is a service. Rather they are people who understand it takes effort and action on each and everyone's part to make the Net a regenerative and vibrant community and resource. Netizens are people who decide to devote time and effort into making the Net, this new part of our world, a better place.<br/>[[Lurker]]s are not Netizens, and vanity home pages are not the work of Netizens. While lurking or trivial home pages do not harm the Net, they do not contribute either.}}

==In China==<!--or \"Usage of the term/word in China?-->
{{See also|Internet in China}}
In Chinese, the terms ''wǎngmín'' (网民, literally \"net-people\") and ''wǎngyǒu'' (网友, literally \"net-friend\") are commonly used terms meaning \"Internet users\", and the English word ''netizen'' is used by [[mainland China]]-based [[English language]] media to translate both terms, resulting in the frequent appearance of that English word in media reporting about China, far more frequently than the use of the word in other contexts.<ref>Brian Fung, \"[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/netizen-why-is-this-goofy-sounding-word-so-important-in-china/263245/ 'Netizen': Why Is This Goofy-Sounding Word So Important in China?]\", ''The Atlantic'', 11 October 2012</ref><ref>Matt Schiavenza, \"[https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/09/enough-with-the-word-netizen/279969/ Enough with the word \"Netizen\"]\", ''The Atlantic'', 25 September 2013</ref>

You are a Netizen (a Net Citizen), and you exist as [[Global citizenship|a citizen of the world]] thanks to the global connectivity that the Net makes possible. You consider everyone as your compatriot. You physically live in one country but you are in contact with much of the world via the global computer network. Virtually, you live next door to every other single Netizen in the world. Geographical separation is replaced by existence in the same [[cyberspace|virtual space]].|author=[[Michael Hauben]]|source=The Net and Netizens: The Impact the Net Has on People's Lives<ref name=\"heise\"/>}}

Hauben describes the distinction to Internet users in general by saying:<ref>{{cite web|last1=DeLoach|first1=Amelia|title=What is a Netizen?|url=http://www.december.com/cmc/mag/1996/sep/netizen.html|accessdate=6 June 2015|date=September 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The need for a Netizens Association|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/text/netizen-a-call.html|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=March 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hauben|first1=Michael|last2=Hauben|first2=Ronda|title=What is a Netizen?|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/606/527|publisher=first monday|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=November 1995}}</ref>
{{pull quote|Netizens are not just anyone who comes on-line, and they are especially not people who come on-line for isolated gain or profit. They are not people who come to the Net thinking it is a service. Rather they are people who understand it takes effort and action on each and everyone's part to make the Net a regenerative and vibrant community and resource. Netizens are people who decide to devote time and effort into making the Net, this new part of our world, a better place.<br/>[[Lurker]]s are not Netizens, and vanity home pages are not the work of Netizens. While lurking or trivial home pages do not harm the Net, they do not contribute either.}}

==In China==<!--or \"Usage of the term/word in China?-->
{{See also|Internet in China}}
In Chinese, the terms ''wǎngmín'' (网民, literally \"net-people\") and ''wǎngyǒu'' (网友, literally \"net-friend\") are commonly used terms meaning \"Internet users\", and the English word ''netizen'' is used by [[mainland China]]-based [[English language]] media to translate both terms, resulting in the frequent appearance of that English word in media reporting about China, far more frequently than the use of the word in other contexts.<ref>Brian Fung, \"[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/netizen-why-is-this-goofy-sounding-word-so-important-in-china/263245/ 'Netizen': Why Is This Goofy-Sounding Word So Important in China?]\", ''The Atlantic'', 11 October 2012</ref><ref>Matt Schiavenza, \"[https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/09/enough-with-the-word-netizen/279969/ Enough with the word \"Netizen\"]\", ''The Atlantic'', 25 September 2013</ref>

\"'''Dream On'''\" is a [[power ballad]] by [[Aerosmith]] from their 1973 debut album, ''[[Aerosmith (album)|Aerosmith]]''.<ref name=\"Aerosmith - MTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/aerosmith/artist.jhtml#biographyEn|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629145041/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/aerosmith/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd|archivedate=2012-06-29|publisher=[[MTV]]|title=<nowiki>Aerosmith | Music Videos, News, Photos, Tour Dates, Ringtones, and Lyrics | MTV</nowiki>|accessdate=2017-04-05}}</ref> Written by lead singer [[Steven Tyler]], this song was their first major hit and became a [[classic rock]] radio staple. Released in June 1973, it peaked at number 59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] but hit big in the band's native Boston, where it was the number one single of the year on [[WMJX|WBZ-FM]], number five for the year on [[WRKO]] and number 16 on [[WMEX (AM)]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The song also received immediate heavy airplay on the former WVBF (FM), often showing up in the #1 position on \"The Top Five At Five\" in June 1973.

The album version of \"Dream On\" (4:28, as opposed to the 3:25 1973 [[gramophone record|45rpm]] edit where most of the intro has been edited out and the first chorus is replaced with the second chorus) was re-issued in late 1975, debuting at number 81 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart on January 10, 1976, breaking into the Top 40 on February 14 and peaking at number 6 on April 10. [[Columbia Records]] chose to service Top 40 radio stations with both long and short versions of the song; thus, many 1976 pop radio listeners were exposed to the group's first Top 10 effort through the 45 edit.

==Background==
\"Dream On\" was first played live in [[Mansfield, Connecticut]], at the Shaboo Inn.<ref name=\"song\">[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1296 Song Facts – Dream On by Aerosmith], viewed May 24th 2017</ref>{{Unreliable source?|sure=y|date=January 2020}} In a 2011 interview, Tyler reminisced about his father, a [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]-trained musician. He recalled lying beneath his dad's piano as a three-year-old listening to him play classical music. \"That's where I got that ''Dream On'' chordage\", he said.<ref>\"The Emancipation of Steven Tyler\", ''Rolling Stone'', May 12, 2011.</ref>

Tyler says that this was the only song on the band's first album where he used his real voice. He was insecure about how his voice sounded on tape, so for the other songs, he tried to sing a bit lower and sound more like soul artists, such as [[James Brown]].<ref name=\"song\" /> The song is also famous for its building climax to showcase Tyler's trademark screams.

In the authorized [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]] band memoir ''Walk This Way'', Tyler speaks at length about the origins of the songs:{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|pp=171-173}}
* \"The music for 'Dream On' was originally written on a [[Steinway]] upright piano in the living room of Trow-Rico Lodge in [[Sunapee, New Hampshire|Sunapee]], maybe four years before Aerosmith even started. I was seventeen or eighteen. ... It was just this little thing I was playing, and I never dreamed it would end up as a real song or anything. ... It's about dreaming until your dreams come true.
