The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-pattern) six-speed [[manual transmission]], and a more advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically actuated single-clutch [[Semi-automatic transmission|automated manual]] [[Transmission (mechanics)| transmission]], similar to a Formula One style single-clutch sequential gearbox, which Lamborghini abbreviates to \"E-gear\". The \"E-gear\" allows the driver to change gears much faster than they could with a manual transmission. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode via the gear selector located in place of the gear shift lever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambocars.com/gal/gall.php |title=Gallardo 5.0 - the STORY on |website=Lambocars.com |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> The vehicle was designed by [[Luc Donckerwolke]] and was based on the 1995 [[Lamborghini Cal\u00e0|Cal\u00e0]] prototype designed by [[Italdesign Giugiaro]].\n\n===2005 Coup\u00e9 update===\nFor the 2006 model year (launched in late 2005), Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter during city driving), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20&nbsp;PS to a maximum of {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and the biggest change was overall lower gearing ratios, especially in 1st to 5th gear. These changes gave the car much better performance than the original.

The Concept S was intended to be a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilising a 'saute-vent' ([[French language|French]] for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5.0&nbsp;L V10 engine, giving the car a distinctly futuristic look along with increasing aerodynamic flow. The [[rear-view mirror]] is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or to retract it into the dashboard when not needed. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini was rumoured to be building 100 examples for customers, but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 cars were produced: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event \"Driven by Disruption\". It was expected to sell for US$2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/lamborghini-concept-s-fails-to-sell-at.html|title=Lamborghini Concept S Fails To Sell At RM's New York Auction|last=Anderson|first=Brad|date=16 December 2015|publisher=Carscoops|accessdate=4 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529111845/http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/lamborghini-concept-s-fails-to-sell-at.html|archivedate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Gallardo Spyder===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= 06 Gallardo spyder.jpg\n|image2= 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder E-Gear - Flickr - The Car Spy (24) (cropped).jpg\n|image3= 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder E-Gear - Flickr - The Car Spy (18).jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder\n}}\n\nThe convertible variant of the Gallardo, called the Gallardo Spyder, was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006.

The Superleggera is lighter than the base model by {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} due the use of carbon fibre panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts and carbon fibre sports seats. The engine power was uprated by {{convert|10|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} courtesy of an improved intake, exhaust and ECU for a total power output of {{convert|530|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The 6-speed E-Gear transmission was standard on US spec models with the 6-speed manual transmission offered as a no cost option.

When the [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]], Gallardo's successor, was introduced, Lamborghini S.p.A produced a personalised version for the Italian police force serving as the replacement of the destroyed cars.\n\n====London Metropolitan Police====\nTwo Gallardos have been \"temporary\" police cars for the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] in London, one in 2005 and one in 2006, for specific publicity events. The car used in 2006 was seen at the start of the 2006 [[Gumball 3000|Gumball Rally]].

It is distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by a black-roofed two-tone color scheme as well as specially designed \"Callisto\" wheels. It also featured a two-tone interior further distinguishing it from the base model. All piping and stitching on the leather are executed in the same colour as the bodywork of the car. The midsections of the seats are finished in colour-coded upholstery and even the black floormats have a colour-coded border. A rear-view camera was standard on the Gallardo SE, as was the multimedia and navigation system, sports suspension and an exclusive cover. The optional E-gear transmission came with a new function: 'thrust' mode. This feature automatically revs the car to 5,000 rpm then drops the clutch engaging all four wheels in a controlled burnout to ensure that the car performs maximum acceleration.\n\n====Gallardo Nera (2007)====\n[[File:Lambo nera 07 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lamborghini Gallardo Nera]]\nThe Gallardo Nera is a special edition (limited to 185 units) of the Gallardo and was introduced at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile 2006|Paris Motor Show]]. The car was designed to showcase the customization options available to the customer in the Ad Personam program. It features special matte black body panels and was only available in a special shade of black: a combination of Nero Serapis and Nero Noctis. Brake calipers are painted a special silver and the taillights are smoked to match the darker paint scheme. The interior is stitched from high-contrast black and white leather in the Q-Citura (lozenge shaped) fashion.\n\n===Motorsports===\n====FIA GT3 Championship====\nIn 2007, the Gallardo was entered in the [[FIA GT3 European Championship|FIA GT3 Championship]], built by German motorsport specialists [[Reiter Engineering]], who previously manufactured the [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago|Murci\u00e9lago R-GT]] and the [[Lamborghini Diablo|Diablo GTR]] Super Trophy race cars. All the extra aerodynamic components were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart. [[Brembo]] racing brakes and [[OZ Group|OZ]] Racing wheels were also added. It was converted to rear wheel drive, other than when racing in the one-make Lamborghini Super Trofeo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3475.html |title=SuperCars.net |publisher=SuperCars.net |date=1 March 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> The engine generated a maximum power output of {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,800 rpm and {{convert|510|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,500 rpm.\n\n====Super GT====\nIn 2007, the Gallardo was entered by Japan Lamborghini Owners Club (JLOC) to the GT300 class of the Japanese Super GT Championship, the car had to conform to rather different regulations. The engine could only have a power output of {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and the car must be rear-wheel-drive. The power was limited by air restrictors placed in the engine bay. The gearbox is a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supergt.net/en/ |title=SuperGT.net |publisher=SuperGT.net |accessdate=2 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605102641/http://www.supergt.net/en/ |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Recall===\nLamborghini recalled about 1,500 Gallardo Coup\u00e9 and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, because of the possibility of [[power steering fluid]] leaking and the risk of fire.

On 25 November 2013, the last Gallardo was rolled off the production line. The Gallardo was replaced by the [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]] in 2014.\n\n==First Generation==\n{{see also|Lamborghini Cal\u00e0}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= Yellow Lamborghini Gallardo edit2.jpg\n|image2= Lamborghini Gallardo (DSCF0227 (8041049016) (cropped)).jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Gallardo Coup\u00e9\n}}\n\nThe first generation of the Gallardo was powered with an even firing {{cvt|4993|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} 90 degree V10 engine generating a maximum power output of {{cvt|500|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7500 rpm and {{convert|510|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4500 rpm. The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-pattern) six-speed [[manual transmission]], and a more advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically actuated single-clutch [[Semi-automatic transmission|automated manual]] [[Transmission (mechanics)| transmission]], similar to a Formula One style single-clutch sequential gearbox, which Lamborghini abbreviates to \"E-gear\". The \"E-gear\" allows the driver to change gears much faster than they could with a manual transmission. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode via the gear selector located in place of the gear shift lever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambocars.com/gal/gall.php |title=Gallardo 5.0 - the STORY on |website=Lambocars.com |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> The vehicle was designed by [[Luc Donckerwolke]] and was based on the 1995 [[Lamborghini Cal\u00e0|Cal\u00e0]] prototype designed by [[Italdesign Giugiaro]].\n\n===2005 Coup\u00e9 update===\nFor the 2006 model year (launched in late 2005), Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter during city driving), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20&nbsp;PS to a maximum of {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and the biggest change was overall lower gearing ratios, especially in 1st to 5th gear. These changes gave the car much better performance than the original. These changes were also included in the limited edition Gallardo SE.\n\n==={{anchor|Concept S}}Lamborghini Concept S===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= Lamborghini Gallardo LP-560-4 Spyder (5482252151).jpg|\n|image2= Lamborghini Concept S rear - Flick - Concorso Italiano 2005.jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Concept S\n}}\n\nThe '''Lamborghini Concept S''' is a [[concept car]] based on the Gallardo, featuring a speedster (Barchetta) body designed by [[Luc Donckerwolke]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurecar.co.za/category/20/luc-donckerwolke/ |title=Luc Donckerwolke \u00ab Future Car |publisher=Futurecar.co.za |date=25 June 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514063421/http://www.futurecar.co.za/category/20/luc-donckerwolke/ |archivedate=14 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/lamborghini-concept-s.htm |title=Lamborghini Concept S : News & Reports : Motoring |publisher=Web Wombat |date= |accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref> It was built in 2005 and was first shown at that year's [[Geneva Motor Show#2005|Geneva Motor Show]]. The Concept S was intended to be a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilising a 'saute-vent' ([[French language|French]] for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5.0&nbsp;L V10 engine, giving the car a distinctly futuristic look along with increasing aerodynamic flow. The [[rear-view mirror]] is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or to retract it into the dashboard when not needed. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini was rumoured to be building 100 examples for customers, but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 cars were produced: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event \"Driven by Disruption\". It was expected to sell for US$2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/lamborghini-concept-s-fails-to-sell-at.html|title=Lamborghini Concept S Fails To Sell At RM's New York Auction|last=Anderson|first=Brad|date=16 December 2015|publisher=Carscoops|accessdate=4 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529111845/http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/lamborghini-concept-s-fails-to-sell-at.html|archivedate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Gallardo Spyder===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= 06 Gallardo spyder.jpg\n|image2= 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder E-Gear - Flickr - The Car Spy (24) (cropped).jpg\n|image3= 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder E-Gear - Flickr - The Car Spy (18).jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder\n}}\n\nThe convertible variant of the Gallardo, called the Gallardo Spyder, was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006.

The Superleggera is lighter than the base model by {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} due the use of carbon fibre panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts and carbon fibre sports seats. The engine power was uprated by {{convert|10|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} courtesy of an improved intake, exhaust and ECU for a total power output of {{convert|530|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The 6-speed E-Gear transmission was standard on US spec models with the 6-speed manual transmission offered as a no cost option.

When the [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]], Gallardo's successor, was introduced, Lamborghini S.p.A produced a personalised version for the Italian police force serving as the replacement of the destroyed cars.\n\n====London Metropolitan Police====\nTwo Gallardos have been \"temporary\" police cars for the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] in London, one in 2005 and one in 2006, for specific publicity events. The car used in 2006 was seen at the start of the 2006 [[Gumball 3000|Gumball Rally]]. Both vehicles were lent by Lamborghini London and were fitted with yellow and blue [[battenburg markings]], police logos and a small blue [[lightbar]].\n\n====Gallardo SE (2005)====\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= Lamborghini Gallardo SE - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (4) (cropped).jpg\n|image2= Lamborghini Gallardo SE - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (5) (cropped).jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Gallardo SE\n}}\n\nThe Gallardo SE is a limited edition of 250 units introduced in 2005. It is distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by a black-roofed two-tone color scheme as well as specially designed \"Callisto\" wheels. It also featured a two-tone interior further distinguishing it from the base model. All piping and stitching on the leather are executed in the same colour as the bodywork of the car. The midsections of the seats are finished in colour-coded upholstery and even the black floormats have a colour-coded border. A rear-view camera was standard on the Gallardo SE, as was the multimedia and navigation system, sports suspension and an exclusive cover. The optional E-gear transmission came with a new function: 'thrust' mode. This feature automatically revs the car to 5,000 rpm then drops the clutch engaging all four wheels in a controlled burnout to ensure that the car performs maximum acceleration.\n\n====Gallardo Nera (2007)====\n[[File:Lambo nera 07 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lamborghini Gallardo Nera]]\nThe Gallardo Nera is a special edition (limited to 185 units) of the Gallardo and was introduced at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile 2006|Paris Motor Show]]. The car was designed to showcase the customization options available to the customer in the Ad Personam program. It features special matte black body panels and was only available in a special shade of black: a combination of Nero Serapis and Nero Noctis. Brake calipers are painted a special silver and the taillights are smoked to match the darker paint scheme. The interior is stitched from high-contrast black and white leather in the Q-Citura (lozenge shaped) fashion.\n\n===Motorsports===\n====FIA GT3 Championship====\nIn 2007, the Gallardo was entered in the [[FIA GT3 European Championship|FIA GT3 Championship]], built by German motorsport specialists [[Reiter Engineering]], who previously manufactured the [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago|Murci\u00e9lago R-GT]] and the [[Lamborghini Diablo|Diablo GTR]] Super Trophy race cars. All the extra aerodynamic components were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart. [[Brembo]] racing brakes and [[OZ Group|OZ]] Racing wheels were also added. It was converted to rear wheel drive, other than when racing in the one-make Lamborghini Super Trofeo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3475.html |title=SuperCars.net |publisher=SuperCars.net |date=1 March 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> The engine generated a maximum power output of {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,800 rpm and {{convert|510|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,500 rpm.\n\n====Super GT====\nIn 2007, the Gallardo was entered by Japan Lamborghini Owners Club (JLOC) to the GT300 class of the Japanese Super GT Championship, the car had to conform to rather different regulations. The engine could only have a power output of {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and the car must be rear-wheel-drive. The power was limited by air restrictors placed in the engine bay. The gearbox is a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supergt.net/en/ |title=SuperGT.net |publisher=SuperGT.net |accessdate=2 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605102641/http://www.supergt.net/en/ |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Recall===\nLamborghini recalled about 1,500 Gallardo Coup\u00e9 and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, because of the possibility of [[power steering fluid]] leaking and the risk of fire.

Featuring \"Iniezione Diretta Stratificata\" [[gasoline direct injection|direct fuel injection system]] to improve efficiency; fuel consumption and [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions have been reduced by 18% despite the increase in performance. The car was redesigned, inspired by the Murci\u00e9lago LP 640 and Revent\u00f3n.\n\nThe new engine, {{convert|40|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} more powerful than in the previous car, comes with two transmission choices: a 6-speed manual or 6-speed E-gear, the latter of which was revised to offer a Corsa mode which makes 40% quicker shifts than before and decreases traction control restrictions, a Thrust Mode launch control system was also added.
