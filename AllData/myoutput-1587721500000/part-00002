After committing several [[rape]]/[[murder]]s with BOB, MIKE had a religious epiphany and repented, cutting off his own arm to rid himself of a tattoo that read \"Fire Walk With Me\", which symbolized being touched by \"The devilish one\".

He shows Cooper a vision of BOB as he appeared in life. Later, Cooper, Deputy Hawk, and Sheriff Truman locate Philip Gerard, who is at the time unable to give them any information. Later, in the show's second season, MIKE is key to solving Laura Palmer's murder.\n\n==Prequel film==\nIn the prequel film ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'', during a scene taking place in the [[Black Lodge]], [[The Man From Another Place]] confronts Cooper and asks, \"Do you know who I am?\" Cooper shakes his head, and The Man From Another Place responds, \"I am the arm\". This gives the indication that he is the arm that MIKE removed in order to get rid of the tattoo that linked him with BOB on the left shoulder.\n\nMIKE also harasses [[Leland Palmer]], BOB's [[host (biology)|host]], in a [[road rage]] incident where he accuses Leland of \"stealing the corn,\" and that \"the thread will be torn.\" Before driving away, MIKE tries to tell Laura that Leland is indeed BOB's host.\n\nThe film reveals that MIKE was present on the night of Laura's murder and was, unintentionally, the reason Ronette survived and escaped; he had tracked BOB down and his efforts to enter the train car (in which Laura and Ronette had been raped), led to Ronette falling through the momentarily opened door. BOB swiftly shut the door again, denying MIKE any chance of saving Laura's life, but as BOB closed the door, MIKE threw the Owl Ring into the train car, which Laura put on, preventing BOB from possessing her (as he had originally intended).\n\nAt the end of the film, after Leland murders Laura, he enters the Black Lodge and sits beside MIKE, BOB and the Man From Another Place.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn the 2017 revived series, MIKE appears once again in the Black Lodge as a sort of guide for Agent Cooper, who is transported back into the real world after being imprisoned in the alternate dimension for 25 years.\n\n{{Twin Peaks}}\n\n[[Category:Twin Peaks characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional amputees]]\n[[Category:Fictional demons and devils]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with multiple personalities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional serial killers]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1990]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the ''Twin Peaks'' character|other uses|Mike (disambiguation)}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2018}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n|name = MIKE\n|series = [[Twin Peaks]]\n|image= \n|caption = \n|first = ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', \"[[Pilot (Twin Peaks episode)|Pilot]]\"\n|last = \"[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|The Return]], [[Part 18 (Twin Peaks)|Part 18]]\"\n|portrayer =[[Al Strobel]]\n|occupation =\n|lbl21 = Affiliated with\n|data21 = [[Black and White Lodges]]\n|religion =\n|gender = \n| nationality = \n}}\n\n'''MIKE''' is a character in the TV series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', portrayed by [[Al Strobel]].\n\n==Character overview==\nMIKE is an inhabiting spirit similar to the primary villain of the series, [[Killer BOB|BOB]], who was his partner in [[serial murder]].
