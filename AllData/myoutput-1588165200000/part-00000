The first computer-animated film by DreamWorks Animation to be produced at their [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] studio, the film stars the voices of [[Smith]], [[L De Niro]], [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]], [[Jack ]], [[Angelina Jolie]], and [[Martin Scorsese]] (in his only voice acting role) while [[Ziggy Marley]], [[Doug E. Doug]], [[Michael Imperioli]], [[Vincent Pastore]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Katie Couric]] voice the film's secondary characters. It tells the story of a fish named Oscar (Smith) who falsely claims to have killed Frankie (Imperioli), the son of a shark mob boss named Don Lino (De Nirolup with the mobster's other son Lenny (Black) to keep up the other facade.\n\n''Shark Tale'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004, and was theatrically released by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] on October 1. The film was a box office success and opened at #1 with $47.6 million, which was the second-highest opening for a DreamWorks Animation film at the time, behind ''[[Shrek 2]]'' ($108 million). It remained as the #1 film in the U.S. and Canada for its second and third weekends, and made $367 million worldwide against its $75 million budget. It was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], losing to ''[[The Incredibles]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Southside Reef, a [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse]] named Oscar fantasizes about being rich and famous. Soon after arriving for work at the Whale Wash, he is called to the office of his boss, a [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] named Sykes, to discuss the fact that he owes a large sum of money and must pay it back by the next day. He remembers being humiliated as a child because his father was a tongue scrubber, so his [[Pomacanthidae|angelfish]] best friend, Angie, offers him a shiny pink pearl that was a gift from her grandmother to pawn and pay his debt. Oscar brings the money to the race track to meet Sykes, but hears that the race is rigged and bets it all on a [[seahorse]] named \"Lucky Day\". Sykes is annoyed that Oscar bet the money but agrees to see how the race turns out. Moments before Lucky Day crosses the finish line, he trips and loses.\n\nMeanwhile, a family of criminally-inclined sharks which has associates such as killer whales, swordfish, and octopuses has a problem with one of their sons, Lenny, who is a vegetarian and refuses to act the part of a killer. His crime lord father, Don Edward Lino, orders his violent eldest son, Frankie, to mentor his brother in the family business. Frankie sees Oscar left for dead in the middle of the ocean by Sykes' two jellyfish enforcers, Ernie and Bernie, and urges Lenny to eat Oscar, but Lenny instead frees Oscar and tells him to escape. Furious, Frankie charges at Oscar, but suddenly an anchor falls on his head, killing him. Devastated and frightened, Lenny flees. As there were no other witnesses and Oscar was seen near the body, everyone comes to believe that he killed Frankie, an opportunity that Oscar decides to exploit for fame.\n\nOscar returns to the city with a new title of \"Sharkslayer\". Sykes becomes his manager and Oscar moves to the \"top of the reef\" to live in luxury. At the same time, Don Lino has everyone search for Lenny. When several sharks approach Oscar's neighborhood, his neighbors expect him to drive them away so he goes and encounters Lenny. Since he does not wish to return home, Lenny begs Oscar to let him stay at Oscar's house. Soon, Angie finds out about the lie and threatens to tell everyone. Oscar and Lenny stage an event in which Lenny pretends to terrorize the town and Oscar defeats him. Though this further cements Oscar's reputation and causes the beautiful, but vindictive Lola to become his girlfriend, it infuriates Don Lino. Afterwards, Oscar and an angered Angie get into an argument, where she reveals that she had feelings for Oscar even before he became the \"Sharkslayer\", causing Oscar to dump Lola and reflect on the consequences of his selfishness.\n\nSoon, Oscar buys some gifts for Angie, only to discover that Don Lino has kidnapped her to stage a meeting. Lenny attends disguised as a dolphin named Sebastian. Don Lino threatens to eat Angie if Oscar does not comply. Lenny grabs Angie into his mouth, but later regurgitates her and unintentionally reveals himself in front of everyone. Enraged, Don Lino chases Oscar through the reef. Oscar heads for the Whale Wash and ends up trapping Don Lino and (by accident) Lenny in the machinery. Oscar is given an ovation by everyone, but he finally confesses the truth behind Frankie's death. He then tells Don Lino that everyone likes Lenny for who he is and urges him to respect everyone's individual choices. Inspired by Oscar's confession, Don Lino reconciles with his son and states that he and his gang bear the city no ill will. Oscar forsakes all the wealth he has acquired, makes peace with the sharks, becomes co-manager of the Whale Wash (now frequented by sharks, killer whales, and swordfish), and lives happily ever after with Angie.\n\nIn the mid-credits, Lola shows up at Oscar's apartment to apologize only to encounter Crazy Joe, Oscar's eccentric hermit crab neighbor.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Will Smith]] as Oscar, a comical street wise bluestreak cleaner wrasse who works in the Whale Wash of Reef City who wants to be rich, but his schemes always fail and he ends up in-debt to his boss with five thousand clams.\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Don Edward Lino, a shark and leader of a mob consisting of criminally-inclined great white sharks, who wants his two sons to take over his business and run it together, but becomes enraged when Oscar inadvertently gets in the way following one of his sons' death.

The first computer-animated film by DreamWorks Animation to be produced at their [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] studio, the film stars the voices of [[Will Smith]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]], [[Jack Black]], [[Angelina Jolie]], and [[Martin Scorsese]] (in his only voice acting role) while [[Ziggy Marley]], [[Doug E. Doug]], [[Michael Imperioli]], [[Vincent Pastore]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Katie Couric]] voice the film's secondary characters. It tells the story of a fish named Oscar (Smith) who falsely claims to have killed Frankie (Imperioli), the son of a shark mob boss named Don Lino (De Niro) to advance his own community standing and teams up with the mobster's other son Lenny (Black) to keep up the other facade.\n\n''Shark Tale'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004, and was theatrically released by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] on October 1. The film was a box office success and opened at #1 with $47.6 million, which was the second-highest opening for a DreamWorks Animation film at the time, behind ''[[Shrek 2]]'' ($108 million). It remained as the #1 film in the U.S. and Canada for its second and third weekends, and made $367 million worldwide against its $75 million budget. It was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], losing to ''[[The Incredibles]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Southside Reef, a [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse]] named Oscar fantasizes about being rich and famous. Soon after arriving for work at the Whale Wash, he is called to the office of his boss, a [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] named Sykes, to discuss the fact that he owes a large sum of money and must pay it back by the next day. He remembers being humiliated as a child because his father was a tongue scrubber, so his [[Pomacanthidae|angelfish]] best friend, Angie, offers him a shiny pink pearl that was a gift from her grandmother to pawn and pay his debt. Oscar brings the money to the race track to meet Sykes, but hears that the race is rigged and bets it all on a [[seahorse]] named \"Lucky Day\". Sykes is annoyed that Oscar bet the money but agrees to see how the race turns out. Moments before Lucky Day crosses the finish line, he trips and loses.\n\nMeanwhile, a family of criminally-inclined sharks which has associates such as killer whales, swordfish, and octopuses has a problem with one of their sons, Lenny, who is a vegetarian and refuses to act the part of a killer. His crime lord father, Don Edward Lino, orders his violent eldest son, Frankie, to mentor his brother in the family business. Frankie sees Oscar left for dead in the middle of the ocean by Sykes' two jellyfish enforcers, Ernie and Bernie, and urges Lenny to eat Oscar, but Lenny instead frees Oscar and tells him to escape. Furious, Frankie charges at Oscar, but suddenly an anchor falls on his head, killing him. Devastated and frightened, Lenny flees. As there were no other witnesses and Oscar was seen near the body, everyone comes to believe that he killed Frankie, an opportunity that Oscar decides to exploit for fame.\n\nOscar returns to the city with a new title of \"Sharkslayer\". Sykes becomes his manager and Oscar moves to the \"top of the reef\" to live in luxury. At the same time, Don Lino has everyone search for Lenny. When several sharks approach Oscar's neighborhood, his neighbors expect him to drive them away so he goes and encounters Lenny. Since he does not wish to return home, Lenny begs Oscar to let him stay at Oscar's house. Soon, Angie finds out about the lie and threatens to tell everyone. Oscar and Lenny stage an event in which Lenny pretends to terrorize the town and Oscar defeats him. Though this further cements Oscar's reputation and causes the beautiful, but vindictive Lola to become his girlfriend, it infuriates Don Lino. Afterwards, Oscar and an angered Angie get into an argument, where she reveals that she had feelings for Oscar even before he became the \"Sharkslayer\", causing Oscar to dump Lola and reflect on the consequences of his selfishness.\n\nSoon, Oscar buys some gifts for Angie, only to discover that Don Lino has kidnapped her to stage a meeting. Lenny attends disguised as a dolphin named Sebastian. Don Lino threatens to eat Angie if Oscar does not comply. Lenny grabs Angie into his mouth, but later regurgitates her and unintentionally reveals himself in front of everyone. Enraged, Don Lino chases Oscar through the reef. Oscar heads for the Whale Wash and ends up trapping Don Lino and (by accident) Lenny in the machinery. Oscar is given an ovation by everyone, but he finally confesses the truth behind Frankie's death. He then tells Don Lino that everyone likes Lenny for who he is and urges him to respect everyone's individual choices. Inspired by Oscar's confession, Don Lino reconciles with his son and states that he and his gang bear the city no ill will. Oscar forsakes all the wealth he has acquired, makes peace with the sharks, becomes co-manager of the Whale Wash (now frequented by sharks, killer whales, and swordfish), and lives happily ever after with Angie.\n\nIn the mid-credits, Lola shows up at Oscar's apartment to apologize only to encounter Crazy Joe, Oscar's eccentric hermit crab neighbor.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Will Smith]] as Oscar, a comical street wise bluestreak cleaner wrasse who works in the Whale Wash of Reef City who wants to be rich, but his schemes always fail and he ends up in-debt to his boss with five thousand clams.\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Don Edward Lino, a shark and leader of a mob consisting of criminally-inclined great white sharks, who wants his two sons to take over his business and run it together, but becomes enraged when Oscar inadvertently gets in the way following one of his sons' death.
