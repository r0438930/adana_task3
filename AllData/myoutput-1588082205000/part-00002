According to one, the word comes from the Greek ''\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1'', pouring, infusion, used in connexion with the study of the juices of plants, and thence extended to chemical manipulations in general; this derivation accounts for the old-fashioned spellings \"chymist\" and \"chymistry\". The other view traces it to ''khem'' or ''khame'', hieroglyph ''khmi'', which denotes black earth as opposed to barren sand, and occurs in [[Plutarch]] as ''\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1''; on this derivation alchemy is explained as meaning the \"Egyptian art\". The first occurrence of the word is said to be in a treatise of [[Julius Firmicus Maternus|Julius Firmicus]], an astrological writer of the 4th century, but the prefix al there must be the addition of a later Arabic copyist. <!-- Among Alexandrian writers, alchemy was designated as ''h\u0113 t\u0113s krusou te kai argurou poi\u0113se\u014ds tekn\u0113 theia kai hiera'' or ''h\u0113 epist\u0113m\u0113 hiera''. --> In English, [[Piers Plowman]] (1362) contains the phrase \"experimentis of alconomye\", with variants \"alkenemye\" and \" alknamye\".

This Coptic word derives from [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''km\u1ec9'', itself from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''kmt''. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour \"black\" (Egypt was the \"Black Land\", by contrast with the \"Red Land\", the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname \"Egyptian black arts\".
