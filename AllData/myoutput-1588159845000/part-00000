In ''Imaginators'', there are a few characters (Crash Bandicoot, Dr. Neo Cortex, Wild Storm, and Ro-Bow) that act as level unlockers.\n\n==Universe==\n===Characters===\nWhile the Skylanders are the main playable characters in the series, they are aided by many supporting characters and face many villains throughout their adventures. The players act as \"Portal Masters\" where they place the Skylander figure on the portal to operate them.\n\nSpyro the Dragon is a popular Skylander where he is the number one defender of Skylands. Each of the Skylanders were discovered by a Portal Master named Master Eon, Spyro, or another Skylander after they were shown fighting off threats to their homeland. Some Skylanders, like Camo, are based off artworks or media.\n\nKnown allies of the Skylanders include the Mabu pilot Flynn, the Mabu adventurer Cali, Master Eon's Mabu assistant Hugo, the Woodburrow inhabitant Tessa and her bird Whiskers, the fairy Persephone, and the veteran Mabu Buzz.\n\nA dark Portal Master named Kaos serves as the primary antagonist of the series. Outside of being served by his Troll butler Glumshanks, Kaos is served by armies of Cyclopes, Drows, Chompies, Greebles, Spell Punks, and Trolls, as well as numerous other supporting characters such as Kaossandra, Mesmerelda, the Darkness, and Brain.\n\n===Skylands===\nThe '''Skylands''' is the main setting of the series, a world lying at the very center of the universe. It consists of many floating islands where each one has its own ecosystems like forests, rainforests, deserts, arctic areas, swamps, mountains, and oceanic areas.\n\nEach of the games has a hub where the Skylanders can start their missions from:\n* For ''Spyro's Adventure'', it is the ruins as the Hub where Master Eon's citadel was located and was slowly restored when the Core of Light was reassembled. In the Nintendo 3DS version, it was replaced by the Sanctuary.\n* ''Giants'' has Flynn's airship, The Dread-Yacht.\n* ''Swap Force'' has Tessa's homeland of Woodburrow, the capital city of the Cloudbreak Islands. In the 3DS version, it was replaced by Flynn's hometown called Boom Town.\n* ''Trap Team'', ''SuperChargers'', and ''Imaginators'' have the Skylanders Academy established by Buzz where those who want to become Skylanders get their education. By ''SuperChargers'', the Skylanders Academy was redesigned following recent attacks.\n* Along with the Academy, ''Imaginators '' has the ''Mysterious Ancient Place'' (M.A.P.), the place where all creation was created and serves as the Ancients' headquarters. It connects the game's chapters and the Academy.\n\n==Music==\n[[Lorne Balfe]] has composed the soundtracks to all the ''Skylanders'' games thus far, while [[Hans Zimmer]] composed the main theme.\n\n==Media==\n===Novels===\nA series of books in the ''Skylanders'' franchise started with ''Skylanders: The Machine of Doom'' that takes place before the events of ''Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure''. It was written by [[Cavan Scott]], who would later write sequels to the novel under the ''Skylanders: The Mask of Power'' series, which also serve as prequels to ''Spyro's Adventure''.\n\n===IDW

It is the very center of the universe where it is constantly threatened by evil forces who seek to rule Skylands and gain access to all worlds.<ref>Skylanders: The Machine of Doom, page 43</ref> Luckily, a band of heroes called the Skylanders use their abilities and machinery to defend their world from various threats, which they have done for generations. They have worked with the Portal Masters in keeping peace and balance in Skylands, battling the forces of evil, and protecting the Core of Light. Unfortunately, Kaos (the main antagonist of the franchise) has destroyed the Core of Light (in the first game Spyro's adventure) and now Skylands is in his hands. It is up to the player to send the Skylanders into the game and stop Kaos. The Skylanders have an unbreakable bond with their Portal Masters. Though they are not servants, the Skylanders chose to serve their Portal Master and do so eagerly. Each Skylander is associated with one of the ten elements of Skylands: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Magic, Tech, Life, Undead, Light, and Dark( both recently added).\n\nThe main plot is the Skylanders going through levels to defeat Kaos, the series' main antagonist, and stop him from ruling over Skylands.\n\nThe console versions of each game follow identical storylines, while the [[Nintendo 3DS]] versions follow stories different from those of the console versions.\n\n==Games==\n{{Video game timeline\n| 2011 = ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure|Spyro's Adventure]]''\n| 2012 = ''[[Skylanders: Giants|Giants]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Skylanders: Swap Force|Swap Force]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Skylanders: Trap Team|Trap Team]]''\n| 2015 = ''[[Skylanders: SuperChargers|SuperChargers]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Skylanders: Imaginators|Imaginators]]''\n}}\n\n===''Spyro's Adventure'' (2011)===\n{{Main|Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure}}\nThis is the very first edition of the Skylanders franchise.

Giant figures also light up, but do not have the light bomb attack. There were 8 giants, 8 new \"core\" characters, 24 re-posed characters, 8 lightcore figures, 3 magic items, and 4 sidekicks.

In ''Imaginators'', there are a few characters (Crash Bandicoot, Dr. Neo Cortex, Wild Storm, and Ro-Bow) that act as level unlockers.\n\n==Universe==\n===Characters===\nWhile the Skylanders are the main playable characters in the series, they are aided by many supporting characters and face many villains throughout their adventures. The players act as \"Portal Masters\" where they place the Skylander figure on the portal to operate them.\n\nSpyro the Dragon is a popular Skylander where he is the number one defender of Skylands. Each of the Skylanders were discovered by a Portal Master named Master Eon, Spyro, or another Skylander after they were shown fighting off threats to their homeland. Some Skylanders, like Camo, are based off artworks or media.\n\nKnown allies of the Skylanders include the Mabu pilot Flynn, the Mabu adventurer Cali, Master Eon's Mabu assistant Hugo, the Woodburrow inhabitant Tessa and her bird Whiskers, the fairy Persephone, and the veteran Mabu Buzz.\n\nA dark Portal Master named Kaos serves as the primary antagonist of the series. Outside of being served by his Troll butler Glumshanks, Kaos is served by armies of Cyclopes, Drows, Chompies, Greebles, Spell Punks, and Trolls, as well as numerous other supporting characters such as Kaossandra, Mesmerelda, the Darkness, and Brain.\n\n===Skylands===\nThe '''Skylands''' is the main setting of the series, a world lying at the very center of the universe. It consists of many floating islands where each one has its own ecosystems like forests, rainforests, deserts, arctic areas, swamps, mountains, and oceanic areas.\n\nEach of the games has a hub where the Skylanders can start their missions from:\n* For ''Spyro's Adventure'', it is the ruins as the Hub where Master Eon's citadel was located and was slowly restored when the Core of Light was reassembled. In the Nintendo 3DS version, it was replaced by the Sanctuary.\n* ''Giants'' has Flynn's airship, The Dread-Yacht.\n* ''Swap Force'' has Tessa's homeland of Woodburrow, the capital city of the Cloudbreak Islands. In the 3DS version, it was replaced by Flynn's hometown called Boom Town.\n* ''Trap Team'', ''SuperChargers'', and ''Imaginators'' have the Skylanders Academy established by Buzz where those who want to become Skylanders get their education. By ''SuperChargers'', the Skylanders Academy was redesigned following recent attacks.\n* Along with the Academy, ''Imaginators '' has the ''Mysterious Ancient Place'' (M.A.P.), the place where all creation was created and serves as the Ancients' headquarters. It connects the game's chapters and the Academy.\n\n==Music==\n[[Lorne Balfe]] has composed the soundtracks to all the ''Skylanders'' games thus far, while [[Hans Zimmer]] composed the main theme.\n\n==Media==\n===Novels===\nA series of books in the ''Skylanders'' franchise started with ''Skylanders: The Machine of Doom'' that takes place before the events of ''Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure''. It was written by [[Cavan Scott]], who would later write sequels to the novel under the ''Skylanders: The Mask of Power'' series, which also serve as prequels to ''Spyro's Adventure''.\n\n===IDW
