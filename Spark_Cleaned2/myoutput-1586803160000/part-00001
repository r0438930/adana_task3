He argues that [[Alfred the Great]], in particular, drew on [[biblical nationalism]], using biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into [[Old English]] to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the [[Norman conquest]]) beginning with the [[Wycliffe's Bible|translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s]], positing that [[English nationalism]] and the English nation have been continuous since that time.<ref>Adrian Hastings, The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997</ref>\n\nAnother prudent example of Medieval nationalism is the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], a document produced by Scottish nobles and clergy during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]]. The purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the Pope that Scotland was indeed a nation of its own, with its own unique culture, history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than England. The document went on to justify the actions of [[Robert the Bruce]] and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the English for having violated Scottish sovereignty without justification. The propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the Bruce, which after the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] was successful and eventually resulted in the end of England's occupation and recognition of Scottish independence on the part of the English crown. The document is widely seen as an early example of both [[Scottish nationalism]] and [[popular sovereignty]].\n\n[[Anthony Kaldellis]] affirms in ''Hellenism in Byzantium'' (2008) that what is called the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the Roman Empire transformed into a [[nation-state]] in Middle Ages.\n\nAzar Gat is among the scholars who argue that [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.<ref>Azar Gat, ''Nations: The Long History and Deep Roots of Political Ethnicity and Nationalism'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2013, China, p. 93 Korea, p. 104 and Japan p., 105.</ref>\n\n===Use of term ''nationes'' by medieval universities and other medieval institutions===\n{{main article| Nation (university)}}\nA significant early use of the term ''nation'', as ''natio'', occurred at [[Medieval university|Medieval universities]]<ref>''see: [[nation (university)]]''</ref> to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the [[University of Paris]], who were all born within a ''pays'', spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, [[Jean Gerson]] was elected twice as a procurator for the French ''natio''. The [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] adopted the division of students into ''nationes'': from its opening in 1349 the ''[[studium generale]]'' which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Silesian ''nations''.\n\nIn a similar way, the ''nationes'' were segregated by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem]], who maintained at [[Rhodes]] the hostels from which they took their name \"where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion\", as the Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]] noted in 1436.<ref>Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andan\u00e7as e viajes]''.</ref>\n\n==Early modern nations==\n{{See also|Nation state}}\nIn his article, \"The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism\", [[Philip S.

Smith, Chosen Peoples: Sacred Sources of National Identity (Oxford University Press, 2003) and Myths and Memories of the Nation (Oxford University Press, 1999).</ref>\n \nIn her book ''Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity'', [[Liah Greenfeld]] argued that nationalism was invented in England by 1600.

The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and [[ethnic origins]], that differentiate them from people of other nations.<ref name=Noiriel>{{cite book|last=Noiriel|first=G\u00e9rard|title=Population, immigration et identit\u00e9 nationale en France:XIX-XX si\u00e8cle.|date=1992|publisher=Hachette|isbn=2010166779}}</ref> On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the [[French Revolution]] and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centered in a willingness to \"live together\", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation.<ref>[[Rogers Brubaker]], Citizenship and nationhood in France and Germany, Harvard University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-674-13178-1}}</ref> This is the vision, among others, of [[Ernest Renan]].<ref name=Noiriel />\n\nPresent day analysis tend to be based in socio-historical studies about the building of [[national identity]] sentiments, trying to identify the individual and collective mechanisms, either conscient or non-conscient, intended or un-intended. According to some of these studies, it seems that the [[State (polity)|State]] often plays a significant role, and communications, particularly of economic content, also have a high significance.<ref name=Noiriel />\n\n==Debate about a potential future of nations==\n{{See also|Clash of Civilizations|City-state|Virtual community|Tribe (Internet)|Global citizenship|Geographic mobility|Transnationalism|Geo-fence|Decentralization|Collective problem solving|Sociocultural evolution}}\nThere is an ongoing debate about the future of nations \u2212 about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.<ref name=news>{{cite magazine|title=End of nations: Is there an alternative to countries?|url=http://mpc-journal.org/blog/2016/11/09/end-of-nations-is-there-an-alternative-to-countries/|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe theory of the [[clash of civilizations]] lies in direct contrast to [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]], people's cultural and religious [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post\u2013[[Cold War]] world.\n\nThe theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy&nbsp;\u2014 Economics |publisher=AEI |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\",<ref name=\"FAarticle\">Official copy (free preview): {{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|title=The Clash of Civilizations?|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=Summer 1993|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in response to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his [[thesis]] in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.\n\nHuntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post\u2013[[Cold War]] period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]] and capitalist [[free market]] economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post\u2013Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', argued that the world had reached a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] \"end of history\".\n\nHuntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.\n[[Postnationalism]] is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including [[economic globalization]], a rise in importance of [[multinational corporation]]s, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of [[socio-political power]] from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the [[Internet]]. However attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.<ref>R. Koopmans and P. Statham; \"Challenging the liberal nation-state?

Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the [[Norman conquest]]) beginning with the [[Wycliffe's Bible|translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s]], positing that [[English nationalism]] and the English nation have been continuous since that time.<ref>Adrian Hastings, The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997</ref>\n\nAnother prudent example of Medieval nationalism is the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], a document produced by Scottish nobles and clergy during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]]. The purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the Pope that Scotland was indeed a nation of its own, with its own unique culture, history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than England. The document went on to justify the actions of [[Robert the Bruce]] and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the English for having violated Scottish sovereignty without justification. The propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the Bruce, which after the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] was successful and eventually resulted in the end of England's occupation and recognition of Scottish independence on the part of the English crown. The document is widely seen as an early example of both [[Scottish nationalism]] and [[popular sovereignty]].\n\n[[Anthony Kaldellis]] affirms in ''Hellenism in Byzantium'' (2008) that what is called the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the Roman Empire transformed into a [[nation-state]] in Middle Ages.\n\nAzar Gat is among the scholars who argue that [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.<ref>Azar Gat, ''Nations: The Long History and Deep Roots of Political Ethnicity and Nationalism'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2013, China, p. 93 Korea, p. 104 and Japan p., 105.</ref>\n\n===Use of term ''nationes'' by medieval universities and other medieval institutions===\n{{main article| Nation (university)}}\nA significant early use of the term ''nation'', as ''natio'', occurred at [[Medieval university|Medieval universities]]<ref>''see: [[nation (university)]]''</ref> to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the [[University of Paris]], who were all born within a ''pays'', spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, [[Jean Gerson]] was elected twice as a procurator for the French ''natio''. The [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] adopted the division of students into ''nationes'': from its opening in 1349 the ''[[studium generale]]'' which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Silesian ''nations''.\n\nIn a similar way, the ''nationes'' were segregated by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem]], who maintained at [[Rhodes]] the hostels from which they took their name \"where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion\", as the Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]] noted in 1436.<ref>Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andan\u00e7as e viajes]''.</ref>\n\n==Early modern nations==\n{{See also|Nation state}}\nIn his article, \"The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism\", [[Philip S.

The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and [[ethnic origins]], that differentiate them from people of other nations.<ref name=Noiriel>{{cite book|last=Noiriel|first=G\u00e9rard|title=Population, immigration et identit\u00e9 nationale en France:XIX-XX si\u00e8cle.|date=1992|publisher=Hachette|isbn=2010166779}}</ref> On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the [[French Revolution]] and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centered in a willingness to \"live together\", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation.<ref>[[Rogers Brubaker]], Citizenship and nationhood in France and Germany, Harvard University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-674-13178-1}}</ref> This is the vision, among others, of [[Ernest Renan]].<ref name=Noiriel />\n\nPresent day analysis tend to be based in socio-historical studies about the building of [[national identity]] sentiments, trying to identify the individual and collective mechanisms, either conscient or non-conscient, intended or un-intended. According to some of these studies, it seems that the [[State (polity)|State]] often plays a significant role, and communications, particularly of economic content, also have a high significance.<ref name=Noiriel />\n\n==Debate about a potential future of nations==\n{{See also|Clash of Civilizations|City-state|Virtual community|Tribe (Internet)|Global citizenship|Geographic mobility|Transnationalism|Geo-fence|Decentralization|Collective problem solving|Sociocultural evolution}}\nThere is an ongoing debate about the future of nations \u2212 about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.<ref name=news>{{cite magazine|title=End of nations: Is there an alternative to countries?|url=http://mpc-journal.org/blog/2016/11/09/end-of-nations-is-there-an-alternative-to-countries/|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe theory of the [[clash of civilizations]] lies in direct contrast to [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]], people's cultural and religious [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post\u2013[[Cold War]] world.\n\nThe theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy&nbsp;\u2014 Economics |publisher=AEI |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\",<ref name=\"FAarticle\">Official copy (free preview): {{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|title=The Clash of Civilizations?|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=Summer 1993|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in response to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his [[thesis]] in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.\n\nHuntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post\u2013[[Cold War]] period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]] and capitalist [[free market]] economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post\u2013Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', argued that the world had reached a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] \"end of history\".\n\nHuntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.\n[[Postnationalism]] is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including [[economic globalization]], a rise in importance of [[multinational corporation]]s, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of [[socio-political power]] from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the [[Internet]]. However attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.<ref>R. Koopmans and P. Statham; \"Challenging the liberal nation-state?
