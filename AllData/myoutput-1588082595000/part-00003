Lagos State is financing construction of the Blue Line from its own resources.\n\nThe Blue Line will run 27.5&nbsp;km from Marina to Okokomaiko, with 13 stations and an end-to-end journey time of 35 minutes. The entire Blue Line will operate over a secure and exclusive right-of-way, with no [[level crossing]]s and no uncontrolled access by pedestrians or vehicles. The route will run on the surface in the central reservation of the [[Lagos-Badagry Expressway]] between Igbo-Elerin Road (Okokomaiko) and Iganmu. The line will then be elevated from Iganmu along the south side of the expressway passing the junction with Eric Moore Road, crossing just south of the National Theatre to Iddo, then south to Lagos Island with a terminal at Marina. A Maintenance and Storage Facility (MSF) will be constructed at Okokomaiko, with a track connection from the Blue Line to the depot.\n\nWhen a project review was completed in 2018 by [[Alstom]], the commencement date was pushed back to 2022.<ref name=\"premiumtimesng.com\"/>\n\n===Agbado-Marina Red Line===\n\nThe second line, the Red Line, will run from Marina to [[Agbado-Oke Odo|Agbado]].

The same contract also included an option for some H6-series subway cars from the TTC, however this has since been cancelled.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tess |last=Kalinowski |title=TTC subway cars bound for Nigeria |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/transportation/article/1049970--ttc-subway-cars-bound-for-nigeria |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=September 6, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Eko Rail's Trains Begin Journey to Lagos |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eko-rails-trains-begin-journey-to-lagos-130627418.html |work=[[PR Newswire]] |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2009/May_28_2009/Reports/Sale_of_Surplus_Asse.pdf |title=Report on sales of surplus assets |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2013-06-15 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.railjournal.com/newsflash/first-subway-cars-leave-toronto-for-lagos-1333.html |title=First subway cars leave Toronto for Lagos |journal=[[International Railway Journal]] |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=2013-06-15 |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003100612/http://www.railjournal.com/newsflash/first-subway-cars-leave-toronto-for-lagos-1333.html |url-status=dead |quote=The Blue Line is expected to carry 300,000 passengers a day with trains running at 5-minute headways. }}</ref> The trains were built as two-unit [[married pair]]s<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nigeriansabroadlive.com/lagos-settles-for-refurbished-subway-cars-for-its-light-rail-project/ |title=Lagos settles for refurbished subway cars for its light rail project |work=[[Nigerians Abroad]] |date=May 11, 2011 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |quote=Subway cars \u2014 equivalent of trains \u2014 are series of connected railroad cars used for intra city (urban) transportation, usually underground and operated by electricity. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026020219/http://nigeriansabroadlive.com/lagos-settles-for-refurbished-subway-cars-for-its-light-rail-project/ |archive-date=October 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> with a driver's cab in the front right corner of each car.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Toronto_Transit_Commission_5670-5807 |title=Toronto Transit Commission 5670-5807 |publisher=Canadian Public Transit Discussion Board |accessdate=2013-06-14 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, LAMATA has opted for Chinese-built trains instead, ordering 15 electro-diesel multiple units from [[CNR Dalian]] with an option for 14 more.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackborderbuild.com/nigeria-updates/lamata-opts-for-chinese-trains-for-the-lagos-light-rail |title=LAMATA opts for Chinese Trains for the Lagos Light Rail |publisher=Black Border Build |date=January 11, 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925120446/http://www.blackborderbuild.com/nigeria-updates/lamata-opts-for-chinese-trains-for-the-lagos-light-rail |archive-date=September 25, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> About 76 H5 cars that had been taken for refurbishment to Buffalo, New York, have been scrapped by August 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Hawker_Siddeley_Canada_H5 |title=Hawker Siddeley Canada H5 |website=Canadian Public Transit Discussion Board |accessdate=2015-09-22}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, LAMATA signed an agreement with [[Alstom]]. As a part of the agreement, Alstom conducted a review of the rail lines. After the review of the rail project, which should have initiated passenger activity, the state government said the Blue Line, would now be ready for passenger operation by 2022. This deal also plans for the electrification of a portion of the track.<ref name=\"premiumtimesng.com\"/>\n\n==Routes==\n\n===Okokomaiko-Marina Blue Line===\n\nIn April 2008, the Lagos State Government approved [[\u20a6]] 70 billion for construction of the [[Okokomaiko]]-[[Lagos Terminus railway station|Iddo]]-Marina Line, with an estimated completion date of 2011. However, the project suffered many delays due to funding shortfalls.<ref name=\"businessday2015\">{{cite news|title=Lagos light rail now to be completed 2017|url=https://www.businessdayonline.com/lagos-light-rail-now-to-be-completed-2017/|work=BusinessDay|date=21 October 2015}}</ref> The opening date was revised to June 2013, then December 2016, then 2017.<ref name=\"venturesafrica2016\"/><ref name=\"businessday2015\"/> As of November 2016, only 16&nbsp;km of the 27&nbsp;km Blue Line had been completed.<ref name=\"venturesafrica2016\"/>\n\nThe contract was awarded to the [[China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation]] (CCECC),<ref name=\"venturesafrica2016\">{{cite news|last1=Fahd|first1=Abdulmalik|title=December knocking: Where is the Lagos light rail?|url=http://venturesafrica.com/december-knocking-where-lagos-light-rail/|work=Ventures Africa|date=25 November 2016}}</ref> with advisory services being provided by [[CPCS Transcom Limited]].  Lagos State is financing construction of the Blue Line from its own resources.\n\nThe Blue Line will run 27.5&nbsp;km from Marina to Okokomaiko, with 13 stations and an end-to-end journey time of 35 minutes. The entire Blue Line will operate over a secure and exclusive right-of-way, with no [[level crossing]]s and no uncontrolled access by pedestrians or vehicles. The route will run on the surface in the central reservation of the [[Lagos-Badagry Expressway]] between Igbo-Elerin Road (Okokomaiko) and Iganmu. The line will then be elevated from Iganmu along the south side of the expressway passing the junction with Eric Moore Road, crossing just south of the National Theatre to Iddo, then south to Lagos Island with a terminal at Marina. A Maintenance and Storage Facility (MSF) will be constructed at Okokomaiko, with a track connection from the Blue Line to the depot.\n\nWhen a project review was completed in 2018 by [[Alstom]], the commencement date was pushed back to 2022.<ref name=\"premiumtimesng.com\"/>\n\n===Agbado-Marina Red Line===\n\nThe second line, the Red Line, will run from Marina to [[Agbado-Oke Odo|Agbado]].
