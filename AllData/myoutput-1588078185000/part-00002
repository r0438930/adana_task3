The Swedish diplomatic effort has been through consular channels and has been low-profile.<ref name=20161017hongkongfp/>\n\nIn late February 2016, state media appeared to clarify the charges against Gui, saying that Gui was being held for \"illegal business operations\".

In his report on Hong Kong for the second half of 2015, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond expressed concern about the Causeway Bay Books disappearances, and said in particular that the abduction of Gui's colleague Lee Bo, a British citizen, from Hong Kong was \"a serious breach of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on Hong Kong and undermines the principle of [[one country, two systems]]\".<ref name=\"20160212theguardian\"/>\n\nGui's detention was discussed at the US Congressional Executive Committee on China in May.<ref name=20161017hongkongfp/> In September, Angela spoke before the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and also made an emotional plea on behalf of her father on Swedish television, an appearance which prompted another public statement by Wallstr\u00f6m on the detention. The Swedish government, which said that they had been involved in \"quiet diplomacy\" with the Chinese regime, secured a second audience with Gui after 11 months of detention.<ref name=\"20161017hongkongfp\"/>\n\nA year after Gui's disappearance, there was a general consensus among commentators that the five booksellers had been abducted by Chinese authorities.<ref name=\"AutoLM-1\"/> {{as of|2016|October}}, Gui has spent a year in detention, while the other four men were released in early March 2016.<ref name=\"20160304guardian\"/><ref name=\"scmp1922757\"/> One colleague, [[Lam Wing-kee]], gave an interview that received significant media coverage in which he spoke in great detail about his abduction and his months in detention by mainland law enforcement in Ningbo and subsequently Shaoguan.

He said that Sweden had sensationalised his case and tricked him into an unsuccessful attempt to leave China using a medical appointment at the Swedish embassy in Beijing as a pretext. They would supposedly wait for an opportunity to repatriate Gui to Sweden. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International denounced \"this sort of contrived [confession] made in incommunicado detention\".

The men, who claimed to have \"connections within the Chinese Communist Party\", apparently used a mixture of inducements, manipulation and threats on her. She was told that her father's release would be contingent on her stopping her campaign and avoiding media engagement. They offered her a Chinese visa as well as a job in the Chinese embassy.<ref name=20190214theguardian>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/sweden-investigates-ambassador-china-strange-meetings|title=Sweden investigates its Beijing ambassador over 'strange' meetings|first=Kate|last=Lyons|date=14 February 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215123737/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/sweden-investigates-ambassador-china-strange-meetings|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> To Angela, Ambassador Lindstedt's presence and seemingly supportive stance suggested the talks were initiated by the Swedish foreign ministry.

When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the [[Wang Lijun incident]] in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10&nbsp;million from the surge in book sales.<ref name=scmp1902296/> Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in [[Pattaya]], Thailand.<ref name=scmp1902296/><ref name=20151208guardian/>\n\nThe [[International Publishers Association]] announced in February 2018 that Gui was the winner of the association's Publishing Freedom Award for fearless publishing in the face of adversity.<ref name=appledaily57782485>{{cite web|url=https://hk.news.appledaily.com/china/realtime/article/20180201/57782485|title=\u3010\u9285\u947c\u7063\u66f8\u5e97\u3011\u6842\u6c11\u6d77\u7372\u570b\u969b\u51fa\u7248\u81ea\u7531\u734e \u8a55\u5be9\uff1a\u8868\u73fe\u82f1\u52c7\u7121\u61fc\u7cbe\u795e|website=Apple Daily|language=zh|access-date=2 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203065434/https://hk.news.appledaily.com/china/realtime/article/20180201/57782485|archive-date=3 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Disappearance ==\nHis colleagues last heard from Gui Minhai on 15 October 2015.<ref name=\"scmp1922289\"/> Gui was captured on closed circuit TV leaving his apartment in [[Pattaya]], Thailand on 17 October 2015, apparently taken away by an unknown man.<ref name=\"time4184324\"/> He was the second bookseller associated with Causeway Bay Books to apparently vanish without trace: Lui Bo had last been seen near his home in Shenzhen on 14 October 2015; three others would also disappear in the weeks that followed.<ref name=\"Initium\"/> The three were reported missing in November.<ref name=scmp1897366/> Lee Bo (sometimes, Paul Lee, also, Lee Po) had been informing the media of the disappearances of his other four colleagues when he himself vanished from Hong Kong on 30 December.<ref name=bbc35219260/> Lee's disappearance, due to the improbability that Lee had gone to Shenzhen while his [[Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents|mainland travel permit]] was left at home, crystallised a great deal of anxiety about the pattern of bookshop disappearances and of the possibility of [[extraordinary rendition|cross-border renditions]].<ref name=\"bbc35219260\"/> Lee Bo's disappearance prompted Hong Kong Chief executive [[CY Leung]] to hold a press conference on 4 January 2016 in which he stated that it would be \"unacceptable\" and a breach of the [[Basic Law]] if mainland Chinese law officials were operating in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"20160105nytimes\"/><ref name=\"20160107guardianpull\"/>\n\nTwo weeks after Gui's disappearance, four men came to search his apartment \u2013 ostensibly for his computer \u2013 but left without it.<ref name=\"AutoAI-5\"/><ref name=\"AutoAI-6\"/><ref name=\"time4184324\"/> A manager from the estate where Gui lived attempted to contact Gui on the number of the person who called her last regarding Gui.

The two discrepancies created doubts that there may have been a case of mistaken identity.<ref name=20160121cpianalysis/><ref name=20160117hongkongfp/><ref name=\"AutoAI-7\"/> Xinhua claimed that Gui gave himself up to public security officials in October 2015.<ref name=latimes20160120/><ref name=\"xinhuanet1117800737\"/> Contrary to Xinhua's claims, news reports from 2004 about the court proceedings from the traffic accident did not suggest Gui intended to abscond, instead he expressed a willingness to assume \"full responsibility\" in the form of economic compensation.

In the 10-minute exclusive video, a tearful Gui expressed his remorse over a killing charge that he had absconded from a decade earlier. He said that his return to mainland China and his surrender were \"my personal choice and had nothing to do with anyone else. I should shoulder my responsibility and I don't want any individual or institutions to interfere, or viciously hype up my return\". Gui also said, \"Although I have Swedish citizenship, I truly feel that I am still Chinese \u2013 my roots are in China. So I hope Sweden can respect my personal choice, respect my rights and privacy of my personal choice and allow me to resolve my own problems\". Criminal investigations on other charges were said to be in progress.<ref name=latimes20160120/><ref name=20160121cpianalysis/><ref name=\"xinhuanet1117800737\"/><ref name=20160117hongkongfp/> It was only on 19 January, when fellow Swedish citizen [[Peter Dahlin]], cofounder of an NGO providing legal training for local lawyers in China, appeared on television, confessing to having violated Chinese law and \"caused harm to the Chinese government [and] hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\", that it came to international attention that Gui had also confessed on television; Dahlin was subsequently deported.<ref name=nbcnews505046/> [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned China's [[forced confession]]s, and urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for \"knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress\".<ref name=rthk/> Lee Bo's letter to his wife on 17 January said that he had voluntarily gone to the mainland to assist Chinese law enforcement in an investigation that involved Gui. He denounced Gui as \"a morally unacceptable person\" who had got him into trouble with the authorities.<ref name=20160119straitstimes/><ref name=20160121cpianalysis/>\n\n[[File:Gui-minhai.jpg|thumb|Gui's video confession broadcast on [[China Central Television]] on 17 January 2016]]\nGui's confession was received with incredulity, and many of the facts surrounding his disappearance from Thailand, including the release of the video three months after his disappearance, were called into question.<ref name=20160117hongkongfp/><ref name=scmp1902805/> The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, [[Jasper Tsang]], said: \"the China Central Television (CCTV) report [and broadcast of Gui Minghau's confession] did not seem to be able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation\".<ref name=australian/> Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying: \"Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility\".<ref name=\"201601asiancorrespondent\"/> ''The Washington Post'' said: \"The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even\".<ref name=20160118wapo/><ref name=qz596565/> Amnesty International's China researcher cast doubt on the narrative, asking: \"Why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case? How could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of Gui Minhai have any connection to the case?\"<ref name=20160117guardian/> ''The Guardian'' drew a connection to [[Operation Fox Hunt]], a Chinese government campaign launched by Xi Jinping in 2014 to repatriate corrupt officials or opponents of the regime who had fled abroad, and which may also have been responsible for the abduction of the other missing booksellers.<ref name=20151208guardian/> By mid-June 2016, Gui's family had not yet received official confirmation that he was under detention, according to Gui's daughter.<ref name=scmp1976776/>\n\n=== Reaction to detention ===\n[[File:Kidnap by Kacey Wong.jpg|thumb|Artist [[Kacey Wong]] protesting against the Causeway Bay booksellers disappearances. The sign in his hand says \"Hostage is well\". 10 February 2016]]\n[[Bei Ling]], a personal friend of Gui and president of Independent Chinese PEN, said that Gui had not given himself up voluntarily but had in fact been abducted.<ref name=\"bbc160118\"/> He confirmed that there had indeed been a drink-driving case involving Gui in which a young woman was killed but that the accident and his disappearance were unrelated.<ref name=20160119straitstimes/><ref name=20160121cpianalysis/> Bei asserted that there was no official record of Gui's departure from Thailand, and that international law had been violated by Gui's kidnapping.<ref name=\"bbc160118\"/> He speculated that the abductors had returned to Gui's apartment to retrieve his passport, and that Gui may have been sent to China from Cambodia on a plane loaded with Chinese deportees.<ref name=20151208guardian/> Gui's daughter Angela had been notified of her father's disappearance in an email from Lee Bo dated 10 November in which Lee said he feared Gui had been taken to China \"for political reasons\".<ref name=scmp1922289/> Angela dismissed the assertion that her father had returned to the mainland voluntarily.<ref name=latimes20160120/><ref name=australian/>\n\nSweden has repeatedly requested transparency from China, and summoned the Thai ambassador for information in December.<ref name=latimes20160120/> After the appearance of the video confession, the Swedish foreign ministry reported that a Swedish envoy was finally allowed to visit Gui.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"scmp1966843\"/> In January 2016, Swedish foreign minister [[Margot Wallstr\u00f6m]] condemned the forced confessions of Dahlin and Gui (who are both Swedish citizens) on Chinese television, terming them \"unacceptable\". The Chinese government has said that Gui was first and foremost a Chinese subject, and the Swedish government seems to have quietly accepted this position. The Swedish diplomatic effort has been through consular channels and has been low-profile.<ref name=20161017hongkongfp/>\n\nIn late February 2016, state media appeared to clarify the charges against Gui, saying that Gui was being held for \"illegal business operations\". He is alleged to have knowingly distributed books not approved by China's press and publication authority \u2013 according to the charges, some 4,000 such books had been sent by post disguised as different books to 380 buyers in 28 cities in mainland China since October 2014.<ref name=\"20160229hongkongfp\"/> Also in early February, the European Parliament issued a statement asking for Gui, Lee Bo, and their three colleagues at Causeway Bay Books to be released immediately. In his report on Hong Kong for the second half of 2015, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond expressed concern about the Causeway Bay Books disappearances, and said in particular that the abduction of Gui's colleague Lee Bo, a British citizen, from Hong Kong was \"a serious breach of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on Hong Kong and undermines the principle of [[one country, two systems]]\".<ref name=\"20160212theguardian\"/>\n\nGui's detention was discussed at the US Congressional Executive Committee on China in May.<ref name=20161017hongkongfp/> In September, Angela spoke before the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and also made an emotional plea on behalf of her father on Swedish television, an appearance which prompted another public statement by Wallstr\u00f6m on the detention. The Swedish government, which said that they had been involved in \"quiet diplomacy\" with the Chinese regime, secured a second audience with Gui after 11 months of detention.<ref name=\"20161017hongkongfp\"/>\n\nA year after Gui's disappearance, there was a general consensus among commentators that the five booksellers had been abducted by Chinese authorities.<ref name=\"AutoLM-1\"/> {{as of|2016|October}}, Gui has spent a year in detention, while the other four men were released in early March 2016.<ref name=\"20160304guardian\"/><ref name=\"scmp1922757\"/> One colleague, [[Lam Wing-kee]], gave an interview that received significant media coverage in which he spoke in great detail about his abduction and his months in detention by mainland law enforcement in Ningbo and subsequently Shaoguan. Their other colleagues have remained low profile and refused comment.<ref name=\"scmp1976598\"/>\n\nIn June 2017, Swedish Prime Minister [[Stefan L\u00f6fven]] talked to the Chinese President during a state visit about the case of Gui Minhai.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2017-06-26/lofven-lyfte-fragan-om-minhai-med-presidenten|title=L\u00f6fven lyfte fr\u00e5gan om Minhai med presidenten|work=Sydsvenskan|accessdate=26 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626105901/https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2017-06-26/lofven-lyfte-fragan-om-minhai-med-presidenten|archive-date=26 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Release from PSB custody and apparent recapture ===\nAccording to Chinese officials, Gui Minhai was set free on 17 October 2017; Sweden's Foreign Ministry had received notification from the Chinese authorities that Gui had been released, \"although neither his daughter nor Swedish authorities knew of his whereabouts\" for a certain time afterwards.<ref name=cnn_griffths>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/24/asia/gui-minhai-hong-kong-china/index.html|title=China frees Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai but his whereabouts unknown|first=James|last=Griffiths|publisher=CNN|access-date=3 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104073329/https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/24/asia/gui-minhai-hong-kong-china/index.html|archive-date=4 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On 19 January 2018, a group of about 10 men in plain clothes boarded a train bound for Beijing and pulled Gui from the train.

Gui, who had been in custody or under close surveillance for the past two years, appeared to have been freed in October 2017. He said that Sweden had sensationalised his case and tricked him into an unsuccessful attempt to leave China using a medical appointment at the Swedish embassy in Beijing as a pretext. They would supposedly wait for an opportunity to repatriate Gui to Sweden. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International denounced \"this sort of contrived [confession] made in incommunicado detention\". Sweden later condemned China's \"brutal intervention\" in Gui's case the following week.<ref name=20180210theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/10/bookseller-gui-minhai-surfaces-in-chinese-custody-to-deliver-staged-confession|title=Bookseller Gui Minhai surfaces in Chinese custody to deliver staged confession|first=Tom|last=Phillips|date=10 February 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=10 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210234456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/10/bookseller-gui-minhai-surfaces-in-chinese-custody-to-deliver-staged-confession|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Misinformation campaign===\nA study by the [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]] which analysed the tweets of Chinese government-controlled accounts banned by Twitter in response to the [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests]] found that the accounts also targeted Gui Minhai.

The men, who claimed to have \"connections within the Chinese Communist Party\", apparently used a mixture of inducements, manipulation and threats on her. She was told that her father's release would be contingent on her stopping her campaign and avoiding media engagement.
