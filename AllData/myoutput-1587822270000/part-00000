Reddy was accused of completely rigging iron ore mining in this area and defrauding the government. [[Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation]] officials had clues to tax evasion and found that Reddy had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with a one-dollar company in Singapore to camouflage the company's income suppression. They raided the place along with other investigative agencies and formed a report which served as the basis of the report on illegal mining. Reddy is said to have designed a \"Zero-Risk system\" of iron ore mining, where he seamlessly provided protection to unauthorized and unaccounted mining, with active connivance from government officials at all levels. The rule of the iron ore mafia under his command was called the \"Republic of Bellary\" in which no external control or governance mechanism had any effect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-the-republic-of-bellary-a-ministers/825181/|title=In the 'Republic of Bellary', a minister's 'muscle power'|date=1 August 2011|work=The Indian Express}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/karnataka/article2302226.ece|title=Report details Reddys' rule over 'Republic of Bellary'|date=28 July 2011|work=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n=== Bribery ===\nThe CBI is investigating the alleged bribing of the [[Hyderabad]] Special Court judge T.

Reddy was accused of completely rigging iron ore mining in this area and defrauding the government. [[Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation]] officials had clues to tax evasion and found that Reddy had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with a one-dollar company in Singapore to camouflage the company's income suppression. They raided the place along with other investigative agencies and formed a report which served as the basis of the report on illegal mining. Reddy is said to have designed a \"Zero-Risk system\" of iron ore mining, where he seamlessly provided protection to unauthorized and unaccounted mining, with active connivance from government officials at all levels. The rule of the iron ore mafia under his command was called the \"Republic of Bellary\" in which no external control or governance mechanism had any effect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-the-republic-of-bellary-a-ministers/825181/|title=In the 'Republic of Bellary', a minister's 'muscle power'|date=1 August 2011|work=The Indian Express}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/karnataka/article2302226.ece|title=Report details Reddys' rule over 'Republic of Bellary'|date=28 July 2011|work=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n=== Bribery ===\nThe CBI is investigating the alleged bribing of the [[Hyderabad]] Special Court judge T.
