The satrapy became a kingdom in 321 BC during the reign of the [[Orontid dynasty]] after the conquest of [[Iran|Persia]] by [[Alexander the Great]], which was then incorporated as one of the  [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] kingdoms of the [[Seleucid Empire]].\n\nUnder the Seleucid Empire (312\u201363 BC), the Armenian throne was divided in two \u2013 '''Armenia Maior''' and [[Sophene]] \u2013 both of which passed to members of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]] in 189 BC. During the [[Roman Republic]]'s eastern expansion, the Kingdom of Armenia, under [[Tigranes the Great]], reached its peak, from 83 to 69 BC, after it reincorporated Sophene and conquered the remaining territories of the falling Seleucid Empire, effectively ending its existence and raising Armenia into an empire for a brief period, until it was itself conquered by Rome in 69 BC. The remaining Artaxiad kings ruled as clients of Rome until they were overthrown in 12 AD due to their possible allegiance to Rome's main rival in the region, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]].\n\nDuring the [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars]], the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia]] was founded when [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]], a member of the Parthian Arsacid dynasty, was proclaimed King of Armenia in 52. Throughout most of its history during this period, Armenia was heavily contested between [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and Parthia, and the [[Armenian nobility]] was divided among pro-Roman, pro-Parthian or neutrals. From 114 to 118, Armenia briefly became a [[Roman province|province]] of the Roman Empire under [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]]. The Kingdom of Armenia often served as a client state or vassal at the frontier of the two large empires and their successors, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires. In 301, [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] proclaimed [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Christianity]] as the state religion of Armenia, making the Armenian kingdom the first state to embrace Christianity officially.\n\nDuring the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars]], Armenia was ultimately partitioned into [[Byzantine Armenia]] in 387 and [[Persian Armenia]] in 428.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Armenia}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|Origin of the Armenians}}\nThe geographic [[Armenian Highlands]], then known as the [[Mountains of Ararat|highlands of Ararat]] ([[Akkadian language|Assyrian]]: Urartu), was originally inhabited by Proto-Armenian tribes which did not yet constitute a unitary state or nation. The highlands were first united by tribes in the vicinity of [[Lake Van]] into the [[Urartu|Kingdom of Van]] ([[Urartian language|Urartian]]: Biainili). The kingdom [[Urartu\u2013Assyria War|competed with Assyria]] over supremacy in the highlands of Ararat and the [[Fertile Crescent]].\n\nBoth kingdoms fell to [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] invaders from the neighbouring East ([[Medes]], followed by [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]]) in the 6th century BC. Its territory was reorganized into a [[satrapy]] called [[Satrapy of Armenia|Armenia]] ([[Old Persian]]: Armina, [[Elamite language|Elamite]]: Harminuya, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: Urashtu). The [[Orontid dynasty]] ruled as satraps of the Achaemenid Empire for three centuries until the empire's defeat against [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Macedonian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] in 331 BC. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, a [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Macedonian]] general named [[Neoptolemus (general)|Neoptolemus]] obtained Armenia until he died in 321 BC and the Orontids returned, not as satraps, but as kings.\n\n===Orontid Dynasty===\n{{Main|Orontid Dynasty}}\n\n[[Orontes III]] and the ruler of [[Lesser Armenia]], Mithridates, recognized themselves independent, thus elevating the former Armenian satrapy into a kingdom, giving birth to the kingdoms of Armenia and Lesser Armenia. Orontes III also defeated the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|commander Menon]], who wanted to capture [[\u0130spir|Sper]]'s gold mines.\n\nWeakened by the [[Seleucid Empire]] which succeeded the Macedonian Empire, the last Orontid king, [[Orontes IV]], was overthrown in 200/201 BC and the kingdom was taken over by a commander of the [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Artashes I]], who is presumed to be related to the [[Orontid dynasty]] himself.\n\n===Artaxiad dynasty===\n[[File:Artaxiad Armenia 80BC-fr.svg|250px|right|thumb|[[Tigran II]]'s Great Armenia]]\n[[File:Roman East 50-en.svg|250px|thumb|left|Map of Armenia and the Roman client states in eastern Asia Minor, ca. 50 AD, before the Roman\u2013Parthian War and the annexation of the client kingdoms into the Empire]]\n{{Main|Artaxiad dynasty}}\nThe [[Seleucid Empire]]'s influence over Armenia had weakened after it was defeated by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in the [[Battle of Magnesia]] in 190 BC. A Hellenistic Armenian state was thus founded in the same year by [[Artaxias I]] alongside the Armenian kingdom of [[Sophene]] led by [[Zariadres]]. Artaxias seized [[Yervandashat (ancient city)|Yervandashat]], united the [[Armenian Highlands]] at the expense of neighboring tribes and founded the new royal capital of [[Artaxata]] near the [[Araxes River]].<ref name=\"RichardHovannisian\">{{cite book | last = Hovannisian | first = Richard G. | title = The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2004 | page = 49 | isbn = 1-4039-6421-1}}</ref> According to [[Strabo]] and [[Plutarch]], [[Hannibal Barca]] received hospitality at the Armenian court of Artaxias I.

In 83 BC, at the invitation of one of the factions in the interminable civil wars, he entered Syria, and soon established himself as ruler of Syria\u2014putting the [[Seleucid Empire]] virtually at an end\u2014and ruled peacefully for 17 years. During the zenith of his rule, Tigranes the Great extended Armenia's territory outside of the Armenian Highland over parts of the Caucasus and the area that is now south-eastern [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], becoming one of the most powerful states in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] East.\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{Main|Roman Armenia}}\n[[File:Antoninus Pius \u00c6 Sestertius 84001035.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman coin of 141 AD, showing emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] holding a crown on the Armenia King's head]]\nArmenia came under the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[sphere of influence]] in 66 BC, after the [[battle of Tigranocerta]] and the final defeat of Armenia's ally, [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]]. [[Mark Antony]] invaded and defeated the kingdom in 34 BC, but the Romans lost [[hegemony]] during the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] in 32\u201330 BC. In 20 BC, [[Augustus]] negotiated a truce with the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], making Armenia a [[Buffer state|buffer zone]] between the two major powers.\n\nAugustus installed [[Tigranes V of Armenia|Tigranes V]] as king of Armenia in AD 6, but ruled with [[Erato of Armenia]]. The Romans then installed [[Mithridates of Armenia]] as client king. Mithridates was arrested by [[Caligula]], but later restored by [[Claudius]]. Subsequently, Armenia was often a focus of contention between Rome and Parthia, with both major powers supporting opposing [[monarch|sovereign]]s and [[usurper]]s. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission in AD 37, but in AD 47 the Romans retook control of the kingdom. In AD 51 Armenia fell to an [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian]] invasion sponsored by Parthia, led by [[Rhadamistus]]. [[Tigranes VI of Armenia]] ruled from AD 58, again installed by Roman support. The period of turmoil ends in AD 66, when [[Tiridates I of Armenia]] was crowned king of Armenia by [[Nero]]. For the remaining duration of the Armenian kingdom, Rome still considered it a client kingdom ''de jure'', but the ruling dynasty was of Parthian extraction, and contemporary Roman writers thought that Nero had ''de facto'' yielded Armenia to the Parthians.<ref>Redgate, Anne Elizabeth (2000). ''The Armenians'' (First ed.). Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers Inc. pp. 88\u201391. {{ISBN|0-631-22037-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Arsacid dynasty===\n{{Main|Arsacid dynasty of Armenia}}\nUnder [[Nero]], the Romans fought a campaign (55\u201363) against the [[Parthian Empire]], which had invaded the Kingdom of Armenia, allied with the Romans. After gaining Armenia in 60, then losing it in 62, the Romans sent the [[Legio XV Apollinaris|Legio XV ''Apollinaris'']] from [[Pannonia]] to [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], ''[[legatus]]'' of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. In 63, strengthened further by the legions [[Legio III Gallica|III ''Gallica'']], [[Legio V Macedonica|V ''Macedonica'']], [[Legio X Fretensis|X ''Fretensis'']] and [[Legio XXII Deiotariana|XXII]], General Corbulo entered into the territories of [[Vologases I of Parthia]], who then returned the Armenian kingdom to [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates]], king Vologases I's brother.\n\nAnother campaign was led by Emperor [[Lucius Verus]] in 162\u2013165, after [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] had invaded Armenia and installed his chief general on its throne. To counter the Parthian threat, Verus set out for the east. His army won significant victories and retook the capital. [[Sohaemus]], a Roman citizen of Armenian heritage, was installed as the new [[client king]]. But during an epidemic within the Roman forces, Parthians retook most of their lost territory in 166. Sohaemus retreated to Syria, and the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid's dynasty]] was restored to power over Armenia.\n\nAfter the fall of the Arsacid dynasty in Persia, the succeeding [[Sasanian Empire]] aspired to reestablish Persian control. The Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252. However, in 287, [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III the Great]] was established King of Armenia by the Roman armies. After [[Gregory the Illuminator]]'s spreading of Christianity in Armenia, Tiridates accepted Christianity and made it his kingdom's official religion. The traditional date for Armenia's conversion to Christianity is established at 301, preceding the Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great]]'s conversion and the [[Edict of Milan]] by a dozen years.\n\nIn 387, the Kingdom of Armenia was split between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the Persian Empire. Western Armenia first became a [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Roman Empire]] under the name of [[Armenia Minor]], and later [[Byzantine Armenia]]; [[Eastern Armenia]] remained a kingdom within Persia until, in 428, the local [[nobility]] overthrew the king, and the Sassanids installed a [[governor]] in his place, beginning the [[Marzpanate Armenia|Marzpanate]] period over [[Persian Armenia]]. Those parts of historical Armenia remained firmly under Persian control until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], while the Byzantine parts remained until being conquered, also by invading Arabic armies, in the 7th century. In 885, after years of Roman, Persian, and Arab rule, Armenia regained its independence under the [[Bagratuni dynasty]].\n\n==Army==\n{{Main|Military history of Armenia}}\n\n===Under Tigranes the Great===\nThe army of the Kingdom of Armenia reached its peak under the reign of [[Tigranes the Great]]. According to the author of ''[[Judith]]'', his army included chariots and 12,000 cavalrymen, most likely heavy cavalry or [[cataphract]]s, a unit also commonly used by Seleucids and Parthians. His army consisted mainly of 120,000 infantrymen and 12,000 [[Horse archery|mounted archers]],  also an important feature of the [[Parthian army]]. Like the Seleucids, the bulk of Tigranes' army were foot soldiers. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] talks of 500,000 men in total, including camp followers. These followers consisted of camels, donkeys, and mules used for baggage, sheep, cattle, and goats for food, said to be stocked in abundance for each man, and hoards of gold and silver. As a result, the marching Armenian army was listed as \"a huge, irregular force, too many to count, like locusts or the dust of the earth\", not unlike many other enormous Eastern armies of the time. The smaller [[Cappadocia]]n, Graeco-Phoenician, and [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] armies were generally no match for the sheer number of soldiers, with the organized [[Roman army]] with its [[Roman legion|legions]] eventually posing a much greater challenge to the Armenians.<ref>{{cite book  | last = W |first = Aa. | title = Materia Giudaica X/1 | publisher = Editrice La Giuntina | year = 2005  | isbn = 88-8057-226-1 | page = 93}}</ref>\n\nNote that the numbers given by Israelite historians of the time were probably exaggerated, considering the fact that the [[Hasmonean]] Jews lost the war against Tigranes.\n\n{{cquote|Plutarch wrote that the Armenian archers could kill from 200 meters with their deadly-accurate arrows. The Romans admired and respected the bravery and the warrior spirit of the Armenian Cavalry \u2013 the core of Tigran's Army. The Roman historian Sallustius Crispus wrote that the Armenian [Ayrudzi \u2013 lit. horsemen] Cavalry was \"remarkable by the beauty of their horses and armor\". Horses in Armenia, since ancient times were considered as the most important part and pride of the warrior.<ref>Gevork Nazaryan, Armenian Empire.</ref>}}\n\n===Ayrudzi===\nFrom ancient times in Armenia there existed \"Azatavrear\" cavalry which consisted of the Armenian elite. \"Azatavrear\" cavalry made up the main part of the Armenian king's court. In medieval times \"Azatavrear\" cavalry were collected from nobles (usually the youngest sons of Armenian lords), and were known as Ayrudzi, or \"horsemen.\" During times of peace, Armenian cavalry were divided into small groups which took the roles of guarding the King and other Armenian lords, as well as their families. Some part of the Armenian cavalry force was always patrolling Armenian borders, under the command of an Armenian general (sparapet). The group of Armenian cavalry whose main mission was the protection of the Armenian king and his family consisted of 6000 heavily armored horsemen in the ancient period, and 3000 horsemen in the medieval period. During times of war, the number of Armenian cavalry would rise, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to at least 20,000 horsemen. Besides heavy cavalry, there was also light cavalry, which primarily consisted of mounted archers.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Legio I Armeniaca-Armenian First Legion===\n\"Legio Armeniaca\" translates from Latin as \"Armenian Legion\" and \"prima\" as \"first\". The Armenian First Legion was one of the later-period Roman imperial legions. This Legion was mentioned in the late-antique text known as Notitia Dignitatum. It is most likely that the Armenian First Legion was formed in the 2nd or 3rd century AD, in the western part of the Kingdom, with the mission to protect the lands of Armenia from intrusion. It might first have been the garrison of Armenian lands which had been under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. The Armenian First Legion took part in the ill-fated Persian campaign of the emperor Julianus Apostata in 363.\n\n===Legio II Armeniaca-Armenian Second Legion===\n\"Legio Armeniaca\" translates from Latin as \"Armenian [[Roman legion|Legion]]\" and \"Secunda\" as \"Second\". Like the First legion, the Armenian Second Legion was one of the later-period [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] legions. This legion is also mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum. The Armenian Second Legion was thought to have been created around the end of the 3rd century or in the beginning of the 4th century. The Armenian Second Legion had a permanent camp in one of the Northern provinces of the Orient, and built a camp in [[Satala]]. The Armenian Second legion is mentioned in the year 360 AD as a part of the garrison of Bezabda (anciently called Phoencia) in upper Tigris. In [[Bezabde]] the Armenian Second Legion served together with the Legions Parthica and II Flavia. In 390 AD [[Bezabde]] was taken by the Persian army, and a terrible bloodbath ensued against the inhabitants and garrison. The legion seemed to have survived this battle, because it appears in Notitia Dignitatum, which was written in the 5th century.\n\nLater on, the Armenian Second legion became a part of the Byzantine army.\n\n==Mythology and pre-Christian religion==\n{{Main|Armenian mythology|Armenian Apostolic Church}}\nThe [[Armenian mythology#Pantheon|pre-Christian Armenian pantheon]] included:\n* '''[[Aramazd]]''' - Cognate of the Iranian [[Ahura Mazda]] (or [[Ormazd]]).  Head of the pantheon, identified with Zeus in the ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''.\n* '''[[Amanor and Vanatur|Amanor]]''' and/or '''[[Amanor and Vanatur|Vanatur]]''' -  God of the Armenian new year, Navasard, at the end of July.

God of the sun and light, son of [[Aramazd]], the brother of [[Anahit]] and [[Nane (goddess)|Nane]]. His center of worship was located in Bagaharich, and the temple of Garni was dedicated to him.\n* '''[[Nane (goddess)|Nane]]''' - Possible cognate of the Sumerian [[Nanaya]].  Daughter of Aramazd, war and motherhood goddess.  Her cult was related to [[Anahit]], both of their temples located near each other in [[Gavar]].\n* '''[[Tir (god)|Tir]]''' or '''Tiur''' - God of wisdom, culture, science and studies, he also was an interpreter of dreams. He was the messenger of the gods and was associated with [[Apollo]]. Tir's temple was located near [[Artashat (ancient city)|Artashat]].\n* '''[[Tsovinar (goddess)|Tsovinar]]''' - Also called '''Nar''', she was the goddess of rain, sea and water, though she was actually a fiery being who forced rain to fall.\n* '''[[Vahagn]]''' - Cognate of the Iranian [[Verethragna]].  The storm god and [[herculean]] dragon slayer.  [[Derik]] housed the central temple to Vahagn.\n\nDuring the 1st century AD, Christianity spread through Armenia due to (according to legend) the efforts of the apostles [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] and [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]].  After persecutions by kings [[Sanatruk]], [[Axidares of Armenia|Axidares]], [[Khosrov I of Armenia|Khosrov I]], and [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]], Christianity was adopted as the state religion by Tiridates III after he was converted by [[Gregory the Illuminator]].

The story of the foundation is given by the Armenian historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] of the 5th century: \"Artashes traveled to the location of the confluence of the [[Aras (river)|Yeraskh]] and [[Akhurian River|Metsamor]] [rivers] and taking a liking to the position of the hills (adjacent to [[Mount Ararat]]), he chose it as the location of his new city, naming it after himself.\"<ref>{{in lang|hy}} [[Movses Khorenatsi]].

The city's strategic position in the Araks valley on the [[Silk Road]] soon made Artashat a centre of bustling economic activity and thriving international trade, linking [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] with the [[Caucasus]] and [[Asia Minor]]. Its economic wealth can be gauged in the numerous bathhouses, markets, workshops, and administrative buildings that sprang up during the reign of Artashes I. The city had its own treasury and customs. The amphitheatre of Artashat was built during the reign of king [[Artavasdes II of Armenia|Artavasdes II]] (55\u201334 BC). The remains of the huge walls surrounding the city built by King Artashes I can still be found in the area. After losing its status as a capital, Artashat gradually lost its significance.\n* [[Tigranakert (Silvan)|Tigranakert]] was founded by the Armenian emperor [[Tigranes the Great]] in the 1st century BC. Tigranakert was founded as the new capital of the Armenian Empire in order to be in a more central position within the boundaries of the expanding empire. Its population was 120,000 and it also had many [[temple]]s and an [[amphitheater]].\n* [[Vagharshapat]] \u2013 In the first half of the 1st century, during the reign of the Armenian [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arshakuni]] king [[Vologases III of Parthia|Vologases I (Vagharsh I)]] (117\u2013144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed '''Vaghasrhapat''' (\u054e\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0580\u0577\u0561\u057a\u0561\u057f), which still persists as the official appellation of the city. The original name, as preserved by Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] (''Persian Wars''), was Valashabad\u2014\"Valash/Balash city\" named after king Balash/Valash/Valarsh of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial L into a Gh, which is common in [[Armenian language]]. Khorenatsi mentions that the town of Vardges was totally rebuilt and fenced by Vagharsh I, eventually becoming known as '''Noarakaghak''' (The New City) or Vagharshapat. The city served as a capital for the Ashakuni Kingdom of Armenia between 120\u2013330 AD and remained the country's most important city until the end of the 4th century. When Christianity became the state religion of Armenia, Vagharshapat was eventually called Ejmiatsin (or Etchmiadzin), after the name of the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral|Mother Cathedral]]. Starting in 301, the city became the spiritual centre of the Armenian nation, home to the Armenian Catholicosate, one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. Vagharshapat was home to one of the oldest schools established by Saint [[Mesrop Mashtots|Mashtots]] and the home of the first manuscripts library in Armenia founded in 480 AD. Starting in the 6th century, the city slowly lost its importance\u2014especially after the transfer of the seat of the Catholicosate to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 452\u2014until the foundation of the [[Bagratid Armenia|Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]] in 885. After the fall of the Bagratid dynasty in 1045, the city gradually became an insignificant place until 1441, when the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate was transferred from the [[Cilicia]]n town of [[Kozan, Adana|Sis]] back to Etchmiadzin.\n* [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] \u2013 The ancient city of Dvin was built by [[Khosrov III the Small]] in 335 on the site of an ancient settlement and fortress from the 3rd millennium BC.  Since then the city had been used as the primary residence of the Armenian kings of the [[Arshakuni dynasty]]. Dvin had a population of about 100,000 citizens of various professions including arts and crafts, trade, fishing, etc. After the fall of the Armenian Kingdom in 428, Dvin became the residence of Sassanid-appointed ''marzpans'' (governors), Byzantine ''kouropalates'' and later [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]]-appointed ''ostikans'' (governors), all of whom were of senior [[nakharar]] stock. In 640 Dvin was the center of the emirate of Armenia.\n\n==Political geography==\nThe Kingdom of Armenia was bordered by [[Caucasian Albania]] in the east, [[Caucasian Iberia]] in the north, the [[Roman Empire]] in the west, and Parthia, later succeeded by Sassanian Empire, in the south. The border between Caucasian Iberia and the Kingdom of Armenia was the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kur]] river, which was also the border between Caucasian Albania and Kingdom of Armenia.\n\nAfter 331 BC, Armenia was divided into [[Lesser Armenia]] (a region of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]]), the Kingdom of Armenia (corresponding to Armenia Major) and the [[Sophene|Kingdom of Sophene]]. In 189 BC when [[Artashes I]]'s reign began, many neighboring countries ([[Medes|Media]], [[Caucasian Iberia]], [[Seleucid Empire]]) exploiting the weakened state of the kingdom, conquered its remote regions. [[Strabo]] says that Artaxias I raided to the east and reunited [[Caspiane]] and [[Paytakaran]], then raided to the north, defeated the [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberians]], reuniting [[Gugark]] ([[Strabo]] also notes that Iberia recognized themselves as vassals of the Kingdom of Armenia at this time), to the west, reuniting [[Karin, Armenia|Karin]], Ekeghik and Derjan and to the south, where, after many battles with the [[Seleucid Empire]], he reunited Tmorik. Artaxias I was not able to reunite [[Lesser Armenia]],  [[Corduene]], and [[Sophene]], something completed by his grandson [[Tigranes the Great]]. During Artaxias I's reign the Kingdom of Armenia covered {{convert|350000|km2|sqmi|-3|abbr=on}}. At its peak, under Tigranes the Great, it covered {{convert|3000000|km2|sqmi|-3|abbr=on}}, incorporating, besides Armenia Major, [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Cilicia]], [[Armenian Mesopotamia]], [[Osroene]], [[Adiabene]], [[Syria]], [[Assyria]], [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]], [[Kingdom of Sophene|Sophene]], [[Judea]] and [[Atropatene]].

The satrapy became a kingdom in 321 BC during the reign of the [[Orontid dynasty]] after the conquest of [[Iran|Persia]] by [[Alexander the Great]], which was then incorporated as one of the  [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] kingdoms of the [[Seleucid Empire]].\n\nUnder the Seleucid Empire (312\u201363 BC), the Armenian throne was divided in two \u2013 '''Armenia Maior''' and [[Sophene]] \u2013 both of which passed to members of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]] in 189 BC. During the [[Roman Republic]]'s eastern expansion, the Kingdom of Armenia, under [[Tigranes the Great]], reached its peak, from 83 to 69 BC, after it reincorporated Sophene and conquered the remaining territories of the falling Seleucid Empire, effectively ending its existence and raising Armenia into an empire for a brief period, until it was itself conquered by Rome in 69 BC. The remaining Artaxiad kings ruled as clients of Rome until they were overthrown in 12 AD due to their possible allegiance to Rome's main rival in the region, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]].\n\nDuring the [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars]], the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia]] was founded when [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]], a member of the Parthian Arsacid dynasty, was proclaimed King of Armenia in 52. Throughout most of its history during this period, Armenia was heavily contested between [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and Parthia, and the [[Armenian nobility]] was divided among pro-Roman, pro-Parthian or neutrals. From 114 to 118, Armenia briefly became a [[Roman province|province]] of the Roman Empire under [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]]. The Kingdom of Armenia often served as a client state or vassal at the frontier of the two large empires and their successors, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires. In 301, [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] proclaimed [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Christianity]] as the state religion of Armenia, making the Armenian kingdom the first state to embrace Christianity officially.\n\nDuring the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars]], Armenia was ultimately partitioned into [[Byzantine Armenia]] in 387 and [[Persian Armenia]] in 428.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Armenia}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|Origin of the Armenians}}\nThe geographic [[Armenian Highlands]], then known as the [[Mountains of Ararat|highlands of Ararat]] ([[Akkadian language|Assyrian]]: Urartu), was originally inhabited by Proto-Armenian tribes which did not yet constitute a unitary state or nation. The highlands were first united by tribes in the vicinity of [[Lake Van]] into the [[Urartu|Kingdom of Van]] ([[Urartian language|Urartian]]: Biainili). The kingdom [[Urartu\u2013Assyria War|competed with Assyria]] over supremacy in the highlands of Ararat and the [[Fertile Crescent]].\n\nBoth kingdoms fell to [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] invaders from the neighbouring East ([[Medes]], followed by [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]]) in the 6th century BC. Its territory was reorganized into a [[satrapy]] called [[Satrapy of Armenia|Armenia]] ([[Old Persian]]: Armina, [[Elamite language|Elamite]]: Harminuya, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: Urashtu). The [[Orontid dynasty]] ruled as satraps of the Achaemenid Empire for three centuries until the empire's defeat against [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Macedonian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] in 331 BC. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, a [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Macedonian]] general named [[Neoptolemus (general)|Neoptolemus]] obtained Armenia until he died in 321 BC and the Orontids returned, not as satraps, but as kings.\n\n===Orontid Dynasty===\n{{Main|Orontid Dynasty}}\n\n[[Orontes III]] and the ruler of [[Lesser Armenia]], Mithridates, recognized themselves independent, thus elevating the former Armenian satrapy into a kingdom, giving birth to the kingdoms of Armenia and Lesser Armenia. Orontes III also defeated the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|commander Menon]], who wanted to capture [[\u0130spir|Sper]]'s gold mines.\n\nWeakened by the [[Seleucid Empire]] which succeeded the Macedonian Empire, the last Orontid king, [[Orontes IV]], was overthrown in 200/201 BC and the kingdom was taken over by a commander of the [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Artashes I]], who is presumed to be related to the [[Orontid dynasty]] himself.\n\n===Artaxiad dynasty===\n[[File:Artaxiad Armenia 80BC-fr.svg|250px|right|thumb|[[Tigran II]]'s Great Armenia]]\n[[File:Roman East 50-en.svg|250px|thumb|left|Map of Armenia and the Roman client states in eastern Asia Minor, ca. 50 AD, before the Roman\u2013Parthian War and the annexation of the client kingdoms into the Empire]]\n{{Main|Artaxiad dynasty}}\nThe [[Seleucid Empire]]'s influence over Armenia had weakened after it was defeated by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in the [[Battle of Magnesia]] in 190 BC. A Hellenistic Armenian state was thus founded in the same year by [[Artaxias I]] alongside the Armenian kingdom of [[Sophene]] led by [[Zariadres]]. Artaxias seized [[Yervandashat (ancient city)|Yervandashat]], united the [[Armenian Highlands]] at the expense of neighboring tribes and founded the new royal capital of [[Artaxata]] near the [[Araxes River]].<ref name=\"RichardHovannisian\">{{cite book | last = Hovannisian | first = Richard G. | title = The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2004 | page = 49 | isbn = 1-4039-6421-1}}</ref> According to [[Strabo]] and [[Plutarch]], [[Hannibal Barca]] received hospitality at the Armenian court of Artaxias I.

In 83 BC, at the invitation of one of the factions in the interminable civil wars, he entered Syria, and soon established himself as ruler of Syria\u2014putting the [[Seleucid Empire]] virtually at an end\u2014and ruled peacefully for 17 years. During the zenith of his rule, Tigranes the Great extended Armenia's territory outside of the Armenian Highland over parts of the Caucasus and the area that is now south-eastern [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], becoming one of the most powerful states in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] East.\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{Main|Roman Armenia}}\n[[File:Antoninus Pius \u00c6 Sestertius 84001035.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman coin of 141 AD, showing emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] holding a crown on the Armenia King's head]]\nArmenia came under the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[sphere of influence]] in 66 BC, after the [[battle of Tigranocerta]] and the final defeat of Armenia's ally, [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]]. [[Mark Antony]] invaded and defeated the kingdom in 34 BC, but the Romans lost [[hegemony]] during the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] in 32\u201330 BC. In 20 BC, [[Augustus]] negotiated a truce with the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], making Armenia a [[Buffer state|buffer zone]] between the two major powers.\n\nAugustus installed [[Tigranes V of Armenia|Tigranes V]] as king of Armenia in AD 6, but ruled with [[Erato of Armenia]]. The Romans then installed [[Mithridates of Armenia]] as client king. Mithridates was arrested by [[Caligula]], but later restored by [[Claudius]]. Subsequently, Armenia was often a focus of contention between Rome and Parthia, with both major powers supporting opposing [[monarch|sovereign]]s and [[usurper]]s. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission in AD 37, but in AD 47 the Romans retook control of the kingdom. In AD 51 Armenia fell to an [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian]] invasion sponsored by Parthia, led by [[Rhadamistus]]. [[Tigranes VI of Armenia]] ruled from AD 58, again installed by Roman support. The period of turmoil ends in AD 66, when [[Tiridates I of Armenia]] was crowned king of Armenia by [[Nero]]. For the remaining duration of the Armenian kingdom, Rome still considered it a client kingdom ''de jure'', but the ruling dynasty was of Parthian extraction, and contemporary Roman writers thought that Nero had ''de facto'' yielded Armenia to the Parthians.<ref>Redgate, Anne Elizabeth (2000). ''The Armenians'' (First ed.). Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers Inc. pp. 88\u201391. {{ISBN|0-631-22037-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Arsacid dynasty===\n{{Main|Arsacid dynasty of Armenia}}\nUnder [[Nero]], the Romans fought a campaign (55\u201363) against the [[Parthian Empire]], which had invaded the Kingdom of Armenia, allied with the Romans. After gaining Armenia in 60, then losing it in 62, the Romans sent the [[Legio XV Apollinaris|Legio XV ''Apollinaris'']] from [[Pannonia]] to [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], ''[[legatus]]'' of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. In 63, strengthened further by the legions [[Legio III Gallica|III ''Gallica'']], [[Legio V Macedonica|V ''Macedonica'']], [[Legio X Fretensis|X ''Fretensis'']] and [[Legio XXII Deiotariana|XXII]], General Corbulo entered into the territories of [[Vologases I of Parthia]], who then returned the Armenian kingdom to [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates]], king Vologases I's brother.\n\nAnother campaign was led by Emperor [[Lucius Verus]] in 162\u2013165, after [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] had invaded Armenia and installed his chief general on its throne. To counter the Parthian threat, Verus set out for the east. His army won significant victories and retook the capital. [[Sohaemus]], a Roman citizen of Armenian heritage, was installed as the new [[client king]]. But during an epidemic within the Roman forces, Parthians retook most of their lost territory in 166. Sohaemus retreated to Syria, and the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid's dynasty]] was restored to power over Armenia.\n\nAfter the fall of the Arsacid dynasty in Persia, the succeeding [[Sasanian Empire]] aspired to reestablish Persian control. The Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252. However, in 287, [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III the Great]] was established King of Armenia by the Roman armies. After [[Gregory the Illuminator]]'s spreading of Christianity in Armenia, Tiridates accepted Christianity and made it his kingdom's official religion. The traditional date for Armenia's conversion to Christianity is established at 301, preceding the Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great]]'s conversion and the [[Edict of Milan]] by a dozen years.\n\nIn 387, the Kingdom of Armenia was split between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the Persian Empire. Western Armenia first became a [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Roman Empire]] under the name of [[Armenia Minor]], and later [[Byzantine Armenia]]; [[Eastern Armenia]] remained a kingdom within Persia until, in 428, the local [[nobility]] overthrew the king, and the Sassanids installed a [[governor]] in his place, beginning the [[Marzpanate Armenia|Marzpanate]] period over [[Persian Armenia]]. Those parts of historical Armenia remained firmly under Persian control until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], while the Byzantine parts remained until being conquered, also by invading Arabic armies, in the 7th century. In 885, after years of Roman, Persian, and Arab rule, Armenia regained its independence under the [[Bagratuni dynasty]].\n\n==Army==\n{{Main|Military history of Armenia}}\n\n===Under Tigranes the Great===\nThe army of the Kingdom of Armenia reached its peak under the reign of [[Tigranes the Great]]. According to the author of ''[[Judith]]'', his army included chariots and 12,000 cavalrymen, most likely heavy cavalry or [[cataphract]]s, a unit also commonly used by Seleucids and Parthians. His army consisted mainly of 120,000 infantrymen and 12,000 [[Horse archery|mounted archers]],  also an important feature of the [[Parthian army]]. Like the Seleucids, the bulk of Tigranes' army were foot soldiers. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] talks of 500,000 men in total, including camp followers. These followers consisted of camels, donkeys, and mules used for baggage, sheep, cattle, and goats for food, said to be stocked in abundance for each man, and hoards of gold and silver. As a result, the marching Armenian army was listed as \"a huge, irregular force, too many to count, like locusts or the dust of the earth\", not unlike many other enormous Eastern armies of the time. The smaller [[Cappadocia]]n, Graeco-Phoenician, and [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] armies were generally no match for the sheer number of soldiers, with the organized [[Roman army]] with its [[Roman legion|legions]] eventually posing a much greater challenge to the Armenians.<ref>{{cite book  | last = W |first = Aa. | title = Materia Giudaica X/1 | publisher = Editrice La Giuntina | year = 2005  | isbn = 88-8057-226-1 | page = 93}}</ref>\n\nNote that the numbers given by Israelite historians of the time were probably exaggerated, considering the fact that the [[Hasmonean]] Jews lost the war against Tigranes.\n\n{{cquote|Plutarch wrote that the Armenian archers could kill from 200 meters with their deadly-accurate arrows. The Romans admired and respected the bravery and the warrior spirit of the Armenian Cavalry \u2013 the core of Tigran's Army. The Roman historian Sallustius Crispus wrote that the Armenian [Ayrudzi \u2013 lit. horsemen] Cavalry was \"remarkable by the beauty of their horses and armor\". Horses in Armenia, since ancient times were considered as the most important part and pride of the warrior.<ref>Gevork Nazaryan, Armenian Empire.</ref>}}\n\n===Ayrudzi===\nFrom ancient times in Armenia there existed \"Azatavrear\" cavalry which consisted of the Armenian elite. \"Azatavrear\" cavalry made up the main part of the Armenian king's court. In medieval times \"Azatavrear\" cavalry were collected from nobles (usually the youngest sons of Armenian lords), and were known as Ayrudzi, or \"horsemen.\" During times of peace, Armenian cavalry were divided into small groups which took the roles of guarding the King and other Armenian lords, as well as their families. Some part of the Armenian cavalry force was always patrolling Armenian borders, under the command of an Armenian general (sparapet). The group of Armenian cavalry whose main mission was the protection of the Armenian king and his family consisted of 6000 heavily armored horsemen in the ancient period, and 3000 horsemen in the medieval period. During times of war, the number of Armenian cavalry would rise, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to at least 20,000 horsemen. Besides heavy cavalry, there was also light cavalry, which primarily consisted of mounted archers.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Legio I Armeniaca-Armenian First Legion===\n\"Legio Armeniaca\" translates from Latin as \"Armenian Legion\" and \"prima\" as \"first\". The Armenian First Legion was one of the later-period Roman imperial legions. This Legion was mentioned in the late-antique text known as Notitia Dignitatum. It is most likely that the Armenian First Legion was formed in the 2nd or 3rd century AD, in the western part of the Kingdom, with the mission to protect the lands of Armenia from intrusion. It might first have been the garrison of Armenian lands which had been under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. The Armenian First Legion took part in the ill-fated Persian campaign of the emperor Julianus Apostata in 363.\n\n===Legio II Armeniaca-Armenian Second Legion===\n\"Legio Armeniaca\" translates from Latin as \"Armenian [[Roman legion|Legion]]\" and \"Secunda\" as \"Second\". Like the First legion, the Armenian Second Legion was one of the later-period [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] legions. This legion is also mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum. The Armenian Second Legion was thought to have been created around the end of the 3rd century or in the beginning of the 4th century. The Armenian Second Legion had a permanent camp in one of the Northern provinces of the Orient, and built a camp in [[Satala]]. The Armenian Second legion is mentioned in the year 360 AD as a part of the garrison of Bezabda (anciently called Phoencia) in upper Tigris. In [[Bezabde]] the Armenian Second Legion served together with the Legions Parthica and II Flavia. In 390 AD [[Bezabde]] was taken by the Persian army, and a terrible bloodbath ensued against the inhabitants and garrison. The legion seemed to have survived this battle, because it appears in Notitia Dignitatum, which was written in the 5th century.\n\nLater on, the Armenian Second legion became a part of the Byzantine army.\n\n==Mythology and pre-Christian religion==\n{{Main|Armenian mythology|Armenian Apostolic Church}}\nThe [[Armenian mythology#Pantheon|pre-Christian Armenian pantheon]] included:\n* '''[[Aramazd]]''' - Cognate of the Iranian [[Ahura Mazda]] (or [[Ormazd]]).

The city's strategic position in the Araks valley on the [[Silk Road]] soon made Artashat a centre of bustling economic activity and thriving international trade, linking [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] with the [[Caucasus]] and [[Asia Minor]]. Its economic wealth can be gauged in the numerous bathhouses, markets, workshops, and administrative buildings that sprang up during the reign of Artashes I. The city had its own treasury and customs. The amphitheatre of Artashat was built during the reign of king [[Artavasdes II of Armenia|Artavasdes II]] (55\u201334 BC). The remains of the huge walls surrounding the city built by King Artashes I can still be found in the area. After losing its status as a capital, Artashat gradually lost its significance.\n* [[Tigranakert (Silvan)|Tigranakert]] was founded by the Armenian emperor [[Tigranes the Great]] in the 1st century BC. Tigranakert was founded as the new capital of the Armenian Empire in order to be in a more central position within the boundaries of the expanding empire. Its population was 120,000 and it also had many [[temple]]s and an [[amphitheater]].\n* [[Vagharshapat]] \u2013 In the first half of the 1st century, during the reign of the Armenian [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arshakuni]] king [[Vologases III of Parthia|Vologases I (Vagharsh I)]] (117\u2013144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed '''Vaghasrhapat''' (\u054e\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0580\u0577\u0561\u057a\u0561\u057f), which still persists as the official appellation of the city. The original name, as preserved by Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] (''Persian Wars''), was Valashabad\u2014\"Valash/Balash city\" named after king Balash/Valash/Valarsh of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial L into a Gh, which is common in [[Armenian language]]. Khorenatsi mentions that the town of Vardges was totally rebuilt and fenced by Vagharsh I, eventually becoming known as '''Noarakaghak''' (The New City) or Vagharshapat. The city served as a capital for the Ashakuni Kingdom of Armenia between 120\u2013330 AD and remained the country's most important city until the end of the 4th century. When Christianity became the state religion of Armenia, Vagharshapat was eventually called Ejmiatsin (or Etchmiadzin), after the name of the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral|Mother Cathedral]]. Starting in 301, the city became the spiritual centre of the Armenian nation, home to the Armenian Catholicosate, one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. Vagharshapat was home to one of the oldest schools established by Saint [[Mesrop Mashtots|Mashtots]] and the home of the first manuscripts library in Armenia founded in 480 AD. Starting in the 6th century, the city slowly lost its importance\u2014especially after the transfer of the seat of the Catholicosate to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 452\u2014until the foundation of the [[Bagratid Armenia|Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]] in 885. After the fall of the Bagratid dynasty in 1045, the city gradually became an insignificant place until 1441, when the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate was transferred from the [[Cilicia]]n town of [[Kozan, Adana|Sis]] back to Etchmiadzin.\n* [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] \u2013 The ancient city of Dvin was built by [[Khosrov III the Small]] in 335 on the site of an ancient settlement and fortress from the 3rd millennium BC.  Since then the city had been used as the primary residence of the Armenian kings of the [[Arshakuni dynasty]]. Dvin had a population of about 100,000 citizens of various professions including arts and crafts, trade, fishing, etc. After the fall of the Armenian Kingdom in 428, Dvin became the residence of Sassanid-appointed ''marzpans'' (governors), Byzantine ''kouropalates'' and later [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]]-appointed ''ostikans'' (governors), all of whom were of senior [[nakharar]] stock. In 640 Dvin was the center of the emirate of Armenia.\n\n==Political geography==\nThe Kingdom of Armenia was bordered by [[Caucasian Albania]] in the east, [[Caucasian Iberia]] in the north, the [[Roman Empire]] in the west, and Parthia, later succeeded by Sassanian Empire, in the south. The border between Caucasian Iberia and the Kingdom of Armenia was the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kur]] river, which was also the border between Caucasian Albania and Kingdom of Armenia.\n\nAfter 331 BC, Armenia was divided into [[Lesser Armenia]] (a region of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]]), the Kingdom of Armenia (corresponding to Armenia Major) and the [[Sophene|Kingdom of Sophene]]. In 189 BC when [[Artashes I]]'s reign began, many neighboring countries ([[Medes|Media]], [[Caucasian Iberia]], [[Seleucid Empire]]) exploiting the weakened state of the kingdom, conquered its remote regions. [[Strabo]] says that Artaxias I raided to the east and reunited [[Caspiane]] and [[Paytakaran]], then raided to the north, defeated the [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberians]], reuniting [[Gugark]] ([[Strabo]] also notes that Iberia recognized themselves as vassals of the Kingdom of Armenia at this time), to the west, reuniting [[Karin, Armenia|Karin]], Ekeghik and Derjan and to the south, where, after many battles with the [[Seleucid Empire]], he reunited Tmorik. Artaxias I was not able to reunite [[Lesser Armenia]],  [[Corduene]], and [[Sophene]], something completed by his grandson [[Tigranes the Great]]. During Artaxias I's reign the Kingdom of Armenia covered {{convert|350000|km2|sqmi|-3|abbr=on}}.
