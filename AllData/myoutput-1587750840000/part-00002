One of Kozlov's army patients believes that Simpson is behind this, and Jones suspects that he also killed Coleman. Walker asks Malcolm Ducasse, Jones's neighbor and work partner, to help her rather than further involve the reluctant Jones. Walker confronts Maximilian Tatum, a director, about the sexual relationship they had when she was a child actress working for him, threatening to publicly reveal this unless he helps her get access to records at a hospital he has influence over.

Jessica explains everything to Trish and Ducasse, but tells them to stay away. She finds Malus and convinces him to go to a country with no extradition so Alisa can talk about him without fear of him being caught. He first waits for a new passport provided by Arocho, and also tells Jessica that he never treated Ryback.

There's a lot to mine from in her backstory and in her present day situation\".<ref name=\"WrapS2Jan2016\" /> Actress [[Krysten Ritter]] said that the second season would evolve from the first, and that for Jones, \"The first season was in her head and the second season is in her heart,\"<ref name=\"RitterAug2017\" /> adding that Jones \"is in a pretty dark headspace\" at the beginning of the season and that the season would be \"more of an emotional thriller this time.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" /> On whether Tennant could return for the second season, Rosenberg said, \"Sure, when you have David Tennant, you want him around forever....But the show is called ''Jessica Jones'' and the story is about Jessica's arc and how does that play out in its best form?\" It was noted that Kilgrave would be \"hard to top\", though, with [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] saying, \"One of the things that's important about any Marvel show is your hero is often defined by how strong your antagonist is,\"<ref name=\"TennantReturn?\" /> with Rosenberg adding that the objective for the new villain, or villains, for the season would be not to match or do what was done with Kilgrave.<ref name=\"TCAAug2016\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\" /> As Kilgrave does appear in the season, Rosenberg felt it was important to have him return to \"be that mirror again\" for Jones, as he is \"such a part of her construction and her dilemma\".<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" />\n\nRosenberg also hoped to \"further expand on the ensemble and on Jessica's world\" by giving more screen time to supporting characters,<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\" /> noting that in the first season, \"the trick of a show that's called ''Jessica Jones'' [is if] she's not in the scene, it's not a guarantee that scene will end up in the final picture. You have to earn secondary character stories. You have to flesh them out enough so that they can eventually carry stories of their own\" in future seasons.<ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\" /> She also wanted to continue to explore the relationship between Jones and [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]], stating \"That is the core relationship in the piece. It is about female friendship, it is about how friends evolve\u2014they're sisters, really\u2014and it's about how they evolve and ping off each other.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\"/> On Jones becoming famous after her heroics in the first season, Ritter said, \"She keeps her circle small because she doesn't want people in her life, so there's no textbook on how to deal with new popularity or new eyes on you.\"<ref name=\"RitterAug2017\"/> Speaking on the social issues she hoped to tackle in the season, after covering \"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\" while also exploring \"feminism and being a woman in this world\" in the first, Rosenberg said, \"I'm not quite sure yet what the social issues are that we're dealing with [in season 2]. We're just trying to find some resonance for [Jessica Jones] and a new place to push her, to give Krysten something new to play and really push the boundaries of the character.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\"/> \n\nAfter much of the first season was taken from the ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' comic book, Rosenberg wanted to continue that trend with the second season, but acknowledged that \"the MCU is very different from the comics in terms of its mythology. In the books there were things building towards \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" and all that, and here that's not the case. The nature of that is we're probably not going to be able to continue to do parallel storylines [to ''Alias'']\".<ref name=\"WrapS2Jan2016\"/> On having Jones continue to struggle with the same issues in the second season, Loeb said, \"The end of the [first season]\u2014and it was one of the things that was very important when we talked about the end of the first [season]\u2014was that it wasn't, 'Ooh, I triumphed and now I can get in my hovercar and join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].' That wasn't the story we were interested in telling.\"<ref name=\"LoebIGNJan2016\"/> Rosenberg elaborated by comparing the ''Jessica Jones'' to her previous series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', saying that she learned \"you can advance the character, but you never want to cure the character. With [[Dexter Morgan|Dexter]], the moment he felt guilt or accepted that he was 'bad,' the show's over. He's no longer a sociopath. The equivalent for us would be if Jessica somehow recovered from the damage that had been done to her. People don't just heal\".<ref name=\"RosenbergSept2016\"/> She added that Jones' killing of Kilgrave at the end of the first season was \"a life changing experience\" and something that would affect the character going forward.<ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\"/> Rosenberg also stated that the season would be \"about digging deeper into this chaos and peeling back those layers [of Jones' life], just going to the core of her being\" after the first season focused on Jones' trauma and facing her abuser.<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" />\n\n===Casting===\nAfter the season was ordered, several main cast members revealed that they would return for the second season, including Ritter as Jessica Jones,<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> [[Rachael Taylor]] as Patricia \"Trish\" Walker,<ref name=\"Taylor\" /><ref name=\"TaylorReturn\" /> and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]].<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"MossReturn\" /> [[Eka Darville]] also reprises his role as Malcolm Ducasse.<ref name=\"DarvilleReturn\" /> In March 2017, [[J.

Ramirez]] was cast as Oscar Arocho, which was revealed in July after the airing of his character's death on ''[[Power (TV series)|Power]]''.<ref name=\"Ramirez\" /><ref name=\"Ramirez2\" /> In April 2017, [[Janet McTeer]] was cast in an undisclosed role, described as someone who has \"an enormous impact on Jessica's life.\"<ref name=\"McTeerCast\" /> She was revealed to be playing [[Mrs. Campbell (comics)|Alisa Jones]], Jessica's mother,<ref name=\"McTeerRole\" /> who was briefly portrayed in flashbacks by [[Miriam Shor]] in the first season.<ref name=\"ShorAlisa\" /> By July, [[Leah Gibson]] had also joined the cast,<ref name=\"Gibson\" /> in the role of Inez Green.<ref name=\"InezGreen\" /> Also joining in the season is [[Terry Chen]] as Pryce Cheng.<ref name=\"Chen\" />\n\nIn August 2017, [[David Tennant]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]],<ref name=\"Tennant\" /> appearing as a hallucination,<ref name=\"TennantHallucination\" /> with [[Wil Traval]] also returning as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]].<ref name=\"TravalS2\" /> Recurring characters in the season include [[Rebecca De Mornay]] reprises her role as Dorothy Walker,<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> Kevin Chacon as Vido Arocho<ref name=\"ColliderEasterEggs\" /> and [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[Karl Malus]].<ref name=\"McTeerRole\" /> [[Elden Henson]] and [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] reprise their roles as [[Foggy Nelson]] and [[Turk Barrett]] from previous Marvel Netflix series, respectively.<ref name=\"Henson\" /><ref name=\"Morgan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began the week of April 3, 2017 in New York City, once again using the [[working title]] ''Violet''.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> This followed the end of production on ''The Defenders'' in March,<ref name=\"DefendersFinished\" /> with Ritter having indicated in May 2016 that the season would film [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"BackToBackFilming\" /> Filming occurred at the [[Long Island Aquarium and Exhibition Center]].<ref name=\"LIAquarium\" /> Filming for the season wrapped on September 14, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingWrap\" />\n\nApproaching the second season, Rosenberg wanted to increase the number of female directors working on the series as a further push for representation. This was a goal that \"Marvel was completely on board with\", and given the demand of many talented female directors at the time, the series' producers looked to book only female directors first, and approach male directors later in the pre-production phase if needed. Another member of the production suggested that the series book only female directors for the season, which Rosenberg \"hadn't contemplated [as a] concept prior to that conversation\". She quickly made that the goal of the production, and in October 2016, Rosenberg confirmed that all 13 episodes of the season would be directed by women.<ref name=\"FemaleDirectors\" /> Oscar's paintings in the season were created by comic book artist [[David W.

The artists included, in respective order for each episode: Stephanie Hans, [[Jen Bartel]], Elizabeth Torque, Kate Niemczyk, [[Colleen Doran]], Erica Henderson, Audrey Mox, [[Joyce Chin]], [[Jenny Frison]], [[Amy Reeder]], Emanuela Lupacchino, [[June Brigman]], and Annie Wu.<ref name=\"PulpCovers\" /> The season held its red carpet premiere on March 7, 2018 at the [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] Loews Lincoln Square.<ref name=\"InezGreen\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Jessica Jones'' was released on March 8, 2018,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> to coincide with [[International Women's Day]],<ref name=\"Trailer\" /> on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide, in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the season has an approval rating of 83% with an average rating of 6.97/10, based on 86 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While ''Jessica Jones'' is a slower burn with less focus than its inaugural season, its enticing new character arc more fully details the most charismatic Defender.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica_jones/s02|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 2 (2018)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 70 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"JJMC2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones/season-2|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 2 Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn her review of the first five episodes of the season, Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] gave the season 4 out of 5 stars. She felt \"[t]he season really starts to kick into gear.. once we\u2019re introduced to the central mystery: the truth behind IGH,\" with the season getting \"better and better as it goes along.\" However, as with previous Marvel Netflix series, the season suffered from pacing issues, featuring \"a minimal or non-existent score, scenes that go on for too long, and a limited number of edits that add up to everything feeling like it\u2019s happening in real time. It\u2019s not as bad as any other Marvel series on Netflix in this regard \u2014 not even close \u2014 but it\u2019s still a problem, and one that has unbelievably still not been addressed in terms of episode count (or shorter runtimes within episodes).\" Keene also felt the season missed a \"driving force\" by not having David Tennant back as Kilgrave, but was glad the season largely ignored the events of ''The Defenders'' to focus on Jones and her relationships.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Awarding the season a \"B\", Liz Shannon Miller from [[IndieWire]] said the season's all-female directors kept \"the show\u2019s noir bent in place though doesn\u2019t push too hard into the realm of art \u2014 but the clean approach works, as does Ritter\u2019s always grounded and believable performance.\" She also enjoyed the Hogarth medical storyline, saying it was \"one of the most compelling new storylines\", despite it not connecting to the overall larger narrative through the first five episodes. For Miller, Janet McTeer was \"the most dynamic element of these early episodes. While she has potential as a foil, there\u2019s not enough of her to keep us hooked, not to mention the lack of the emotional hook that we had with Kilgrave in season 1.\" Miller also felt the plot lacked direction, and agreed with Keene about the pacing issues.<ref name=\"IndieWireReview\" />\n\n''[[Digital Spy]]''{{'}}s Jo Berry said in her review, \"While the beginning of the new season lacks the focus of the first, and is missing a truly menacing bad guy for Jessica to go up against, the new additions and expanded storylines don't detract from Ritter's powerhouse performance... Pacing quibbles aside, this is a darkly enjoyable return for Jessica Jones, thanks to the strong scripts, slick direction and Ritter's gripping performance.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> In a more mixed review, ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s David Betancourt noted the season \"lacks shock value\". While Ritter \"still brings her A-game... It\u2019s the lack of Kilgrave that at first seems to be what\u2019s missing from season 2.\" He did praise the supporting cast, feeling Darville \"has a standout performance\" as Malcolm, with his connection to the larger storyline \"surprising and enjoyable to watch\", and also praising Taylor, adding it \"wouldn\u2019t hurt to bring [Taylor] in\" as her comics alter ego Hellcat, to help the season that \"lags at the beginning\".<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\" />\n\nConversely, Susana Polo from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' was left disappointed and bored by the early episodes, also noting the lack of compelling antagonist for the season. She said, \"I don\u2019t see ''Jessica Jones''{{'}} second season winning over anyone who was lukewarm about her first \u2014 or anyone who skipped it entirely. I\u2019m a big fan, and even I left these first five episodes wondering exactly what had happened to the series that gripped me and never let go in 2015.\"<ref name=\"PolygonReview\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"SarandosMultipleSeasons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/daredevil_bloodline_kimmy_schmidt_premiere_date_netflix-2015-01 |title=Netflix announces 'Daredevil,' 'Bloodline,' 'Kimmy Schmidt' premiere dates |last=Schwartz |first=Terri |publisher=[[Zap2It]] |date=January 7, 2015 |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VTyOGUNY?url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/daredevil_bloodline_kimmy_schmidt_premiere_date_netflix-2015-01 |archivedate=January 10, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/netflix-on-marvel-series-release-plan-and-if-punisher-could-get-a-spinoff |title=Netflix On Marvel Series Release Plan And If Punisher Could Get A Spinoff |last=Goldman |first=Eric |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aMsAdcZ1?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/netflix-on-marvel-series-release-plan-and-if-punisher-could-get-a-spinoff |archivedate=July 28, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/ |title=Krysten Ritter & Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg Talk 'Jessica Jones' at NYCC |last=Weintraub |first=Steve |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=October 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cHchpv7S?url=http://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/ |archivedate=October 14, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergVarietyNov2015\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/jessica-jones-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-1201644912/ |title='Jessica Jones' Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg Talks About Her Tough Heroine |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dD7rxT4f?url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/features/jessica-jones-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-1201644912/ |archivedate=November 21, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-spoilers-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-krysten-ritter-luke-cage-1201628832/ |title='Marvel's Jessica Jones' EP Melissa Rosenberg On Luke Cage, Season 2, 'Supergirl' & Gender Parity In Hollywood |last=Patten |first=Dominic |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d9BxvVEQ?url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-spoilers-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-krysten-ritter-luke-cage-1201628832/ |archivedate=November 19, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"S2Order\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jessica-jones-season-2-netflix-krysten-ritter-mike-colter-luke-cage-1201666573/ |title='Jessica Jones' Renewed for Season 2 on Netflix |last=Friedlander |first=Whitney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ebvyYfnL?url=http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jessica-jones-season-2-netflix-krysten-ritter-mike-colter-luke-cage-1201666573/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TennantReturn?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/731416/do-jessica-jones-and-luke-cage-have-a-future-krysten-ritter-hopes-so |title=Do Jessica Jones and Luke Cage Have a Future?

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Tall Girls Productions, with [[Melissa Rosenberg]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n \n[[Krysten Ritter]] stars as Jones, with [[Rachael Taylor]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], and [[Eka Darville]] also returning from the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season]], as well as [[Wil Traval]] and [[David Tennant]] in guest roles. They are joined by [[J. R. Ramirez]], [[Terry Chen]], [[Leah Gibson]], and [[Janet McTeer]]. The second season was ordered in January 2016, with filming beginning in April 2017, [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with the miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|Marvel's The Defenders]]''. Filming concluded in September 2017.\n\nThe season was released on March 8, 2018. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, who once again praised Ritter's performance and the series' female focus, but felt the season suffered from pacing issues and a lack of a compelling villain after Tennant's [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]] from season one.

One of Kozlov's army patients believes that Simpson is behind this, and Jones suspects that he also killed Coleman. Walker asks Malcolm Ducasse, Jones's neighbor and work partner, to help her rather than further involve the reluctant Jones. Walker confronts Maximilian Tatum, a director, about the sexual relationship they had when she was a child actress working for him, threatening to publicly reveal this unless he helps her get access to records at a hospital he has influence over. After Tatum refuses, Walker runs into Simpson. Jones also arrives, having tracked Walker down when she did not answer her phone. Simpson claims that someone else who was experimented on by IGH has killed Kozlov and Coleman, and that he is just there to protect Walker since she was noticed investigating IGH.

Jessica explains everything to Trish and Ducasse, but tells them to stay away. She finds Malus and convinces him to go to a country with no extradition so Alisa can talk about him without fear of him being caught. He first waits for a new passport provided by Arocho, and also tells Jessica that he never treated Ryback. Hogarth does not believe Jessica when she says this, but arrives home to find Green and Ryback have robbed her (and thus realizes she was not cured).

Malus takes Trish to the old IGH facility, where he begins to put her through the same process that changed Jessica and Alisa. Jessica arrives and stops the procedure, and then is almost convinced by her hallucination of Kilgrave to murder Malus. She stops herself, but he decides to end his own life.

There's a lot to mine from in her backstory and in her present day situation\".<ref name=\"WrapS2Jan2016\" /> Actress [[Krysten Ritter]] said that the second season would evolve from the first, and that for Jones, \"The first season was in her head and the second season is in her heart,\"<ref name=\"RitterAug2017\" /> adding that Jones \"is in a pretty dark headspace\" at the beginning of the season and that the season would be \"more of an emotional thriller this time.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" /> On whether Tennant could return for the second season, Rosenberg said, \"Sure, when you have David Tennant, you want him around forever....But the show is called ''Jessica Jones'' and the story is about Jessica's arc and how does that play out in its best form?\" It was noted that Kilgrave would be \"hard to top\", though, with [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] saying, \"One of the things that's important about any Marvel show is your hero is often defined by how strong your antagonist is,\"<ref name=\"TennantReturn?\" /> with Rosenberg adding that the objective for the new villain, or villains, for the season would be not to match or do what was done with Kilgrave.<ref name=\"TCAAug2016\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\" /> As Kilgrave does appear in the season, Rosenberg felt it was important to have him return to \"be that mirror again\" for Jones, as he is \"such a part of her construction and her dilemma\".<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" />\n\nRosenberg also hoped to \"further expand on the ensemble and on Jessica's world\" by giving more screen time to supporting characters,<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\" /> noting that in the first season, \"the trick of a show that's called ''Jessica Jones'' [is if] she's not in the scene, it's not a guarantee that scene will end up in the final picture. You have to earn secondary character stories. You have to flesh them out enough so that they can eventually carry stories of their own\" in future seasons.<ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\" /> She also wanted to continue to explore the relationship between Jones and [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]], stating \"That is the core relationship in the piece. It is about female friendship, it is about how friends evolve\u2014they're sisters, really\u2014and it's about how they evolve and ping off each other.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\"/> On Jones becoming famous after her heroics in the first season, Ritter said, \"She keeps her circle small because she doesn't want people in her life, so there's no textbook on how to deal with new popularity or new eyes on you.\"<ref name=\"RitterAug2017\"/> Speaking on the social issues she hoped to tackle in the season, after covering \"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\" while also exploring \"feminism and being a woman in this world\" in the first, Rosenberg said, \"I'm not quite sure yet what the social issues are that we're dealing with [in season 2]. We're just trying to find some resonance for [Jessica Jones] and a new place to push her, to give Krysten something new to play and really push the boundaries of the character.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\"/> \n\nAfter much of the first season was taken from the ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' comic book, Rosenberg wanted to continue that trend with the second season, but acknowledged that \"the MCU is very different from the comics in terms of its mythology. In the books there were things building towards \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" and all that, and here that's not the case. The nature of that is we're probably not going to be able to continue to do parallel storylines [to ''Alias'']\".<ref name=\"WrapS2Jan2016\"/> On having Jones continue to struggle with the same issues in the second season, Loeb said, \"The end of the [first season]\u2014and it was one of the things that was very important when we talked about the end of the first [season]\u2014was that it wasn't, 'Ooh, I triumphed and now I can get in my hovercar and join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].' That wasn't the story we were interested in telling.\"<ref name=\"LoebIGNJan2016\"/> Rosenberg elaborated by comparing the ''Jessica Jones'' to her previous series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', saying that she learned \"you can advance the character, but you never want to cure the character. With [[Dexter Morgan|Dexter]], the moment he felt guilt or accepted that he was 'bad,' the show's over. He's no longer a sociopath. The equivalent for us would be if Jessica somehow recovered from the damage that had been done to her. People don't just heal\".<ref name=\"RosenbergSept2016\"/> She added that Jones' killing of Kilgrave at the end of the first season was \"a life changing experience\" and something that would affect the character going forward.<ref name=\"RosenbergNerdistMay2016\"/> Rosenberg also stated that the season would be \"about digging deeper into this chaos and peeling back those layers [of Jones' life], just going to the core of her being\" after the first season focused on Jones' trauma and facing her abuser.<ref name=\"EWDec2017\" />\n\n===Casting===\nAfter the season was ordered, several main cast members revealed that they would return for the second season, including Ritter as Jessica Jones,<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> [[Rachael Taylor]] as Patricia \"Trish\" Walker,<ref name=\"Taylor\" /><ref name=\"TaylorReturn\" /> and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]].<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"MossReturn\" /> [[Eka Darville]] also reprises his role as Malcolm Ducasse.<ref name=\"DarvilleReturn\" /> In March 2017, [[J.

This was a goal that \"Marvel was completely on board with\", and given the demand of many talented female directors at the time, the series' producers looked to book only female directors first, and approach male directors later in the pre-production phase if needed. Another member of the production suggested that the series book only female directors for the season, which Rosenberg \"hadn't contemplated [as a] concept prior to that conversation\".

She felt \"[t]he season really starts to kick into gear.. once we\u2019re introduced to the central mystery: the truth behind IGH,\" with the season getting \"better and better as it goes along.\" However, as with previous Marvel Netflix series, the season suffered from pacing issues, featuring \"a minimal or non-existent score, scenes that go on for too long, and a limited number of edits that add up to everything feeling like it\u2019s happening in real time. It\u2019s not as bad as any other Marvel series on Netflix in this regard \u2014 not even close \u2014 but it\u2019s still a problem, and one that has unbelievably still not been addressed in terms of episode count (or shorter runtimes within episodes).\" Keene also felt the season missed a \"driving force\" by not having David Tennant back as Kilgrave, but was glad the season largely ignored the events of ''The Defenders'' to focus on Jones and her relationships.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Awarding the season a \"B\", Liz Shannon Miller from [[IndieWire]] said the season's all-female directors kept \"the show\u2019s noir bent in place though doesn\u2019t push too hard into the realm of art \u2014 but the clean approach works, as does Ritter\u2019s always grounded and believable performance.\" She also enjoyed the Hogarth medical storyline, saying it was \"one of the most compelling new storylines\", despite it not connecting to the overall larger narrative through the first five episodes. For Miller, Janet McTeer was \"the most dynamic element of these early episodes. While she has potential as a foil, there\u2019s not enough of her to keep us hooked, not to mention the lack of the emotional hook that we had with Kilgrave in season 1.\" Miller also felt the plot lacked direction, and agreed with Keene about the pacing issues.<ref name=\"IndieWireReview\" />\n\n''[[Digital Spy]]''{{'}}s Jo Berry said in her review, \"While the beginning of the new season lacks the focus of the first, and is missing a truly menacing bad guy for Jessica to go up against, the new additions and expanded storylines don't detract from Ritter's powerhouse performance... Pacing quibbles aside, this is a darkly enjoyable return for Jessica Jones, thanks to the strong scripts, slick direction and Ritter's gripping performance.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> In a more mixed review, ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s David Betancourt noted the season \"lacks shock value\". While Ritter \"still brings her A-game... It\u2019s the lack of Kilgrave that at first seems to be what\u2019s missing from season 2.\" He did praise the supporting cast, feeling Darville \"has a standout performance\" as Malcolm, with his connection to the larger storyline \"surprising and enjoyable to watch\", and also praising Taylor, adding it \"wouldn\u2019t hurt to bring [Taylor] in\" as her comics alter ego Hellcat, to help the season that \"lags at the beginning\".<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\" />\n\nConversely, Susana Polo from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' was left disappointed and bored by the early episodes, also noting the lack of compelling antagonist for the season. She said, \"I don\u2019t see ''Jessica Jones''{{'}} second season winning over anyone who was lukewarm about her first \u2014 or anyone who skipped it entirely. I\u2019m a big fan, and even I left these first five episodes wondering exactly what had happened to the series that gripped me and never let go in 2015.\"<ref name=\"PolygonReview\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"SarandosMultipleSeasons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/daredevil_bloodline_kimmy_schmidt_premiere_date_netflix-2015-01 |title=Netflix announces 'Daredevil,' 'Bloodline,' 'Kimmy Schmidt' premiere dates |last=Schwartz |first=Terri |publisher=[[Zap2It]] |date=January 7, 2015 |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VTyOGUNY?url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/daredevil_bloodline_kimmy_schmidt_premiere_date_netflix-2015-01 |archivedate=January 10, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/netflix-on-marvel-series-release-plan-and-if-punisher-could-get-a-spinoff |title=Netflix On Marvel Series Release Plan And If Punisher Could Get A Spinoff |last=Goldman |first=Eric |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aMsAdcZ1?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/netflix-on-marvel-series-release-plan-and-if-punisher-could-get-a-spinoff |archivedate=July 28, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/ |title=Krysten Ritter & Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg Talk 'Jessica Jones' at NYCC |last=Weintraub |first=Steve |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=October 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cHchpv7S?url=http://collider.com/jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-melissa-rosenberg-interview-nycc/ |archivedate=October 14, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergVarietyNov2015\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/jessica-jones-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-1201644912/ |title='Jessica Jones' Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg Talks About Her Tough Heroine |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dD7rxT4f?url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/features/jessica-jones-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-1201644912/ |archivedate=November 21, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-spoilers-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-krysten-ritter-luke-cage-1201628832/ |title='Marvel's Jessica Jones' EP Melissa Rosenberg On Luke Cage, Season 2, 'Supergirl' & Gender Parity In Hollywood |last=Patten |first=Dominic |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d9BxvVEQ?url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-spoilers-marvel-melissa-rosenberg-krysten-ritter-luke-cage-1201628832/ |archivedate=November 19, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"S2Order\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jessica-jones-season-2-netflix-krysten-ritter-mike-colter-luke-cage-1201666573/ |title='Jessica Jones' Renewed for Season 2 on Netflix |last=Friedlander |first=Whitney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ebvyYfnL?url=http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jessica-jones-season-2-netflix-krysten-ritter-mike-colter-luke-cage-1201666573/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TennantReturn?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/731416/do-jessica-jones-and-luke-cage-have-a-future-krysten-ritter-hopes-so |title=Do Jessica Jones and Luke Cage Have a Future?
