It is usually a mixture of English, Mandarin, Tamil, Malay, and other local dialects like Hokkien, Cantonese or Teochew. There are a few loan words from these languages i.e. 'pek chek' is often taken as being annoyed or frustrated and originate [[Singaporean Hokkien|from the Hokkien dialect]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160919-the-language-the-government-tried-to-suppress|title=The language the government tried to suppress|last=Harbeck|first=James|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref> It is used in casual contexts between Singaporeans, but is avoided in formal events when certain Singlish phrases may be considered unedifying. [[Singapore English]] can be broken into two subcategories. Standard Singapore English (SSE) and Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) or Singlish as many locals call it. The relationship between SSE and Singlish is viewed as a [[diglossia]], in which SSE is restricted to be used in [[Formality scale|situations of formality]] where Singlish/CSE is used in most other circumstances.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Leimgruber|first=Jakob R.

For instance, local media have \"sports pages\" (''sport'' in British English) and \"[[soccer]] coverage\" (soccer&mdash;originally slang for ''as'''soc'''iation football''&mdash;while used in Britain, is more usually called just ''football''). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese in Singapore]], and from [[Malay language|Malay]]. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. Vocabulary is also taken from Indian words such as ''dai'' meaning 'hey', ''goondu'' meaning 'fat', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as ''borrow''/''lend'', which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, {{Lang|zh|{{linktext|\u501f}}}} (''ji\u00e8''), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: \"Oi, can I borrow your calculator?\" / \"Hey, can you lend me your calculator?\"\n\n==Singlish dictionaries and word lists==\n[[File:Coxford Singlish Dictionary.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'', a light-hearted lexicon of Singlish published in 2002]]\nThere have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, but most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were [[Sylvia Toh Paik Choo]]'s ''Eh, Goondu!'' (1982)<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Eh, Goondu!\n| publisher = Eastern Universities Press\n| year=1982\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-71-168-9}}</ref> and ''Lagi Goondu!'' (1986).<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Lagi Goondu!\n| publisher = Times Books International\n| year=1986\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-65-224-1}}</ref> In 1997 the second edition of the ''Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary''<ref>{{cite book \n| title = Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary\n| edition = 2nd\n| publisher = Federal Publications\n| year=1997\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-01-3727-4}}</ref> was published. To date, this is the only formal dictionary containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.\n\n2002 saw the publication of the ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite book \n| title = The Coxford Singlish Dictionary\n| publisher = Angsana Books\n|year=2002\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-3056-50-3}}</ref> a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website [http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php Talkingcock.com]. In 2004 a website, [http://www.singlishdictionary.com ''A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English''], was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur [[lexicographer]], the ''Dictionary'' appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.\n\nThe [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.\n\nThe lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the [[Speak Good English Movement]] over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.\n\nLetters contributed to the forum of ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named \"Speak Good Singlish Movement\". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.\n\nA list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary.\n\n== Phonological sounds used in Singlish ==\nBelow are the phonological sounds used from the International Phonetic Alphabet used in Singlish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 10px auto;\"\n|+ Consonants Used in Singlish Vocabulary<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Leimgruber|first=Jakob R.

For instance, local media have \"sports pages\" (''sport'' in British English) and \"[[soccer]] coverage\" (soccer&mdash;originally slang for ''as'''soc'''iation football''&mdash;while used in Britain, is more usually called just ''football''). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese in Singapore]], and from [[Malay language|Malay]]. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. Vocabulary is also taken from Indian words such as ''dai'' meaning 'hey', ''goondu'' meaning 'fat', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as ''borrow''/''lend'', which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, {{Lang|zh|{{linktext|\u501f}}}} (''ji\u00e8''), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: \"Oi, can I borrow your calculator?\" / \"Hey, can you lend me your calculator?\"\n\n==Singlish dictionaries and word lists==\n[[File:Coxford Singlish Dictionary.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'', a light-hearted lexicon of Singlish published in 2002]]\nThere have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, but most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were [[Sylvia Toh Paik Choo]]'s ''Eh, Goondu!'' (1982)<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Eh, Goondu!\n| publisher = Eastern Universities Press\n| year=1982\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-71-168-9}}</ref> and ''Lagi Goondu!''

To date, this is the only formal dictionary containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.\n\n2002 saw the publication of the ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite book \n| title = The Coxford Singlish Dictionary\n| publisher = Angsana Books\n|year=2002\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-3056-50-3}}</ref> a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website [http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php Talkingcock.com]. In 2004 a website, [http://www.singlishdictionary.com ''A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English''], was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur [[lexicographer]], the ''Dictionary'' appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.\n\nThe [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.\n\nThe lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the [[Speak Good English Movement]] over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.\n\nLetters contributed to the forum of ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named \"Speak Good Singlish Movement\". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.\n\nA list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary.\n\n== Phonological sounds used in Singlish ==\nBelow are the phonological sounds used from the International Phonetic Alphabet used in Singlish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 10px auto;\"\n|+ Consonants Used in Singlish Vocabulary<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Leimgruber|first=Jakob R.
