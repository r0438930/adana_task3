Pelican cases include a barometric relief valve made of [[Gore-Tex]] to prevent pressure damage to the case during transportation or when the air pressure in the environment changes. Pelican cases meet standards for waterproofing, stacking, impact, and durability including [[MIL-STD]] C4150-J for waterproofing, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[IP Code|IP67]] rating indicating complete sealing against dust and water immersion to 1 metre, as well as [[ATA 300]] rating indicating compliance with [[Air Transport Association]] standards for durability in shipping. Pelican cases feature a lifetime guarantee. In Europe, they are sold as Peli cases.\n\nIf the case falls into water, generally there will be enough air in the case to keep it afloat. The barometric relief valve permits air to pass through, but not water or other liquids. Under some extreme conditions leakage is technically possible, but such conditions are unlikely to be encountered, except in the case of deliberate vandalism.\n\nPelican Products also manufactures customized rotationally molded cases built for specialized sensitive equipment protection. The cases can be modified with features including internal shock-mount systems, manual pressure relief valves, humidity indicators, custom foam, and fabricated metal framing for electronics. Pelican Products also runs a series of Advanced Case Centers in California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Canada, France, United Kingdom, and Australia that handle customization and design work for their cases.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The official distributor in Russia is Protect Studio.<ref>Official distributor in Russia https://protect.studio/about/</ref>\n\n== Temperature Controlled Packaging ==\nPelican's BioThermal division offers passive temperature-controlled products and service solutions including single-use and reusable parcels, single use and reusable pallets and rental programs for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n==Flashlights==\nPelican flashlights (known as ''Pelican Lights'') use [[Incandescent light bulb|Xenon]], [[Halogen lamp|Halogen]], and [[LED]] lamps.
