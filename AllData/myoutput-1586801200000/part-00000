They form two rows, one on each side. For the purpose of this article, they are listed in the order they are passed when crossing the bridge from the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, and are divided into two categories: those on the north side of the bridge and those on the south side. The [[Statue of Bruncv\u00edk, Charles Bridge|statue of Bruncv\u00edk]] is also included, although it is not considered one of the principal statues.\n\nDamage caused to the statues over many years has resulted in many of the originals being replaced by copies.\n\n==Statues on the south side of the bridge==\n=== Statue of [[Ivo of Kermartin|St. Ivo]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Ivo of Kermartin, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv.

Kry\u0161tofa'') This statue was designed by Emanuel Max in 1857 and sponsored by V\u00e1clav Wanek, the portreeve of Prague. It depicts the saint holding Christ as a boy on his shoulder.

A plan of this was created by Matthias Braun, which was not executed.\n\n=== Statue of [[Francis Borgia|St. Francis Borgia]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Francis Borgia, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv.

Ludmily'') The exact date and sculptor responsible for this statue are not known, although it is believed that it was created by Matthias Braun around 1730. The sculpture was erected on the bridge in 1784 to replace the statue of St. Wenceslas damaged in the floods in that year. The statue depicts St. Ludmila teaching her grandson, St. Wenceslas and the base contains a relief sculpture showing the murder of St. Wenceslas.\n\n=== Statue of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Francis of Assisi, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Franti\u0161ka Serafinsk\u00e9ho'') Sculpted by Emanuel Max in 1855, the statue was donated by count [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky|Franti\u0161ek Anton\u00edn Kolowrat Liebsteinsk\u00fd]].

Prokopa'') One of the most artistically important pieces on the bridge, this statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1712, paid for by Romedius Josef Franti\u0161ek, the count Thun and lord of Choltice. St. Vincent is on the left, with a coffin and a kneeling penitent sinner by his legs. Saint Procopius of S\u00e1zava stands on a devil to the right.\n\nBeside the statue of Sts. Vincent and Procopius stands a column with a sculpture of Bruncvik, (a mythical Bohemian knight inspired by the Saxonian and Bavarian knight [[Henry the Lion]] from [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]), portrayed helping a lion fight a seven-headed dragon. This was sculpted by Ludv\u00edk \u0160imek in 1884, and sponsored by the City of Prague. The knight, Bruncv\u00edk, is holding a golden sword, with a lion lying by his legs. This replaced a [[Roland (statue)|statue of Roland]], erected in 1502, and was intended to remind passers-by of the Old Town's privileges to the bridge, in particular the right to charge tolls and duty. It was damaged by cannon fire when [[Battle of Prague (1648)|the city was attacked]] by [[Sweden|Swedish forces]] in 1648.\n\n=== Statue of [[Nicholas of Tolentino|St. Nicholas of Tolentino]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Nicholas of Tolentino, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

Vojt\u011bcha'') Designed by [[Michael Brokoff|Michael]] and [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1709, this statue was sponsored by Markus Bernard Joanelli, the councilor of the Old Town of Prague. The saint is represented with a prelate stick developing into a sea paddle and is standing on a base decorated with angels and the emblem of the donor.\n\n=== Statues of Saints [[John of Matha]], [[Felix of Valois]], and [[Saint Ivan|Ivan]] ===\n{{Main|Statues of John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Saint Ivan, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Jana z Mathy, Felixe z Valois a Ivana'') The most spacious and expensive sculpture on the bridge, this was designed in 1714 by Ferdinand Brokoff and sponsored by Franti\u0161ek Josef Thun, the lord of Kl\u00e1\u0161terec nad Oh\u0159\u00ed. The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks. St. Ivan, the saint patron of Slavs was added to the group for unknown reasons. The base depicts a cave in which three chained Christians are praying to the Lord for salvation.\n\n=== Statue of [[Saint Wenceslas|St. Wenceslas]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Wenceslaus I, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. V\u00e1clava'') This statue was designed by Karel B\u00f6hm in 1858 and was based on the design by Josef Kamil F\u00fchring. The statue was paid for by the Institute of the Blind at Kl\u00e1rov, Prague. Until 1822, various little shops stood on this part of the bridge.\n\n==Statues on the north side of the bridge==\n===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] attending to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Madonna and Saint Bernard, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(Czech: ''souso\u0161\u00ed Madony se sv. Bernardem'') This statue was sculpted by Mat\u011bj V\u00e1clav J\u00e4ckl in 1709 and donated by the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Osek, Benedikt Littwerig.\n\n===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], [[Saint Dominic|Ss. Dominic]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Madonna, Saint Dominic and Thomas Aquinas, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed Madony se sv.

The statue portrays the Madonna giving the Rosary to St. Dominic on the left, with St. Thomas Aquinas standing to the right.\n\n===The Crucifix and Calvary===\n{{Main|Calvary, Charles Bridge}}\n\n[[Image:St Calvary at Charles Bridge.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Statuary of the Holy Crucifix and Calvary]]\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed K\u0159\u00ed\u017ee s Kalv\u00e1ri\u00ed'') This sculpture is one of the most historically interesting sculptures on the bridge, which gradually gained its present appearance throughout many centuries. The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the [[Hussites]] in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629 but was severely damaged by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] towards the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|lapidarium]] of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in [[Dresden]], this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and [[John the Evangelist]].\n\nThe golden [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text on the crucifix was added in 1696 and is a prime example of Medieval European [[anti-Semitism]]. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, one Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out \"Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts,\" the [[Kedusha]] from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the vision from the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews, forcing them to pay for a set of golden letters referring to God and hung around the neck of the statue of Christ (information from Steven Plaut, The \"Vav\" from the Charles Bridge).  A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000.  The tablet's placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text.  Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue.\n\n===Statue of [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Saint Anne, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Anny'') Designed by Mat\u011bj V\u00e1clav J\u00e4ckel in 1707, at the expense of count Rudolf of Lisov, the hetman of the New Town of Prague, this statue represents St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, who is portrayed here as a young girl.\n\n===Statue of [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Cyrila a Metod\u011bje'') This statue was sculpted by Karel Dvo\u0159\u00e1k between 1928 and 1939 and was erected by the Ministry of education. It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius ([[missionary|missionaries]] who introduced Christianity to the [[Slavic Peoples|Slavs]]). The original statue of St. Ignatius which stood here, designed by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1711, was displaced by the floods of 1890 and can now be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|Prague lapidarium]].\n\n===Statue of St. [[John the Baptist]]===\n{{Main|Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Jana K\u0159titele'') Sculpted by Josef Max in 1857, at the expenses of Jan Norbert Gemrich of Neuberk, this statue depicts a standing St. John. This replaces a statue by Jan Brokoff, portraying the Baptism of Jesus by St. John, which stood in this position between 1706 and 1848.\n\n===Statue of Saints [[Norbert of Xanten]], [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] and [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Norbert, Wenceslaus and Sigismund}}\n\n[[Image:Prague-charles bridge-hradcany.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund on Charles Bridge in Prague]]\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Norberta, V\u00e1clava a Zikmunda'') This statue was designed by Josef Max in 1853, under the patronage of the abbot of Strahov Monastery, Dr. Jeron\u00fdm Zeidler.\n\n===Statue of [[John of Nepomuk|St. John of Nepomuk]]===\n{{Main|Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge}}\n\n[[Image:Prague 07-2016 Charles Bridge John of Nepomuk statue img2.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The [[Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge|statue of John of Nepomuk]]]]\n\n(''socha sv. Jana Nepomuck\u00e9ho'') This statue is the oldest on the bridge. The original clay design was made by Austrian sculptor Matthias Rauchm\u00fcller, based upon a wood model by Jan Brokoff. The statue was then cast in bronze by Volfgang Jeron\u00fdm Heroldt in [[Nuremberg]]. The saint is presented in a traditional way, as a bearded capitulary with a five-star glory, standing on a tripartite base. The base portrays scenes from the life of St. John of Nepomuk, including the confession of Queen Johanna and the saint's death. In 1393 St. John of Nepomuk was thrown from the bridge into the river where he drowned. In modern times it has become traditional to [[statue rubbing|touch]] the bridge here; this is held to bring good fortune and to ensure that the visitor will return to the city of Prague.\n\n===Statue of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony of Padua]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Anthony of Padua, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Anton\u00edna Padu\u00e1nsk\u00e9ho'') Designed by Jan Old\u0159ich Mayer in 1707 and sponsored by Kri\u0161tof Mo\u0159ice Withauer, councilor of the [[Prague Castle]] [[Graf|burgraviate]], this statue represents St. Anthony standing between two vases, holding Jesus.\n\n===Statue of [[Saint Jude|St. Jude Thaddeus]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Jude the Apostle, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

Duke [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] acquired a number of his relics to honor the founding of [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] at Prague Castle. These relics, together with others acquired by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1355, are embedded in the cathedral building.\n\n===Statue of the Holy Savior with [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv.

The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks.

The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the [[Hussites]] in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629 but was severely damaged by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] towards the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|lapidarium]] of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in [[Dresden]], this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and [[John the Evangelist]]. \n\nThe golden [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text on the crucifix was added in 1696 and is a prime example of Medieval European [[anti-Semitism]]. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, one Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out \"Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts,\" the [[Kedusha]] from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the vision from the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews, forcing them to pay for a set of golden letters referring to God and hung around the neck of the statue of Christ (information from Steven Plaut, The \"Vav\" from the Charles Bridge).  A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000.  The tablet's placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text.  Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue.\n\n===Statue of [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Saint Anne, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius ([[missionary|missionaries]] who introduced Christianity to the [[Slavic Peoples|Slavs]]).
