It was originally recorded by American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer [[Little Willie John]] for his debut album, ''Fever'' (1956), and released as a [[single (music)|single]] in April of the same year. The song managed to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' R&B Best Sellers in the US and peak at number 24 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>[http://musicvf.com/song.php?title=Fever+by+Little+Willie+John&id=26135 Little Willie John, \"Fever\" chart positions]. Retrieved June 20, 2015</ref>  It was received positively by [[music journalism|music critics]] and included on several lists of the best songs during the time it was released.\n\nIt has been covered by numerous artists from various musical genres, most notably by [[Peggy Lee]], whose 1958 rendition became the most widely known version of \"Fever\" and the singer's [[signature song]]. Lee's version contained rewritten lyrics different from the original and an altered music arrangement. It became a top-five hit on the music charts in the UK and Australia in addition to entering the top ten in the US and the Netherlands. \"Fever\" was nominated in three categories at the [[1st Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1959, including [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].\n\nOther notable cover versions of \"Fever\" include those by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Boney M.]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]], [[The McCoys]], [[La Lupe]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]]. Madonna released it as a single from her fifth studio album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' (1992) in March 1993 through [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] It topped the charts in Finland and the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] in the US in addition to charting in the top 50 in many other countries. Madonna promoted \"Fever\" by filming and releasing a [[music video]] directed by [[St\u00e9phane Sednaoui]] and performing the song on several television shows as well as her 1993 [[The Girlie Show World Tour]]. Various versions of \"Fever\" have been used in many films, plays and television shows. Petula Clark covered it also on her FROM NOW ON (2016) CD. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background and reception==\nThe idea for \"Fever\" was presented to [[Otis Blackwell]] by an old friend, [[Eddie Cooley]], who in 1956 had a hit song called \"[[Priscilla (Eddie Cooley song)|Priscilla]]\".<ref name=\"dahl\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/fever-mt0010797774|title=Fever - Little Willie John|website=[[AllMusic]]|first=Bill|last=Dahl|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref> Blackwell said: \"Eddie Cooley was a friend of mine from New York and he called me up and said 'Man, I got an idea for a song called 'Fever', but I can't finish it.'
