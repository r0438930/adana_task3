She was the daughter of [[tsar]] [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria]] and his wife [[Maria Asenina of Bulgaria|Maria]]. The dates and the places of her birth and death are unknown.\n\n== History ==\nThrough her mother, Kira Maria was a granddaughter of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] and [[Irene Komnene of Epirus]]. She was also the sister of tsar [[Ivan Asen III]], who seized the [[Bulgaria]]n throne in 1280 with Byzantine support.\n\nShe married the Bulgaro-[[Cumans|Cuman]] nobleman [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter]] in a marriage arranged by her brother in order to strengthen his position. George divorced his first wife, [[Maria Terter|Maria]], and sent her and their son, [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Theodore Svetoslav]], as hostages to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He was accordingly made a ''[[despot\u0113s]]'', the highest rank in the Byzantino-Bulgarian court hierarchy, and Kira Maria was granted the title of ''despoina''.\n\nIvan Asen III failed to assert himself throughout the country and he secretly fled [[Tarnovo]] in 1280 and escaped to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. George Terter seized the throne and Kira Maria was proclaimed the new ''[[tsarina]]''.\n\nHowever, she was very unpopular in [[Tarnovo]], because of her deposed brother. Her marriage also proved to be controversial as Maria Terter was still alive in [[Constantinople]]. According to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] George's first marriage was still valid and Kira Maria was his uncanonical wife. [[Patriarch]] [[Joachim III of Bulgaria|Yoakim III of Bulgaria]] threatened to excommunicate the couple and insisted that he would not relent until George I Terter put away Kira Maria. The tsar re-opened negotiations with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and sought the return of Maria, what he eventually accomplished in a treaty in which Maria and Kira Maria exchanged places as empress and hostage.\n\n== Children ==\nAccording to [[Georgius Pachymeres]] [[Ana Terter]], wife of [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian king]] [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin]], was the daughter of Kira Maria and George Terter.<ref>Georgius Pachymeres.
