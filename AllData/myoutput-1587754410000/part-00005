{"title_page": "Judicial independence", "text_new": "{{Short description|Notion that judges should not be beholden to political pressures}}'''Judicial independence''' is the concept that the [[judiciary]] should be independent from the other  [[Separation of powers|branches of government]]. That is, [[court]]s should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of [[separation of powers]].\n\nMany countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing [[judge]]s. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting [[life tenure]] or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide [[Legal case|cases]] and make [[Court order|rulings]] according to the [[rule of law]] and [[judicial discretion]], even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.\n\nIn some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of [[judicial review]]. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.\n\n==Theory of judicial independence==\n[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by portraitist Daniel Huntington ''c.'' 1865.

The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the [[judiciary]]'s affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.<ref>{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Rule of Law within a Non-liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy: The Singapore Experience|editor=Randall Peerenboom|title=Asian Discourses of Rule of Law: Theories and Implementation of Rule of Law in Twelve Asian Countries, France and the U.S.|location=London; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]|year=2004|pages=183\u2013224 at 188|isbn=978-0-415-32613-1|quote=As the partisan administration of law erodes rule of law, a central institutional requirement is an independent, accessible judiciary.}}.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference.<ref>{{citation|author=Roger K.

Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=2\u20133}} The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and inter-dependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=3\u20135}}\n\nAlso, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or problems. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=4-5}}\n\n==Economic basis==\n[[Constitutional economics]] studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a [[market economy]].<ref>Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009</ref>\n\nIn some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.\n\n==Development of the concept==\n\n===National and international developments===\n\nThe development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.<ref name=Shetreet2009>S Shetreet, \u2018The Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges\u2019 (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332</ref> This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.<ref name=Shetreet2009/>\n\nA notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].<ref>See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial.</ref> The second phase was evident when England's concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for [[Montesquieu]]\u2019s [[separation of powers]] doctrine,<ref>See Baron de Montesquieu, [[The Spirit of the Laws]] (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans).</ref> and the Founding Fathers of the [[US Constitution]] used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution's Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.<ref>Article III of the US Constitution provides that \u201cthe judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\u201d</ref> Other [[common law]] countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.<ref>Shetreet, Judicial Independence. See also Peter H. Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001).</ref>\n\nIn recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,<ref>UK Human Rights Act - 1998</ref> as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which came into force in the UK in 2000.<ref>Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at <{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901121920/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |archivedate=2010-09-01 }}> (visited Mar 27, 2009).</ref>\n\nWhere British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]<ref>Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161\u201374 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55\u201368 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him</ref> marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the [[Lord Chancellor]], one of the country's oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.<ref name=\"Anthony Seldon 2007\">Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294</ref> The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the [[House of Lords]]; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard \u2013 [[Impeachment#United Kingdom|impeachment]] and the hearing of felony charges against peers.<ref>Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6</ref> The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], and creating a [[Judicial Appointments Commission]].<ref name=\"Anthony Seldon 2007\"/> The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.<ref>Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113</ref>\n\nThus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in [[European Union law]],<ref>See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, \u201cThe Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.\u201d</ref> in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.<ref>See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada)</ref>\n\n===International standards===\nThe [[International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace]] produced the Mt. Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence between 2007 and 2012. These built on the same association's New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montr\u00e9al Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983.

These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the [[Parliament of Canada]] (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in [[criminal law]] (but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]) by [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], although in the 1986 case ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.\n\nThe year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]] found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.\nThere are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.\n\n== Hong Kong ==\nIn [[Hong Kong]], independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty registered with the [[United Nations]], independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English [[common law]], has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]].<ref>[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html \"The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\"- Chapter 1], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008.

To safeguard judicial independence, [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]] lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] may be discussed in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|State Courts]], and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.\n\nThe [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the [[President of Singapore]] acting on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]]. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy [[security of tenure]] up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===England and Wales===\n{{main|Judiciary of England and Wales}}\n\n====History====\nDuring the [[middle ages]], under the Norman monarchy of the [[Kingdom of England]], the king and his [[Curia Regis]] held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the [[early modern period]]; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.<ref>Justice [[Gerard La Forest]], [[Provincial Judges Reference]], [[Supreme Court of Canada]], para. 305.</ref> Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The [[Stuart dynasty]] used this power frequently in order to overpower the [[Parliament of England]]. After the Stuarts were removed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King [[William III of England|William III]] approved the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref><ref>Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306.</ref>\n\n====Contemporary usage====\nUnder the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], there are two important [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of [[parliamentary privilege]]: that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nFurthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitutional reform|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/constitutional-reform/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] aims to increase [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the judiciary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in \"good order,\" they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the [[mandatory retirement]] age of 70.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nUntil 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the [[Bar Council]] and the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the [[Legal Services Board]], composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]]. This saw the establishment of the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] to regulate [[solicitor]]s and the [[Bar Standards Board]] to regulate [[barrister]]s.<ref name=\"legal_serves_act_2007\">{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Legal Services Act 2007|chapter=29|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n==United States of America==\n\n===Federal courts===\n[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution]] establishes the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] as part of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].\n\nThe Constitution provides that [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], including judges of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] \"by and with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\" Once appointed, federal judges:\n\n{{quote|...both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.}}\n\nFederal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment and removal from office]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]]; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached.

In some [[U.S. state|states]], judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a [[nonpartisan]] one), while in others they are appointed by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].\n\nThe 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the [[George W. Bush]] then pending in the [[Florida Supreme Court]], whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Judicial reform]]\n*[[Judiciary in Russia]]\n*[[Political corruption#Judiciary corruption|Political corruption \u00a7 Judiciary corruption]]\n*[[Rule According to Higher Law]]\n*[[Rule of law]]\n*[[Separation of powers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*Independence of the judicial system [https://web.archive.org/web/20100625023314/http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2010/CDL-AD(2010)004-e.pdf Part I.

This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.\n\n==Theory of judicial independence==\n[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by portraitist Daniel Huntington ''c.'' 1865.

The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the [[judiciary]]'s affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.<ref>{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Rule of Law within a Non-liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy: The Singapore Experience|editor=Randall Peerenboom|title=Asian Discourses of Rule of Law: Theories and Implementation of Rule of Law in Twelve Asian Countries, France and the U.S.|location=London; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]|year=2004|pages=183\u2013224 at 188|isbn=978-0-415-32613-1|quote=As the partisan administration of law erodes rule of law, a central institutional requirement is an independent, accessible judiciary.}}.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions.

Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=2\u20133}} The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and inter-dependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=3\u20135}}\n\nAlso, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or problems. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=4-5}}\n\n==Economic basis==\n[[Constitutional economics]] studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a [[market economy]].<ref>Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009</ref>\n\nIn some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.\n\n==Development of the concept==\n\n===National and international developments===\n\nThe development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.<ref name=Shetreet2009>S Shetreet, \u2018The Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges\u2019 (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332</ref> This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.<ref name=Shetreet2009/>\n\nA notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].<ref>See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial.</ref> The second phase was evident when England's concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for [[Montesquieu]]\u2019s [[separation of powers]] doctrine,<ref>See Baron de Montesquieu, [[The Spirit of the Laws]] (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans).</ref> and the Founding Fathers of the [[US Constitution]] used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution's Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.<ref>Article III of the US Constitution provides that \u201cthe judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\u201d</ref> Other [[common law]] countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.<ref>Shetreet, Judicial Independence. See also Peter H. Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001).</ref>\n\nIn recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,<ref>UK Human Rights Act - 1998</ref> as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which came into force in the UK in 2000.<ref>Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at <{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901121920/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |archivedate=2010-09-01 }}> (visited Mar 27, 2009).</ref>\n\nWhere British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]<ref>Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161\u201374 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55\u201368 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him</ref> marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the [[Lord Chancellor]], one of the country's oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.<ref name=\"Anthony Seldon 2007\">Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294</ref> The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the [[House of Lords]]; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard \u2013 [[Impeachment#United Kingdom|impeachment]] and the hearing of felony charges against peers.<ref>Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6</ref> The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], and creating a [[Judicial Appointments Commission]].<ref name=\"Anthony Seldon 2007\"/> The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.<ref>Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113</ref>\n\nThus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in [[European Union law]],<ref>See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, \u201cThe Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.\u201d</ref> in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.<ref>See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada)</ref>\n\n===International standards===\nThe [[International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace]] produced the Mt.

These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the [[Parliament of Canada]] (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in [[criminal law]] (but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]) by [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], although in the 1986 case ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.\n\nThe year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]] found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.\nThere are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.\n\n== Hong Kong ==\nIn [[Hong Kong]], independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty registered with the [[United Nations]], independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English [[common law]], has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]].<ref>[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html \"The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\"- Chapter 1], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008.

To safeguard judicial independence, [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]] lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] may be discussed in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|State Courts]], and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.\n\nThe [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the [[President of Singapore]] acting on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]]. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy [[security of tenure]] up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===England and Wales===\n{{main|Judiciary of England and Wales}}\n\n====History====\nDuring the [[middle ages]], under the Norman monarchy of the [[Kingdom of England]], the king and his [[Curia Regis]] held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the [[early modern period]]; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.<ref>Justice [[Gerard La Forest]], [[Provincial Judges Reference]], [[Supreme Court of Canada]], para. 305.</ref> Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The [[Stuart dynasty]] used this power frequently in order to overpower the [[Parliament of England]]. After the Stuarts were removed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King [[William III of England|William III]] approved the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref><ref>Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306.</ref>\n\n====Contemporary usage====\nUnder the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], there are two important [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of [[parliamentary privilege]]: that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nFurthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitutional reform|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/constitutional-reform/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] aims to increase [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the judiciary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in \"good order,\" they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the [[mandatory retirement]] age of 70.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nUntil 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the [[Bar Council]] and the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the [[Legal Services Board]], composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]].

In some [[U.S. state|states]], judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a [[nonpartisan]] one), while in others they are appointed by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].\n\nThe 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the [[George W. Bush]] then pending in the [[Florida Supreme Court]], whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court.
