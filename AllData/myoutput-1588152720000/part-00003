He started for seven seasons in the NFL, playing for the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Despite only 15 rushing attempts in his career, Ritchie built a reputation with his blue collar work ethic as being one of the best blocking fullbacks in the NFL.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/24/sports/pro-football-raiders-ritchie-is-a-studied-breath-of-fresh-air.html PRO FOOTBALL; Jon Ritchie is a Studied Breath of Fresh Air]</ref> \n\nAfter football, Ritchie co-hosted ''[[The Artie Lange Show]]'' alongside comedian [[Artie Lange]] from 2013 to 2014. He currently cohosts the midday show on Philadelphia sports radio station as a sidekick on [[WIP-FM]] with Joe \u201cMr Softee\u201d DeCamara.\n\n==Early years==\nRitchie attended [[Cumberland Valley High School]] near [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] from 1989 to 1993. He led his [[high school football]] team to the state championship in 1992.\n\n==College career==\nUpon graduation, Ritchie attended the [[University of Michigan]] as a freshman and sophomore. At Michigan, he played as a [[true freshman]]. During his career at Michigan, he rushed for 120 yards and caught two passes for 13 yards. Then in 1995 he transferred to [[Stanford University]] where he played as a junior and senior. At Stanford, he first started as an inside [[linebacker]], but switched to fullback. He rushed 17 times for 95 yards and received nine passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns. He is a member of [[Delta Tau Delta]] International Fraternity.<ref>The Rainbow, vol. 132, no. 2, p. 14,</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nRitchie was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] in the third round (63rd overall) of the [[1998 NFL Draft]] by the [[Oakland Raiders]]. He [[Starting lineup|started]] for the Raiders for five seasons. Raiders running back [[Charlie Garner]] posted three seasons of more than 1,700 yards from scrimmage with Ritchie as his teammate after rushing for just 381 yards the year before he joined Oakland. The Raiders led the league in total yardage in 2002, en route to an AFC Championship and appearance in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], where Oakland lost to the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].\n\nIn 2003, Ritchie signed a two-year contract with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. He had expressed an interest in playing closer to his hometown, which was just 90 miles west of Philadelphia, so his friends and family could watch and attend his games. In 2003, the Eagles running back tandem of [[Brian Westbrook]], [[Duce Staley]], [[Correll Buckhalter]] and quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] rushed for 2,015 yards and 23 touchdowns behind Ritchie.<ref>[http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/article-1/Where-Are-They-Now-FB-Jon-Ritchie/ccbba3b3-0c95-48e0-9101-b2a07aa122a3 Where Are They Now?

He re-signed with the Eagles on a one-year contract for the 2005 season while recovering from his injury. Though Ritchie had been taking first team reps as the starting fullback during training camp, he was released by the team during final cuts. He retired from playing prior to the 2006 season and began a career in sports media.<ref>[http://www.kffl.com/gnews.php?id=304535-nfl---ritchie-retires--heading-to-a-broadcasting-career NFL | Ritchie retires; heading to a broadcasting career]</ref>\n\n===Career statistics===\n{| border=0 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=0 style=\"text-align:right; text-indent:1em;\"\n|+ align=bottom |\n|- style=\"background-color: #9999dd;\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year !! colspan=4 | Rushing !! colspan=4 | Receiving !! colspan=5 | Combined\n|- style=\"background-color: #9999dd;\"\n!
