According to legend, this Buddha image originated in [[India]] where the sage [[Nagasena]] prophesied that the Emerald Buddha would bring \"prosperity and pre-eminence to each country in which it resides\". The Emerald Buddha deified in the Wat Phra Kaew is therefore deeply revered and venerated in Thailand as the protector of the country. Historical records date its finding to the 15th century in [[Chiang Rai]] where, after it was relocated a number of times, it was finally brought to Thailand in the 18th century. It was enshrined in Bangkok at the Wat Phra Kaew Temple in 1782 during the reign of [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Phutthayotfa Chulalok, King Rama I]] (1782\u20131809). This marked the beginning of the [[Chakri dynasty]] of [[Thailand]], whose current sovereign is [[Vajiralongkorn|Vajiralongkorn, King Rama X]].\n\nThe Emerald Buddha, a dark green statue, is in a standing form, about {{convert|66|cm|in}} tall, carved from a single jade stone (\"emerald\" in Thai means deep green colour and not the specific stone). It is carved in the meditating posture in the style of the [[Lanna]] school of northern Thailand. Except for the Thai King and, in his stead, the crown prince, no other persons are allowed to touch the statue. The king changes the cloak around the statue three times a year, corresponding to the summer, winter, and rainy seasons, an important ritual performed to bring good fortune to the country during each season.<ref name=Roeder-1999>{{Cite journal|last=Roeder |first=Eric|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/2542/The%20Origin%20and%20Significance%20of%20the%20Emerald%20Buddha.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Origin and Significance of the Emerald Buddha|accessdate=2014-09-22|journal=Explorations in Southeast Asian Studies|volume=3|year=1999}}</ref><ref name=parka/><ref name=Sacred/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21 \u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e27 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 - Wat Phra Kaew, Temple of Emerald Buddha, Bangkok, Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to the Royal Pantheon, constructed by Rama IV in 1856]]\n\nIn 1767, the Kingdom of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] fell to the Burmese, and [[King Taksin]] then moved the capital to [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] where he built the [[Phra Racha Wang Derm|old palace]] beside [[Wat Arun]] on the west bank of [[Chao Phraya River]].

The Buddha statue fell down and later became chipped, and the monks, after removing the [[stucco]] around the statue, discovered that the image was a perfectly made Buddha image from a solid piece of green jade. The image was moved a few time to various temples, first to [[Lampang]], then to [[Chiang Mai]], from where it was removed by prince Chao [[Setthathirath|Chaiyasetthathirat]] to [[Luang Prabang]], when his father died and he ascended the throne of both [[Lanna]] and [[Lan Xang]], in 1551. The statue remained the it to his new capital of [[Lan Xang]] in Vientiane in the 1560s. The statue remained there for twelve years. King Chaiyasetthathirat then shifted it to his new capital of [[Lan Xang]] in Vientiane in the 1560s. He took the Emerald Buddha with him and the image remained in Vientiane for 214 years until 1778.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn the reign of King Taksin, Chao Phraya Chakri (who later became [[Rama I]]) defeated [[Vientiane]] and moved the Emerald Buddha from Vientiane to Thonburi where it was installed in a shrine close to [[Wat Arun]]. When Chao Phra Chakri took over the throne and founded the [[Chakri Dynasty]] of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]], he shifted his capital across the river to its present location in Bangkok. The Emerald Buddha was also moved across the river with pomp and pageantry and installed in the temple of Wat Phra Keaw.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/>\n\n===Legends===\nThere a number of legends associated with the Emerald Buddha.  It was said the iconic image of the Emerald Buddha was made by [[Nagasena]], a saint in [[Pataliputra]] (present day [[Patna]]), India, who, with the help of Hindu god Vishnu and demigod Indra, had the Emerald Buddha image made. Nagasena predicted that:<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><blockquote>\nThe image of the Buddha is assuredly going to give to religion the most brilliant importance in five lands, that is in Lankadvipa ([[Sri Lanka]]), Ramalakka, [[Dvaravati]], [[Chieng Mai]] and [[Lan Xang|Lan Chang]] ([[Laos]]).</blockquote>\n\nThe Emerald Buddha image was taken to Sri Lanka after three hundred years in Pataliputra to save it during a civil war. In 457, King Anuruth of [[Myanmar|Burma]] sent a mission to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] with a request for [[Buddhist scriptures]] and the Emerald Buddha, in order to promote Buddhism in his country. These requests were granted, but the ship lost its way in a storm during the return voyage and landed in [[Cambodia]]. When the Thais captured [[Angkor Wat]] in 1432 (following the ravage of the [[bubonic plague]]), the Emerald Buddha was taken to Ayutthaya, [[Kamphaeng Phet]], [[Laos]] and finally [[Chiang Rai]], where the ruler of the city hid it, and was later found.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:A view of the temple of the Emerald Buddha.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Temple of the Emerald Buddha]]\n\nWat Phra Kaew has a number of buildings in the precincts of the Grand Palace that covers a total area of over {{convert|94.5|ha|acre}}. It has over 100 buildings with \"200 years royal history and architectural experimentation\" linked to it. The architectural style is named as [[Rattanakosin style]] (old Bangkok-style). The main temple of the Emerald Buddha is decorated and similar to the temple in ancient capital of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. The roof is embellished with polished orange and green tiles, the pillars are inlaid with [[mosaic]]s and the [[pediment]]s are made of marble, installed in the 18th century. The Emerald Buddha reposes on an elevated altar surrounded by large gilded decorations. While the upper part of this altar was part of the original construction, the base was added by [[King Rama III]]. Two images of the Buddha, that represent the first two kings of the Chakri dynasty, flank the main image. Over the years, the temple has retained its original design. Minor improvements have been made after its construction during Rama I's reign: temple woodwork  was replaced by King Rama III and King Chulalongkorn; during [[King Mongkut]]'s reign, the doors and windows and the copper plates on the floor were added; Rama III refurbished the wall painting (indicative of the universe according to [[Buddhist cosmology]]) and several frescos that display various stages of the Buddha's life; three chambers were added on the west side by King Mongkut; in the chamber known as ''Phra Kromanusorn'' at the north end, images of Buddha have been installed in honour of the kings of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]; and in the 19th century, [[Khrua In Khong]], a famous painter, created the wall murals.

The image made with a circular base has a smooth top-knot that is finished with a \"dulled point marking at the top of the image\". A third eye made in gold is inset over the elevated eyebrows of the image. The image appears divine and composed, with the eyes cast downward.

It is about {{convert|2|km|ft}} in length. The compound walls are decorated with Thai murals, based on the [[Indian epic]] [[Ramayana]]. In the [[Thai language]] these murals are known to form the [[Ramakian]], the Thai national epic that was written during the reign of Rama I. These stories formed the basis for the paintings made during the reign of King [[Rama I]] (1782\u20131809). These paintings are refurbished regularly. The murals, in 178 scenes starting from the north gate of the temple, illustrates the complete epic story of Ramayana sequentially, in a clockwise direction covering the entire compound wall. The murals serve to emphasise human values of honesty, faith, and devotion.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/><ref name=Williams/><ref name=photo/>\n\nThere are twelve [[Sala (architecture)|salas]], built by Rama I, around the temple. They house interesting artefacts of regions such as Cambodia and [[Java]]. One of these salas had an inscription of [[Ramkhamhaeng University|Ramkamhaeng]] that was moved, in 1924, to the National Library. During the reign of [[King Mongkut]], the Phra Gandharara, a small chapel at the southwest corner, and a tall belfry were added.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Worship and ceremonies==\n[[File:Wat Phra Kaew.jpg|thumb|left|A group of Buddhist monks at the Wat Phra Kaew temple]]\n\nEarly in the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782\u20131932)|Bangkok period]], the Emerald Buddha was removed from the temple and paraded in the streets to relieve the city and countryside of various calamities (such as [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[cholera]]). However, this practice was discontinued during [[Rama IV]]'s reign as it was feared that the image could get damaged during the procession and also a practical line of thinking that Rama IV held \"that diseases are caused by germs, not by evil spirits or the displeasure of the Buddha\". The image also marks the changing of the seasons in Thailand, with the king presiding over the seasonal ceremonies.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\nLike many other Buddha statues in Thailand, the Emerald Buddha is dressed in a seasonal costume. It is a significant ritual held at this temple. In this ritual, dress of the deity is changed three times a year to correspond to the seasons. In summer it is a pointed crown of gold and jewels, and a set of jewelled ornaments that adorns the image from the shoulders to the ankles. In winter, a meshed dressing gown or drapery made of gold beads that covered from the neck down like a [[poncho]] is used. During the rainy months, a top-knot headdress studded with gold, enamel and sapphires; the gold attire in the rainy season is draped over the left shoulder of the deity, only with the right shoulder left bare while gold ornaments embellish the image up to the ankles. The astrological dates for the ritual ceremonies, at the changing of the seasons, followed are in the 1st [[waning moon]] of [[lunar months]] 4, 8 and 12 (around March, July and November). The costume change ritual is performed by the Thai king who is the highest master of ceremonies for all Buddhist rites. On each occasion, the king himself  \"cleans the image by wiping away any dust that has collected and changing the headdress of the image\". Then a king's royal attendant climbs up and performs the elaborate ritual of changing garments of the image as the king is chanting prayers to the deity. On this occasion, the king sprinkles water over the monks and the faithful who have assembled to witness the unique ritual and seeks blessings of the deity for good fortune during the upcoming season. The two sets of clothing not in use at any given time are kept on display in the nearby [[Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Coins]] in the precincts of the Grand Palace. While Rama I initiated this ritual for the hot season and the rainy season, Rama III introduced the ritual for the winter season.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/> The robes that the image adorns, represents that of monks and King's depending on the season, a clear indication of highlighting its symbolic role \"as Buddha and the King\", which role is also enjoined on the Thai King who formally dresses the Emerald Buddha image.<ref name=Kleiner/>\n\n[[File:Rama9insigwpk0609.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Monument with insignia of [[King Rama IX]] showing the Octagonal Throne with a ''[[chakra]]'' with Thai numeral 9 inside and a [[Umbrella|seven-tiered Umbrella of State]]]]\nA ceremony that is observed in the wat is the Chakri Day (begun on 6 April 1782), a national holiday to honour founding of the [[Chakri dynasty]]. On this day, the king attends the ceremony. The former king [[Rama IX]], with his Queen, and entourage of the royal family, the Prime Minister, officials in the Ministry of Defence, and other government departments, first offered prayers at the Emerald Buddha temple. This was followed by visit to the pantheon to pay homage to the images of past Chakri rulers that are installed there.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\nThe [[Coronation of the Thai monarch]] is an important event of the Chakri dynasty. One such event took place when Rama IX was crowned the king. On this occasion, the king came to the Chapel Royal, Wat Phra Keo, in a procession wearing a \"great crown\". After entering the chapel, the king made offerings of gold and silver flowers to the deity and also lighted candles. He also paid homage to the images of Buddha that represented past kings of the dynasty. In the presence of assembled elite clergy of the kingdom, he took a formal vow of his religion and his commitment to defend the faith.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Rules of entry and conduct==\nThe sacred temples in Thailand follow a dress code that is strictly followed. Men must wear long trousers and sleeved shirts and shoes; women must wear long skirts. Visitors who arrive dressed otherwise may rent appropriate clothing items at the entry area of the temple. It is compulsory to remove the shoes before entering the temple, as a sign of respect of the Buddha, as is the practice in all other temples in Thailand. While offering prayers before the Buddha image, the sitting posture should avoid any offensive stretching of feet towards the deity; the feet should be tucked in towards the back.<ref name=Williams>{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=China|author2=Aaron Anderson |author3=Brett Atkinson |author4=Becca Blond |author5=Tim Bewer |title= Thailand|page=126|accessdate=2010-03-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc0LoROKM0MC&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2010|isbn= 9781742203850}}</ref>\n\n==Other monuments==\nWhile the surrounding portico of the shrine is an example of Thai craftsmanship, the perimeter of the temple complex has 12 open pavilions.

These are:\n\n;Pagodas\n[[File:Golden Chedi in Wat Phra Kaew.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Phra Sri Rattana [[stupa|Chedi]] in Sri Lankan style]]\nThe temple grounds also depict three pagodas to its immediate north that represent the changing centres of Buddhist influence. One such shrine to the west of the temple is the Phra Si Ratana Chedi, a 19th-century stupa built in Sri Lankan style enshrining ashes of the Buddha.<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;The Library\n[[File:The Grand Palace (8281348373).jpg|thumb|right|Phra Mondop, the library]]\nRama I also built a library in Thai style, in the middle of the complex, known as the \"Phra Mondop\". The library houses an elegantly carved Ayutthaya-style [[mother-of-pearl]] doors, bookcases with the [[Tripitaka]] (sacred Buddhist manuscripts), human-and dragon-headed nagas (snakes), and images of [[Chakri kings]].<ref name=Sacred/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Royal Pantheon was built in [[Khmer style]] to the east of the temple that is kept open for only one day in year, in the month of October to commemorate the founding of the [[Chakri dynasty]].<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;Model of Angkor Wat\nThe temple complex also contains a model of [[Angkor Wat]] (the most sacred of all Cambodian shrines). In 1860, King [[Mongkut]] ordered his generals to lead 2,000 men to dismantle Angkor Wat and take it to Bangkok. Modern scholars suggested that the king wanted to show that Siam was still in control of Cambodia, as France was seeking to [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|colonise Cambodia]] at that time. However, the king's order could not be fulfilled. A royal chronicle written by [[Chaophraya Thiphakorawong]], then foreign minister, recorded that many Thai men fell ill after entering Cambodian wilderness. The chronicle also stated that forest-dwelling [[Khmer people]] ambushed the Thai army, killing many leading generals. King Mongkut then ordered the construction of the model within Wat Phra Kaew, instead of the real Angkor Wat that could not be brought to Bangkok. Mongkut died before he could see the model. Its construction was completed in the reign of his son, [[Chulalongkorn]].<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Charnvit Kasetsiri]] | script-title=th:\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e23\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e21 |trans-title=Relocating a Khmer temple | year = 2009 | language = Thai | pages = 3\u20134 | location = Bangkok | publisher = Foundation for the Promotion of Social Sciences and Humanities Textbooks Project | format = pdf | url = http://www.openbase.in.th/files/tbpj174.pdf }}</ref>\n\n;Hermit statue\nA hermit's bronze image, that is believed to have healing powers is installed in a sala on the western side of the temple.

The Emerald Buddha deified in the Wat Phra Kaew is therefore deeply revered and venerated in Thailand as the protector of the country. Historical records date its finding to the 15th century in [[Chiang Rai]] where, after it was relocated a number of times, it was finally brought to Thailand in the 18th century. It was enshrined in Bangkok at the Wat Phra Kaew Temple in 1782 during the reign of [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Phutthayotfa Chulalok, King Rama I]] (1782\u20131809).

It is carved in the meditating posture in the style of the [[Lanna]] school of northern Thailand. Except for the Thai King and, in his stead, the crown prince, no other persons are allowed to touch the statue.

The Buddha statue fell down and later became chipped, and the monks, after removing the [[stucco]] around the statue, discovered that the image was a perfectly made Buddha image from a solid piece of green jade. The image was moved a few time to various temples, first to [[Lampang]], then to [[Chiang Mai]], from where it was removed by prince Chao [[Setthathirath|Chaiyasetthathirat]] to [[Luang Prabang]], when his father died and he ascended the throne of both [[Lanna]] and [[Lan Xang]], in 1551. The statue remained the it to his new capital of [[Lan Xang]] in Vientiane in the 1560s. The statue remained there for twelve years. King Chaiyasetthathirat then shifted it to his new capital of [[Lan Xang]] in Vientiane in the 1560s. He took the Emerald Buddha with him and the image remained in Vientiane for 214 years until 1778.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn the reign of King Taksin, Chao Phraya Chakri (who later became [[Rama I]]) defeated [[Vientiane]] and moved the Emerald Buddha from Vientiane to Thonburi where it was installed in a shrine close to [[Wat Arun]]. When Chao Phra Chakri took over the throne and founded the [[Chakri Dynasty]] of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]], he shifted his capital across the river to its present location in Bangkok. The Emerald Buddha was also moved across the river with pomp and pageantry and installed in the temple of Wat Phra Keaw.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/>\n\n===Legends===\nThere a number of legends associated with the Emerald Buddha.  It was said the iconic image of the Emerald Buddha was made by [[Nagasena]], a saint in [[Pataliputra]] (present day [[Patna]]), India, who, with the help of Hindu god Vishnu and demigod Indra, had the Emerald Buddha image made. Nagasena predicted that:<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><blockquote>\nThe image of the Buddha is assuredly going to give to religion the most brilliant importance in five lands, that is in Lankadvipa ([[Sri Lanka]]), Ramalakka, [[Dvaravati]], [[Chieng Mai]] and [[Lan Xang|Lan Chang]] ([[Laos]]).</blockquote>\n\nThe Emerald Buddha image was taken to Sri Lanka after three hundred years in Pataliputra to save it during a civil war. In 457, King Anuruth of [[Myanmar|Burma]] sent a mission to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] with a request for [[Buddhist scriptures]] and the Emerald Buddha, in order to promote Buddhism in his country. These requests were granted, but the ship lost its way in a storm during the return voyage and landed in [[Cambodia]]. When the Thais captured [[Angkor Wat]] in 1432 (following the ravage of the [[bubonic plague]]), the Emerald Buddha was taken to Ayutthaya, [[Kamphaeng Phet]], [[Laos]] and finally [[Chiang Rai]], where the ruler of the city hid it, and was later found.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:A view of the temple of the Emerald Buddha.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Temple of the Emerald Buddha]]\n\nWat Phra Kaew has a number of buildings in the precincts of the Grand Palace that covers a total area of over {{convert|94.5|ha|acre}}. It has over 100 buildings with \"200 years royal history and architectural experimentation\" linked to it. The architectural style is named as [[Rattanakosin style]] (old Bangkok-style). The main temple of the Emerald Buddha is decorated and similar to the temple in ancient capital of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. The roof is embellished with polished orange and green tiles, the pillars are inlaid with [[mosaic]]s and the [[pediment]]s are made of marble, installed in the 18th century. The Emerald Buddha reposes on an elevated altar surrounded by large gilded decorations. While the upper part of this altar was part of the original construction, the base was added by [[King Rama III]]. Two images of the Buddha, that represent the first two kings of the Chakri dynasty, flank the main image. Over the years, the temple has retained its original design. Minor improvements have been made after its construction during Rama I's reign: temple woodwork  was replaced by King Rama III and King Chulalongkorn; during [[King Mongkut]]'s reign, the doors and windows and the copper plates on the floor were added; Rama III refurbished the wall painting (indicative of the universe according to [[Buddhist cosmology]]) and several frescos that display various stages of the Buddha's life; three chambers were added on the west side by King Mongkut; in the chamber known as ''Phra Kromanusorn'' at the north end, images of Buddha have been installed in honour of the kings of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]; and in the 19th century, [[Khrua In Khong]], a famous painter, created the wall murals.

It is about {{convert|2|km|ft}} in length. The compound walls are decorated with Thai murals, based on the [[Indian epic]] [[Ramayana]]. In the [[Thai language]] these murals are known to form the [[Ramakian]], the Thai national epic that was written during the reign of Rama I. These stories formed the basis for the paintings made during the reign of King [[Rama I]] (1782\u20131809). These paintings are refurbished regularly. The murals, in 178 scenes starting from the north gate of the temple, illustrates the complete epic story of Ramayana sequentially, in a clockwise direction covering the entire compound wall. The murals serve to emphasise human values of honesty, faith, and devotion.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/><ref name=Williams/><ref name=photo/>\n\nThere are twelve [[Sala (architecture)|salas]], built by Rama I, around the temple.

During the reign of [[King Mongkut]], the Phra Gandharara, a small chapel at the southwest corner, and a tall belfry were added.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Worship and ceremonies==\n[[File:Wat Phra Kaew.jpg|thumb|left|A group of Buddhist monks at the Wat Phra Kaew temple]]\n\nEarly in the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782\u20131932)|Bangkok period]], the Emerald Buddha was removed from the temple and paraded in the streets to relieve the city and countryside of various calamities (such as [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[cholera]]). However, this practice was discontinued during [[Rama IV]]'s reign as it was feared that the image could get damaged during the procession and also a practical line of thinking that Rama IV held \"that diseases are caused by germs, not by evil spirits or the displeasure of the Buddha\". The image also marks the changing of the seasons in Thailand, with the king presiding over the seasonal ceremonies.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\nLike many other Buddha statues in Thailand, the Emerald Buddha is dressed in a seasonal costume. It is a significant ritual held at this temple. In this ritual, dress of the deity is changed three times a year to correspond to the seasons. In summer it is a pointed crown of gold and jewels, and a set of jewelled ornaments that adorns the image from the shoulders to the ankles. In winter, a meshed dressing gown or drapery made of gold beads that covered from the neck down like a [[poncho]] is used. During the rainy months, a top-knot headdress studded with gold, enamel and sapphires; the gold attire in the rainy season is draped over the left shoulder of the deity, only with the right shoulder left bare while gold ornaments embellish the image up to the ankles. The astrological dates for the ritual ceremonies, at the changing of the seasons, followed are in the 1st [[waning moon]] of [[lunar months]] 4, 8 and 12 (around March, July and November). The costume change ritual is performed by the Thai king who is the highest master of ceremonies for all Buddhist rites. On each occasion, the king himself  \"cleans the image by wiping away any dust that has collected and changing the headdress of the image\". Then a king's royal attendant climbs up and performs the elaborate ritual of changing garments of the image as the king is chanting prayers to the deity. On this occasion, the king sprinkles water over the monks and the faithful who have assembled to witness the unique ritual and seeks blessings of the deity for good fortune during the upcoming season. The two sets of clothing not in use at any given time are kept on display in the nearby [[Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Coins]] in the precincts of the Grand Palace. While Rama I initiated this ritual for the hot season and the rainy season, Rama III introduced the ritual for the winter season.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/> The robes that the image adorns, represents that of monks and King's depending on the season, a clear indication of highlighting its symbolic role \"as Buddha and the King\", which role is also enjoined on the Thai King who formally dresses the Emerald Buddha image.<ref name=Kleiner/>\n\n[[File:Rama9insigwpk0609.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Monument with insignia of [[King Rama IX]] showing the Octagonal Throne with a ''[[chakra]]'' with Thai numeral 9 inside and a [[Umbrella|seven-tiered Umbrella of State]]]]\nA ceremony that is observed in the wat is the Chakri Day (begun on 6 April 1782), a national holiday to honour founding of the [[Chakri dynasty]]. On this day, the king attends the ceremony. The former king [[Rama IX]], with his Queen, and entourage of the royal family, the Prime Minister, officials in the Ministry of Defence, and other government departments, first offered prayers at the Emerald Buddha temple. This was followed by visit to the pantheon to pay homage to the images of past Chakri rulers that are installed there.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\nThe [[Coronation of the Thai monarch]] is an important event of the Chakri dynasty. One such event took place when Rama IX was crowned the king. On this occasion, the king came to the Chapel Royal, Wat Phra Keo, in a procession wearing a \"great crown\". After entering the chapel, the king made offerings of gold and silver flowers to the deity and also lighted candles. He also paid homage to the images of Buddha that represented past kings of the dynasty. In the presence of assembled elite clergy of the kingdom, he took a formal vow of his religion and his commitment to defend the faith.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Rules of entry and conduct==\nThe sacred temples in Thailand follow a dress code that is strictly followed. Men must wear long trousers and sleeved shirts and shoes; women must wear long skirts. Visitors who arrive dressed otherwise may rent appropriate clothing items at the entry area of the temple. It is compulsory to remove the shoes before entering the temple, as a sign of respect of the Buddha, as is the practice in all other temples in Thailand. While offering prayers before the Buddha image, the sitting posture should avoid any offensive stretching of feet towards the deity; the feet should be tucked in towards the back.<ref name=Williams>{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=China|author2=Aaron Anderson |author3=Brett Atkinson |author4=Becca Blond |author5=Tim Bewer |title= Thailand|page=126|accessdate=2010-03-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc0LoROKM0MC&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2010|isbn= 9781742203850}}</ref>\n\n==Other monuments==\nWhile the surrounding portico of the shrine is an example of Thai craftsmanship, the perimeter of the temple complex has 12 open pavilions. These were built during the reign of Rama I.<ref name=Sacred/> There is plethora of monuments in the temple complex. These are:\n\n;Pagodas\n[[File:Golden Chedi in Wat Phra Kaew.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Phra Sri Rattana [[stupa|Chedi]] in Sri Lankan style]]\nThe temple grounds also depict three pagodas to its immediate north that represent the changing centres of Buddhist influence. One such shrine to the west of the temple is the Phra Si Ratana Chedi, a 19th-century stupa built in Sri Lankan style enshrining ashes of the Buddha.<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;The Library\n[[File:The Grand Palace (8281348373).jpg|thumb|right|Phra Mondop, the library]]\nRama I also built a library in Thai style, in the middle of the complex, known as the \"Phra Mondop\". The library houses an elegantly carved Ayutthaya-style [[mother-of-pearl]] doors, bookcases with the [[Tripitaka]] (sacred Buddhist manuscripts), human-and dragon-headed nagas (snakes), and images of [[Chakri kings]].<ref name=Sacred/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Royal Pantheon was built in [[Khmer style]] to the east of the temple that is kept open for only one day in year, in the month of October to commemorate the founding of the [[Chakri dynasty]].<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;Model of Angkor Wat\nThe temple complex also contains a model of [[Angkor Wat]] (the most sacred of all Cambodian shrines). In 1860, King [[Mongkut]] ordered his generals to lead 2,000 men to dismantle Angkor Wat and take it to Bangkok. Modern scholars suggested that the king wanted to show that Siam was still in control of Cambodia, as France was seeking to [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|colonise Cambodia]] at that time. However, the king's order could not be fulfilled. A royal chronicle written by [[Chaophraya Thiphakorawong]], then foreign minister, recorded that many Thai men fell ill after entering Cambodian wilderness. The chronicle also stated that forest-dwelling [[Khmer people]] ambushed the Thai army, killing many leading generals. King Mongkut then ordered the construction of the model within Wat Phra Kaew, instead of the real Angkor Wat that could not be brought to Bangkok. Mongkut died before he could see the model. Its construction was completed in the reign of his son, [[Chulalongkorn]].<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Charnvit Kasetsiri]] | script-title=th:\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e23\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e21 |trans-title=Relocating a Khmer temple | year = 2009 | language = Thai | pages = 3\u20134 | location = Bangkok | publisher = Foundation for the Promotion of Social Sciences and Humanities Textbooks Project | format = pdf | url = http://www.openbase.in.th/files/tbpj174.pdf }}</ref>\n\n;Hermit statue\nA hermit's bronze image, that is believed to have healing powers is installed in a sala on the western side of the temple. It is near the entry gate. It is a black stone statue, considered a patron of medicine, before which relatives of the sick and infirm pay respects and make offerings of joss sticks, fruit, flowers, and candles.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;Eight towers\nOn the eastern side of the temple premises there are eight towers or [[prang (architecture)|prang]]s, each of a different colour.  They were erected during the reign of Rama I and represent eight elements of Buddhism.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-HPoafeJ8UC&pg=PA83#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Thailand |author= Kindersley Dorling, Philip Cornwel-Smith |page=83 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |date=1 August 2012|isbn=978-1405370691}}</ref>\n;Elephant statues\nStatues of elephants that symbolize independence and power are seen all around the complex. As Thai kings fought wars mounted on elephants, it has become customary for parents to make their children circumambulate the elephant three times with the belief that it would bring them strength. The head of an elephant statue is also rubbed for good luck; this act of the people is reflected in the smoothness of the surface of elephant statues here.<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n==Map==\n{{Map of Wat Phra Kaew}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Wat Phra Kaew Building photo D Ramey Logan.jpg| A Wat Phra Kaew Inner Compound Structure\nImage:Bangkok statue.jpg|Thotsakhirithon (\u0e17\u0e28\u0e04\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35\u0e18\u0e23), giant demon ([[Yaksha]]) guarding an exit to Grand Palace\nImage:Kinnon_Wat_Phra_Kaew_02.jpg|[[Kinnara|Kinare]] \u2013 mythological creature, half bird, half man\nImage:Bangkok Wat Phra Kaew golden statue.jpg|Detail of a kinnara-statue\nImage:Garudakaryatid98.jpg|[[Garuda]] and [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]], at the outside of the [[ubosot]]\nImage:Tantima birds in Wat Phra Kaew.JPG|[[Nok Tantima]] (\u0e19\u0e01\u0e15\u0e31\u0e19\u0e15\u0e34\u0e21\u0e32) or [[Tantima bird]], guarding the Viharn Yod\nImage:Temple of the Emerald Buddha 2012.JPG| Wat Phra Kaew from entrance\nImage:Phra Mondop in Wat Phra Kaew 2015.JPG|Phra Mondop (the library) and Phra Sri Rattana Chedi\nImage:Gran Palacio, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 14.jpg|[[N\u0101ga]] at the entrance to Phra Mondop\nImage:Gran Palacio, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 06.jpg|Entrance to Phra Mondop\nImage:Wat Phra Kaew Temple and Stupa.JPG| View of the Temple of [[Emerald Buddha]] and Golden Stupa\nImage:Gran Palacio, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 24.jpg|Royal Pantheon of Wat Phra Kaew\nImage:A Row of Prangs in Wat Phra Kaew.JPG|A row of prangs in Wat Phra Kaew\nImage:\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e07\u0e32\u0e21\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e04\u0e48\u0e33\u0e04\u0e37\u0e19.JPG|Wat Phra Kaew at night\nFile:Wat Prah 10.jpg|Interior View\nFile:Gran Palacio, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 21.jpg|Golden Chedi\nFile:Kinnon Wat Phra Kaew.jpeg|Statue of a ''kinnara''\nFile:Wat_Phra_Kaew_entrance_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg|Entrance\nFile:Watphrakaeomap.png|Map\nFile:\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e30\u0e06\u0e31\u0e07 \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e21\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22.jpg|[[Bell tower (wat)|Bell tower]] (belfry), front view, at Wat Phra Kaew\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Thailand|Religion|Architecture}}\n{{commons+cat|Wat Phra Kaew}}\n* [[Wat Pho]] (Temple of the Reclining Buddha)\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n{{Rattanakosin|state=collapsed}}\n{{Visitor attractions in Bangkok}}\n\n[[Category:Buddhist temples in Bangkok|Phra Kaew]]\n[[Category:Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Phra Nakhon District]]\n[[Category:18th-century Buddhist temples|Phra Kaew]]\n[[Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1784]]\n[[Category:1784 establishments in Siam]]\n[[Category:1780s in Siam]]\n[[Category:Rattanakosin Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Grand Palace]]\n", "name_user": "Paul 012", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phra_Kaew"}
