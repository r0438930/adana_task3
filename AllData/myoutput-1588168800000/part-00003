In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} to less than {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}.

Between Chongqing and Yichang (I-ch'ang), at an altitude of {{convert|40|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} and a distance of about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}}, it passes through the spectacular [[Yangtze Gorges]], which are noted for their natural beauty but are dangerous to shipping.\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at [[Yibin]]. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through [[Mount Wushan]] bordering [[Chongqing]] and [[Hubei]] to create the famous [[Three Gorges]]. Eastward of the Three Gorges, [[Yichang]] is the first city on the [[Yangtze Plain]].\n\nAfter entering Hubei, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is [[Dongting Lake]], which is located on the border of [[Hunan]] and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At [[Wuhan]], it receives its biggest tributary, the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], bringing water from its northern basin as far as [[Shaanxi]].\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi, [[Lake Poyang]], the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]], receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the [[East China Sea]] at Shanghai.\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River.

They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]] in 506&nbsp;BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473&nbsp;BC, [[King Goujian of Yue]] fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its [[Wu (city)|eponymous capital]] at modern Suzhou. In 333&nbsp;BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the [[Minyue]] kingdom in [[Fujian]]. [[state of Qin|Qin]] was able to unite China by first subduing [[state of Ba|Ba]] and [[state of Shu|Shu]] on the upper Yangtze in modern [[Sichuan]], giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\n\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the [[Xiang River]] to expand China into [[Hunan]], Jiangxi and [[Guangdong]], setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the [[collapse of the Qin Dynasty]], these southern commanderies became the independent [[Nanyue Empire]] under [[Zhao Tuo]] while Chu and Han [[Chu-Han Contention|vied with each other]] for control of the north.\n\nFrom the [[Han dynasty]], the region of the Yangtze River became more and more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System|Dujiangyan]], northwest of Chengdu, built during the [[Warring States]] period) made agriculture very stable and productive. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.<ref>Brian Lander, \"State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.\" T'oung Pao 100.4\u20135 (2014): 325\u2013362.</ref> By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river.

The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the [[Jiangnan]] region south of the river ([[Wuxi]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]]) and with northern China (all the way from [[Yangzhou]] to Beijing). The less well known ancient [[Lingqu Canal]], connecting the upper [[Xiang River]] with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the [[Pearl River Delta]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ Lingqu Canal (Xiang'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qin Dynasty)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228071501/http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ |date=February 28, 2019 }} (Nomination for the UNESCO Heritage List)</ref>\n\nHistorically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see [[History of China]]) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and the [[Southern Song]]. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the [[Song dynasty]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] during the [[Jin\u2013Song wars]]. In the [[Battle of Caishi]] of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor [[Wanyan Liang]] clashed with the [[Naval history of China|Song fleet]] on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships.

Only the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] occupied most parts of China from their capital at [[Nanjing]], though it later moved the capital to Beijing.

She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between [[Lintin Island]], Macau and [[Whampoa Dock|Whampoa]]. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary who personified [[gunboat diplomacy]], decided to wage war on China mainly on the \"suggestions\" of Jardine Matheson{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the ''Royal Saxon'', the British started the [[First Opium War]]. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military was vastly superior during the conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the ''[[Nemesis (1839)|Nemesis]]'') were not only virtually indestructible using contemporary available weapons, but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern rifled muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took [[Guangzhou|Canton]], they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.\n\nIn 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to [[Queen Victoria]]. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.\n[[File:1937 Yangtze Gorges VP8.webm|thumb|left|Yangtze River steam boats filmed in 1937]]\n\n=== U.S. and French conflicts ===\nThe US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the {{USS|Wachusett|1861|6}} six hundred miles up the river to [[Hankou District|Hankow]] sometime in the 1860s, while the {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|6}}, a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to [[Yichang]] in 1874. The first {{USS|Monocacy|1864|6}}, a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first {{USS|Palos|1865|6}}, an armed tug, was on [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic Station]] into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as [[Hankou]], 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Europeans]] put more steamers on the river. The French engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of [[Vietnam]]. The [[Sino-French War]]s of the 1880s emerged with the [[Battle of Shipu]] having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.\n[[File:USSLuzonPG-7.jpg|left|thumb|[[USS Luzon (PG-47)|USS ''Luzon'']]]]\n[[The China Navigation Company]] was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by Japan in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. [[Robert Dollar]] was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.\n\n[[Yichang]], or Ichang, {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to [[Hankow]], a distance of almost {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} from the sea. For about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.\n\nThe Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the [[Nanyang Fleet]], which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet, only to be ravaged by another war with [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan (1895)]], [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution (1911)]] and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.\n\n===Navigation on the upper river===\n[[File:Yangtze kiang 1915.jpg|thumb|Yangtze in 1915]]\n[[File:Cruise boats on yangtze.jpg|thumb|Cruise boats on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A vehicle carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A vehicle carrier on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A container carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A container carrier on Yangtze]]\n\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the [[three gorges]], described as an \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.<ref>Lyman P. Van Slyke, ''Yangtze, ''Nature'', History and the River'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., Massachusetts, 1988, p.18-19 and 121\u2013123.</ref> Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the [[Chefoo Convention]] opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built ''Kuling'' but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes.  ''Kuling'' was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service.  In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts.  In 1895, the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade.  Little took up residence in Chongqing and built ''Leechuan'', to tackle the gorges in 1898.  In March ''Leechuan'' completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers.  ''Leechuan'' was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.<ref>''Ibid.'', p. 170-172.</ref> In 1898, Little persuaded Captain [[Samuel Cornell Plant]] to come out to China to lend his expertise.  Captain Plant had just completed navigation of [[Iran|Persia]]'s Upper [[Karun River]] and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on ''Leechuan'' at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS ''Pioneer'' built with Plant in command.  In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing.  ''Pioneer'' was sold to [[British Royal Navy]] after its first run due to threat from the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and renamed HMS ''Kinsha''.  Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS ''Suixing'' ended in catastrophe.  On ''Suixing's'' maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.  In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing.  Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS ''Shutung'' and SS ''Shuhun''. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too.  Plant was appointed by [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] as First Senior River Inspector in 1915.  In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.  He also wrote ''Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River'', a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction.  Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze.  Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, [[Jardine Matheson]], [[Butterfield and Swire]] and [[Standard Oil]] added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919.  Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shih Brandmeyer | first1 = Polly | year = 2014 | title = Cornell Plant, Lost Girls and Recovered Lives \u2013 Sino-British Relations at the Human Level in Late Qing and Early Republican China | url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch | volume = 54 | pages = 106\u2013110 | access-date = April 13, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180811112513/https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | archive-date = August 11, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> ''Shutung'' was commandeered by warlords and ''Shuhun'' was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.<ref>\"Returns of Trade and Trade Reports 1918,\" ''China \u2013 The Maritime Customs'', published by Order of the Inspector General of Customs.</ref> In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation.

In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners.  One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English.  Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.<ref>Peter Simpson, \"Hell and High Water,\" ''South China Morning Post Magazine'', October 2, 2011, p.24-30.</ref><ref>Plant Memorial Brochure, March 20, 1923, ''National Maritime Museum'', Greenwich, Archive Collection, \"Papers of Capt.

In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, a public company under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardine's established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.<ref>Mender, P., Thirty Years A Mariner in the Far East 1907\u20131937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, A Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, p.53, {{ISBN|978-1-60910-498-6}}</ref>\n\n===Navy ships===\n[[File:Japanese cruiser Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[armored cruiser]] ''[[Japanese cruiser Izumo|Izumo]]'' in Shanghai in 1937. She sank [[riverboat]]s on the Yangtze in 1941.]]\n{{see also|USS Asheville (PG-21)|Yangtze Patrol|Yangtze Incident}}\nWith the [[Treaty Ports]], the [[Great power|European powers]] and Japan were allowed to sail navy ships into China's waters. The British, Americans, and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire|German]] navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open warfare with the Chinese over conquest of the Chinese [[Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u20131895, and with Russia over Qing Empire territory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. Incidentally, both the [[French Navy|French]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies were heavily involved in running [[opium]] and [[narcotics]] to Shanghai, where it was refined into [[morphine]]. It was then transhipped by liner back to [[Marseille]] and France (i.e. [[French Connection]]) for processing in [[German Empire|Germany]] and eventual sale in the U.S. or Europe.\n\nIn 1909 the gunboat {{USS|Samar|PG-41|6}} changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to [[Nanking]] and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in [[Changsha]] in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to [[Hankow]] and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, \"American interests in the Orient.\" After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on July 1, 1911.\n\nAfter staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and [[Ichang]] in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial [[warlord]]s in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze River steamer that damaged her bow.\n\nThe Spanish boats were replaced in the 1920s by {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} and {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} were the largest, {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} and {{USS|Panay|PR-5|6}} next in size, and {{USS|Guam|PG-43|6}} and {{USS|Tutuila|PG-44|6}} the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the 20th century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the [[Nanking incident of 1927]] when the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalists]] broke into open war. The [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second {{USS|Palos|PG-16|6}} protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and [[Chongqing|Chungking]] throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] had a series of [[Insect-class gunboat]]s which patrolled between Chungking and Shanghai. Cruisers and destroyers and [[Fly-class gunboat]]s{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when ''Panay'' and {{HMS|Bee|1915|6}} in 1937, were dive-bombed by Japanese aeroplanes during the notorious [[Nanking massacre]]. The Westerners were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. Probably the most curious incident involved {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}} in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]] between [[Kuomintang]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] forces; and led to the award of the [[Dickin Medal]] to the ship's cat [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].\n\n===Contemporary events===\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer [[Ash Dykes]] became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210094552/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek |archive-date=December 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Hydrology==\n\n===Periodic floods===\n{{See also|List of deadliest floods}}\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes.

Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\nThe [[1931 China floods|1931 Central China floods]] or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted).

Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nThe [[1998 Yangtze River floods]] were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.<ref name=\"cnews\">{{cite web |website=Chinanews.com.cn |url=http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130101151742/http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |script-title=zh:98\u5e74\u7279\u5927\u6d2a\u6c34 |accessdate=August 1, 2009}}</ref>\n<!--The event was considered the worst [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]] flood in 40 years.<ref name=\"spig\" />--> \nIn the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the [[Yangtze River]], resulting in 3,704 dead, 15 million homeless and $26&nbsp;billion in economic loss.<ref>Pbs.org. \"[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/greatwall/dam1.html Pbs.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502200427/http://www.pbs.org/itvs/greatwall/dam1.html |date=May 2, 2015 }}.\" ''Great wall across the Yangtze.''

More than a hundred lakes were thus cut off from the main river.<ref name=\"WWF UK\"/> There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ma|first=Jun|title=China's Water Crisis|publisher=International Rivers Network|pages=55\u201356|year=2004|isbn=978-1891936272}}</ref> Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, [[Baidang Lake]] shrunk from {{convert|100|km2|sp=us}} in the 1950s to {{convert|40|km2|sp=us}} in 2005. [[Zhangdu Lake]] dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as [[Poyang Lake]] and [[Dongting Lake]], remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of [[carp]] who thrived in [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]] water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.<ref name=\"WWF UK\" /><ref name=\"Lakes reunited\">{{cite web |last = [[China Daily]] |title = Isolated Yangtze lakes reunited with mother river |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |accessdate = October 25, 2011 |date = July 12, 2005 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140830212154/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |archive-date = August 30, 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref> In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.<ref name=\"Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery\">{{cite web |last = [[ABC News]] |title = Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery |url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |accessdate = October 28, 2012 |date = September 7, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121112170920/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |archive-date = November 12, 2012 |url-status = live }}</ref> The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the [[baiji dolphin]], [[narrow-ridged finless porpoise]] and the [[Yangtze alligator]]. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.<ref>Ellen Wohl.

The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were [[Zhangdu Lake]], [[Honghu Lake]], and [[Tian'e-Zhou]] in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in [[Anhui]] was also reconnected.<ref name=\"Lakes reunited\" />\n\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.<ref>{{cite web |last=WWF China |title=The Yangtze Forum |url=http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091933/http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 }}</ref> In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes.

For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry.  On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the ''[[Zhong\u2019anlun Monument|Zhong\u2019anlun]]'' disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and [[Pukou]], and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from [[Wuchang Railway Station|Wuchang]] or [[Nanjing West Railway Station|Nanjing West]].\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], a dual-use [[list of road-rail bridges|road-rail bridge]], built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in [[Nanjing]].  It was built after the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in [[Zhicheng]] (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\n\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The [[Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge]] was built in 1992 as part of the [[Jingjiu railway|Beijing-Jiujiang Railway]].  A [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|second bridge in Wuhan]] was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.

In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} to less than {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}.

While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through [[Mount Wushan]] bordering [[Chongqing]] and [[Hubei]] to create the famous [[Three Gorges]]. Eastward of the Three Gorges, [[Yichang]] is the first city on the [[Yangtze Plain]].\n\nAfter entering Hubei, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is [[Dongting Lake]], which is located on the border of [[Hunan]] and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At [[Wuhan]], it receives its biggest tributary, the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], bringing water from its northern basin as far as [[Shaanxi]].\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi, [[Lake Poyang]], the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]], receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the [[East China Sea]] at Shanghai.\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River.

They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]] in 506&nbsp;BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473&nbsp;BC, [[King Goujian of Yue]] fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its [[Wu (city)|eponymous capital]] at modern Suzhou. In 333&nbsp;BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the [[Minyue]] kingdom in [[Fujian]]. [[state of Qin|Qin]] was able to unite China by first subduing [[state of Ba|Ba]] and [[state of Shu|Shu]] on the upper Yangtze in modern [[Sichuan]], giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\n\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the [[Xiang River]] to expand China into [[Hunan]], Jiangxi and [[Guangdong]], setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the [[collapse of the Qin Dynasty]], these southern commanderies became the independent [[Nanyue Empire]] under [[Zhao Tuo]] while Chu and Han [[Chu-Han Contention|vied with each other]] for control of the north.\n\nFrom the [[Han dynasty]], the region of the Yangtze River became more and more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System|Dujiangyan]], northwest of Chengdu, built during the [[Warring States]] period) made agriculture very stable and productive. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.<ref>Brian Lander, \"State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.\" T'oung Pao 100.4\u20135 (2014): 325\u2013362.</ref> By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river.

The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the [[Jiangnan]] region south of the river ([[Wuxi]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]]) and with northern China (all the way from [[Yangzhou]] to Beijing).

This occurred notably during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and the [[Southern Song]]. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the [[Song dynasty]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] during the [[Jin\u2013Song wars]]. In the [[Battle of Caishi]] of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor [[Wanyan Liang]] clashed with the [[Naval history of China|Song fleet]] on the Yangtze.

The [[Republic of China|ROC]] capital was located in [[Nanjing]] in the periods 1911\u201312, 1927\u201337, and 1945\u201349.\n\n{{wide image|Anonymous-Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River.jpg|5000px|''Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River'', a [[Ming dynasty]] landscape painting}}\n\n=== Age of steam ===\n{{Main|Steamboats on the Yangtze River|China Station}}\n\nThe first merchant steamer in China, the ''Jardine'', was built to order for the firm of [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]] in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between [[Lintin Island]], Macau and [[Whampoa Dock|Whampoa]]. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary who personified [[gunboat diplomacy]], decided to wage war on China mainly on the \"suggestions\" of Jardine Matheson{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the ''Royal Saxon'', the British started the [[First Opium War]]. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military was vastly superior during the conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the ''[[Nemesis (1839)|Nemesis]]'') were not only virtually indestructible using contemporary available weapons, but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern rifled muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took [[Guangzhou|Canton]], they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.\n\nIn 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to [[Queen Victoria]]. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.\n[[File:1937 Yangtze Gorges VP8.webm|thumb|left|Yangtze River steam boats filmed in 1937]]\n\n=== U.S. and French conflicts ===\nThe US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the {{USS|Wachusett|1861|6}} six hundred miles up the river to [[Hankou District|Hankow]] sometime in the 1860s, while the {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|6}}, a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to [[Yichang]] in 1874. The first {{USS|Monocacy|1864|6}}, a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first {{USS|Palos|1865|6}}, an armed tug, was on [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic Station]] into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as [[Hankou]], 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Europeans]] put more steamers on the river. The French engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of [[Vietnam]]. The [[Sino-French War]]s of the 1880s emerged with the [[Battle of Shipu]] having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.\n[[File:USSLuzonPG-7.jpg|left|thumb|[[USS Luzon (PG-47)|USS ''Luzon'']]]]\n[[The China Navigation Company]] was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by Japan in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. [[Robert Dollar]] was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.\n\n[[Yichang]], or Ichang, {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to [[Hankow]], a distance of almost {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} from the sea. For about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.\n\nThe Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the [[Nanyang Fleet]], which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet, only to be ravaged by another war with [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan (1895)]], [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution (1911)]] and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.\n\n===Navigation on the upper river===\n[[File:Yangtze kiang 1915.jpg|thumb|Yangtze in 1915]]\n[[File:Cruise boats on yangtze.jpg|thumb|Cruise boats on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A vehicle carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A vehicle carrier on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A container carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A container carrier on Yangtze]]\n\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the [[three gorges]], described as an \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.<ref>Lyman P. Van Slyke, ''Yangtze, ''Nature'', History and the River'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., Massachusetts, 1988, p.18-19 and 121\u2013123.</ref> Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the [[Chefoo Convention]] opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built ''Kuling'' but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes.  ''Kuling'' was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service.  In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts.  In 1895, the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade.  Little took up residence in Chongqing and built ''Leechuan'', to tackle the gorges in 1898.  In March ''Leechuan'' completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers.  ''Leechuan'' was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.<ref>''Ibid.'', p. 170-172.</ref> In 1898, Little persuaded Captain [[Samuel Cornell Plant]] to come out to China to lend his expertise.  Captain Plant had just completed navigation of [[Iran|Persia]]'s Upper [[Karun River]] and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on ''Leechuan'' at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS ''Pioneer'' built with Plant in command.  In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing.  ''Pioneer'' was sold to [[British Royal Navy]] after its first run due to threat from the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and renamed HMS ''Kinsha''.  Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS ''Suixing'' ended in catastrophe.  On ''Suixing's'' maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.  In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing.  Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS ''Shutung'' and SS ''Shuhun''. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too.  Plant was appointed by [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] as First Senior River Inspector in 1915.  In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.  He also wrote ''Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River'', a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction.  Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze.  Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, [[Jardine Matheson]], [[Butterfield and Swire]] and [[Standard Oil]] added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919.  Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shih Brandmeyer | first1 = Polly | year = 2014 | title = Cornell Plant, Lost Girls and Recovered Lives \u2013 Sino-British Relations at the Human Level in Late Qing and Early Republican China | url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch | volume = 54 | pages = 106\u2013110 | access-date = April 13, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180811112513/https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | archive-date = August 11, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> ''Shutung'' was commandeered by warlords and ''Shuhun'' was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.<ref>\"Returns of Trade and Trade Reports 1918,\" ''China \u2013 The Maritime Customs'', published by Order of the Inspector General of Customs.</ref> In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation.  The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots.  In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners.  One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English.  Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.<ref>Peter Simpson, \"Hell and High Water,\" ''South China Morning Post Magazine'', October 2, 2011, p.24-30.</ref><ref>Plant Memorial Brochure, March 20, 1923, ''National Maritime Museum'', Greenwich, Archive Collection, \"Papers of Capt.

In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, a public company under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardine's established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.<ref>Mender, P., Thirty Years A Mariner in the Far East 1907\u20131937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, A Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, p.53, {{ISBN|978-1-60910-498-6}}</ref>\n\n===Navy ships===\n[[File:Japanese cruiser Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[armored cruiser]] ''[[Japanese cruiser Izumo|Izumo]]'' in Shanghai in 1937. She sank [[riverboat]]s on the Yangtze in 1941.]]\n{{see also|USS Asheville (PG-21)|Yangtze Patrol|Yangtze Incident}}\nWith the [[Treaty Ports]], the [[Great power|European powers]] and Japan were allowed to sail navy ships into China's waters. The British, Americans, and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire|German]] navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open warfare with the Chinese over conquest of the Chinese [[Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u20131895, and with Russia over Qing Empire territory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. Incidentally, both the [[French Navy|French]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies were heavily involved in running [[opium]] and [[narcotics]] to Shanghai, where it was refined into [[morphine]]. It was then transhipped by liner back to [[Marseille]] and France (i.e. [[French Connection]]) for processing in [[German Empire|Germany]] and eventual sale in the U.S. or Europe.\n\nIn 1909 the gunboat {{USS|Samar|PG-41|6}} changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to [[Nanking]] and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in [[Changsha]] in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to [[Hankow]] and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, \"American interests in the Orient.\" After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on July 1, 1911.\n\nAfter staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and [[Ichang]] in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial [[warlord]]s in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze River steamer that damaged her bow.\n\nThe Spanish boats were replaced in the 1920s by {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} and {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} were the largest, {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} and {{USS|Panay|PR-5|6}} next in size, and {{USS|Guam|PG-43|6}} and {{USS|Tutuila|PG-44|6}} the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the 20th century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the [[Nanking incident of 1927]] when the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalists]] broke into open war. The [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second {{USS|Palos|PG-16|6}} protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and [[Chongqing|Chungking]] throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] had a series of [[Insect-class gunboat]]s which patrolled between Chungking and Shanghai. Cruisers and destroyers and [[Fly-class gunboat]]s{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when ''Panay'' and {{HMS|Bee|1915|6}} in 1937, were dive-bombed by Japanese aeroplanes during the notorious [[Nanking massacre]]. The Westerners were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. Probably the most curious incident involved {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}} in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]] between [[Kuomintang]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] forces; and led to the award of the [[Dickin Medal]] to the ship's cat [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].\n\n===Contemporary events===\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer [[Ash Dykes]] became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210094552/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek |archive-date=December 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Hydrology==\n\n===Periodic floods===\n{{See also|List of deadliest floods}}\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes.

Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan.

More than a hundred lakes were thus cut off from the main river.<ref name=\"WWF UK\"/> There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ma|first=Jun|title=China's Water Crisis|publisher=International Rivers Network|pages=55\u201356|year=2004|isbn=978-1891936272}}</ref> Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up.

Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as [[Poyang Lake]] and [[Dongting Lake]], remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of [[carp]] who thrived in [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]] water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution.

Together with 9 other rivers, the Yangtze transports 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans.<ref>{{cite web | title=Almost all plastic in the ocean comes from just 10 rivers \u2013 30.11.2017 | website=DW.COM | url=https://www.dw.com/en/almost-all-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-just-10-rivers/a-41581484 | ref={{sfnref | DW.COM}} | access-date=August 22, 2018 | quote=about 90 percent of all the plastic that reaches the world's oceans gets flushed through just 10 rivers: The Yangtze, the Indus, Yellow River, Hai River, the Nile, the Ganges, Pearl River, Amur River, the Niger, and the Mekong (in that order). | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822181401/https://www.dw.com/en/almost-all-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-just-10-rivers/a-41581484 | archive-date=August 22, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Schmidt | first=Christian | last2=Krauth | first2=Tobias | last3=Wagner | first3=Stephan | title=Export of Plastic Debris by Rivers into the Sea | journal=Environmental Science & Technology | volume=51 | issue=21 | date=October 11, 2017 | issn=0013-936X | doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b02368 | pmid=29019247 | pages=12246\u201312253 | ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n=== Reconnecting lakes ===\nIn 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were [[Zhangdu Lake]], [[Honghu Lake]], and [[Tian'e-Zhou]] in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in [[Anhui]] was also reconnected.<ref name=\"Lakes reunited\" />\n\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.<ref>{{cite web |last=WWF China |title=The Yangtze Forum |url=http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091933/http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 }}</ref> In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes.

For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry.  On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the ''[[Zhong\u2019anlun Monument|Zhong\u2019anlun]]'' disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and [[Pukou]], and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from [[Wuchang Railway Station|Wuchang]] or [[Nanjing West Railway Station|Nanjing West]].\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], a dual-use [[list of road-rail bridges|road-rail bridge]], built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in [[Nanjing]].  It was built after the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in [[Zhicheng]] (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\n\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The [[Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge]] was built in 1992 as part of the [[Jingjiu railway|Beijing-Jiujiang Railway]].  A [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|second bridge in Wuhan]] was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.  These include some of the longest [[suspension bridge|suspension]] and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s in the world on the Yangtze Delta: [[Jiangyin Suspension Bridge]] (1,385 m, opened in 1999), [[Runyang Bridge]] (1,490 m, opened 2005), [[Sutong Bridge]] (1,088 m, opened 2008).
