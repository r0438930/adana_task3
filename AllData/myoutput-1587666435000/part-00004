By a strict classification,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} only 5% to 10% of the population has a completely normal manner of speaking (with respect to all parameters) and healthy voice; all others suffer from one disorder or another.\n\nThere are three different levels of classification when determining the magnitude and type of a speech disorder and the proper treatment or therapy:<ref>Deputy, Paul; ''Human Communication Disorders''; March 10, 2008</ref>\n# Sounds the patient can produce\n## Phonemic \u2013 can be produced easily; used meaningfully and constructively\n## Phonetic \u2013 produced only upon request; not used consistently, meaningfully, or constructively; not used in connected speech\n# Stimulate sounds\n## Easily stimulated\n## Stimulate after demonstration and probing (i.e. with a tongue depressor)\n# Cannot produce the sound\n## Cannot be produced voluntarily\n## No production ever observed\n\n===Types of disorder===\n* [[Apraxia of speech]] may result from stroke or progressive illness, and involves inconsistent production of speech sounds and rearranging of sounds in a word (\"potato\" may become \"topato\" and next \"totapo\"). Production of words becomes more difficult with effort, but common phrases may sometimes be spoken spontaneously without effort.\n* [[Cluttering]], a speech and fluency disorder characterized primarily by a rapid rate of speech, which makes speech difficult to understand.\n* [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]] also known as childhood apraxia of speech. \n* [[Dysarthria]] is a weakness or paralysis of speech muscles caused by damage to the nerves or brain. Dysarthria is often caused by [[stroke]]s, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], head or neck injuries, surgical accident, or [[cerebral palsy]].\n* [[Dysprosody]] is the rarest neurological speech disorder. It is characterized by alterations in intensity, in the timing of utterance segments, and in rhythm, cadence, and intonation of words. The changes to the duration, the [[fundamental frequency]], and the intensity of tonic and atonic syllables of the sentences spoken, deprive an individual's particular speech of its characteristics. The cause of dysprosody is usually associated with neurological pathologies such as [[brain vascular accident]]s, cranioencephalic traumatisms, and [[brain tumor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pinto JA, Corso RJ, Guilherme AC, Pinho SR, N\u00f3brega Mde O |title=Dysprosody nonassociated with neurological diseases--a case report |journal=J Voice |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=90\u20136 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15070228 |doi= 10.1016/j.jvoice.2003.07.005|url=}}</ref>\n* [[Muteness]] is the complete inability to speak.\n* [[Speech sound disorder]]s involve difficulty in producing specific speech sounds (most often certain consonants, such as /s/ or /r/), and are subdivided into [[Speech-Language Pathology in School Settings#Articulation disorders|articulation disorders]] (also called phonetic disorders) and [[Speech sound disorder#Phonemic Disorders|phonemic disorders]]. Articulation disorders are characterized by difficulty learning to produce sounds physically. Phonemic disorders are characterized by difficulty in learning the sound distinctions of a language, so that one sound may be used in place of many.
