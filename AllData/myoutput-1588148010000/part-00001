He is the founder of [[Bad Hat Harry Productions]] and has produced or co-produced almost all of the films he has directed.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California, Singer directed his first short film, ''[[Lion's Den (1988 film)|Lion's Den]]'' (1988). On the basis of that film, he received financing for his next film, ''[[Public Access]]'' (1993), which was a co-winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. In the mid-1990s, Singer received critical acclaim for directing the neo-noir crime thriller ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995), which starred [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Stephen Baldwin]], and [[Benicio del Toro]]. He followed this with another thriller, ''[[Apt Pupil (film)|Apt Pupil]]'' (1998), an adaptation of a [[Stephen King]] novella about a boy's fascination with a Nazi war criminal. In the 2000s, he became known for big budget superhero films such as ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000), for which Singer won the 2000 [[Saturn Award for Best Direction]], its sequel ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003), and ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006). He then directed the World War II historical thriller ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' (2008), co-wrote/co-produced ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (2011), and directed the fantasy adventure film ''[[Jack the Giant Slayer]]'' (2013), as well as two more ''X-Men'' films, ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) and ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016). Singer also directed the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] biographical film ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' (2018), although he was fired from the film shortly before its completion.\n\nSince 1997, a number of boys and men have alleged that Singer sexually assaulted them as [[Minor (law)|minors]]. Singer has denied all of the allegations. The [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] removed Singer's name from ''Bohemian Rhapsody's'' 2019 nomination for the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]] because of the allegations against him.\n\n==Early life==\nSinger was born in New York City and was adopted by Grace Sinden, an environmental activist, and Norbert Dave Singer, a corporate executive.<ref name=\"filmref\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/75/Bryan-Singer.html|title=Bryan Singer biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> He grew up in a Jewish household in [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]].

director, producer and writer of film and television. He is the founder of [[Bad Hat Harry Productions]] and has produced or co-produced almost all of the films he has directed.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California, Singer directed his first short film, ''[[Lion's Den (1988 film)|Lion's Den]]'' (1988). On the basis of that film, he received financing for his next film, ''[[Public Access]]'' (1993), which was a co-winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. In the mid-1990s, Singer received critical acclaim for directing the neo-noir crime thriller ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995), which starred [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Stephen Baldwin]], and [[Benicio del Toro]]. He followed this with another thriller, ''[[Apt Pupil (film)|Apt Pupil]]'' (1998), an adaptation of a [[Stephen King]] novella about a boy's fascination with a Nazi war criminal. In the 2000s, he became known for big budget superhero films such as ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000), for which Singer won the 2000 [[Saturn Award for Best Direction]], its sequel ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003), and ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006). He then directed the World War II historical thriller ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' (2008), co-wrote/co-produced ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (2011), and directed the fantasy adventure film ''[[Jack the Giant Slayer]]'' (2013), as well as two more ''X-Men'' films, ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) and ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016). Singer also directed the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] biographical film ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' (2018), although he was fired from the film shortly before its completion.\n\nSince 1997, a number of boys and men have alleged that Singer sexually assaulted them as [[Minor (law)|minors]]. Singer has denied all of the allegations. The [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] removed Singer's name from ''Bohemian Rhapsody's'' 2019 nomination for the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]] because of the allegations against him.\n\n==Early life==\nSinger was born in New York City and was adopted by Grace Sinden, an environmental activist, and Norbert Dave Singer, a corporate executive.<ref name=\"filmref\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/75/Bryan-Singer.html|title=Bryan Singer biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> He grew up in a Jewish household in [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]].
