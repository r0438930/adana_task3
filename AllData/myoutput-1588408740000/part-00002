In the same year, the Navy began limited [[Mobile Riverine Force|river operations]] in the [[Mekong Delta]], disrupting the [[Viet Cong|Viet Cong's]] lines of communications, locating supply caches, and eliminating tax collecting stations. Based on the \"[[Brown-water navy|Brown-water]]\" Navy's early success, a commitment was made to continue river operations on a full-scale basis in the [[Mekong Delta]].

Operating off a \"Mothership\", the {{USS|Belle Grove|LSD-2|6}}, the Army and Navy worked together on [[Operation Jackstay]]. Although the joint effort was a success, it was felt that [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviators]] and Aircrewman would be more suitable for the mission, especially since the mission would require the pilots and crews to operate off the deck of ships in all weather conditions, day and night. This, coupled with Army's pilots and aircrews lack of training in shipboard operations, identified a need for a dedicated, United States Navy, helicopter gunship program in Vietnam.<ref>Navy Seawolves \u2013 Early History, HA(L)-3 Official Website, http://www.seawolf.org/history/hal3_history.asp</ref>\n\n== The birth of the HA(L)-3 and the Seawolves ==\nIn 1966, rotary wing support was originated as part of the response to the ongoing war in South Vietnam.<ref>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/hc-1.htm</ref> Starting with [[HC-1|Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ONE (HC-1)]], detachments of helicopter gunships transferred to the Navy to conduct combat operations in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam.

In April 1967, HC-1 was divided into four separate units, [[HSC-3|Helicopter Combat Support Squadron THREE]] (Navy Vertical Replenishment), Helicopter Combat Support Squadron FIVE and [[Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Seven|Helicopter Combat Support Squadron SEVEN]] (Navy Combat Search and Rescue) and Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) 3 (HAL-(3)), nicknamed the ''Seawolves''.<ref>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/hc-1.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Navy sent a message fleet-wide, asking for volunteer Naval Aviators to man HA(L)-3.
