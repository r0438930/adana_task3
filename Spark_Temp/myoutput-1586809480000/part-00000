Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be \"wrong\" or hearing a piece of music \"in the wrong key.\" This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning (usually A = 415&nbsp;Hz as opposed to 440&nbsp;Hz, ''i.e.'', roughly a half step or [[semitone]] lower than standard concert pitch).<ref name=\"Sacks, O. 2007\">{{cite book |author=Sacks, O. |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain |url=https://archive.org/details/musicophilia00oliv |url-access=registration |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-4081-0}}</ref> An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with [[relative pitch|relative strategies]], such as transposition<ref name=\"miy_1993\">{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context |journal=Music Perception |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=55\u201372 |doi=10.2307/40285599|jstor=40285599}}</ref> or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard [[equal temperament]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Harris, G.
