Examples from common English expressions include \"suits\" (for \"businessmen\"), \"boots\" (for \"soldiers\") (''[[pars pro toto]]''), and  \"America\" (for \"the United States of America\", ''[[totum pro parte]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://literarydevices.net/synecdoche/ |title=Synecdoche Examples from Everyday Life |work=Literary Devices |accessdate=2 January 2019|date=2013-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nThe use of government buildings to refer to their occupants is metonymy and sometimes also synecdoche. \"[[The Pentagon]]\" for the [[United States Department of Defense]] can be considered synecdoche, as the building can be considered part of the department. Likewise, using \"[[10 Downing Street|Number 10]]\" to mean \"the Office of the [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]]\" (of the United Kingdom) is a synecdoche.\n\n==Definition==\nSynecdoche is a [[rhetorical]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]] and a type of figurative speech similar to [[metonymy]]\u2014a figure of speech that uses a term that denotes one thing to refer to a related thing.<ref name=\"seu\">[http://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms#42 Glossary of Rhetorical Terms], University of Kentucky</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jakobson|first=Roman & Morris Halle|title=Fundamentals of Language|year=1956|publisher=Mouton|location=The Hague|isbn=978-1178718140|page=95}}</ref> Indeed, synecdoche is sometimes considered a subclass of metonymy.

It is used in reference to political relations, including \"having a footing\", to mean a country or organization is in a position to act, or \"the wrong hands\", to describe opposing groups, usually in the context of military power.<ref name=\"Political Metaphors\" >{{cite web |title=President Obama's State of the Union Address |work=Metaphors in American Politics |url=http://www.politicalmetaphors.com/tag/synecdoche/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305010025/http://www.politicalmetaphors.com/tag/synecdoche/ |archive-date=5 March 2014 |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe two main types of synecdoche are ''microcosm'' and ''macrocosm''.

The residence of an executive is often credited for the executive's action. A spokesperson of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] is identified in \"The [[White House]] announced a new plan to reduce hunger.\" References to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King or Queen of the United Kingdom]] are made in the same fashion by referring to today's official residence, [[Buckingham Palace]]. Worldwide examples include \"the [[Sublime Porte]]\" of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and \"the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]\" of [[Russia]].\n\n[[Sonnet]]s and other forms of love poetry frequently use synecdoches to characterize the beloved in terms of individual body parts rather than a coherent whole. This practice is especially common in the [[Petrarchan sonnet]], where the idealised beloved is often described part by part, from head to toe.\n\nSynecdoche is also popular in advertising. Since synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole, its use requires the audience to make associations and \"fill in the gaps\", engaging with the ad by thinking about the product.<ref name=\"Chandler\" >{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |title=Semiotics: the Basics |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=132\u2013133 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=utd_AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT126&dq=Barthes%201974%2C%20162%3B&pg=PT126#v=onepage&q=Barthes%201974,%20162;&f=false |isbn=978-1-134-32476-7}}</ref> Moreover, catching the attention of an audience with advertising is often referred to by advertisers as \"getting eyeballs\", another synecdoche.<ref name=\"Bureman\" >{{cite web |title=Synecdoche: The Art of Getting Eyeballs |first=Liz |last=Bureman |url=http://thewritepractice.com/synecdoche/ |work=The Write Practice |accessdate=2 January 2019|date=2013-09-24 }}</ref>\nSynecdoche is very common in spoken English, especially in reference to sports.

Since synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole, its use requires the audience to make associations and \"fill in the gaps\", engaging with the ad by thinking about the product.<ref name=\"Chandler\" >{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |title=Semiotics: the Basics |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=132\u2013133 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=utd_AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT126&dq=Barthes%201974%2C%20162%3B&pg=PT126#v=onepage&q=Barthes%201974,%20162;&f=false |isbn=978-1-134-32476-7}}</ref> Moreover, catching the attention of an audience with advertising is often referred to by advertisers as \"getting eyeballs\", another synecdoche.<ref name=\"Bureman\" >{{cite web |title=Synecdoche: The Art of Getting Eyeballs |first=Liz |last=Bureman |url=http://thewritepractice.com/synecdoche/ |work=The Write Practice |accessdate=2 January 2019|date=2013-09-24 }}</ref>\nSynecdoche is very common in spoken English, especially in reference to sports. The names of cities are used as shorthand for their sports teams to describe events and their outcomes, such as \"Denver won Monday's game\", when it would be more accurate that a ''sports team'' from the city won the game.<ref name=\"Bureman\" />\n\n[[Kenneth Burke]] (1945), an American&nbsp;[[Literary theory|literary theorist]], declared that in [[rhetoric]] the four master [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], or [[figures of speech]], are [[metaphor]], [[metonymy]], synecdoche, and [[irony]]. Burke's primary concern with these four master tropes is not simply their figurative usage but their role in the discovery and description of the truth.<ref name=\"Burke 1945 503\">{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|year=1945|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=503}}</ref> He described synecdoche as \u201cpart of the whole, whole for the part, container for the contained, sign for the thing signified, material for the thing made\u2026 cause for the effect, effect for the cause, genus for the species, species for the genus\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|year=1945|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|pages=507\u2013508}}</ref> In addition, Burke suggests that synecdoche patterns can include reversible pairs such as disease-cure.<ref name=\"Burke 1945 508\">{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|year=1945|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=508}}</ref> Burke proclaimed the noblest synecdoche is found in the description of \"[[microcosm and macrocosm]]\" since microcosm is related to macrocosm as part to the whole, and either the whole can represent the part or the part can represent the whole\".<ref name=\"Burke 1945 508\" />\nBurke also compared synecdoche with the concept of \"representation\", especially in the political sense in which [[representative democracy|elected representatives]] stand in ''pars pro toto'' for their electorate.<ref name=\"Burke 1945 503\" />\n\n==Examples==\n{{example farm|section|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Part referring to whole ''([[pars pro toto]])''===\n* Referring to a person according to a single characteristic: \"gray beard\" meaning an old man \n* Referring to a sword as a 'blade'\n* Describing a complete vehicle as \"wheels,\" or, referring to a manual transmission vehicle as a \"stick\"\n* Referring to people by a particular body part;
