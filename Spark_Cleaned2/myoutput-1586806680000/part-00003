This would change somewhat by the extension of the [[London Underground|Underground]] to [[Morden]] and major house-building projects in the area. Between 1945 and 1953, it had an allocation of exactly 100 Utility [[Daimler Company|Daimlers]] (classed as Ds) numbered from D182 - D281. By 1952, the garage had 128 buses allocated, achieved mainly by parking buses in surrounding streets. However, this would soon fall again, to 100 in 1966, 82 in 1976 and 62 in 1987. The garage passed to the reborn London General bus company in the run-up to privatisation in 1985. Sutton Garage also partly took control of [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] at a yard in [[Colliers Wood]] (AA) in 1989, after Cityrama withdrew from their contract. Sutton was responsible for providing drivers for the service, whilst Merton garage were contracted to do the maintenance.

The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940 which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was underutilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of [[Putney Bridge]] garage (F) it started to receive both short and long wheelbase [[AEC Routemaster]]s for its central London routes.

Harris Bus went into receivership in 2000, and its routes and garage were taken over by London Buses under the guise of East Thames Buses. East Thames Buses remained a subsidiary of London Buses, taking over routes from defunct operators such as [[Durham Travel Services|London Easylink's]] [[London Buses route 42|42]] and [[London Buses route 185|185]] when this company ceased operating in 2002. Following the move to Mandela Way the engineering is now done there, however limited engineering facilities exist at Belvedere.\n\nIn October 2009, East Thames Buses was sold to Go-Ahead London. As a result of the purchase by Go-Ahead some route and allocation movements have taken or are due to take place.\n\nEven though Belvedere was a London General Garage it operated as a satellite of [[London Central]]'s Bexleyheath garage. All of Belvedere's engineering and fleet and staff management was done at or organised by Bexleyheath.\n\nBelvedere Garage closed on 1 December 2017 when the lease expired. Routes 180 and N1 transferred to the recently opened [[London Central#Morden Wharf (MG)|Morden Wharf]] bus garage in Greenwich, while Routes 244 and 669 transferred to Bexleyheath.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commons category-inline|London General (bus company)|London General}}\n* [http://www.londongeneral.co.uk/ Company website]\n\n{{London bus operators}}\n{{Go-Ahead Bus Companies}}\n\n[[Category:Go-Ahead Group London bus operators]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|a bus company|the accent spoken in south-eastern England|Estuary English}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=February 2019}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=February 2019}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2019}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox Bus transit\n|name            =\n|logo            = London General logo.png\n|logo_size       = 150\n|image           = London General buses LT60 (LTZ 1060) & E176 (SN61 BHJ, route 11, 13 October 2013.jpg\n|image_size      = 250\n|image_caption   = [[New Routemaster]] & [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]] on [[Whitehall]] in October 2013\n|company_slogan  =\n|parent          = [[Go-Ahead Group]]\n|founded         = {{Start date and age|df=yes|1989|4|1}}\n|headquarters    = [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]\n|locale          =\n|service_area    = [[Greater London]]\n|service_type    = Bus services\n|hubs            =\n|stations        =\n|depots          = 10\n|lounge          =\n|fleet           =\n|ridership       =\n|fuel_type       =\n|operator        =\n|ceo             =\n|website         = [http://www.goaheadlondon.com/ www.goaheadlondon.com]}}\n'''London General''' is a bus company operating services in [[Greater London]].

Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of [[Putney Bridge]] garage (F) it started to receive both short and long wheelbase [[AEC Routemaster]]s for its central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005 when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.\n\n===Merton (AL)===\nAs at February 2020, [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 44|44]], [[London Buses route 57|57]], [[London Buses route 131|131]], [[London Buses route 152|152]], [[London Buses route 163|163]], [[London Buses route 164|164]], [[London Buses route 200|200]], [[London Buses route 219|219]], [[London Buses route 270|270]], [[London Buses route 280|280]], London bus route 718 and [[London Buses route 655|655]].<ref name=\"Busroutes\" /> It also runs the [[St. Bede's School]] private bus services 514 and 519, which run between the [[Caterham]] area and the school, on behalf of [[Surrey County Council]].\n\n====History====\nThe garage was modernised in 1960, and again in 1991 when a new roof was fitted and various stores and welfare areas were moved to provide a larger, unobstructed parking area, which had previously been long and narrow. [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] was also responsible for the maintenance of vehicles for [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] in 1988/9 after the withdrawal of the Cityrama sightseeing company, whilst the route was operated from Sutton garage.\n\nThe garage has become [[Go-Ahead London]]'s head office, following the sale of Raleigh House, [[Mitcham]] and the acquisition of the former pub ([[King's Head, Merton]]) next door.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Croydon (C)===\nAs at August 2019, [[Croydon]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 119|119]], [[London Buses route 127|127]], [[London Buses route 202|202]], [[London Buses route 355|355]], [[London Buses route 359|359]], [[London Buses route 403|403]], [[London Buses route 405|405]], [[London Buses route 434|434]], [[London Buses route 455|455]] and [[London Buses route X26|X26]]<ref name=\"Busroutes\" />\n\n====History====\nThe Beddington Lane depot was opened by Metrobus in December 2005 to house [[London Buses route 127|route 127]] which had been surrendered early by [[Centra (bus company)|Centra]].

More recently routes have been operated from Godstone and in December 2005 a new depot was constructed in Croydon to cope with new tender awards.

The garage only operates Monday to Friday due to its proximity to residential properties.\n\nIn June 2002. the Red Arrow [[Leyland National]]s were replaced by London's first fleet of [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] articulated buses. Because of the extra space required to stable these, the route 11 Routemasters were transferred to Stockwell garage. In September 2009 the articulated fleet was replaced by [[Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro]]s.\n\n===Stockwell (SW)===\nAs of December 2019, [[Stockwell Garage]] operated routes [[London Buses route 11|11]], [[London Buses route 77|77]], [[London Buses route 87|87]], [[London Buses route 88|88]], [[London Buses route 93|93]], [[London Buses route 118|118]], [[London Buses route 155|155]], [[London Buses route 170|170]], [[London Buses route 315|315]], [[London Buses route 322|322]], [[London Buses route 432|432]], [[London Buses route 670|670]], [[London Buses route G1|G1]], [[London Buses route N11|N11]], [[London Buses route N44|N44]], [[London Buses route N87|N87]] and [[London Buses route N155|N155]] <ref name=\"Busroutes\" />\n\n====History====\nOpened in 1952 after nearly four years of planning and building with many materials short of supply and problems re-housing residents of the houses that stood on the site.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Stockwell garage is a listed building, and when built was a masterpiece of architectural design incorporating a new roof structure that did not need supports which enabled for a {{convert|73350|sqft|m2|adj=on}} unobstructed parking space.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The offices and workshops are on the edges of the garage but do not take up any of the parking space. In the first few days of operation the garage ran just 11 buses on route 178 which had moved from Rye Lane (Peckham), but then gained more work from the next stage of the tram replacement program for which it had been designed, but it was still well short of capacity. \n\nMore work arrived in late 1953 and early 1954 when routes 77 and 77A (now 87) moved from Victoria garage due to recruitment problems, and the closure of Nunhead which increased the PVR to 110 buses. In the early 1970s the Round London Sightseeing Tours moved to Stockwell. In 1984 Stockwell was chosen to conduct comparative testing on route 170, consisting of [[MCW Metrobus]]es, [[Leyland Titan (B15)|Leyland Titans]], [[Leyland Olympian]]s, [[Dennis Dominator]]s, and [[Volvo Ailsa]]s. The allocation steadied at around 120 for many years, but has increased in the last few years,{{when|date=May 2019}} partially due to taking back full control of [[London Buses route 11|route 11]] from Waterloo garage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Former garages==\n===Mandela Way (MW)===\nAs at May 2015, Mandela Way, [[Bermondsey]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 1|1]], [[London Buses route 453|453]], [[London Buses route 521|521]], [[London Buses route 624|624]], [[London Buses route 658|658]] [[London Buses route N1|N1]].{{cn|date=February 2019}} It was included in the 2009 [[East Thames Buses]] purchase.\nOn 28 July 2017, Mandela Way garage was closed with bus routes being transferred to other garages.<ref>[https://www.goaheadlondon.com/news/post/mandela-way-garage-has-closed-its-gates-after-almost-10-years Mandela Way garage has closed its gates, after nearly 10 years] Go-Ahead London August 2017</ref><ref>\"New garage for Go-Ahead London\" ''Buses Magazine'' issue 750 September 2017 page 24</ref>\n\n===Belvedere (BV)===\nAs at May 2015, [[Belvedere, London|Belvedere]] garage operated routes [[London Buses route 180|180]], [[London Buses route 244|244]], [[London Buses route 669|669]] and [[London Buses route N1|N1]].{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n====History====\nBelvedere was purchased by [[Harris Bus]] in 1998 to house its operations that moved from [[Crayford]]. Harris Bus went into receivership in 2000, and its routes and garage were taken over by London Buses under the guise of East Thames Buses. East Thames Buses remained a subsidiary of London Buses, taking over routes from defunct operators such as [[Durham Travel Services|London Easylink's]] [[London Buses route 42|42]] and [[London Buses route 185|185]] when this company ceased operating in 2002. Following the move to Mandela Way the engineering is now done there, however limited engineering facilities exist at Belvedere.\n\nIn October 2009, East Thames Buses was sold to Go-Ahead London. As a result of the purchase by Go-Ahead some route and allocation movements have taken or are due to take place.\n\nEven though Belvedere was a London General Garage it operated as a satellite of [[London Central]]'s Bexleyheath garage. All of Belvedere's engineering and fleet and staff management was done at or organised by Bexleyheath.\n\nBelvedere Garage closed on 1 December 2017 when the lease expired. Routes 180 and N1 transferred to the recently opened [[London Central#Morden Wharf (MG)|Morden Wharf]] bus garage in Greenwich, while Routes 244 and 669 transferred to Bexleyheath.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commons category-inline|London General (bus company)|London General}}\n* [http://www.londongeneral.co.uk/ Company website]\n\n{{London bus operators}}\n{{Go-Ahead Bus Companies}}\n\n[[Category:Go-Ahead Group London bus operators]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "KaiMPoppe", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMandela Way (MW):Added Wayback machine link to defunct news site", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_General"}
