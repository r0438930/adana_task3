It stars [[Kriti Sanon]] and [[Sushant Singh Rajput]], with [[Jim Sarbh]], [[Rajkumar Yadav]] and [[Varun Sharma]] in supporting roles. The story is based on the concept of [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] [[star-crossed lovers]]. ''Raabta'' released on 9 June 2017 at a budget of {{INR|450 million}}. It underperformed at the box office, grossing {{INR|398 million}} worldwide, and was termed a \"disaster\" by [[Box Office India]].\n\n==Plot==\nShiv Kakkar ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) is a young man from [[Amritsar]] who gets a lucrative opportunity to work in [[Budapest]] for a job as a banker, and lives with his friend, Radha ([[Varun Sharma]]). Shiv is shown to have been a fun-loving womanizer back home and continues this behaviour in Budapest. Saira Singh ([[Kriti Sanon]]), a young woman, is haunted by mysterious nightmares of drowning to death. She lives by herself in Budapest and works as a chocolatier. Shiv happens to stumble upon Saira's shop while on a date with a woman, but finds himself deeply attracted to Saira. Though she initially rejects his advances, she eventually succumbs and sleeps with Shiv, revealing the next day that she actually has a boyfriend and what happened with Shiv was a mistake. Unwilling to let go of their connection, Shiv interrupts Saira's date with her boyfriend Manav ([[Vikas Verma]]) and shows her that she would rather be with him than with her boyfriend. Manav breaks up with her, and Shiv and Saira start spending time together, growing close. One night, they go to a club with Radha, where they happen to meet an eccentric psychic who knows about Saira's nightmares and tells her that the events of her previous life will repeat themselves, and only she can fix them. Saira tearfully reveals to Shiv that she has a fear of water because her parents drowned after a car accident when she was two years old.\n\nWhile trying to test their love a final time, Shiv and Saira make a pact. Shiv flirts with multiple women, but Saira finds herself strongly drawn to a young businessman Zakir \"Zack\" Merchant ([[Jim Sarbh]]). Shiv reveals he has to leave for a business trip for a week and he and Saira decide to see how they feel after a week's separation. If they still feel strongly about each other, they will start considering marriage. During Shiv's absence, Saira gets to know Zakir better and confides in him about her nightmares. During one of their dinners, Zakir drugs Saira and kidnaps her.\n\nSaira wakes up and finds herself trapped in Zakir's isolated mansion on an island off the coast. She demands him to let her go, but he refuses, saying that he spent his whole life looking for her. He explains that he was madly in love with her in a previous life but his love remained unrequited. He refuses to let go of her again. When she does not believe him, he shows her a collection of uncannily accurate paintings he made of her at various ages and says she will find the explanation for her nightmares. Thinking he is crazy, she attempts to escape but ends up falling into the ocean, which triggers the memories of her previous life.\n\nThree hundred years ago, Saira was warrior princess Saiba. She had a childhood best friend Kabir ([[Jim Sarbh]]), a fellow warrior from her tribe who was in love with her. Their kingdom was threatened by the Muraakis, led by a wise, old Rajput ruler Muwwaqqil ([[Rajkummar Rao]]). Qaabir is severely wounded by the fierce warrior Jilaan ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]), who gives Qaabir an ultimatum to surrender. Saiba challenges Jilaan, and they find themselves attracted to each other. Saiba accepts defeat, surrendering the kingdom to the Muraakis and herself to Jilaan. Qaabir attempts to take Saiba back, but she reveals that she and Jilaan are in love. On their wedding night, a [[comet]] falls and Muwwaqqil realizes that this will be a fateful night. Qaabir ambushes Jilaan and Saiba, and murders Jilaan by wounding him and throws him in the ocean. Saiba jumps into the ocean to save him, but to no avail. Heartbroken on seeing Jilaan die, Saiba who is also heartbroken decides to drown too. On seeing Saiba dead, Qaabir slits his own throat, killing himself. Muwwaqqil forebodes that these events will repeat.\n\nHowever, this time, when Shiv shows up, Saira decides to fight back against Zakir. When their previous lives' events repeat, Zakir throwing Shiv into the ocean, Shiv drags Zakir down with him and Zakir dies. Saira jumps into the water and is able to save Shiv.\n\nThe film ends with Shiv humorously telling their children to not to believe Saira if she tells them any far-fetched stories about reincarnation, implying that he is still oblivious to the events of their previous lives.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sushant Singh Rajput]] as Jilaan/Shiv Kakkar\n* [[Kriti Sanon]] as Saiba/Saira Singh\n* [[Jim Sarbh]] as Kabir/Zakir \"Zak\" Merchant\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Radha, Shiv's friend\n* [[Vikas Verma]] as Manav Mehta\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Muwwaqqil\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] in a special appearance in the title track\n\n==Production ==\nThe film production began in 2015 and it was set to release in 2016.
