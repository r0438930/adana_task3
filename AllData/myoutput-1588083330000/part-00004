They were also endorsed by the Montreal Central Council of the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des syndicats nationaux]] which represents 125,000 members in Quebec.

''Pour un Qu\u00e9bec lucide'' presented a distinctly neoliberal analysis of and set of solutions to Quebec's problems, particularly criticizing the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignty movement]] as distracting from Quebec's real issues and the Quebec social model as inefficient and out-of-date. ''Pour un Qu\u00e9bec solidaire'' presented an alternate analysis, and later its writers formed the party Quebec solidaire, taking its name from the manifesto.{{r|thetyee}}\n\nFran\u00e7oise David and [[Amir Khadir]] were named as the two spokespersons at the party's founding.\n\n=== Electoral activity ===\n[[File:Amir Khadir election 2008.jpg|thumb|Victory speech of Amir Khadir after his election, 8 December 2008]]\nQu\u00e9bec solidaire's first political venture was to field a candidate, [[Manon Mass\u00e9]], in an April 10, 2006 by-election in [[Sainte-Marie\u2013Saint-Jacques]]. She received 22% of the vote. Six years later, she became QS' third MNA.\n\nQu\u00e9bec solidaire contested the [[2007 Quebec general election|2007 Quebec election]].  It won 3.65% of the popular vote and received 144,418 votes, 0.21% behind the Green Party of Quebec. They were also endorsed by the Montreal Central Council of the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des syndicats nationaux]] which represents 125,000 members in Quebec. According to an analysis on ''Canadian Dimension,'' this was the first time a trade union in Quebec has endorsed a party more left-wing than the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]].{{r|fidler}}\n\nOn December 8, 2008, the first Quebec solidaire candidate was elected in the [[2008 Quebec general election|provincial election]].

David has been named Personality of the Year by ''[[Le Point]]'' and Khadir is known for becoming the first elected member of the party, winning the provincial riding of [[Mercier (provincial electoral district)|Mercier]] in 2008.\n\nThe basic unit of the party is the local association. There is a local association for each of the 125 ridings in Quebec. These local associations are grouped into 19 regional associations, whose primary mandate to support the establishment of local associations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In March 2007, Qu\u00e9bec solidaire has 61 local associations organized. Students and staff at institutions of higher education are grouped in campus associations that also participate in the democratic life of the party.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Two national commissions are also part of the structure of Qu\u00e9bec solidaire: the Political Committee and the National Commission for Women. The first is composed of 14 thematic committees and is responsible for proposing a program to members. It was responsible for drafting the electoral platform of the party in general elections of 2007. The National Commission for Women is composed of delegates from each region and is responsible for ensuring that feminism is a value which transverses the party.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nQu\u00e9bec solidaire also includes a number of collectives, made up of members in good standing who may, in compliance with requirements, promote their respective political views within Qu\u00e9bec solidaire.
