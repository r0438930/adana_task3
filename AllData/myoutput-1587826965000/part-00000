It is strong, resilient, and [[Iridescence|iridescent]].\n\nNacre is found in some of the most ancient lineages of [[bivalve]]s, [[gastropod]]s, and [[cephalopod]]s. However, the inner layer in the great majority of mollusc shells is [[Porcelain|porcellaneous]], not nacreous, and this usually results in a non-iridescent shine, or more rarely in non-nacreous iridescence such as ''flame structure'' as is found in [[conch]] pearls.\n\nThe outer layer of cultured pearls and the inside layer of [[pearl oyster]] and [[freshwater pearl mussel]] shells are made of nacre. Other mollusc families that have a nacreous inner shell layer include marine gastropods such as the [[Haliotidae]], the [[Trochidae]] and the [[Turbinidae]].\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n\n=== Structure and appearance===\n{{further|Structural coloration}}\n\n[[File:Nacre microscopic structure.png|thumb|Schematic of the microscopic structure of nacre layers]]\n[[File:Bruchfl\u00e4che eines Perlmuttst\u00fccks.JPG|thumb|Electron microscopy image of a fractured surface of nacre]]\n\nNacre is composed of hexagonal platelets of [[aragonite]] (a form of [[calcium carbonate]]) 10\u201320&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]] wide and 0.5&nbsp;\u00b5m thick arranged in a continuous parallel [[wikt:lamina|lamina]].<ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.jsb.2005.09.009\"/> Depending on the species, the shape of the tablets differ; in ''Pinna'', the tablets are rectangular, with symmetric sectors more or less soluble. Whatever the shape of the tablets, the smallest units they contain are irregular rounded granules.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Biominerals and fossils through time|last=Cuif J.P. Dauphin Y., Sorauf J.E.|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521874731|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=664839176}}</ref> These layers are separated by sheets of organic matrix (interfaces) composed of [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[biopolymers]] (such as [[chitin]], [[Lustrin A|lustrin]] and [[silk]]-like [[protein]]s). This mixture of brittle platelets and the thin layers of elastic biopolymers makes the material strong and resilient, with a [[Young's modulus]] of 70&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]] (when dry).<ref name=Jackson1988 /> Strength and resilience are also likely to be due to adhesion by the \"brickwork\" arrangement of the platelets, which inhibits transverse crack propagation. This structure, at multiple length sizes, greatly increases its [[toughness]], making it almost as strong as [[silicon]]. \n\nThe statistical variation of the platelets has a negative effect on the mechanical performance (stiffness, strength, and energy absorption) because statistical variation precipitates localization of deformation <ref name=Abid2018/>. However, the negative effects of statistical variations can be offset by interfaces with large strain at failure accompanied by strain hardening <ref name=Abid2018/>. On the other hand, the fracture toughness of nacre increases with moderate statistical variations which creates tough regions where the crack gets pinned <ref name=Abid2019/>. But, higher statistical variations generates very weak regions which allows the crack to propagate without much resistance causing the fracture toughness decreases <ref name=Abid2019/>. \n\nNacre appears [[Iridescence|iridescent]] because the thickness of the aragonite platelets is close to the wavelength of visible [[light]]. These structures [[interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] constructively and destructively  with different wavelengths of light at different viewing angles, creating [[Structural coloration|structural colours]].\n\nThe crystallographic ''c-''axis points approximately perpendicular to the shell wall, but the direction of the other axes varies between groups.  Adjacent tablets have been shown to have dramatically different c-axis orientation, generally randomly oriented within ~20\u00b0 of vertical.<ref name='Metzler2007'/><ref name='Olson2012'/>  In bivalves and cephalopods, the ''b-''axis points in the direction of shell growth, whereas in the [[monoplacophora]] it is the ''a''-axis that is this way inclined.<ref name=Checa2009/> The interlocking of bricks of nacre has large impact on both the deformation mechanism as well as its toughness.<ref name=r1/>  In addition, the mineral\u2013organic interface results in enhanced resilience and strength of the organic interlayers.<ref name=r2/><ref name=r3/><ref name=r4/>\n\n===Formation===\nNacre formation is not fully understood. The initial onset assembly, as observed in ''Pinna nobilis'', is driven by the aggregation of nanoparticles (~50\u201380\u2009nm) within an organic matrix that arrange in fibre-like polycrystalline configurations.<ref name='Hovden2015'/> The particle number increases successively and, when critical packing is reached, they merge into early-nacre platelets. Nacre growth is  mediated by organics, controlling the onset, duration and form of crystal growth.<ref name=Jackson2010/> Individual aragonite \"bricks\" are believed to quickly grow to the full height of the nacreous layer, and expand until they abut adjacent bricks.<ref name='Checa2009'/> This produces the hexagonal close-packing characteristic of nacre.<ref name='Checa2009'/> Bricks may nucleate on randomly dispersed elements within the organic layer,<ref name=r5/> well-defined arrangements of proteins,<ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.jsb.2005.09.009\"/> or may grow [[epitaxially]] from mineral bridges extending from the underlying tablet.<ref name='Schaffer1997'/><ref name='Checa2011'/> Nacre differs from fibrous aragonite \u2013 a brittle mineral of the same form \u2013 in that the growth in the c-axis (i.e., approximately perpendicular to the shell, in nacre) is slow in nacre, and fast in fibrous aragonite.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Function===\n[[File:Fossil nautiloid shell with original iridescent nacre in fossiliferous asphaltic limestone.jpg|thumb|Fossil [[nautiloid]] shell with original iridescent nacre in fossiliferous asphaltic limestone, [[Oklahoma]]. Dated to the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|late Middle Pennsylvanian]], which makes it by far the oldest deposit in the world with aragonitic nacreous shelly fossils.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jsjgeology/15054496278/ Buckhorn Lagerst\u00e4tte of Oklahoma] Click on photo for more information.</ref>]]\nNacre is secreted by the [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] of the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle tissue]] of various molluscs. The nacre is continuously deposited onto the inner surface of the shell, the iridescent ''nacreous layer'', commonly known as ''mother of pearl''. The layers of nacre smooth the shell surface and help defend the soft tissues against [[parasite]]s and damaging debris by entombing them in successive layers of nacre, forming either a blister [[pearl]] attached to the interior of the shell, or a free pearl within the mantle tissues. The process is called ''encystation'' and it continues as long as the mollusc lives.\n\n===In different mollusc groups===\n{{further|Mollusc shell#Evolution}}\n\nThe form of nacre varies from group to group. In [[bivalves]], the nacre layer is formed of single crystals in a [[hexagonal close packed|hexagonal close packing]].  In [[gastropods]], crystals are [[twinned crystal|twinned]], and in [[cephalopods]], they are pseudohexagonal monocrystals, which are often twinned.<ref name=Checa2009/>\n\n==Commercial sources==\n\nThe main commercial sources of mother of pearl have been the [[pearl oyster]], [[freshwater pearl]] mussels, and to a lesser extent the [[abalone]], popular for their sturdiness and beauty in the latter half of the 19th century.\n\nWidely used for pearl buttons especially during the 1900s, were the shells of the great green [[turban snail]] ''[[Turbo marmoratus]]'' and the large top snail, ''[[Tectus niloticus]]''. The international trade in mother of pearl is governed by the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]], an agreement signed by more than 170 countries.<ref>Jessica Hodin, [http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/contraband-chic-mother-pearl-items-sell-export-restrictions \"Contraband Chic: Mother-of-Pearl Items Sell With Export Restrictions\"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125044241/http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/contraband-chic-mother-pearl-items-sell-export-restrictions |date=2010-11-25 }} New York Observer, October 20, 2010</ref>\n\n==Decorative uses==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Nacre has been used for centuries for a variety of decorative purposes\" widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Fl\u00fcgelretabel Perlmutt Augsburg um 1520.jpg|[[Altarpiece]], circa 1520, with extensive use of carved nacre.\nFile:Powder flask img 2091.jpg|Nacre [[powder flask|gunpowder flask]], circa 1750, mostly consisting of the polished [[seashell|shell]] of a large sea snail ''[[Turbo marmoratus]]''.\nFile:Istanbul.Topkapi046.jpg|[[Inlay]] with nacre [[tesserae]], Baghdad pavilion, [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], [[Istanbul]].\nFile:Masa per\u0142owa3.jpg|Nacreous shell worked into a decorative object.\nFile:Ile Salomon Pendentif MHNT ETH AC SL 23 Roquemaurel.jpg|Nacre pendant engraved [[Solomon Islands]] 1838\n</gallery>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Mother of pearl ceiling.jpg|thumb|upright|White nacre mosaic tiles in the ceiling of the [[Criterion Restaurant]] in London]]\nBoth black and white nacre are used for [[architectural]] purposes. The natural nacre may be artificially tinted to almost any color. Nacre [[:wikt:tessera|tesserae]] may be cut into shapes and [[lamination|laminated]] to a [[ceramic]] [[tile]] or [[marble]] base.  The tesserae are hand-placed and closely sandwiched together, creating an irregular mosaic or pattern (such as a weave). The laminated material is typically about {{convert|2|mm|in}} thick.  The tesserae are then [[lacquer]]ed and [[polishing|polished]] creating a durable and glossy surface.\n\nInstead of using a marble or tile base, the nacre tesserae can be glued to [[fiberglass]]. The result is a lightweight material that offers a seamless installation and there is no limit to the sheet size. Nacre sheets may be used on interior floors, exterior and interior walls, countertops, doors and ceilings. Insertion into architectural elements, such as columns or furniture is easily accomplished.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Fashion===\n[[File:Nacre sticks.JPG|thumb|Nacre bracelet]]\n\nMother of pearl [[button]]s are used in clothing either for functional or decorative purposes. The [[Pearly Kings and Queens]] are an elaborate example of this.\n\nNacre is also used to decorate watches, knives, guns and jewellery.\n\n===Musical instruments===\n\nNacre inlay is often used for music [[Key (instrument)|keys]] and other decorative motifs on musical instruments. Many [[accordion]] and [[concertina]] bodies are completely covered in nacre, and some [[guitar]]s have fingerboard or headstock inlays made of nacre (as well as some guitars having plastic inlays designed to imitate the appearance of nacre). The [[bouzouki]] and [[baglamas]] (Greek plucked string instruments of the [[lute]] family) typically feature nacre decorations, as does the related Middle Eastern [[oud]] (typically around the [[sound hole]]s and on the back of the instrument). [[bow (music)|Bows]] of stringed instruments such as the [[violin]] and [[cello]] often have mother of pearl inlay at the frog. It is traditionally used on [[saxophone]] keytouches, as well as the valve buttons of [[trumpets]] and other brass instruments. The Middle Eastern [[goblet drum]] (darbuka) is commonly decorated by mother of pearl.\n\n===Other===\nMother of pearl is sometimes used to make [[spoon]]-like utensils for [[caviar]], so as to not spoil the taste with metallic spoons.\n\n== Manufactured nacre ==\n\nIn 2012, researchers created calcium-based nacre in the laboratory by mimicking its natural growth process.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1970?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news |title=Artificial mother of pearl follows nature's recipe|work=New Scientist|date=24 July 2012|last=Aron|first=Jacob}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, researchers used lasers to create an analogue of nacre by engraving networks of wavy 3D \"micro-cracks\" in glass. When the slides were subjected to an impact, the micro-cracks absorbed and dispersed the energy, keeping the glass from shattering. Altogether, treated glass was reportedly 200 times tougher than untreated glass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/mollusk-nacre-tougher-glass/30654 |title=Super-tough glass based on mollusk shells |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ammolite]]\n* [[Mollusc shell]]\n* [[Pearl]]\n* [[Raden]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=Jackson2010>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/molbev/msp278|title=Parallel Evolution of Nacre Building Gene Sets in Molluscs|year=2009|last1=Jackson|first1=D.

Other mollusc families that have a nacreous inner shell layer include marine gastropods such as the [[Haliotidae]], the [[Trochidae]] and the [[Turbinidae]].\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n\n=== Structure and appearance===\n{{further|Structural coloration}}\n\n[[File:Nacre microscopic structure.png|thumb|Schematic of the microscopic structure of nacre layers]]\n[[File:Bruchfl\u00e4che eines Perlmuttst\u00fccks.JPG|thumb|Electron microscopy image of a fractured surface of nacre]]\n\nNacre is composed of hexagonal platelets of [[aragonite]] (a form of [[calcium carbonate]]) 10\u201320&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]] wide and 0.5&nbsp;\u00b5m thick arranged in a continuous parallel [[wikt:lamina|lamina]].<ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.jsb.2005.09.009\"/> Depending on the species, the shape of the tablets differ; in ''Pinna'', the tablets are rectangular, with symmetric sectors more or less soluble. Whatever the shape of the tablets, the smallest units they contain are irregular rounded granules.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Biominerals and fossils through time|last=Cuif J.P. Dauphin Y., Sorauf J.E.|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521874731|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=664839176}}</ref> These layers are separated by sheets of organic matrix (interfaces) composed of [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[biopolymers]] (such as [[chitin]], [[Lustrin A|lustrin]] and [[silk]]-like [[protein]]s). This mixture of brittle platelets and the thin layers of elastic biopolymers makes the material strong and resilient, with a [[Young's modulus]] of 70&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]] (when dry).<ref name=Jackson1988 /> Strength and resilience are also likely to be due to adhesion by the \"brickwork\" arrangement of the platelets, which inhibits transverse crack propagation. This structure, at multiple length sizes, greatly increases its [[toughness]], making it almost as strong as [[silicon]]. \n\nThe statistical variation of the platelets has a negative effect on the mechanical performance (stiffness, strength, and energy absorption) because statistical variation precipitates localization of deformation <ref name=Abid2018/>. However, the negative effects of statistical variations can be offset by interfaces with large strain at failure accompanied by strain hardening <ref name=Abid2018/>. On the other hand, the fracture toughness of nacre increases with moderate statistical variations which creates tough regions where the crack gets pinned <ref name=Abid2019/>. But, higher statistical variations generates very weak regions which allows the crack to propagate without much resistance causing the fracture toughness decreases <ref name=Abid2019/>. \n\nNacre appears [[Iridescence|iridescent]] because the thickness of the aragonite platelets is close to the wavelength of visible [[light]]. These structures [[interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] constructively and destructively  with different wavelengths of light at different viewing angles, creating [[Structural coloration|structural colours]].\n\nThe crystallographic ''c-''axis points approximately perpendicular to the shell wall, but the direction of the other axes varies between groups.  Adjacent tablets have been shown to have dramatically different c-axis orientation, generally randomly oriented within ~20\u00b0 of vertical.<ref name='Metzler2007'/><ref name='Olson2012'/>  In bivalves and cephalopods, the ''b-''axis points in the direction of shell growth, whereas in the [[monoplacophora]] it is the ''a''-axis that is this way inclined.<ref name=Checa2009/> The interlocking of bricks of nacre has large impact on both the deformation mechanism as well as its toughness.<ref name=r1/>  In addition, the mineral\u2013organic interface results in enhanced resilience and strength of the organic interlayers.<ref name=r2/><ref name=r3/><ref name=r4/>\n\n===Formation===\nNacre formation is not fully understood. The initial onset assembly, as observed in ''Pinna nobilis'', is driven by the aggregation of nanoparticles (~50\u201380\u2009nm) within an organic matrix that arrange in fibre-like polycrystalline configurations.<ref name='Hovden2015'/> The particle number increases successively and, when critical packing is reached, they merge into early-nacre platelets. Nacre growth is  mediated by organics, controlling the onset, duration and form of crystal growth.<ref name=Jackson2010/> Individual aragonite \"bricks\" are believed to quickly grow to the full height of the nacreous layer, and expand until they abut adjacent bricks.<ref name='Checa2009'/> This produces the hexagonal close-packing characteristic of nacre.<ref name='Checa2009'/> Bricks may nucleate on randomly dispersed elements within the organic layer,<ref name=r5/> well-defined arrangements of proteins,<ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.jsb.2005.09.009\"/> or may grow [[epitaxially]] from mineral bridges extending from the underlying tablet.<ref name='Schaffer1997'/><ref name='Checa2011'/> Nacre differs from fibrous aragonite \u2013 a brittle mineral of the same form \u2013 in that the growth in the c-axis (i.e., approximately perpendicular to the shell, in nacre) is slow in nacre, and fast in fibrous aragonite.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Function===\n[[File:Fossil nautiloid shell with original iridescent nacre in fossiliferous asphaltic limestone.jpg|thumb|Fossil [[nautiloid]] shell with original iridescent nacre in fossiliferous asphaltic limestone, [[Oklahoma]]. Dated to the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|late Middle Pennsylvanian]], which makes it by far the oldest deposit in the world with aragonitic nacreous shelly fossils.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jsjgeology/15054496278/ Buckhorn Lagerst\u00e4tte of Oklahoma] Click on photo for more information.</ref>]]\nNacre is secreted by the [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] of the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle tissue]] of various molluscs. The nacre is continuously deposited onto the inner surface of the shell, the iridescent ''nacreous layer'', commonly known as ''mother of pearl''. The layers of nacre smooth the shell surface and help defend the soft tissues against [[parasite]]s and damaging debris by entombing them in successive layers of nacre, forming either a blister [[pearl]] attached to the interior of the shell, or a free pearl within the mantle tissues. The process is called ''encystation'' and it continues as long as the mollusc lives.\n\n===In different mollusc groups===\n{{further|Mollusc shell#Evolution}}\n\nThe form of nacre varies from group to group. In [[bivalves]], the nacre layer is formed of single crystals in a [[hexagonal close packed|hexagonal close packing]].  In [[gastropods]], crystals are [[twinned crystal|twinned]], and in [[cephalopods]], they are pseudohexagonal monocrystals, which are often twinned.<ref name=Checa2009/>\n\n==Commercial sources==\n\nThe main commercial sources of mother of pearl have been the [[pearl oyster]], [[freshwater pearl]] mussels, and to a lesser extent the [[abalone]], popular for their sturdiness and beauty in the latter half of the 19th century.\n\nWidely used for pearl buttons especially during the 1900s, were the shells of the great green [[turban snail]] ''[[Turbo marmoratus]]'' and the large top snail, ''[[Tectus niloticus]]''. The international trade in mother of pearl is governed by the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]], an agreement signed by more than 170 countries.<ref>Jessica Hodin, [http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/contraband-chic-mother-pearl-items-sell-export-restrictions \"Contraband Chic: Mother-of-Pearl Items Sell With Export Restrictions\"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125044241/http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/contraband-chic-mother-pearl-items-sell-export-restrictions |date=2010-11-25 }} New York Observer, October 20, 2010</ref>\n\n==Decorative uses==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Nacre has been used for centuries for a variety of decorative purposes\" widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Fl\u00fcgelretabel Perlmutt Augsburg um 1520.jpg|[[Altarpiece]], circa 1520, with extensive use of carved nacre.\nFile:Powder flask img 2091.jpg|Nacre [[powder flask|gunpowder flask]], circa 1750, mostly consisting of the polished [[seashell|shell]] of a large sea snail ''[[Turbo marmoratus]]''.\nFile:Istanbul.Topkapi046.jpg|[[Inlay]] with nacre [[tesserae]], Baghdad pavilion, [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], [[Istanbul]].\nFile:Masa per\u0142owa3.jpg|Nacreous shell worked into a decorative object.\nFile:Ile Salomon Pendentif MHNT ETH AC SL 23 Roquemaurel.jpg|Nacre pendant engraved [[Solomon Islands]] 1838\n</gallery>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Mother of pearl ceiling.jpg|thumb|upright|White nacre mosaic tiles in the ceiling of the [[Criterion Restaurant]] in London]]\nBoth black and white nacre are used for [[architectural]] purposes. The natural nacre may be artificially tinted to almost any color. Nacre [[:wikt:tessera|tesserae]] may be cut into shapes and [[lamination|laminated]] to a [[ceramic]] [[tile]] or [[marble]] base.  The tesserae are hand-placed and closely sandwiched together, creating an irregular mosaic or pattern (such as a weave). The laminated material is typically about {{convert|2|mm|in}} thick.  The tesserae are then [[lacquer]]ed and [[polishing|polished]] creating a durable and glossy surface.\n\nInstead of using a marble or tile base, the nacre tesserae can be glued to [[fiberglass]]. The result is a lightweight material that offers a seamless installation and there is no limit to the sheet size. Nacre sheets may be used on interior floors, exterior and interior walls, countertops, doors and ceilings. Insertion into architectural elements, such as columns or furniture is easily accomplished.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Fashion===\n[[File:Nacre sticks.JPG|thumb|Nacre bracelet]]\n\nMother of pearl [[button]]s are used in clothing either for functional or decorative purposes. The [[Pearly Kings and Queens]] are an elaborate example of this.\n\nNacre is also used to decorate watches, knives, guns and jewellery.\n\n===Musical instruments===\n\nNacre inlay is often used for music [[Key (instrument)|keys]] and other decorative motifs on musical instruments. Many [[accordion]] and [[concertina]] bodies are completely covered in nacre, and some [[guitar]]s have fingerboard or headstock inlays made of nacre (as well as some guitars having plastic inlays designed to imitate the appearance of nacre). The [[bouzouki]] and [[baglamas]] (Greek plucked string instruments of the [[lute]] family) typically feature nacre decorations, as does the related Middle Eastern [[oud]] (typically around the [[sound hole]]s and on the back of the instrument). [[bow (music)|Bows]] of stringed instruments such as the [[violin]] and [[cello]] often have mother of pearl inlay at the frog. It is traditionally used on [[saxophone]] keytouches, as well as the valve buttons of [[trumpets]] and other brass instruments. The Middle Eastern [[goblet drum]] (darbuka) is commonly decorated by mother of pearl.\n\n===Other===\nMother of pearl is sometimes used to make [[spoon]]-like utensils for [[caviar]], so as to not spoil the taste with metallic spoons.\n\n== Manufactured nacre ==\n\nIn 2012, researchers created calcium-based nacre in the laboratory by mimicking its natural growth process.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1970?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news |title=Artificial mother of pearl follows nature's recipe|work=New Scientist|date=24 July 2012|last=Aron|first=Jacob}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, researchers used lasers to create an analogue of nacre by engraving networks of wavy 3D \"micro-cracks\" in glass. When the slides were subjected to an impact, the micro-cracks absorbed and dispersed the energy, keeping the glass from shattering. Altogether, treated glass was reportedly 200 times tougher than untreated glass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/mollusk-nacre-tougher-glass/30654 |title=Super-tough glass based on mollusk shells |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ammolite]]\n* [[Mollusc shell]]\n* [[Pearl]]\n* [[Raden]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=Jackson2010>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/molbev/msp278|title=Parallel Evolution of Nacre Building Gene Sets in Molluscs|year=2009|last1=Jackson|first1=D.
