It works on the principle of  impact and  attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.\n\nA ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.  The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal.  It is partially filled with balls.  The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel ([[chrome steel]]), stainless steel, ceramic or rubber.  The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as [[Mangalloy|manganese steel]] or [http://sakarrubtech.com/mill-lining.php rubber lining].

Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including [[ceramic]] balls, [[flint]] pebbles and [[stainless steel]] balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder. Industrial ball mills can operate continuously, fed at one end and discharged at the other end. Large to medium-sized ball mills are mechanically rotated on their axis, but small ones normally consist of a cylindrical capped container that sits on two drive shafts ([[pulleys]] and belts are used to transmit rotary motion). A [[rock tumbler]] functions on the same principle.  Ball mills are also used in [[pyrotechnics]] and the manufacture of [[black powder]], but cannot be used in the preparation of some pyrotechnic mixtures such as [[flash powder]] because of their sensitivity to impact. High-quality ball mills are potentially expensive and can grind mixture particles to as small as 5 [[Nanometre|nm]], enormously increasing surface area and reaction rates. \n\nThe grinding works on the principle of critical speed.  Critical speed can be understood as that speed after which the steel balls (which are responsible for the grinding of particles) start rotating along the direction of the cylindrical device; thus causing no further grinding.\n\nBall mills are used extensively in the [[mechanical alloying]] process<ref>\n{{cite journal|author=Florez-Zamora, M.

The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry. There are two kinds of ball mill, grate type and overfall type due to different ways of discharging material.  Many types of grinding media are suitable for use in a ball mill, each material having its own specific properties and advantages.  Key properties of grinding media are size, density, hardness, and composition.\n* Size: The smaller the media particles, the smaller the particle size of the final product.  At the same time, the grinding media particles should be substantially larger than the largest pieces of material to be ground.\n* Density: The media should be denser than the material being ground.  It becomes a problem if the grinding media floats on top of the material to be ground.\n* Hardness: The grinding media needs to be durable enough to grind the material, but where possible should not be so tough that it also wears down the tumbler at a fast pace.\n* Composition: Various grinding applications have special requirements.  Some of these requirements are based on the fact that some of the grinding media will be in the finished product.  Others are based in how the media will react with the material being ground.\n* Where the color of the finished product is important, the color and material of the grinding media must be considered.\n* Where low contamination is important, the grinding media may be selected for ease of separation from the finished product (i.e.: steel dust produced from stainless steel media can be magnetically separated from non-ferrous products).  An alternative to separation is to use media of the same material as the product being ground.\n* Flammable products have a tendency to become [[dust explosion|explosive in powder form]].  Steel media may spark, becoming an ignition source for these products.  Either wet-grinding, or non-sparking media such as [[ceramic]] or [[lead]] must be selected.\n* Some media, such as iron, may react with corrosive materials.  For this reason, [[stainless steel]], ceramic, and [[flint]] grinding media may each be used when corrosive substances are present during grinding.\n\nThe grinding chamber can also be filled with an inert [[shield gas]] that does not react with the material being ground, to prevent oxidation or explosive reactions that could occur with ambient air inside the mill.\n\n==Advantages of the ball mill==\n[[File:Ceramic ball mill before 1945 Thiem and Towe Halle.jpg|thumb|Ceramic ball mill before 1945 [[Thiem&Towe]] [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. Property of Faculty of Chemistry, Gda\u0144sk University of Technology]]\nBall milling boasts several advantages over other systems: the cost of installation and grinding medium is low; it is suitable for both batch and continuous operation, similarly it is suitable for open as well as closed circuit grinding and is applicable for materials of all degrees of hardness.\n\n== Varieties ==\nAside from common ball mills there is a second type of ball mill called a ''planetary ball mill''. Planetary ball mills are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A planetary ball mill consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1).\nThe grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the planetary ball mill.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cement mill]]\n*[[Vertical roller mill]]\n*[[Tumble finishing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{commons category|Ball mills}}\n\n{{Extractive metallurgy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ball Mill}}\n[[Category:Grinding mills]]\n[[Category:Mining equipment]]\n", "text_old": "{{For2|the type of end mill|[[Milling cutter#Ball nose cutter|Ball nose cutter]]}}\n\n[[Image:Ball mill.gif|thumb|Ball mill]]\nA '''ball mill''' is a type of [[grinder (milling)|grinder]] used to grind, blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and [[selective laser sintering]].
