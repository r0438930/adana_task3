H.A.B. Shapiro died in 1952; there were 25 students enrolled at that time, and his widow, who had increasingly administered the school as her husband's health declined, then ran the school until 1971, continuing as president emeritus until 1986.<ref>Cote, Joe, [https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/2018/09/gertrude-shapiro \"The Leadership and Legacy of Gertrude Shapiro\"]. Southern New Hampshire University, September 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the school was incorporated and renamed the '''New Hampshire College of Accounting and Commerce'''. The state of [[New Hampshire]] granted the college its charter in 1963, which gave it degree-granting authority. The first [[associate degree]]s were awarded that year, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were conferred in 1966. The college became a [[nonprofit institution]] under a [[board of trustees]] in September 1968, and its name was shortened to '''New Hampshire College''' in 1969.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe 1970s were a time of growth and change. The college moved from its downtown Manchester site to the now {{convert|300|acre|adj=on}} campus along the [[Merrimack River]], at the northern border of Manchester with the town of [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]], in 1971. Academic offerings expanded with the introduction of a [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1974,<ref name=\"history\"/> as well as when [[human services]] programs were adopted from [[Franconia College]], which closed in 1978.<ref name=\"lessard\">{{cite web| url=http://www.hippopress.com/read-article/college-satellite-closes-in-manchester |title=College satellite closes in Manchester|publisher=[[Hippo Press|The Hippo]]|date=February 23, 2017|last=Lessard|first=Ryan|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, New Hampshire College received authorization from the [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire legislature]] to offer [[Master of Science]] degrees in business-related subjects, as well as Master of Human Services degrees. (All human services programs would be transferred to [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in Massachusetts by the end of the decade.)<ref name=\"lessard\"/> That same year, the college opened its North Campus on the site of the former [[Mount Saint Mary College (New Hampshire)|Mount Saint Mary College]], which had shut down three years earlier. The North Campus became the home of the [[culinary arts]] program, which was established in 1983.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nUltimately, the North Campus was sold,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| title=Hooksett's Mount Saint Mary's to be Converted to Condos| publisher=Brady Sullivan| accessdate=July 18, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804122255/http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| archivedate=August 4, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> and its academic programs were consolidated back to the main campus. This spurred several major construction projects on the main campus in the mid-1990s: Washington Hall, a [[dormitory|residence hall]]; Webster Hall, home to the School of Business; the Hospitality Center, home of the Quill (a student-run [[restaurant]]) and culinary arts programs; and Belknap Hall, now home to the Institute for Language Education, the School of Education, and several university offices. In 1995, New Hampshire College began offering [[distance learning]] programs through the [[Internet]]. In 1998, academic degrees were expanded to include a [[Ph.D.]] in [[community economic development]] and the [[Doctor of Business Administration]].<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nNew Hampshire College became '''Southern New Hampshire University''' on July 1, 2001.

LeBlanc addressed this in 2009 with an increased focus on the College of Online and Continuing Education. Rapid revenue growth from the division helped save the struggling main campus where enrollment had slumped.

H.A.B. Shapiro died in 1952; there were 25 students enrolled at that time, and his widow, who had increasingly administered the school as her husband's health declined, then ran the school until 1971, continuing as president emeritus until 1986.<ref>Cote, Joe, [https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/2018/09/gertrude-shapiro \"The Leadership and Legacy of Gertrude Shapiro\"]. Southern New Hampshire University, September 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the school was incorporated and renamed the '''New Hampshire College of Accounting and Commerce'''. The state of [[New Hampshire]] granted the college its charter in 1963, which gave it degree-granting authority. The first [[associate degree]]s were awarded that year, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were conferred in 1966. The college became a [[nonprofit institution]] under a [[board of trustees]] in September 1968, and its name was shortened to '''New Hampshire College''' in 1969.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe 1970s were a time of growth and change. The college moved from its downtown Manchester site to the now {{convert|300|acre|adj=on}} campus along the [[Merrimack River]], at the northern border of Manchester with the town of [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]], in 1971. Academic offerings expanded with the introduction of a [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1974,<ref name=\"history\"/> as well as when [[human services]] programs were adopted from [[Franconia College]], which closed in 1978.<ref name=\"lessard\">{{cite web| url=http://www.hippopress.com/read-article/college-satellite-closes-in-manchester |title=College satellite closes in Manchester|publisher=[[Hippo Press|The Hippo]]|date=February 23, 2017|last=Lessard|first=Ryan|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, New Hampshire College received authorization from the [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire legislature]] to offer [[Master of Science]] degrees in business-related subjects, as well as Master of Human Services degrees. (All human services programs would be transferred to [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in Massachusetts by the end of the decade.)<ref name=\"lessard\"/> That same year, the college opened its North Campus on the site of the former [[Mount Saint Mary College (New Hampshire)|Mount Saint Mary College]], which had shut down three years earlier. The North Campus became the home of the [[culinary arts]] program, which was established in 1983.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nUltimately, the North Campus was sold,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| title=Hooksett's Mount Saint Mary's to be Converted to Condos| publisher=Brady Sullivan| accessdate=July 18, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804122255/http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| archivedate=August 4, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> and its academic programs were consolidated back to the main campus. This spurred several major construction projects on the main campus in the mid-1990s: Washington Hall, a [[dormitory|residence hall]]; Webster Hall, home to the School of Business; the Hospitality Center, home of the Quill (a student-run [[restaurant]]) and culinary arts programs; and Belknap Hall, now home to the Institute for Language Education, the School of Education, and several university offices. In 1995, New Hampshire College began offering [[distance learning]] programs through the [[Internet]]. In 1998, academic degrees were expanded to include a [[Ph.D.]] in [[community economic development]] and the [[Doctor of Business Administration]].<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nNew Hampshire College became '''Southern New Hampshire University''' on July 1, 2001.

LeBlanc addressed this in 2009 with an increased focus on the College of Online and Continuing Education. Rapid revenue growth from the division helped save the struggling main campus where enrollment had slumped.
