The group established a Board of Management (which included the founding board and citizens and a couple of city councillors). [[Bruce Kuwabara|Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects]] was commissioned to renovate and enlarge the non-heritage-designated spaces (exhibition spaces, administrative office space, the resource centre and meeting rooms).\n\nThe same year the Group for the Creation of a Design Centre in Toronto began a capital campaign drive aimed at raising funds from the private and public sectors. In 1993, after years of lobbying, the federal and provincial governments confirmed funding for capital expenses in the sum of $6.3 million. In 1994, The Group became the sub-tenant with a long-term lease until 2091. On September 21, 1994, the Design Exchange was officially opened by Prime Minister, The Right Honourable [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]].  Howard Cohen, now of Context Development, was named the first President.\n\nIn 1996 the Design Exchange set a mandate for its Permanent Collection: to collect the best Canadian materials designed since 1945. As of 2016, the DX Permanent Collection contained approximately 600 items, however, the collection was deaccessioned in 2019.  Design Exchange has mounted more than 400 exhibitions, organized hundreds of seminars, lectures, international conferences and educational programs and publications related to the role of design in culture, industry, and business.\n\nFrom 2003-2011, under the leadership of President and CEO Samantha Sannella, the Design Exchange focused on promoting the value of Canadian design and its contribution to the economy, environment and quality of life. During this time, the DX hosted numerous domestic and international exhibitions and created hundreds of programs with the goal to educate the public.  This included the creation of Design Camps and an extensive curriculum was developed targeting children 18 and under - with a special outreach program entitled, Designers in the Classroom.  Numerous annual design competitions for high school students and university students were created that awarded scholarships nationally for design excellence.  Additionally, workshops, lectures and classes for adults were held monthly.  Notable exhibits included:  Costume Design from the Academy Awards, Canadian Architecture curated by Chris Hume, Japan 100 Design, Milano: Italian Design curated by Studio Zuccaro, Design for the Other 90%, New Materials in Design, Carrot City and Tokyo Doll. Industry events included the annual the Design Exchange awards. This was a national design competition open to professional designers across Canada. The awards promoted Canadian design excellence and recognize the critical role of design in business. The Awards celebrated the success stories achieved through close partnerships between clients and designers. Projects were recognized for balancing function, aesthetics, and economic success. During this period, all major design disciplines were emphasized:  Architecture, Interior Design, Fashion, Industrial Design and Graphic Design and the DX published many books across these themes including:  Ourtopias, a collection of essays about cities and their role in design, edited by Paola Poletto and Phillip Beasley and The Art of Clairtone, by Nina Munk and Rachel Gotleib, a compelling story about Peter Munk's Canadian stereo company. As part of an export initiative, The DX organized numerous programs that helped entrepreneurial Canadian Designers showcase their products in foreign markets including the UK, Hong Kong and Mexico. Moreover, the DX annual fundraising gala was created, which was named one of the top 10 fundraising galas in Toronto.\n\n[[File:Design Exchange June 2012.jpg|thumb|A gift shop at the Design Exchange, June 2012.
