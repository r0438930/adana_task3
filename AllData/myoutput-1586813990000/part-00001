There were 127 of this type of vehicle and they were delivered new in 1959 to Southall depot working services between Paddington and the suburbs. They continued to be based in the London area until withdrawal in the 1990s, they arrived at the Railway in 2004. Each coach has two [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] [[diesel engine]]s underneath, which drive the wheels mechanically through a [[fluid flywheel]]. The driver's cab at each end of the unit means it can be driven from either end, making it ideal when running to [[Coopersale]], and speeding up turn-around times. The windows in the ends mean passengers in either coach get an excellent view of the line ahead or behind and also get to watch the driver in action. The unit ran in an unusual dark blue and white 'EOR' livery until 2007, when it was taken out of service by the new owner when services were suspended. The interior has been refurbished, the unit is receiving attention to the exterior bodywork.

The volunteer team at EOR has restored the unit, complete with its commuter-style interior and is now painted in former \"Network SouthEast\" livery. This ensures the preservation of this period of transport history and is attractive to film and TV companies who require a train of that era. It arrived at the Epping Ongar Railway in 2009.

There was talk of the line being electrified by the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] with overhead electrification before the [[Second World War]] intervened. Some local lines were electrified quite early on, for example to Shenfield and Southend, and the next generations of EMUs continue to work services on those lines into Liverpool Street.\n\nWhile the 3rd & 4th conductor rails were removed by the new owners, the line still hosts electric style units, though without the electrification they are hauled by a [[diesel locomotive]]. Due to cost, safety issues and legislation it is not possible to re-electrify the branch.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Origin\n! Number\n! Class\n! Notes\n!

The Buffet was moved again in 2001 to the workshops at Ovington and where the coach finally received covered accommodation.

Photograph\n!\n|-\n| [[British Rail]]\n| Unit 60110 and 60810 Set No 205205\n| [[British Rail Class 205|Class 205]]\n| The railway has a 2-car 1957 \"Hampshire\" [[British Rail Class 205|Class 205 DEMU]] 205205. It has been brought back to the South East from the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]], and has been restored and again carries passengers. It is the usual motive power for the trains towards Epping. 205205 is the only unit with a corridor connection as it was experimentally converted and modernised by British Rail. The volunteer team at EOR has restored the unit, complete with its commuter-style interior and is now painted in former \"Network SouthEast\" livery. This ensures the preservation of this period of transport history and is attractive to film and TV companies who require a train of that era. It arrived at the Epping Ongar Railway in 2009. It is Out of Traffic - available as coaching stock.<ref>http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/mus/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n| [[File:Ongar railway station MMB 04 205205.jpg|150px]]\n| In Traffic\n|}\n\n==EMUs ==\nEpping Ongar Railway has an affinity with [[electric multiple unit]] (EMU) preservation, as the branch used [[London Underground rolling stock|LT's electric stock]] from 1957 until 1994. There was talk of the line being electrified by the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] with overhead electrification before the [[Second World War]] intervened. Some local lines were electrified quite early on, for example to Shenfield and Southend, and the next generations of EMUs continue to work services on those lines into Liverpool Street.\n\nWhile the 3rd & 4th conductor rails were removed by the new owners, the line still hosts electric style units, though without the electrification they are hauled by a [[diesel locomotive]]. Due to cost, safety issues and legislation it is not possible to re-electrify the branch.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Origin\n! Number\n! Class\n! Notes\n!

Finalised in 1923, the design utilised a 60&nbsp;ft underframe, with more traditional squared moulding and windows and wooden teak-panelled bodies.

After a short stay a Quainton Road, where it was used to serve refreshments, the carriage was then moved to Chappel and Wakes Colne in 1972. Restoration had, by this stage, been commenced, but was stalled as priority was given to a BTO (which later moved to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.) The Buffet was moved again in 2001 to the workshops at Ovington and where the coach finally received covered accommodation. The owner decided in 2010, that carriage would fit in well here, and after needing to vacate the site at Ovington, the ownership of carriage was transferred to Epping Ongar Railway Holdings Limited, on the understanding that, in due course, it would be restored to its former glory. The carriage arrived at North Weald in 2010.
