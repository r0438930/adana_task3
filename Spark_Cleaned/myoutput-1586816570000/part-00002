The orchestra provides these players with a comprehensive string ensemble experience.

The students learn how to successfully navigate difficult passages on their instrument and learn how to listen for orchestral intonation.\n\n==='''Philharmonic Orchestra'''===\n\nThe Philharmonic Orchestra, which is designed to be a full symphony [[orchestra| ]], is placed at the advanced intermediate playing level. The literature is a combination of arranged and unedited works designed to expose students to a symphony orchestra experience.
