'''Bad Honnef''' is a [[spa town]] in [[Germany]] near [[Bonn]] in the [[Rhein-Sieg]] district, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. It is located on the border of the neighbouring state [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. To the north it lies on the slopes of the [[Drachenfels (Siebengebirge)|Drachenfels]] (“Dragon's Rock”) mountain, part of the [[Siebengebirge]].
[[File:Honnef-010.JPG|thumb|Honnef, Aerial view]]

==Overview==
Bad Honnef is home to a mineral spring called the {{lang|de|Drachenquelle}} (\"Dragon Spring\") which was discovered in 1897.  This discovery led to Honnef, as the town was called at the time, transforming from a [[German wine|wine]]-growing town to a spa town, adding the prefix Bad to its name.  The mineral spring has been used for both drinking and bathing.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Honnef|volume=13|page=659}}</ref>

The villages of [[Aegidienberg]], Selhof and Rhöndorf are considered to be part of Bad Honnef. During his term as first chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (then West Germany), [[Konrad Adenauer]] lived (and died) in Bad Honnef, as it was near Bonn, then the capital the republic. Also, German politician and leader of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] [[Guido Westerwelle]] was born in Bad Honnef.

Since the 1980s Bad Honnef has developed into an important place for conferences in Germany. Because of the close proximity to the still internationally important Federal City of Bonn, many federal institutions are located in Bad Honnef.

The head office of the Nationalpark Siebengebirge project was also planned to be in Bad Honnef;<ref>[http://www.naturschutz-fachinformationssysteme-nrw.de/7-gebirge/content/de/start.html?jid=0o0 Informationssystem zum geplanten 'Bürgernationalpark Siebengebirge'<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304055421/http://www.naturschutz-fachinformationssysteme-nrw.de/7-gebirge/content/de/start.html?jid=0o0 |date=2008-03-04 }}</ref> however the project was rejected in a referendum on September 27, 2009.<ref>http://www.bad-honnef.de/service/rathaus/wahlen/index.php?status=story&typ=4&id=3600</ref>

Bad Honnef has the highest purchasing power of all towns in North Rhine-Westphalia; its percentage of millionaires is also one of the highest.<ref>[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=news&itemid=10002&detailid=255769 Bad Honnefer haben das meiste Geld (16.12.2006) | Wirtschaft | Lokales | News | General-Anzeiger Online - Bonn<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

'''Bad Honnef''' is a [[spa town]] in [[Germany]] near [[Bonn]] in the [[Rhein-Sieg]] district, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. It is located on the border of the neighbouring state [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. To the north it lies on the slopes of the [[Drachenfels (Siebengebirge)|Drachenfels]] (“Dragon's Rock”) mountain, part of the [[Siebengebirge]].

==Overview==
Bad Honnef is home to a mineral spring called the {{lang|de|Drachenquelle}} (\"Dragon Spring\") which was discovered in 1897.  This discovery led to Honnef, as the town was called at the time, transforming from a [[German wine|wine]]-growing town to a spa town, adding the prefix Bad to its name.  The mineral spring has been used for both drinking and bathing.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Honnef|volume=13|page=659}}</ref>

The villages of [[Aegidienberg]], Selhof and Rhöndorf are considered to be part of Bad Honnef. During his term as first chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (then West Germany), [[Konrad Adenauer]] lived (and died) in Bad Honnef, as it was near Bonn, then the capital the republic. Also, German politician and leader of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] [[Guido Westerwelle]] was born in Bad Honnef.

Since the 1980s Bad Honnef has developed into an important place for conferences in Germany. Because of the close proximity to the still internationally important Federal City of Bonn, many federal institutions are located in Bad Honnef.

The head office of the Nationalpark Siebengebirge project was also planned to be in Bad Honnef;<ref>[http://www.naturschutz-fachinformationssysteme-nrw.de/7-gebirge/content/de/start.html?jid=0o0 Informationssystem zum geplanten 'Bürgernationalpark Siebengebirge'<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304055421/http://www.naturschutz-fachinformationssysteme-nrw.de/7-gebirge/content/de/start.html?jid=0o0 |date=2008-03-04 }}</ref> however the project was rejected in a referendum on September 27, 2009.<ref>http://www.bad-honnef.de/service/rathaus/wahlen/index.php?status=story&typ=4&id=3600</ref>

Bad Honnef has the highest purchasing power of all towns in North Rhine-Westphalia; its percentage of millionaires is also one of the highest.<ref>[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=news&itemid=10002&detailid=255769 Bad Honnefer haben das meiste Geld (16.12.2006) | Wirtschaft | Lokales | News | General-Anzeiger Online - Bonn<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Each of the voices sings a version of the source plainchant, elaborated or \"paraphrased\".|300px]]
A '''paraphrase mass''' is a musical setting of the [[Ordinary of the Mass|Ordinary]] of the [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that uses as its basis an elaborated version of a [[cantus firmus]], typically chosen from [[plainsong]] or some other sacred source.  It was a common means of mass composition from the late 15th century until the end of the 16th century, during the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period in music history, and was most frequently used by composers in the parts of western Europe which remained under the direct control of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  It is distinguished from the other types of mass composition, including [[cyclic mass]], [[parody mass|parody]], [[canon (music)|canon]], [[soggetto cavato]], free composition, and mixtures of these techniques.

==History==

Musical paraphrase, in general, had been used for a long time before it was first applied to the music of the Ordinary of the Mass.  It was common in the early and middle 15th century for a work such as a [[motet]] to use an embellished plainchant melody as its source, with the melody usually in the topmost voice.  [[John Dunstable]]'s ''Gloria'' is an example of this procedure, as are the two settings by [[Guillaume Dufay]] of the [[Marian Antiphon]] ''Alma redemptoris mater.''  Many compositions in [[fauxbourdon]], a characteristic technique of the [[Burgundian School]], use a paraphrased version of a plainchant tune in the highest voice.  In these cases the source would not be obscured by the paraphrase; it was still easily recognizable through whatever ornamentation was applied.<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 608.</ref>

Dufay was probably one of the first to use paraphrase technique in the mass. His ''Missa Ave regina celorum'' (written between 1463 and 1474) is similar to a cantus firmus mass in that the tune is in the tenor, however it is paraphrased by elaboration (and he also includes bits of his own motet on that antiphon, foreshadowing the [[parody mass|parody]] technique).  By the 1470s or 1480s, the first masses appear that use paraphrase in more than one voice:  two examples survive by [[Johannes Martini]], the ''Missa domenicalis'' and the ''Missa ferialis''.<ref>Burkholder, Grove</ref>

By the beginning of the 16th century, it was becoming more common to use the paraphrased tune in all voices of a polyphonic texture.  The most famous example from the early 16th century, and one of the most famous paraphrase masses ever composed, was the ''[[Missa pange lingua]]'' by [[Josquin des Prez]], which is an extended fantasia on the ''[[Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium|Pange Lingua]]'' hymn for Corpus Christi by [[Thomas Aquinas]].  This mass was probably composed near the end of Josquin's life, around 1520.  In the ''Missa pange lingua'', all voices carry variants of the hymn, with the beginnings of successive phrases marking points of imitation in the mass.  All voices are given equal weight, and the score achieves a motivic unity which was a significant change from previous practice.<ref>Planchart: Sherr, p. 130-150.</ref>

Another composer of Josquin's generation who was important in the development of the paraphrase mass was [[Pierre de La Rue]].  Like Josquin, he began with the cantus firmus technique, and continued to use it for most of his life; but he began to elaborate the source material, eventually integrating it into multiple voices of a [[polyphony|polyphonic]] texture where all the voices had equal weight.<ref>Meconi, Grove</ref>

Later in the 16th century, paraphrase remained a common technique for construction of masses, although it was employed far less frequently than was parody technique.  [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] used paraphrase technique in 31 of his masses, second only to parody, which he used in 51.<ref>Lockwood, Grove</ref>  Most of his masses based on hymns are paraphrase masses. In these works, the source hymns are often presented in a condensed form.  When the [[Council of Trent]] prohibited the use of secular songs as sources for masses in 1562, a large corpus of music was no longer available to composers who had been ransacking it for parodies; those composers who followed the Council's dictates often returned to using [[monophony|monophonic]] hymns and plainsong, sources which suggested the paraphrase technique.  Indeed, during this period, it was the favored method of using [[Gregorian chant]]s to construct masses.<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 608. </ref>

Paraphrase masses were written relatively infrequently in England and Germany, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Composers of masses in those regions developed styles independently, and in both areas tended to use variations of the cantus firmus technique.

Each of the voices sings a version of the source plainchant, elaborated or \"paraphrased\".|300px]]
A '''paraphrase mass''' is a musical setting of the [[Ordinary of the Mass|Ordinary]] of the [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that uses as its basis an elaborated version of a [[cantus firmus]], typically chosen from [[plainsong]] or some other sacred source.  It was a common means of mass composition from the late 15th century until the end of the 16th century, during the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period in music history, and was most frequently used by composers in the parts of western Europe which remained under the direct control of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  It is distinguished from the other types of mass composition, including [[cyclic mass]], [[parody mass|parody]], [[canon (music)|canon]], [[soggetto cavato]], free composition, and mixtures of these techniques.

==History==

Musical paraphrase, in general, had been used for a long time before it was first applied to the music of the Ordinary of the mass.  It was common in the early and middle 15th century for a work such as a [[motet]] to use an embellished plainchant melody as its source, with the melody usually in the topmost voice.  [[John Dunstable]]'s ''Gloria'' is an example of this procedure, as are the two settings by [[Guillaume Dufay]] of the [[Marian Antiphon]] ''Alma redemptoris mater.''  Many compositions in [[fauxbourdon]], a characteristic technique of the [[Burgundian School]], use a paraphrased version of a plainchant tune in the highest voice.  In these cases the source would not be obscured by the paraphrase; it was still easily recognizable through whatever ornamentation was applied.<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 608.</ref>

Dufay was probably one of the first to use paraphrase technique in the mass. His ''Missa Ave regina celorum'' (written between 1463 and 1474) is similar to a cantus firmus mass in that the tune is in the tenor, however it is paraphrased by elaboration (and he also includes bits of his own motet on that antiphon, foreshadowing the [[parody mass|parody]] technique).  By the 1470s or 1480s, the first masses appear that use paraphrase in more than one voice:  two examples survive by [[Johannes Martini]], the ''Missa domenicalis'' and the ''Missa ferialis''.<ref>Burkholder, Grove</ref>

'''''Mickey's Trailer''''' is a 1938 American animated [[short film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]. The cartoon stars [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]] on a near disastrous road trip in a [[travel trailer]]. It was directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]] and features the voices of [[Walt Disney]] as Mickey, [[Clarence Nash]] as Donald, and [[Pinto Colvig]] as Goofy. Animators include Ed Love, Louie Schmitt, Johnny Cannon, Don Patterson, Clyde Geronimi, Tom Palmer, Frenchy de Trémaudan and Cy Young.<ref name=bcdb>\"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/3993-Mickeys_Trailer.html Mickey's Trailer]\". ''www.bcdb.com'', April 12, 2012</ref> [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] makes a cameo in this cartoon where he is seen driving a truck during the \"Runaway Trailer\" sequence featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. This cartoon was released a year after ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.

==Plot==
The movie starts at what seems like a small house in a natural setting. Mickey walks out the door and says, \"Oh boy! What a day!\" Then, he pulls a lever and walks inside. The house is converted into a trailer (with the natural setting in the shape of a giant hand fan revealed to be a city dump) and Goofy's car is released from the side. Then, Goofy starts driving through the countryside while Mickey makes dinner-like breakfast (corn on the cob, baked potatoes, watermelon, coffee, and milk). Meanwhile, Donald can't wake up, even when his alarm clock rings and pulls off his blanket. Thanks to a secret controlboard, Mickey manages to rouse him for a machine-assisted bath, but he sees birds and tries to swat them with the towel. Later, the bath is converted into a dining area.

When Mickey rings the dinner bell, Goofy foolishly leaves the driver's seat - while the car and trailer are still in motion and without stopping - for breakfast, in which it drives through a closed road. After several mishaps during the meal, eventually having popcorn for breakfast, Goofy notices that no one is in the driver's seat and accidentally and unknowingly unhitches the trailer in his panic to resume driving and goes on his way. The trailer rolls downhill on an epic runaway adventure, nearly crashing into a truck and two trains and is a wreck on the inside (but okay on the outside) by the time it's miraculously rehitched to the car. Unaware of the dramatic events, Goofy, who was singing \"''She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain When She Comes''\" while driving down the hill, says in the end, \"Well, I brought you down, safe and sound.\"

==Home video==
A Fisher-Price version of the movie (and silent), was released for the Movie Viewer in 1974, and lasted until 1979. The short can be found on the ''Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color Volume 1'' disc 2 and on the ''Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites Extreme Adventure Fun'' Volume 7, as well as the 1998 ''[[The Spirit of Mickey|The Spirit of Mickey Mouse]]'' [[VHS]]. It was re-released on Blu-ray/DVD/Digital on the 2018 ''Celebrating Mickey'' compilation.

==Legacy==
This cartoon was later adapted into a [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] story titled ''The Unhappy Campers'' in which they replaced Donald with [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]] and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]. This was because Donald was not a character in the ''Mickey Mouse'' strip at the time.

The film is also part of the Christmas show ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''.

The film was also incorporated into the 1983 film ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]].''

'''''Mickey's Trailer''''' is a 1938 American animated [[short film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]. The cartoon stars [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]] on a near disastrous road trip in a [[travel trailer]]. It was directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]] and features the voices of [[Walt Disney]] as Mickey, [[Clarence Nash]] as Donald, and [[Pinto Colvig]] as Goofy. Animators include Ed Love, Louie Schmitt, Johnny Cannon, Don Patterson, Clyde Geronimi, Tom Palmer, Frenchy de Trémaudan and Cy Young.<ref name=bcdb>\"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/3993-Mickeys_Trailer.html Mickey's Trailer]\". ''www.bcdb.com'', April 12, 2012</ref> [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] makes a cameo in this cartoon where he is seen driving a truck during the \"Runaway Trailer\" sequence featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. This cartoon was released a year after ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.

==Plot==
The movie starts at what seems like a small house in a natural setting. Mickey walks out the door and says, \"Oh boy! What a day!\" Then, he pulls a lever and walks inside. The house is converted into a trailer (with the natural setting in the shape of a giant hand fan revealed to be a city dump) and Goofy's car is released from the side. Then, Goofy starts driving through the countryside while Mickey makes dinner-like breakfast (corn on the cob, baked potatoes, watermelon, coffee, and milk). Meanwhile, Donald can't wake up, even when his alarm clock rings and pulls off his blanket. Thanks to a secret controlboard, Mickey manages to rouse him for a machine-assisted bath, but he sees birds and tries to swat them with the towel. Later, the bath is converted into a dining area.

When Mickey rings the dinner bell, Goofy foolishly leaves the driver's seat - while the car and trailer are still in motion and without stopping - for breakfast, in which it drives through a closed road. After several mishaps during the meal, eventually having popcorn for breakfast, Goofy notices that no one is in the driver's seat and accidentally and unknowingly unhitches the trailer in his panic to resume driving and goes on his way. The trailer rolls downhill on an epic runaway adventure, nearly crashing into a truck and two trains and is a wreck on the inside (but okay on the outside) by the time it's miraculously rehitched to the car. Unaware of the dramatic events, Goofy, who was singing \"''She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain When She Comes''\" while driving down the hill, says in the end, \"Well, I brought you down, safe and sound.\"

==Home video==
A Fisher-Price version of the movie (and silent), was released for the Movie Viewer in 1974, and lasted until 1979. The short can be found on the ''Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color Volume 1'' disc 2 and on the ''Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites Extreme Adventure Fun'' Volume 7, as well as the 1998 ''[[The Spirit of Mickey|The Spirit of Mickey Mouse]]'' [[VHS]]. It was re-released on Blu-ray/DVD/Digital on the 2018 ''Celebrating Mickey'' compilation.

==Legacy==
This cartoon was later adapted into a [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] story titled ''The Unhappy Campers'' in which they replaced Donald with [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]] and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]. This was because Donald was not a character in the ''Mickey Mouse'' strip at the time.

The film is also part of the Christmas show ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''.

The film was also incorporated into the 1983 film ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]].''

'''Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner''' (May 17, 1912 – January 13, 2006) was an American [[inventor]] most noted for her development of the [[sanitary napkin|sanitary belt]]. Racial discrimination prevented its adoption for thirty years (Yeah, let's get some actual research in here before we scream racism.) {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Background==
She was born in [[North Carolina]] and came from a family of inventors.

'''Andy Hollis''' is an American [[video game designer]], [[Game programmer|programmer]] and [[video game producer|producer]], mainly known for his [[flight simulator]]s. He was one of the founding members of [[MicroProse]].

==Video game development==
He began his career at MicroProse Software, where he was responsible for games such as ''[[Kennedy Approach]]'', ''[[Gunship (video game)|Gunship]]'', ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle II]]'', ''[[F-19 Stealth Fighter]]'' and ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle III]]'', as well as science fiction titles ''[[Lightspeed (video game)|Lightspeed]]'' and ''[[Hyperspeed (video game)|Hyperspeed]]''.

In 1993, Hollis joined [[Origin Systems]], where he was responsible for creating games for [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[Jane's Combat Simulations]]'' brand. Among the simulations created at Origin are ''[[Longbow (computer game)|AH-64D Longbow]]'', ''[[Longbow 2]]'' and ''[[Jane's F-15]]''. In 1996, [[GameSpot]] named him as the number five in their listing of the Most Influential People in Computer Gaming, \"honored for helping to bring back serious flight simulations that don't alienate beginners.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100405233824/http://www.gamespot.com/features/15most/html/mi96_05.html GameSpot]</ref>
 
When Origin changed its focus to online games, he moved around within Electronic Arts and was working on [[NASCAR]] games and a [[Harry Potter]] online game.

He returned to Origin in 2003 after two years of retirement, where he oversaw the development of ''[[Ultima X]]'', which was cancelled before release in 2004. Later, he served as president of Fastlane Games, Inc., working on the development of a massively multiplayer online game for [[NCsoft]] before retiring again in 2006.

'''Andy Hollis''' is an American [[Video game designer]], [[Game programmer|programmer]] and [[video game producer|producer]], mainly known for his [[flight simulator]]s. He was one of the founding members of [[MicroProse]].

==Video game development==
He began his career at MicroProse Software, where he was responsible for games such as ''[[Kennedy Approach]]'', ''[[Gunship (game)|Gunship]]'', ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle II]]'', ''[[F-19 Stealth Fighter]]'' and ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle III]]'', as well as science fiction titles ''[[Lightspeed (video game)|Lightspeed]]'' and ''[[Hyperspeed (video game)|Hyperspeed]]''.

In 1993, Hollis joined [[Origin Systems]], where he was responsible for creating games for [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[Jane's Combat Simulations]]'' brand. Among the simulations created at Origin are ''[[Longbow (computer game)|AH-64D Longbow]]'', ''[[Longbow 2]]'' and ''[[Jane's F-15]]''. In 1996, [[GameSpot]] named him as the number five in their listing of the Most Influential People in Computer Gaming, \"honored for helping to bring back serious flight simulations that don't alienate beginners.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100405233824/http://www.gamespot.com/features/15most/html/mi96_05.html GameSpot]</ref>
 
When Origin changed its focus to online games, he moved around within Electronic Arts and was working on [[NASCAR]] games and a [[Harry Potter]] online game.

He returned to Origin in 2003 after two years of retirement, where he oversaw the development of ''[[Ultima X]]'', which was cancelled before release in 2004. Later, he served as president of Fastlane Games, Inc., working on the development of a massively multiplayer online game for [[NCsoft]] before retiring again in 2006.

The '''[[General Motors]] G platform''' (also called '''G-Body''') [[automobile platform]] designation was used for [[front-wheel drive]] [[full-size car|full-sized]] and [[luxury car]]s between 1995 and 2011.

Previously General Motors used the [[GM G platform (RWD)]] designation for unrelated [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] cars.

The G-body (the '''GMX690''') was based on [[Cadillac]]'s [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]] architecture. The platform was introduced in 1995 with [[Buick Riviera]] 2-door [[coupe]] (which moved up from the [[GM E platform]]) and the [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (a new model that replaced the Riviera-derived [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]]).  By the turn of the millennium, full-sized cars from four different GM makes were using some derivative of the platform.

==Platform consolidation==
Starting with the 1997 Buick Park Avenue, GM consolidated its four large-car platforms; [[GM C platform (FWD)|C platform]], [[GM K platform (FWD)|K platform]], [[GM H platform (FWD)|H platform]], and G platform; all to the G platform. However, GM decided to retain their previous platform designations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H CARS MOVE TO G PLATFORM|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F19950116%2FANA%2F501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT&date=2013-05-17|archivedate=17 May 2013|date=16 January 1995}}</ref> These legacy platform designations were used in the VIN number and official GM publications. Models designated as \"G\" went out of production for MY 1999, but successor models were sold until MY 2011. 

The G-body had an extremely resilient structure. For its time, the G-body was one of the strongest unibody car frames in production (25&nbsp;Hz). This fact did not go untouted as GM literature made much of the need to use a 'frame crusher' designed to test heavy-duty truck frames to finally break the G-body structure in their crush-to-failure procedures. Vehicles built on the G platform are also noted for having [[Seat belt#Belt-in-Seat .28BIS.29|belt-in-seat]] style seat belts like the mid-size [[GMT360]] SUVs. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The G-body also featured four-wheel [[independent suspension]] with a [[MacPherson strut]] style front suspension and a [[semi-trailing arm]] style rear suspension that utilized [[aluminum]] control arms. All-new aluminum control arms were introduced for the front suspension for 1998. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The handling was further enhanced with standard front and rear [[stabilizer bar]]s and lateral links in the rear suspension to further control wheel [[Toe (automotive)|toe]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Early life and education==
Sakamaki was born in what is now part of the city of [[Awa, Tokushima|Awa]], [[Tokushima Prefecture]], one of eight sons. He was a graduate of the 68th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in 1940.

===Attack on Pearl Harbor===

{{Main|HA. 19 (Japanese Midget Submarine)}}

[[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Sakamaki was one of ten sailors (five officers and five [[petty officer]]s) selected to [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack Pearl Harbor]] in five two-man [[Ko-hyoteki class submarine|''Ko-hyoteki'' class]] [[midget submarine]]s on 7 December 1941. Of the ten, nine were killed (including the other crewman in submarine ''HA. 19'', [[Chief warrant officer|CWO]] Kiyoshi Inagaki.)  Sakamaki was chosen for the mission due to his large number of siblings.

After several attempts to enter Pearl Harbor, Sakamaki attempted to [[scuttling|scuttle]] his disabled submarine, which had been trapped on a reef off [[Waimanalo Beach]], [[Oahu]]. When the explosives failed to go off, he swam to the bottom of the submarine to investigate the cause of the failure and became unconscious due to a lack of oxygen. The book ''Attack on Pearl Harbor'' claims that his submarine hit four coral reefs and sank. Sakamaki was found by a U.S. soldier, [[David Akui]], and was taken into military custody. When he awoke, he found himself in a hospital under U.S. armed guard. Sakamaki became the first Japanese [[prisoner of war]] in U.S. captivity during [[World War II]] and was stricken from Japanese records and officially ceased to exist. His submarine was captured intact and was subsequently taken on tours across the United States to encourage [[Series E bond|war bond]] purchases.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">Goldstein, Richard (December 21, 1999). [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/21/world/kazuo-sakamaki-81-pacific-pow-no-1.html Kazuo Sakamaki, 81, Pacific P.O.W. No. 1]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref><ref name=starbulletin1/>

After being taken to [[Sand Island (Hawaii)|Sand Island]], Sakamaki requested that he be allowed to kill himself, which was denied. Sakamaki spent the rest of the war in [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s in the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. At the war's end, he was repatriated to Japan, by which time he had become deeply committed to [[pacifism]].<ref name=\"starbulletin1\">Burlingame, Burl (May 11, 2002). [http://starbulletin.com/2002/05/11/news/whatever.html World War II's first Japanese prisoner shunned the spotlight]. ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]''.</ref>

==Later life and death==

After the war, Sakamaki worked with the [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], becoming president of its Brazilian subsidiary in 1969. In 1983, he returned to Japan and continued working for Toyota before retiring in 1987. Outside of writing a memoir, Sakamaki refused to speak about the war until 1991, when he attended a historical conference at the [[National Museum of the Pacific War]] in [[Fredericksburg, Texas]]. He reportedly cried at the conference when he was reunited with his submarine (which was on display at the museum) for the first time in 50 years.<ref name=starbulletin1/>

He spent the rest of his life in Japan until his death in 1999 at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife and two children.<ref name=nytimes1/>

'''''Mickey's Rival''''' is a 1936 [[Mickey Mouse]] short film.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFs5evuicXwC&pg=PA109 | title=Animated Short Films: A Critical Index to Theatrical Cartoons | publisher=Scarecrow Press | author=Boroweic, Piotr | year=1998 | pages=109}}</ref> It was directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] and produced by [[Walt Disney]]. It introduces the character of [[Mickey Mouse universe#Mortimer Mouse|Mortimer Mouse]].

==Plot==
Mickey Mouse is by his sentient car, getting ready for his girlfriend, Minnie as they are having a picnic together, just the two of them. But then, a Spanish mouse named Mortimer, who drives a sleek sports car (who is also sentient), rushes by and stops. Mortimer Mouse is one of Minnie's old friends who is also known as the rival of Mickey Mouse. He backs up and crashes his car into Mickey's car, pushing it into a tree. Mortimer starts to make fun of his short rival, making Mickey jealous. He takes two of his buttons from his shorts off. One button is hidden in Mickey's hand whilst the other button is thrown away. Mickey grumpily tries to grab Mortimer's buttons from his long trousers, but they electrocute him (revealed to be connected to batteries) making him even more jealous.

Then, Mickey's car pushes Mortimer's sports car off and tries to scare it away by rattling its engine, but Mortimer's sports car loudly honks its horn, scaring Mickey's car, making it hide behind a rock nearby.

Afterwards, Minnie, Mortimer, and Mickey, who is still grumpy about Mortimer, are all having a picnic together. Then Mortimer sees a bull in a nearby pen and tries to impress Minnie by doing some bullfighting. He grabs the red picnic blanket, causing Mickey to have his nose caught on a doughnut like a ring, to use to fight the bull. Mickey jealously pulls it off, then becomes a bit nervous as Minnie applauds Mortimer and tells Mickey he is good. But Mickey pouts at Minnie, breaks a teacup and storms off back to his old car.

Minnie is shocked about Mickey's jealous behavior, but she only says behind Mickey's back: \"You're just jealous.\" Mickey and his car both sit next to each other, where they both kick a rock while feeling jealous and grumpy about being teased by Mortimer and his car. Meanwhile, Mortimer is still doing his bullfighting thing. His first two attempts went well, mostly by making the bull charge into the fences around its pen, but when Mortimer sees the pen's gate open and as he's about to do a third one, he immediately yelps, runs away and flees in his sports car, leaving Minnie to deal with the bull alone after dropping the blanket over her. The bull chases Minnie, who runs away with the blanket still over her. Mickey and his car notice this and, while Mickey's car hides again, Mickey manages to stop the bull, getting stuck under it in the process while Minnie runs up a tree. Mickey bites the bull's tail, making it jump and allowing him to get out. While trying to help Minnie, the bull charges at them again. Mickey manages to get out of the way as it rams into the tree, making Minnie fall back down before she immediately climbs back up. Mickey then fights the bull with the red blanket only to get wrapped up in it and is unable to run fast enough to get away. He does manage to avoid the bull by grabbing a branch with his mouth but is forced to run again (this time by crawling like a caterpillar) when the bull turns around. Mickey's car suddenly sees his owner in danger and saves him by pushing the bull aside, but the bull immediately begins chasing the car. The car once again hides while the bull turns its attention back to Mickey. His car quickly saves Mickey again by biting the bull's tail and getting it to chase it using its red taillight, tiring it out. After luring the bull towards it again, it then uses its back wheels to splash mud over the bull. Meanwhile, Mickey tries to get a still frightened Minnie down from the tree, only for them to both fall. Mickey's car catches them with the bull still in pursuit. It then creates a cloud of dust around the bull, confusing it and allowing them to escape. While on their way home, Mickey asks Minnie if Mortimer is still funny. Minnie politely denies this and they both shake hands.

'''''Tito and Me''''' ({{lang-sr|Тито и ја}}, ''Tito i ja'') is a 1992 [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[film]] by [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[film director|director]] [[Goran Marković (film director)|Goran Marković]]. The film was made during one of the most difficult periods in the history of the [[Balkans]]. Its quirky humor marked the beginning of the end for the country it celebrates and mercilessly criticises at the same time.

==Plot==
The movie is set in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist-ruled Yugoslavia]] during the 1950s. Zoran is an overweight 10-year-old living in an overcrowded home that his parents share with his grandmother, aunt and uncle. In the early communist era of Yugoslavia, many homes were taken away from their owners in the Land Reform programs. His parents are artists, and do not get along with his aunt and uncle, who think that they are communists. 

Zoran's family is opposed to [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s rule, while little Zoran sees Tito as his personal hero. He's learned in school that Tito is the greatest man ever, and he daydreams about meeting him. One day, Zoran writes a composition called \"Why I Like the President\", which is judged the best of those submitted by Belgrade's schoolchildren. He wins a week's camping trip with other children of families favored by the regime, the trip's highlight being a reception at Tito's palace. His crush, Jasna, an orphan girl, also is going on this trip. 

The camping trip is led by a man named Raja, who quickly seems to be insane. The trip becomes increasingly absurd, with Raja and one of older boys Kengur (kagaroo, a nickname given his height) pretend to be ghosts to scare the kids while they are staying in a historic castle. 

Zoran is exposed by Raja for stealing a ring to give Jasna. He is going to be sent home on a train, and as he waits, a girl who is friendly with him walks over to his side. All of the students join, leaving only Raja and Jasna opposing him. They finish the journey and arrive at Tito's childhood home, and Zoran is asked to give a speech. He corrects his poem by saying that he in fact does love his parents more than Tito, and stating that he doesn't even like Tito that much. 

The film ends with a banquet where all of the kids get to meet Tito, but Zoran is disillusioned and doesn't really care to meet him.

'''''Tito and Me''''' ({{lang-sr|Тито и ја}}, ''Tito i ja'') is a 1992 [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[film]] by [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[film director|director]] [[Goran Marković (film director)|Goran Marković]]. The film was made during one of the most difficult periods in the history of the [[Balkans]]. Its quirky humor marked the beginning of the end for the country it celebrates and mercilessly criticises at the same time.

==Plot==
The movie is set in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist-ruled Yugoslavia]] during the 1950s. Zoran is an overweight 10-year-old living in an overcrowded home that his parents share with his grandmother, aunt and uncle. In the early communist era of Yugoslavia, many homes were taken away from their owners in the Land Reform programs. His parents are artists, and do not get along with his aunt and uncle, who think that they are communists. 

Zoran's family is opposed to [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s rule, while little Zoran sees Tito as his personal hero. He's learned in school that Tito is the greatest man ever, and he daydreams about meeting him. One day, Zoran writes a composition called \"Why I Like the President\", which is judged the best of those submitted by Belgrade's schoolchildren. He wins a week's camping trip with other children of families favored by the regime, the trip's highlight being a reception at Tito's palace. His crush, Jasna, an orphan girl, also is going on this trip. 

The camping trip is led by a man named Raja, who quickly seems to be insane. The trip becomes increasingly absurd, with Raja and one of older boys Kengur (kagaroo, a nickname given his height) pretend to be ghosts to scare the kids while they are staying in a historic castle. 

Zoran is exposed by Raja for stealing a ring to give Jasna. He is going to be sent home on a train, and as he waits, a girl who is freidnly with him walks over to his side. All of the students join, leaving only Raja and Jasna opposing him. They finish the journey and arrive at Tito's childhood home, and Zoran is asked to give a speech. He corrects his poem by saying that he in fact does love his parents more than Tito, and stating that he doesn't even like Tito that much. 

The film ends with a banquet where all of the kids get to meet Tito, but Zoran is disillusioned and doesn't really care to meet him.

The '''Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Matriz de Santiago do Iguape}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] church in the Iguape district of [[Cachoeira]], [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. Its construction began in the early 19th century and replaced an earlier church structure that fell into ruin. The church was listed as a historic structure by [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] (IPHAN) in 1960.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"i\"/><ref name=\"iphan\"/>

==History==

The [[Jesuits]] traveled up the Paraguacu River from Salvador in approximately 1561 and founded a small settlement. It is now known as the Iguape district of Cachoeira. The church complex built by the Jesuits fell into ruin; the present structure dates to the first half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"i\"/>

==Location==

The Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape is located on the Iguape inlet, sometimes called a lake, of the Paraguaçu River. The facade of the church and its entrance faces the river. The rear of the church faces the community of Iguape and lacks an entrance.

==Structure==

The Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape was constructed of mixed masonry of stone and brick. Its frontispiece is \"extremely elegant\"<ref name=\"hpip\"/> and is in the rococo Dona Maria I style. It is divided by sandstone pilasters, five portals superimposed by five windows at the choir level. The portals and windows are framed in ''lioz'' stone imported from Portugal; they have elaborate garland decoration borders. The facade is surmounted by an ornate baroque-style pediment. The church has two bell towers with gables at each side of the pediment. The bell gables have bulbous towers covered in glazed china fragments and azulejos, a feature found in numerous churches in Salvador and Recôncavo region.<ref name=\"iphan\"/>

The east, west, and rear facades of the church were never completed and lack any ornamentation.

===Interior===

The interior of the church has a rectangular plan with a single [[nave]]. It has two side aisles superposed by [[Tribune (architecture)|tribunes]] and a transversal [[sacristy]]; these are features common to churches of the period.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"iphan\"/>

The interior has few decorative features and is considered unfinished. The chancel arch, balconies of the tribunes, and presbytery have simple [[ashlar]] facings; a lavabo is located in the sacristy. The chancel has semi-industrial tiles imported from Portugal in blue and white.<ref name=\"iphan\"/>

==Protected status==

The Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1960. It was listed in the Book of Historical Works no. 575.<ref name=\"i\"/>

The '''Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Matriz de Santiago do Iguape}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] church in the Iguape district of [[Cachoeira]], [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. Its construction began in the early 19th century and replaced an earlier church structure that fell into ruin. The church was listed as a historic structure by [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] (IPHAN) in 1960.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"i\"/><ref name=\"iphan\"/>

==History==

The Jesuits traveled up the Paraguacu River from Salvador in approximately 1561 and founded a small settlement. It is now known as the Iguape district of Cachoeira. The church complex built by the Jesuits fell into ruin; the present structure dates to the first half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"i\"/>

==Location==

The Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape is located on the Iguape inlet, sometimes called a lake, of the Paraguaçu River. The facade of the church and its entrance faces the river. The rear of the church faces the community of Iguape and lacks an entrance.

==Structure==

The Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape was constructed of mixed masonry of stone and brick. Its frontispiece is \"extremely elegant\"<ref name=\"hpip\"/> and is in the rococo Dona Maria I style. It is divided by sandstone pilasters, five portals superimposed by five windows at the choir level. The portals and windows are framed in ''lioz'' stone imported from Portugal; they have elaborate garland decoration borders. The facade is surmounted by an ornate baroque-style pediment. The church has two bell towers with gables at each side of the pediment. The bell gables have bulbous towers covered in glazed china fragments and azulejos, a feature found in numerous churches in Salvador and Recôncavo region.<ref name=\"iphan\"/>

The east, west, and rear facades of the church were never completed and lack any ornamentation.

===Interior===

The interior of the church has a rectangular plan with a single [[nave]]. It has two side aisles superposed by [[Tribune (architecture)|tribunes]] and a transversal [[sacristy]]; these are features common to churches of the period.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"iphan\"/>

The interior has few decorative features and is considered unfinished. The chancel arch, balconies of the tribunes, and presbytery have simple [[ashlar]] facings; a lavabo is located in the sacristy. The chancel has semi-industrial tiles imported from Portugal in blue and white.<ref name=\"iphan\"/>

==Protected status==

The Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1960. It was listed in the Book of Historical Works no. 575.<ref name=\"i\"/>

The '''European ass''' (''Equus hydruntinus'') is an extinct [[Equus (genus)|equine]] from the [[Middle Pleistocene]] to Late [[Holocene]] of Western Eurasia.

In the late Pleistocene it was widespread throughout much of western Eurasia from the Middle East to Europe, especially along the [[Mediterranean]], with fossil reports from [[Sicily]], [[Turkey]], [[Spain]], [[France]] and [[Portugal]].

Tanen served as production supervisor on the 1971 [[Miloš Forman]] film ''[[Taking Off (film)|Taking Off]]'', which became his springboard into film production at [[Universal Pictures]], a subsidiary of MCA. He was named president of Universal's film division in 1976.

He resigned from Universal in December 1982.<ref name=NYTObit/>

In a 1978 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Tanen described how some of the biggest box office grossing films take on a life of their own, describing the success of the film ''Animal House'' was a surprise, acknowledging that \"All we did was make a picture about college fraternity life in the 1960s\".<ref name=NYTObit/><ref>Bates, william.

== Early life and vaccination against smallpox ==
Phipps was born in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]] parish in Gloucestershire to a poor, landless labourer working as Jenner's gardener. He was baptised in St Mary's parish church, Berkeley, when he was 4.<ref>http://histclo.com/child/chron/mod/18/c18-phi.html</ref>

[[file:Melingue Jenner.jpg|thumbnail|[[Lithograph]] depicting the inoculation of James Phipps, by Gaston Mélingue (circa 1894)]]

On 14&nbsp;May 1796 he was selected by Jenner, who took \"a healthy boy, about eight years old for the purpose of inoculation for the Cow Pox\".<ref>Reid, p. 18</ref> Jenner took some fluid from the cowpox vesicles on the hand of a milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes (in an unpublished manuscript Jenner refers to her as ''Lucy Nelmes''<ref>D.

Jenner wrote: ''On the seventh day he complained of uneasiness in the [[axilla]] and on the ninth he became a little chilly, lost his appetite, and had a slight headache.
