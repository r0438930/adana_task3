{"title_page": "Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey", "text_new": "The 1934-1936 '''Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey''' (also called \"cards\") was an early demographic review of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the  United States]] and Canada. The backgrounds of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed directories published in periodicals of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature]]. \n\nA couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds amidst the wider society practice of continuing [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#New_Deal_era|era of social segregation in the American society of the time]] which was against the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teaching of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all humanity]]. The vast majority of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration. However intentional migration had been undertaken shortly after this time - the religion had only been present in a few states mostly in the Northeast to North Central and West Coast coming up to 1936 but a goal was set to spread the religion to every state by 1944. As it spread inward from the West coast this mere presence established recognizable proportional membership in the population while in the higher population of the South it did not. But there it did take root too, more so among the black communities along the coastal regions of the South. Indeed this wave of activity was undertaken during the first Seven Year Plan established by [[Shoghi Effendi]] which had the intranational goal of establishing a community in every state as well as establishing the religion in the countries of Latin America.\n\n==Development, context, and reviews of the Survey==\nThe 1934 American national convention affirmed the request of the national race amity committee for a survey of the racial makeup of the community affirming the request of the national amity committee work asking for localized amity committees and consolidation with concerned groups like the NAACP and Urban League.<ref name=GreenThesis>{{cite thesis |author=Jerome Green|date=2004 |title=Trial and Triumph: The Origins of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith in Black America |type=Senior Fellowship Thesis|publisher=Dartmouth College |oclc= 242842724 |url=http://bahai-library.com/green_bahai_black_america |access-date=Feb 9, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|p36}} The same year the national youth committee including [[Marion Holley]] recommended a census be taken of youth as well.<ref>{{cite magazine | title =Youth committee | magazine = Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed News | pages = 23\u20134 | date = May 1934|issue= 74 | url = http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&page=601 | access-date =Dec 29, 2017}}</ref> The Survey developed included historical information of the respondent - the date and place they were born, the date and place they joined the religion, and where they were living at the time of the Survey as well as their national and religious background.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p66}}\n\nThe Survey was widespread by the summer of 1935.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p37}} The complete collection of respondents is a little unclear.

Those three communities were significantly different:<ref name=StockmanThD/> Kenosha was mostly Scandinavians and Germans, with mostly early converts being 1st generation immigrants, Chicago started with half American followed by English and German and added a significant black proportion of the community after 1921, and in New York the community identified as mostly American then English, and then added a proportion of German. His analysis also showed broadly similar patterns in the communities of Christian or Protestant groups which started out a dominant group and dropped percentage-wise approaching 1936 while those raised as Bah\u00e1'\u00eds kept increasing with a couple small groups non-Protestants, (Catholics, Jews, or metaphysical groups) adding in as well: it started out more Protestant than the US in general but became more diverse than the US in general.<ref name=StockmanThD/>\n\nHampson analyzed the Survey and Census results relative to the states that had a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed population, a minority of the states mostly in the upper mid-West to the Northeast and California, and compared the racial and religious groups for just those states. He argued that the rate of black declarants in those states was much higher than being proportional to the black population of those states, indeed their rate of affiliation with the religion was above that of the rate of white presence in those states,<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp333-5}} and, though fewer of the Survey respondents were sufficiently particular about their religious background, agreed they were mostly from a Protestant background with the refinement that the contribution of the Unitarians was well above that of their proportion of their presence in those states and above that of all other protestant denominations though Episcopalian and Congregational were nearly tied for a distant second.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp338-342}} The lowest rate of religious backgrounds relative to their population in the states with significant Bah\u00e1'\u00eds presence were those of Jewish and Catholic backgrounds.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p340}} However Stockman characterizes these groups as contributing significantly to the religious diversity of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community,<ref name=stockmanv25n3/> and Smith also that in other surveys at other times Jews showed a significantly higher percentage of some communities.<ref name=BFitW-Smith/>{{rp|pp49-50}}\n\nHampson was able to do a county-by-county analysis including of earlier times.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p274}} By 1919 most Bah\u00e1'\u00ed communities had less than two dozen adults and many were an isolated group or individual.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p185}} By 1925 the Faith was in about 50 counties - about 2% - and almost all major urban centers in the Northeast and West Coast excepting Denver, Omaha, Atlanta, Augusta, Miami, and St. Augustine.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p276}} Hampson argued that unity struggles to accept leadership circa 1921-1925 showed some areas lost membership compared to before - only the early cores of communities by 1906 maintained their community populations.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp276-7}} From 1925 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds diffused into nearby regions with infilling and coalescence which favored local spread of the religion while the First Seven Year Plan was the one that established wider diffusion than just in the Northeast and West.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p277}} Those national goals were fulfilled in major urban centers. From 1944 the local diffusion process remained in place since there was no regional goals.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp277-8}} In the earlier period the focus of Shoghi Effendi was to raise administrative structure and initial work raising the Temple<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p196}} out of which, for example, rose a single national budget,<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p198}} while afterwards from 1937 almost the exclusive goal was on dispersal of the community.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp198-9}}\n\nHampson generated maps of relative presence of communities and migrations up to 1936.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp260,264}} He noted a number of points.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p265}} While some of the growth in California was from immigration from the rest of the country more was actually by local conversion. The state of New York held its population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds steady even with the heaviest emigration out of the state of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds of the country. Illinois and Wisconsin also held steady with both had heavy immigration and emigration. Hampson also observed that most of the migration that occurred was far and westward and little close and southward. Interestingly rates of conversion in a state paralleled rates of migration to a state for most states,<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp265-6}} and for a time migration became the principle mechanism of the spread of the Faith where it had not been present before.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p269}} The domestic goal of First Seven Year Plan included reaching an assembly status of every state whether the entire state had 110000 people (Nevada,) or over 6 million, (Texas.)<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p267}} Raising one assembly per state in the South did not rise to proportionality with the state population while to the West it did.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p269}}\n\nTwo individual's cards have been published in biographies: Louis Gregory<ref name=Morrison/>{{rp|pp208-9}} and Alain Locke.<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher Buck|title=Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR_DF2MRlsIC&pg=PA58|year=2005|publisher=Kalimat Press|isbn=978-1-890688-38-7|oclc=238582593|page=58}}</ref>\n\n==The black community==\nIn Hampson's analysis, within the group of respondents in view of the total population of the country, the percentage of black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds is lower than in the general percentage of blacks across the whole of America but they were also relatively sparse in those states with most of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed population,<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp333-5}} but this might also be an effect of urban vs rural concentrations - there were also more cities in the North with Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds than more rural regions in the South.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p335}}\n\nIf you profile the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community only in the states they were well established in 1936<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p333}} the per capita representation of blacks in the community was higher than whites - though the absolute population of blacks in the Survey was near 5% of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds that group was more numerous among the black populations of those regions than the white Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were of the white population.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p334}} The rate of blacks per million of their population in states with Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in 1936 was 37 whereas for the whites it was 29 per million.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p334}} That's near a third higher rate of adoption among blacks than whites proportional to their population in the states under consideration.

However, both also thought the Survey was a valuable tool to profile the black community and experience as Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in general terms. \n\nLouis Gregory was the earliest black Bah\u00e1'\u00ed of the respondents<ref name=Morrison/> though others are known before him. According to the Survey only five blacks had joined the religion in the South,<ref name=Morrison/> but near 60% were born in the South and near 70% had joined the Faith in the Northern area.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p37}} \n\nGreen discerned two bumps in the overall rate of declarant blacks. One phase of enrollment among African-Americans was discerned between 1913-1920 (for 16 of the 88,)<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|pp38-9}} and another between 1927-1933 (36 of 88.)<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p41}} He concluded the [[Race Amity Conventions]] were not directly correlated with either group, having mostly run from 1921 to 1933 though they probably were places of an initial introduction to the Faith - cities that had hosted them only had five black enrollments while Seattle gathered four on its own.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p40}} The largest concentration of people of color who responded to the Survey was in DC and it was also the location of the earlier of the two bumps in the rate of black adherents,<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p36}} who in general learned of the Faith from white Bah\u00e1'\u00eds.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p38}} The later phase of enhanced adherence was in Chicago and almost all were female who had been born in the South,<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p41}} and learned of the Faith in a context of other black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p40}} This development in Chicago started from 1912 with 2 individuals and few by 14 after 1922.<ref name=StockmanThD/> Zia Bagdadi, a Persian Bah\u00e1'\u00ed long living in American, crossed the lines of violence during the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]] where he was noted he was \"the one white man who went into the African-American sections during the riot and brought food to the hungry.\u201d<ref name=Morrison/>{{rp|p130}} According to Gregory Bagdadi was shot at by both white and black protestors on his trips including to see Mr. and Mrs. Clark, black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, who's house had been attacked, themselves arrested and released when cleared by testimony of Bagdadi.<ref>{{cite news\n | author =Louis G.

Whites in the community by then were most underrepresented relative to the population at large among those younger than the group 35-40 years old.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp324-6}} The percentage of males peaked around age 45-54 and females had a broad flat high from 40 to 65 - so that the proportion of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed women per age group increased until very late in age - 70 and above. That peak was at a rate around 45 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds per million. The rate of Baha\u2019i membership compared to the national population about matches the mean population age at about near age 45 combining men and women.\n\nHampson observed the overall structure of the age profile of the respondents was natural from increasing age once declared.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p327}} He compared the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed population by age with a simple model from which he made some conclusions:<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp331-2}} there is a broadly near linear increase percentage of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in a rising age range among those still in the religion by 1936 affected only by the overall mortality rate and the overall increase in the size of the whole country, and there was a sharp increase in the adoption of the religion since 1926 and even higher from 1932.\n\nOrientalist scholar E. G. Browne wrote a testimonial obituary for \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 in January 1922 published in the ''The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'' wherein he says:<blockquote>One of the most notable practical results of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ethical teaching in the United States has been, according to the recent testimony of an impartial and qualified observer, the establishment in Bah\u00e1'\u00ed circles in New York of a real fraternity between black and white, and an unprecedented lifting of the \u2018colour bar\u2019, described by the said observer as \u2019almost miraculous\u2019. <ref>{{cite journal\n | author= E.

millenaries<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p155}} (especially Adventism<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p156}}), metaphysical esotericism and quest (especially the search going through Christian Science, New Thought and Theosophy,)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp162-3}}), religious liberalism(its inclusiveness,)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p171}} having a sense of a need for social reconstruction,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p179}} and personal attachment to 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 (usually as the presence of the Christ spirit or more<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp182-3}} which transformed into an appreciation of the Covenant<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p179}}.) \n\nSmith supported the millenaries group by anecdotally referring to several individuals, publications, and Greenacre reports and the advent issues featured in discussions of 1914 and 1917 though not generally circulated.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp156-7}} Many presentations limited the unveiling of the ideas of [[End time]] era with the quick arrival at its conclusion without \"apocalyptic horrors\u201d but was referenced in 1914, linked with the Christian Era year 70 and destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple with the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Era 70( which was in 1914.)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p158}} This was added to with optimism that peace would be the natural consequence of the war period and according to one report was the key discussion of the national convention.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p159}} Smith described the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed sense of millenarianism as more on the side of post-millenarianism theology, looking for a present active reconstruction of society, and that Bah\u00e1'\u00eds definitely had some [[Adventism]] mixed in as well.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p160}}\n\nFor the metaphysical movement being an appreciable part of the religious background of the white Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, especially New Thought and Theosophy - following a religious search often away from the mainstreams<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p161}} - Smith observed that during 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s tour in America in general and at Greenacre featured meetings with such groups, and the presence of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed membership in the Chicago New Thought Executive Committee.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp162-3}} But this group also had a strain with the anti-individualistic approach to the religious priority of its leadership before 1919,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p164}} and led to an ambivalent co-existent relationship until there were greater tensions later.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p165}} There were new patterns of authority sanctioned while old methods of authority were rejected. Tolerance for non-scriptural practices was allowed but not endorsed albeit some were opposed like the belief in reincarnation. Some of these beliefs that were specifically opposed continued anyway but opposition to claims of personal authority was a greater issue - there were claims of individual conscience and special powers.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p167}} However no process of these claims led to recognized authority in the religion though sometimes lasting or widespread recognition did exist and did lead to cliques and confusions.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p168}} Secret meeting circles occurred which may have been largest in the case of W. H. Harmon who personally revered 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 and associated with the community and teachings but did not join the community. This led to the Committee of Inquiry of 1917-1918,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p170}} (aka Reading Room Affair.)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p189}} The group calling itself the Reading Room, avowing Harmon's personal authority, sent delegates to national convention and was challenged by Chicago House of Spirituality in Boston in 1917 - the findings of a committee were supported by attendees of 19 communities followed by essays about the affair in 1918.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp189-90}} Criticisms included they were leading people astray who used occult pretensions to seek money. The 1918 convention was meticulously reviewed for delegate credentials and the convention approved the committee's findings.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp190-1}}\n\nSmith characterized the religious liberalism component of the white population's religious background as having arose out of protestant transformation toward social Christianity between the Civil War and WWI and it was itself opposed by a rise of fundamentalism.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p170}} The liberalism motivations made repeated statements of inclusiveness of ideas, to add to one\u2019s belief from other places, other religions, an approach of being \u201cleaven rather than a cult\u201d and a challenge \"to be more true to what is deepest in their faith\u201d<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp171-2}} while upholding the singular authority of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h followed by 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 and not break ties with previous religious affiliations and even used their presence in them to present Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ideas to them.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p173}} The ambiguous liberalism had strains in relation to the Faith being a distinct set of principles.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p174}} The liberalism emphasized a \u201clive the life\u201d pattern of action and sometimes as collective action. Smith notes peace organizations and race issues seeming to be the broadest efforts associated with this mindset of previous thinking and many audiences occurred of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Bah\u00e1'\u00eds with organizations of like mind:<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p175}} NAACP, Bowery Mission, Jane Addams Hull House but also volunteers to the League of Nations to enforce peace though how to proceed was not agreed.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p177}} \n\n'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s personal standing among many was combined with his personal style of tolerance and gradualism though this leveraged peaceable if opposition to existing worldly authority.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p181}} In Britain the appreciation of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was less of a high station <ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p182}} and the Americans offended the Londoners with their acts of personal devotion.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp181-2}} Nevertheless the primacy of `Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 of whatever appreciation was a unifying factor in the American Bah\u00e1'\u00ed experience and rose in time in the form of an understanding of the [[Lesser Covenant]] against the challenges of other points of view.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p183}}\n\n==After 1936==\nDuring the first Seven Year Plan, 1936-1944, 153 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds moved among the goal areas in America that succeeded in electing assemblies - an average of 6 per goal area.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp269-70}} A few local residents must have joined in - and in some areas more and in some areas less.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p270}} An additional 10 moved to areas that did not elect an assembly by 1944, another 42 moved to areas in Canada and Alaska and 24 moved to areas that became jeopardized.

The backgrounds of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed directories published in periodicals of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature]]. \n\nA couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds amidst the wider society practice of continuing [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#New_Deal_era|era of social segregation in the American society of the time]] which was against the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teaching of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all humanity]]. The vast majority of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration. However intentional migration had been undertaken shortly after this time - the religion had only been present in a few states mostly in the Northeast to North Central and West Coast coming up to 1936 but a goal was set to spread the religion to every state by 1944.

millenaries<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p155}} (especially Adventism<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p156}}), metaphysical esotericism and quest (especially the search going through Christian Science, New Thought and Theosophy,)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp162-3}}), religious liberalism(its inclusiveness,)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p171}} having a sense of a need for social reconstruction,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p179}} and personal attachment to 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 (usually as the presence of the Christ spirit or more<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp182-3}} which transformed into an appreciation of the Covenant<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p179}}.) \n\nSmith supported the millenaries group by anecdotally referring to several individuals, publications, and Greenacre reports and the advent issues featured in discussions of 1914 and 1917 though not generally circulated.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp156-7}} Many presentations limited the unveiling of the ideas of [[End time]] era with the quick arrival at its conclusion without \"apocalyptic horrors\u201d but was referenced in 1914, linked with the Christian Era year 70 and destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple with the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Era 70( which was in 1914.)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p158}} This was added to with optimism that peace would be the natural consequence of the war period and according to one report was the key discussion of the national convention.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p159}} Smith described the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed sense of millenarianism as more on the side of post-millenarianism theology, looking for a present active reconstruction of society, and that Bah\u00e1'\u00eds definitely had some [[Adventism]] mixed in as well.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p160}}\n\nFor the metaphysical movement being an appreciable part of the religious background of the white Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, especially New Thought and Theosophy - following a religious search often away from the mainstreams<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p161}} - Smith observed that during 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s tour in America in general and at Greenacre featured meetings with such groups, and the presence of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed membership in the Chicago New Thought Executive Committee.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp162-3}} But this group also had a strain with the anti-individualistic approach to the religious priority of its leadership before 1919,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p164}} and led to an ambivalent co-existent relationship until there were greater tensions later.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p165}} There were new patterns of authority sanctioned while old methods of authority were rejected. Tolerance for non-scriptural practices was allowed but not endorsed albeit some were opposed like the belief in reincarnation. Some of these beliefs that were specifically opposed continued anyway but opposition to claims of personal authority was a greater issue - there were claims of individual conscience and special powers.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p167}} However no process of these claims led to recognized authority in the religion though sometimes lasting or widespread recognition did exist and did lead to cliques and confusions.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p168}} Secret meeting circles occurred which may have been largest in the case of W. H. Harmon who personally revered 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 and associated with the community and teachings but did not join the community. This led to the Committee of Inquiry of 1917-1918,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p170}} (aka Reading Room Affair.)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p189}} The group calling itself the Reading Room, avowing Harmon's personal authority, sent delegates to national convention and was challenged by Chicago House of Spirituality in Boston in 1917 - the findings of a committee were supported by attendees of 19 communities followed by essays about the affair in 1918.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp189-90}} Criticisms included they were leading people astray who used occult pretensions to seek money. The 1918 convention was meticulously reviewed for delegate credentials and the convention approved the committee's findings.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp190-1}}\n\nSmith characterized the religious liberalism component of the white population's religious background as having arose out of protestant transformation toward social Christianity between the Civil War and WWI and it was itself opposed by a rise of fundamentalism.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p170}} The liberalism motivations made repeated statements of inclusiveness of ideas, to add to one\u2019s belief from other places, other religions, an approach of being \u201cleaven rather than a cult\u201d and a challenge \"to be more true to what is deepest in their faith\u201d<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp171-2}} while upholding the singular authority of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h followed by 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 and not break ties with previous religious affiliations and even used their presence in them to present Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ideas to them.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p173}} The ambiguous liberalism had strains in relation to the Faith being a distinct set of principles.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p174}} The liberalism emphasized a \u201clive the life\u201d pattern of action and sometimes as collective action. Smith notes peace organizations and race issues seeming to be the broadest efforts associated with this mindset of previous thinking and many audiences occurred of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Bah\u00e1'\u00eds with organizations of like mind:<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p175}} NAACP, Bowery Mission, Jane Addams Hull House but also volunteers to the League of Nations to enforce peace though how to proceed was not agreed.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p177}} \n\n'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s personal standing among many was combined with his personal style of tolerance and gradualism though this leveraged peaceable if opposition to existing worldly authority.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p181}} In Britain the appreciation of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was less of a high station <ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p182}} and the Americans offended the Londoners with their acts of personal devotion.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp181-2}} Nevertheless the primacy of `Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 of whatever appreciation was a unifying factor in the American Bah\u00e1'\u00ed experience and rose in time in the form of an understanding of the [[Lesser Covenant]] against the challenges of other points of view.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p183}}\n\n==After 1936==\nDuring the first Seven Year Plan, 1936-1944, 153 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds moved among the goal areas in America that succeeded in electing assemblies - an average of 6 per goal area.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp269-70}} A few local residents must have joined in - and in some areas more and in some areas less.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p270}} An additional 10 moved to areas that did not elect an assembly by 1944, another 42 moved to areas in Canada and Alaska and 24 moved to areas that became jeopardized.
