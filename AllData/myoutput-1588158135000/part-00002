A [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|post-deregulation]] joint venture between [[Weston-super-Mare]] based bus company [[Badgerline]] and [[Isle of Wight]] bus company [[Southern Vectis]], it was set up in September 1987 to compete with incumbent operator [[Wilts & Dorset]]. The buses all used the [[Badgerline]] brand. After a noted [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom#Bus wars|bus war]] between the two large companies, Badger Vectis folded in March 1988.\n\n==Formation==\nBadger Vectis was formed in September 1987 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Badgerline]] (80%) and [[Southern Vectis]] (20%), after both recently privatised bus companies had failed in a joint bid earlier in the year to buy [[Wilts & Dorset]], which was, like its suitors, a former nationalised [[National Bus Company (UK)|National Bus Company]] subsidiary. Wilts & Dorset had instead been privatised via a [[management buyout]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/2nd-july-1987/25/wilts-bought-out Wilts bought out] ''Commercial Motor'' 2 July 1987 page 25</ref> Badgerline had already been competing with Wilts & Dorset in [[Salisbury]] since June 1987, while Southern Vectis had already set up a mainland subsidiary, [[Bluestar (bus company)|Solent Blue Line]], to compete in [[Southampton]].\n\nHeaded by a regional director from Badgerline, the new operation used vehicles from both partners, as well as from elsewhere, and rented garage space from the other local operator [[Yellow Buses]] at their Mallard Road depot, in north-east [[Bournemouth]]. It traded as Badgerline, using the same livery as its parent company, although with more green on the front of buses, due to a perceived clash with Yellow Buses' livery.\n\n==Operation==\nBadger Vectis competed with Wilts & Dorset using a network focused on urban routes, radiating from Poole, with an important corridor being the coast road between Poole and Bournemouth. The company's tactic was to use a combination of a frequent and simple to understand [[Iveco]] minibus operated routes, branded as ''Minilinks'', together with 2 person [[Conductor (transportation)#Bus conductor|crew-operated]] larger buses, [[Bristol RE]] single-deck buses, to compete with Wilts & Dorset's largely archaic, complex and infrequent, established operations, which had no minibuses and no crew operated buses, and which had routes which ranged over a large rural area as well as the conurbation. Badger Vectis also operated cross-linked services to differentiate itself with Wilts & Dorset's routes.\n\nAfter just a week, Wilts & Dorset retaliated by setting up a high-frequency sub-brand of its own, called ''Skippers'', initially using conventional buses, but from November, using brand new [[MCW Metrorider]] minibuses. The competition saw the Poole to Bournemouth corridor eventually served by a total of 18 buses an hour.\n\nBadger Vectis did not operate into Poole bus station however, which was described as a major problem. Other issues for the company which emerged were reliability problems with its older Bristol REs, as well as recruitment issues, and the relatively higher cost of crew operation. Despite their garage rental arrangement, by the beginning of March 1988, Badger Vectis also began to compete directly with Yellow Buses, having previously avoided their routes.\n\n==Cessation==\nThe financial health of Badger Vectis declined due to its problems, and the retaliation by Wilts & Dorset. In a development described as an implosion, Badger Vectis gave notice to the traffic commissioner that it would stop operating in early May 1988.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/7th-april-1988/15/badgerline-loses-bus-war Badgerline loses bus war] ''Commercial Motor'' 7 April 1988 page 15</ref> The company closed early however, on 29 March, after employees were told that the company would no longer be operating and were offered a deal not to speak to the press.

This was in contrast to the norm which had been, and continued to be for some years afterward, characterised by small operators taking on large incumbents to take a share of their profitable routes in short term competition, and then either withdraw, fail, or be bought out by the incumbent. Industry insiders had at the time predicted however that in this case, by Christmas 1987 Badger Vectis had come very close to forcing Wilts & Dorset to cease operating entirely, had it continued with its own expansion in their territory.\n\nAlthough Badger Vectis was a failure, Badgerline itself continued its aggressive strategy, and went on to form one of the largest private transport groups in the United Kingdom, [[FirstGroup]] in June 1995.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/badgerline-links-with-grt-1614291.html Badgerline links with GRT] ''The Independent'' 5 April 1995</ref><ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/link-up-creates-second-largest-bus-group-grt-and-badgerline-in-agreed-265m-merger-1.686692 Link-up creates second largest bus group: GRT and Badgerline in agreed \u00a3265m merger] ''Herald Scotland'' 5 April 1995</ref> Both Wilts & Dorset and Southern Vectis also continued to operate, ironically coming together under common ownership, both being acquired by the [[Go-Ahead Group]], and now both operating as part of its [[Go South Coast]] division.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/aug/12/transportintheuk Bus buy for Go-Ahead] ''The Guardian'' 12 August 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.go-ahead.com/media/news/archive/2005-07-11.aspx Recommended Cash Offer for Southern Vectis plc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015001908/http://www.go-ahead.com/media/news/archive/2005-07-11.aspx |date=15 October 2013 }} Go-Ahead Group 11 July 2005</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Omnibuses blog, ''Badger Bitter'' [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2007/09/badger-bitter.html Part 1], [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2007/09/badger-bitter-pt-2.htmlPart 2], [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2008/03/badger-bitter-pt-3.html Part 3], 8 September 2007 \u2013 29 March 2008\n\n==External links==\n*[http://bcv.robsly.com/badgerv.html Gallery]\n\n{{Defunct British Bus Companies}}\n\n[[Category:Former bus operators in England]]\n[[Category:1987 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1988 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Former bus operators in Dorset]]\n[[Category:Former bus operators in Hampshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox Bus transit\n|name           = Badger Vectis\n|logo           = <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: Badgerline.svg -->\n|logo_size      = 250\n|image          = \n|image_size     = \n|image_caption  = \n|company_slogan = \n|parent         = [[Badgerline]] (80%)<br>[[Southern Vectis]] (20%)\n|founded        = September 1987\n|ceased         = March 1988\n|headquarters   = [[Poole]]\n|locale         = \n|service_area   = [[Poole]] & [[Bournemouth]]\n|service_type   = Bus operator\n|hubs           = \n|stations       =\n|depots         = \n|routes         = \n|fleet           = \n|ridership      = \n|fuel_type      = \n|operator       = \n|ceo            = }}\n\n'''Badger Vectis''' was an English bus company based in [[Poole]].
