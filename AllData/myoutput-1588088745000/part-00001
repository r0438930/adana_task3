In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of antisemitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not antisemitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious antisemitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]].

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of antisemitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not antisemitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious antisemitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]].
