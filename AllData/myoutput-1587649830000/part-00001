Similar to the [[Black Power movement]], scholars have also written about the repression and police brutality experienced by members of this movement which some connect to larger government-organized activity such as [[COINTELPRO]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe Chicano Movement encompassed a broad list of issues\u2014from restoration of land grants, to farm workers' rights, to enhanced education, to voting and political [[Stereotypes of Hispanic and Latino Americans|ethnic stereotypes]] of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. In an article in ''[[The Journal of American History]]'', Edward J. Escobar describes some of the negativity of the time:\n\n<blockquote>The conflict between Chicanos and the LAPD thus helped Mexican Americans develop a new political consciousness that included a greater sense of ethnic solidarity, an acknowledgment of their subordinated status in American society, and a greater determination to act politically, and perhaps even violently, to end that subordination. While most people of Mexican descent still refused to call themselves Chicanos, many had come to adopt many of the principles intrinsic in the concept of ''[[chicanismo]]''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Escobar|first=Edward J.|date=March 1993|title=The Dialectics of Repression: The Los Angeles Police Department and the Chicano Movement, 1968-1971|jstor=2080213|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=79|issue=4|pages=1483\u20131514|doi=10.2307/2080213}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChicanos did this through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated the Mexican American ethnicity and culture practices.\n\nThe term ''Chicanos'' was originally used as a derogatory label for the sons and daughters of Mexican migrants. Some prefer to spell the word \"Chicano\" as \"Xicano\". This new generation of Mexican Americans were singled out by people on both sides of the border in whose view these Mexican Americans were not \"American\", yet they were not \"Mexican\", either. In the 1960s \"Chicano\" was accepted as a symbol of self-determination and ethnic pride.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lulac.org/about/history/|title=LULAC: LULAC History - All for One and One for All|accessdate=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015053158/http://lulac.org/about/history/|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Chicano Movement had been fermenting since the end of the U.S.\u2013Mexican War in 1848, when the current U.S\u2013Mexican border took form. Since that time, many Chicanos and Chicanas have campaigned against discrimination, racism and exploitation. The Chicano Movement that culminated in the early 1970s took inspiration from heroes and heroines from their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]], Mexican and American past.\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the American G.I. Forum (AGIF), which was founded by returning Mexican American veteran Dr. Hector P. Garcia, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/garcia-archives-collection/ |title=Found in the Garcia Archives: Inspiration from a Notable Civil Rights Leader |publisher=HistoryAssociates.com |accessdate=31 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203064354/https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/garcia-archives-collection/ |archive-date=3 February 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The AGIF first received national exposure when it took on the cause of [[Felix Longoria]], a Mexican American serviceman who was denied a funeral service in his hometown of [[Three Rivers, Texas]] after being killed during WWII.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Rudi |title=Congress Lauds American G.I.

In New Mexico there was Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina who worked on the land grant movement. He fought to regain control of what he considered ancestral lands. He became involved in civil rights causes within six years and also became a cosponsor of the Poor People's March on Washington in 1967. In Texas, war veteran [[Hector P. Garcia|Dr. Hector P. Garcia]] founded the American GI Forum and was later appointed to the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]. In Denver, [[Rodolfo Gonzales|Rodolfo \"Corky\" Gonz\u00e1les]] helped define the meaning of being a Chicano through his poem ''Yo Soy Joaquin'' (''I am Joaquin'')[http://www.gs.cidsnet.de/englisch-online/diverse/joaquin.htm]. In California, [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]] and the farm workers turned to the struggle of urban youth, and created political awareness and participated in ''[[La Raza Unida]]'' Party.\n\nThe most prominent civil rights organization in the Mexican-American community is the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF), founded in 1968.<ref>[http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm MALDEF - About Us<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422002948/http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm |date=April 22, 2008}}</ref> Although modeled after the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], MALDEF has also taken on many of the functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.\n\nSome women who worked for the Chicano movement felt that members were being too concerned with social issues that affected the Chicano community, instead of addressing problems that affected Chicana women specifically. This led Chicana women to form the [[Comisi\u00f3n Femenil Mexicana Nacional]]. In 1975, it became involved in the case ''[[Madrigal v. Quilligan]]'', obtaining a moratorium on the [[compulsory sterilization]] of women and adoption of bilingual consent forms. These steps were necessary because many Hispanic women who did not understand English well were being sterilized in the United States at the time, without proper consent.<ref>{{cite journal|title=STERILIZED in the Name of Public Health|journal = American Journal of Public Health|volume = 95|issue = 7|pages = 1128\u20131138|pmc = 1449330|year = 2005|last1 = Stern|first1 = A.

As of the 21st Century, a major focus of the Chicano Movement has been to increase the (intelligent) representation of Chicanos in mainstream American media and entertainment. There are also many community education projects to educate Latinos about their voice and power like South Texas Voter Registration Project. SVREP's mission is to empower Latinos and other minorities by increasing their participation in the American democratic process. Members of the beginning of the Chicano movement like Faustino Erebia Jr., still speak about their trials and the changes they have seen over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.svrep.org/about_svrep.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306114630/http://www.svrep.org/about_svrep.html |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref><ref>[http://mexican-american.org/chicano-movement/index.html \"Chicano Power in the U.S.A.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425075943/http://mexican-american.org/chicano-movement/index.html |date=2012-04-25}} - Xcano Media, Los Angeles<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>\n\nThe movement started small in Colorado yet spread across the states becoming a worldwide movement for equality. While there are many poets who helped carry out the movement, Corky Gonzales was able to spread the Chicano issues worldwide through \"The Plan Espiritual de Aztl\u00e1n.\" This manifesto advocated Chicano nationalism and self-determination for Mexican Americans. In March 1969 it was adopted by the First National Chicano Liberation Youth Conference based in Colorado. Adolfo Ortega says, \"In its core as well as its fringes, the Chicano Movement verged on strivings for economic, social, and political equality.\" This was a simple message that any ordinary person could relate to and want to strive for in their daily lives. Whether someone was talented or not they wanted to help spread the political message in their own way. While majority of the group consisted of Mexican-Americans many people of other nationalities wanted to help the movement. This helped moved the movement from the fringes into the more mainstream political establishment. The \"Political Establishment\" typically consisted of the dominant group or elite that holds power or authority in a nation. Many successful organizations were formed, such as the Mexican American Youth Organization, to fight for civil rights of Mexican Americans. During the early 1960s in Texas many Mexican-Americans were treated like second class citizens and discriminated against. While progress has been made for equality immigrants even to this day are still a target of misunderstanding and fear. Chicano Poetry was a safe way for political messages to spread without fear of being targeted for by speaking out. Politically, the movement was also broken off into sections like chicanismo. \"Chicanismo meant to some Chicanos dignity, self respect, pride, uniqueness, and a feeling of a cultural rebirth.\" Mexican-Americans wanted to embrace the color of their skin instead of it being something to be ashamed of. Many Mexican-Americans unfortunately had it ingrained on them through society that it was better socially and economically to act \"White\" or \"Normal.\" The movement wanted to break that mindset and embrace who they were and be loud and proud of it. A lot of people in the movement thought it was acceptable to speak Spanish to one another and not be ashamed of not being fluent in English. The movement encouraged to not only discus tradition with other Mexican-Americans but others not within the movement. America was a land of immigrants not just for the social and economically accepted people. The movement made it a point not to exclude others of other cultures but to bring them into the fold to make everyone understanding of one another. While America was new for many people of Latin descent it was important to celebrate what made them who they were as a culture. Entertainment was powerful tool to spread their political message inside and out of their social circles in America. Chicanismo might not be discussed frequently in the mainstream media but the main points of the movement are: self-respect, pride, and cultural rebirth. \n \nThis is a list of the major epicenters of the Chicano Movement.\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]\n* [[Chicago]]\n* [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]\n* [[Dallas]]\n* [[Delano, California|Delano]]\n* [[Denver]]\n* [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]\n* [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]\n* [[Houston]]\n* [[Las Vegas]]\n* [[Los Angeles]]\n* [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]\n* [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]\n* [[San Antonio]]\n* [[San Diego]]\n* [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]\n* [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]\n* [[San Francisco]]\n* [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]\n}}\n\n== Chicanas in the movement ==\nWhile Chicanas are typically not covered as heavily in literature about the Chicano movement, contemporary literature written by Chicana feminists have begun to re-write the history of women in the movement.

Once the sheriff arrived they claimed the rally to be an \"unlawful assembly\" which turned things violent.

The event that took place was being referred to as a riot, some have gone as far to call it a \"Police Riot\" to emphasize that the police were the ones who initiated it <ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Relations with Police ==\nEdward J. Escobar details in his work the relationship between various movements and demonstrations within the Chicano Movement and the Los Angeles Police Department between the years 1968-1971. His main argument explores how \"police violence, rather than subduing Chicano movement activism, propelled that activism to a new level -- a level that created a greater police problem than had originally existed\" (1486).<ref name=\":1\" /> At one [[Chicano Moratorium]] (also referred to as the National Chicano Moratorium) demonstration as part of the Anti-war activism, popular journalist [[Ruben Salazar]] was killed by police after they shot a tear-gas projectile into the Silver Dollar Caf\u00e9 where he was after covering the moratorium demonstration and succeeding riots.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is an example Escobar presents that inspired political consciousness in an even broader base of Mexican-Americans, many considering him a \"martyr\" (1485).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nRelations between Chicano activists and the police mirrored those with other movements during this time. As Escobar states, Black Civil Rights activists in the 50s and 60s \"set the stage by focusing public attention on the issue of racial discrimination and legitimizing public protest as a way to combat discrimination\" (1486).<ref name=\":1\" /> Marginalized communities began using this public platform to speak against injustices they had been experiencing for centuries at the hands of the U.S. government, perpetuated by police departments and other institutions of power. Like many of the movements during this time, Chicanos took inspiration from the Black Panther Party and used their race, historically manipulated to disenfranchise them, as a source of cultural nationalism and pride.\n\nThe Chicano Movement and its sub-organizations were infiltrated by local law enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to acquire information and cause destabilization from within the organizations. Methods used by law enforcement included \"red-baiting, harassment and arrest of activists, infiltration and disruption of movement organizations, and violence\" (1487).<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Agent provocateur]]s were oftentimes planted in these organizations to disrupt and destabilize the movements from within. Repression from law enforcement broadened Chicano political consciousness, their identities in relation to the larger society, and encouraged them to focus their efforts in politics.\n\n==Chicano art==\n{{main|Chicano art movement|Chicano literature|Chicano#Music|Teatro Campesino|Mexican murals}} Art of the Movement was the burgeoning of Chicano art fueled by heightened political activism and energized cultural pride. Chicano visual art, music, literature, dance, theater and other forms of expression have flourished. During the 20th century, an emergence of Chicano expression developed into a full-scale Chicano Art Movement. Chicanos developed a wealth of cultural expression through such media as painting, drawing, sculpture and printmaking. Similarly, novels, poetry, short stories, essays and plays have flowed from the pens of contemporary Chicano writers. \n\nChicano Art developed around the 1960s.<ref name=\"Grove Art Online\">{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=Shifra M.|title=Latin American artists of the USA|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T049509|publisher=Oxford Art Online|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>  In its beginning stages, Chicano art was distinguished by the expression through public art forms. Chicano artists created a bi-cultural style that included US and Mexican influences. The Mexican style can be found by their use of bright colors and expressionism. The art has a very powerful regionalist factor that influences its work. \nExamples of Chicano muralism can be found in California at the historic Estrada Courts Housing Projects in Boyle Heights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estrada Courts|url=http://www.laconservancy.org/locations/estrada-courts|website=Laconservancy.org|accessdate=9 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410072830/https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/estrada-courts|archive-date=10 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  Another example is [[La Marcha Por La Humanidad aka The Chicano Mural At The University of Houston|La Marcha Por La Humanidad]], which is housed at the University of Houston.\n\nAbout 20 years later, u Chicano artists were affected by political priorities and societal values. They were also becoming more accepted by society.  They were becoming more interested making pieces for the museums and such, which brought about new forms of artwork, like easel paintings.  By the late 1970s, women became very prominent in the artistic world. An increase in individualism was more apparent as Chicano artists entered the art business market.\n\n== Chicano press ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chicano newspapers and periodicals 1966-1979.png|thumb|right|alt=A map showing Chicano newspapers published between 1966 and 1979.|A map showing Chicano newspapers published between 1966 and 1979 from the [http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_news_map.shtml Mapping American Social Movements] project.]] -->\n\nThe Chicano press was an important component of the Chicano Movement to disseminate Chicano history, literature, and current news.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_intro.shtml|title=Chicano/Latino Movements History and Geography|last=|first=|date=|website=Mapping American Social Movements|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202045729/http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_intro.shtml|archive-date=2017-02-02|url-status=live}}</ref> The press created a link between the core and the periphery to create a national Chicano identity and community. The Chicano Press Association (CPA) created in 1969 was significant to the development of this national ethos. The CPA argued that an active press was foundational to the liberation of Chicano people, and represented about twenty newspapers, mostly in California but also throughout the Southwest.\n\nChicanos at many colleges campuses also created their own student newspapers but many ceased publication within a year or two, or merged with other larger publications. Organizations such as the Brown Berets and MECHA also established their own independent newspapers. And Chicano communities published newspapers like ''El Grito del Norte'' from Denver and ''Caracol'' from San Antonio.\n\nOver 300 newspapers and periodicals in both large and small communities have been linked the Movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_news_map.shtml|title=Chicano Newspapers and Periodicals, 1966-1979|last=|first=|date=|website=Mapping American Social Movements|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103235741/http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_news_map.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Aztl\u00e1n==\n{{Main article|Aztlan}}\n\nThe concept of Aztl\u00e1n as the place of origin of the pre-Columbian Mexican civilization has become a symbol for various Mexican nationalist and indigenous movements.\n\nThe name Aztl\u00e1n was first taken up by a group of Chicano independence activists led by [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]] during the Chicano movement of the 1960s and 1970s. They used the name \"Aztl\u00e1n\" to refer to the lands of Northern Mexico that were annexed by the United States as a result of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Combined with the claim of some [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] and anthropologists that the original homeland of the Aztecan peoples was located in the southwestern United States even though these lands were historically the homeland of many American Indian tribes (e.g. Navajo, Hopi, Apache, Comanche, Shoshone, Mojave, Zuni and many others). Aztl\u00e1n in this sense became a \"symbol\" for mestizo activists who believed they have a legal and primordial right to the land, although this is disputed by many of the American Indian tribes currently living on the lands they claim as their historical homeland. Some scholars argue that Aztlan was located within Mexico proper. Groups who have used the name \"Aztl\u00e1n\" in this manner include [[Plan Espiritual de Aztl\u00e1n]], [[MEChA]] (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n, \"Chicano Student Movement of Aztl\u00e1n\").\n\nMany in the Chicano Movement attribute poet [[Alurista]] for popularizing the term Aztl\u00e1n in a poem presented during the Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in Denver, Colorado, March 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/alurista|title=Alurista Essay - Critical Essays|work=eNotes|accessdate=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527110517/http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/alurista|archive-date=27 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adela Sloss Vento]]\n* [[Chicano]]\n* [[Chicanismo]]\n* [[Chicano nationalism]]\n* [[Chicano studies]]\n* [[Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project]]\n* [[El Chicano (film)|El Chicano]]\n* [[Mario Cantu]]\n* [[Mestizos in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* G\u00f3mez-Qui\u00f1ones, Juan, and Irene V\u00e1squez.

Similar to the [[Black Power movement]], scholars have also written about the repression and police brutality experienced by members of this movement which some connect to larger government-organized activity such as [[COINTELPRO]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe Chicano Movement encompassed a broad list of issues\u2014from restoration of land grants, to farm workers' rights, to enhanced education, to voting and political [[Stereotypes of Hispanic and Latino Americans|ethnic stereotypes]] of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. In an article in ''[[The Journal of American History]]'', Edward J. Escobar describes some of the negativity of the time:\n\n<blockquote>The conflict between Chicanos and the LAPD thus helped Mexican Americans develop a new political consciousness that included a greater sense of ethnic solidarity, an acknowledgment of their subordinated status in American society, and a greater determination to act politically, and perhaps even violently, to end that subordination. While most people of Mexican descent still refused to call themselves Chicanos, many had come to adopt many of the principles intrinsic in the concept of ''[[chicanismo]]''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Escobar|first=Edward J.|date=March 1993|title=The Dialectics of Repression: The Los Angeles Police Department and the Chicano Movement, 1968-1971|jstor=2080213|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=79|issue=4|pages=1483\u20131514|doi=10.2307/2080213}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChicanos did this through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated the Mexican American ethnicity and culture practices.\n\nThe term ''Chicanos'' was originally used as a derogatory label for the sons and daughters of Mexican migrants. Some prefer to spell the word \"Chicano\" as \"Xicano\". This new generation of Mexican Americans were singled out by people on both sides of the border in whose view these Mexican Americans were not \"American\", yet they were not \"Mexican\", either. In the 1960s \"Chicano\" was accepted as a symbol of self-determination and ethnic pride.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lulac.org/about/history/|title=LULAC: LULAC History - All for One and One for All|accessdate=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015053158/http://lulac.org/about/history/|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Chicano Movement had been fermenting since the end of the U.S.\u2013Mexican War in 1848, when the current U.S\u2013Mexican border took form. Since that time, many Chicanos and Chicanas have campaigned against discrimination, racism and exploitation. The Chicano Movement that culminated in the early 1970s took inspiration from heroes and heroines from their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]], Mexican and American past.\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the American G.I.

In New Mexico there was Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina who worked on the land grant movement. He fought to regain control of what he considered ancestral lands. He became involved in civil rights causes within six years and also became a cosponsor of the Poor People's March on Washington in 1967. In Texas, war veteran [[Hector P. Garcia|Dr. Hector P.

In Denver, [[Rodolfo Gonzales|Rodolfo \"Corky\" Gonz\u00e1les]] helped define the meaning of being a Chicano through his poem ''Yo Soy Joaquin'' (''I am Joaquin'')[http://www.gs.cidsnet.de/englisch-online/diverse/joaquin.htm]. In California, [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]] and the farm workers turned to the struggle of urban youth, and created political awareness and participated in ''[[La Raza Unida]]'' Party.\n\nThe most prominent civil rights organization in the Mexican-American community is the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF), founded in 1968.<ref>[http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm MALDEF - About Us<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422002948/http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm |date=April 22, 2008}}</ref> Although modeled after the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], MALDEF has also taken on many of the functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.\n\nSome women who worked for the Chicano movement felt that members were being too concerned with social issues that affected the Chicano community, instead of addressing problems that affected Chicana women specifically. This led Chicana women to form the [[Comisi\u00f3n Femenil Mexicana Nacional]]. In 1975, it became involved in the case ''[[Madrigal v. Quilligan]]'', obtaining a moratorium on the [[compulsory sterilization]] of women and adoption of bilingual consent forms. These steps were necessary because many Hispanic women who did not understand English well were being sterilized in the United States at the time, without proper consent.<ref>{{cite journal|title=STERILIZED in the Name of Public Health|journal = American Journal of Public Health|volume = 95|issue = 7|pages = 1128\u20131138|pmc = 1449330|year = 2005|last1 = Stern|first1 = A.

As of the 21st Century, a major focus of the Chicano Movement has been to increase the (intelligent) representation of Chicanos in mainstream American media and entertainment. There are also many community education projects to educate Latinos about their voice and power like South Texas Voter Registration Project. SVREP's mission is to empower Latinos and other minorities by increasing their participation in the American democratic process. Members of the beginning of the Chicano movement like Faustino Erebia Jr., still speak about their trials and the changes they have seen over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.svrep.org/about_svrep.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306114630/http://www.svrep.org/about_svrep.html |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref><ref>[http://mexican-american.org/chicano-movement/index.html \"Chicano Power in the U.S.A.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425075943/http://mexican-american.org/chicano-movement/index.html |date=2012-04-25}} - Xcano Media, Los Angeles<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>\n\nThe movement started small in Colorado yet spread across the states becoming a worldwide movement for equality. While there are many poets who helped carry out the movement, Corky Gonzales was able to spread the Chicano issues worldwide through \"The Plan Espiritual de Aztl\u00e1n.\" This manifesto advocated Chicano nationalism and self-determination for Mexican Americans. In March 1969 it was adopted by the First National Chicano Liberation Youth Conference based in Colorado. Adolfo Ortega says, \"In its core as well as its fringes, the Chicano Movement verged on strivings for economic, social, and political equality.\" This was a simple message that any ordinary person could relate to and want to strive for in their daily lives. Whether someone was talented or not they wanted to help spread the political message in their own way. While majority of the group consisted of Mexican-Americans many people of other nationalities wanted to help the movement. This helped moved the movement from the fringes into the more mainstream political establishment. The \"Political Establishment\" typically consisted of the dominant group or elite that holds power or authority in a nation. Many successful organizations were formed, such as the Mexican American Youth Organization, to fight for civil rights of Mexican Americans. During the early 1960s in Texas many Mexican-Americans were treated like second class citizens and discriminated against. While progress has been made for equality immigrants even to this day are still a target of misunderstanding and fear. Chicano Poetry was a safe way for political messages to spread without fear of being targeted for by speaking out. Politically, the movement was also broken off into sections like chicanismo. \"Chicanismo meant to some Chicanos dignity, self respect, pride, uniqueness, and a feeling of a cultural rebirth.\" Mexican-Americans wanted to embrace the color of their skin instead of it being something to be ashamed of. Many Mexican-Americans unfortunately had it ingrained on them through society that it was better socially and economically to act \"White\" or \"Normal.\" The movement wanted to break that mindset and embrace who they were and be loud and proud of it. A lot of people in the movement thought it was acceptable to speak Spanish to one another and not be ashamed of not being fluent in English. The movement encouraged to not only discus tradition with other Mexican-Americans but others not within the movement. America was a land of immigrants not just for the social and economically accepted people. The movement made it a point not to exclude others of other cultures but to bring them into the fold to make everyone understanding of one another. While America was new for many people of Latin descent it was important to celebrate what made them who they were as a culture. Entertainment was powerful tool to spread their political message inside and out of their social circles in America. Chicanismo might not be discussed frequently in the mainstream media but the main points of the movement are: self-respect, pride, and cultural rebirth. \n \nThis is a list of the major epicenters of the Chicano Movement.\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]\n* [[Chicago]]\n* [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]\n* [[Dallas]]\n* [[Delano, California|Delano]]\n* [[Denver]]\n* [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]\n* [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]\n* [[Houston]]\n* [[Las Vegas]]\n* [[Los Angeles]]\n* [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]\n* [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]\n* [[San Antonio]]\n* [[San Diego]]\n* [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]\n* [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]\n* [[San Francisco]]\n* [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]\n}}\n\n== Chicanas in the movement ==\nWhile Chicanas are typically not covered as heavily in literature about the Chicano movement, contemporary literature written by Chicana feminists have begun to re-write the history of women in the movement.

MEChA became [http://depts.washington.edu/moves/MEChA_map.shtml a multi-state organization], but an examination of the year-by-year expansion shows a continued concentration in California.

The depiction of each activist faces the direction in which he or she died.   It currently sits in front of the TB-1 building east of Macky Auditorium on the CU-Boulder campus. \u00a0Baetz, a Canadian, had by chance seen the film ''Symbols of Resistance'', a documentary about Los Seis de Boulder, in 2017.\u00a0 She became inspired to create a piece of art to honor the activists.  She invited community participation in the project; over 200 people worked on it in some capacity.\u00a0 The base of the sculpture states, \u201cDedicated in 2019 to Los Seis de Boulder & Chicana and Chicano students who occupied TB-1 in 1974 & everyone who fights for equity in education at CU Boulder & the original stewards of this land who were forcibly removed & all who remain.\u201d It also states, \u201cPor Todxs Quienes Luchan Por La Justicia\u201d (for all those who fight for justice).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-boulder-mfa-student-creates-sculpture-to-remember-los-seis-de-boulder|title=CU Boulder MFA student creates sculpture to remember Los Seis de Boulder|date=2019-08-26|website=Boulder Daily Camera|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boulderweekly.com/entertainment/the-perils-of-forgotten-history/|title=The perils of forgotten history|last=Dyer|first=Joel|date=2019-08-29|website=Boulder Weekly|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190904210844/https://www.boulderweekly.com/entertainment/the-perils-of-forgotten-history/|archive-date=2019-09-04|url-status=live}}</ref>  CU students have protested a campus decision not to make the art exhibit permanent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailycamera.com/students-demand-los-seis-statue-be-made-permanent|title=Students demand \"Los Seis\" statue be made permanent|date=2020-03-12|website=Boulder Daily Camera|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> \n\n==Anti-war activism==\nThe [[Chicano Moratorium]] was a movement by Chicano activists that organized [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War demonstrations]] and activities throughout the Southwest and other Mexican American communities from November 1969 through August 1971. The movement focused on the disproportionately high death rate of Mexican American soldiers in Vietnam as well as discrimination faced at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://revolutionaryfrontlines.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/30-years-after-the-chicano-moratorium/|title=30 Years After the Chicano Moratorium|work=Frontlines of Revolutionary Struggle|accessdate=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926011031/https://revolutionaryfrontlines.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/30-years-after-the-chicano-moratorium/|archive-date=26 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> After months of demonstrations and conferences, it was decided to hold a National [[Chicano Moratorium]] demonstration against the war on August 29, 1970. The march began at Belvedere Park in LA and headed towards Laguna Park (since renamed [[Salazar Park|Ruben F. Salazar Park]]) alongside 20,000 to 30,000 people. The Committee members included Rosalio Munoz and Corky Gonzales and only lasted one more year but the political momentum generated by the Moratorium led many of its activists to continue their activism in other groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicanomoratorium.org/html/history_timeline.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515043644/http://chicanomoratorium.org/html/history_timeline.html |archivedate=2011-05-15 }}</ref> The rally became violent when there was a disturbance in Laguna Park. There were people of all ages at the rally because it was intended to be a peaceful event. The sheriffs who were there later claimed that they were responding to an incident at a nearby liquor store that involved Chicanos who had allegedly stolen some drinks.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=The Chicano generation: testimonies of the movement|last=T.|first=Garc\u00eda, Mario|isbn=9780520286023|location=Oakland, California|oclc=904133300|date = 2015-05-12}}</ref> The sheriffs also added that upon their arrival they were hit with cans and stones. Once the sheriff arrived they claimed the rally to be an \"unlawful assembly\" which turned things violent. Tear gas and mace were everywhere, demonstrators were hit by billy clubs, and arrested as well. The event that took place was being referred to as a riot, some have gone as far to call it a \"Police Riot\" to emphasize that the police were the ones who initiated it <ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Relations with Police ==\nEdward J. Escobar details in his work the relationship between various movements and demonstrations within the Chicano Movement and the Los Angeles Police Department between the years 1968-1971. His main argument explores how \"police violence, rather than subduing Chicano movement activism, propelled that activism to a new level -- a level that created a greater police problem than had originally existed\" (1486).<ref name=\":1\" /> At one [[Chicano Moratorium]] (also referred to as the National Chicano Moratorium) demonstration as part of the Anti-war activism, popular journalist [[Ruben Salazar]] was killed by police after they shot a tear-gas projectile into the Silver Dollar Caf\u00e9 where he was after covering the moratorium demonstration and succeeding riots.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is an example Escobar presents that inspired political consciousness in an even broader base of Mexican-Americans, many considering him a \"martyr\" (1485).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nRelations between Chicano activists and the police mirrored those with other movements during this time. As Escobar states, Black Civil Rights activists in the 50s and 60s \"set the stage by focusing public attention on the issue of racial discrimination and legitimizing public protest as a way to combat discrimination\" (1486).<ref name=\":1\" /> Marginalized communities began using this public platform to speak against injustices they had been experiencing for centuries at the hands of the U.S. government, perpetuated by police departments and other institutions of power. Like many of the movements during this time, Chicanos took inspiration from the Black Panther Party and used their race, historically manipulated to disenfranchise them, as a source of cultural nationalism and pride.\n\nThe Chicano Movement and its sub-organizations were infiltrated by local law enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to acquire information and cause destabilization from within the organizations. Methods used by law enforcement included \"red-baiting, harassment and arrest of activists, infiltration and disruption of movement organizations, and violence\" (1487).<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Agent provocateur]]s were oftentimes planted in these organizations to disrupt and destabilize the movements from within. Repression from law enforcement broadened Chicano political consciousness, their identities in relation to the larger society, and encouraged them to focus their efforts in politics.\n\n==Chicano art==\n{{main|Chicano art movement|Chicano literature|Chicano#Music|Teatro Campesino|Mexican murals}} Art of the Movement was the burgeoning of Chicano art fueled by heightened political activism and energized cultural pride. Chicano visual art, music, literature, dance, theater and other forms of expression have flourished. During the 20th century, an emergence of Chicano expression developed into a full-scale Chicano Art Movement. Chicanos developed a wealth of cultural expression through such media as painting, drawing, sculpture and printmaking. Similarly, novels, poetry, short stories, essays and plays have flowed from the pens of contemporary Chicano writers. \n\nChicano Art developed around the 1960s.<ref name=\"Grove Art Online\">{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=Shifra M.|title=Latin American artists of the USA|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T049509|publisher=Oxford Art Online|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>  In its beginning stages, Chicano art was distinguished by the expression through public art forms. Chicano artists created a bi-cultural style that included US and Mexican influences. The Mexican style can be found by their use of bright colors and expressionism. The art has a very powerful regionalist factor that influences its work. \nExamples of Chicano muralism can be found in California at the historic Estrada Courts Housing Projects in Boyle Heights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estrada Courts|url=http://www.laconservancy.org/locations/estrada-courts|website=Laconservancy.org|accessdate=9 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410072830/https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/estrada-courts|archive-date=10 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  Another example is [[La Marcha Por La Humanidad aka The Chicano Mural At The University of Houston|La Marcha Por La Humanidad]], which is housed at the University of Houston.\n\nAbout 20 years later, u Chicano artists were affected by political priorities and societal values. They were also becoming more accepted by society.  They were becoming more interested making pieces for the museums and such, which brought about new forms of artwork, like easel paintings.  By the late 1970s, women became very prominent in the artistic world. An increase in individualism was more apparent as Chicano artists entered the art business market.\n\n== Chicano press ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chicano newspapers and periodicals 1966-1979.png|thumb|right|alt=A map showing Chicano newspapers published between 1966 and 1979.|A map showing Chicano newspapers published between 1966 and 1979 from the [http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_news_map.shtml Mapping American Social Movements] project.]] -->\n\nThe Chicano press was an important component of the Chicano Movement to disseminate Chicano history, literature, and current news.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_intro.shtml|title=Chicano/Latino Movements History and Geography|last=|first=|date=|website=Mapping American Social Movements|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202045729/http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_intro.shtml|archive-date=2017-02-02|url-status=live}}</ref> The press created a link between the core and the periphery to create a national Chicano identity and community. The Chicano Press Association (CPA) created in 1969 was significant to the development of this national ethos. The CPA argued that an active press was foundational to the liberation of Chicano people, and represented about twenty newspapers, mostly in California but also throughout the Southwest.\n\nChicanos at many colleges campuses also created their own student newspapers but many ceased publication within a year or two, or merged with other larger publications. Organizations such as the Brown Berets and MECHA also established their own independent newspapers. And Chicano communities published newspapers like ''El Grito del Norte'' from Denver and ''Caracol'' from San Antonio.\n\nOver 300 newspapers and periodicals in both large and small communities have been linked the Movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_news_map.shtml|title=Chicano Newspapers and Periodicals, 1966-1979|last=|first=|date=|website=Mapping American Social Movements|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103235741/http://depts.washington.edu/moves/Chicano_news_map.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Aztl\u00e1n==\n{{Main article|Aztlan}}\n\nThe concept of Aztl\u00e1n as the place of origin of the pre-Columbian Mexican civilization has become a symbol for various Mexican nationalist and indigenous movements.\n\nThe name Aztl\u00e1n was first taken up by a group of Chicano independence activists led by [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]] during the Chicano movement of the 1960s and 1970s. They used the name \"Aztl\u00e1n\" to refer to the lands of Northern Mexico that were annexed by the United States as a result of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Combined with the claim of some [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] and anthropologists that the original homeland of the Aztecan peoples was located in the southwestern United States even though these lands were historically the homeland of many American Indian tribes (e.g. Navajo, Hopi, Apache, Comanche, Shoshone, Mojave, Zuni and many others). Aztl\u00e1n in this sense became a \"symbol\" for mestizo activists who believed they have a legal and primordial right to the land, although this is disputed by many of the American Indian tribes currently living on the lands they claim as their historical homeland. Some scholars argue that Aztlan was located within Mexico proper. Groups who have used the name \"Aztl\u00e1n\" in this manner include [[Plan Espiritual de Aztl\u00e1n]], [[MEChA]] (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n, \"Chicano Student Movement of Aztl\u00e1n\").\n\nMany in the Chicano Movement attribute poet [[Alurista]] for popularizing the term Aztl\u00e1n in a poem presented during the Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in Denver, Colorado, March 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/alurista|title=Alurista Essay - Critical Essays|work=eNotes|accessdate=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527110517/http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/alurista|archive-date=27 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adela Sloss Vento]]\n* [[Chicano]]\n* [[Chicanismo]]\n* [[Chicano nationalism]]\n* [[Chicano studies]]\n* [[Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project]]\n* [[El Chicano (film)|El Chicano]]\n* [[Mario Cantu]]\n* [[Mestizos in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* G\u00f3mez-Qui\u00f1ones, Juan, and Irene V\u00e1squez.
