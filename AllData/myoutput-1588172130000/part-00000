In various air broadcasts,  Nnamdi Kanu stated how his adoption of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s forms of civil disobedience will lead to the \"restoration of Biafra\". In an interview granted to [[Newsweek]], Nnamdi Kanu opined his belief in the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, \"I hope that what we are looking for can be accomplished peacefully. I am an advocate of passive resistance. Gandhi and Martin Luther King tried it to very good effects, so why should it not work in our case?\"\n\nPrior to the 2019 presidential election, IPOB had threatened to boycott the election. According to the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, \"It [the boycott] is a multi-faceted approach. It is civil disobedience, passive resistance, it is an expression of our resentment of Nigeria and what it represents\". His position on election boycotts was widely criticised by local Nigerian politicians who argued to the contrary. On the eve of the election, Nnamdi Kanu lifted the boycott position and urged Biafrans to participate in the election after which he described as his condition as \"signed, sealed and delivered\". His shift was received in different quarters as being open to the appeal and opinions of others.\n\n==Imprisonment==\n===Arrest===\nOn 18 October 2015, it was reported that Kanu had been arrested in

In various air broadcasts,  Nnamdi Kanu stated how his adoption of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s forms of civil disobedience will lead to the \"restoration of Biafra\". In an interview granted to [[Newsweek]], Nnamdi Kanu opined his belief in the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, \"I hope that what we are looking for can be accomplished peacefully. I am an advocate of passive resistance. Gandhi and Martin Luther King tried it to very good effects, so why should it not work in our case?\"\n\nPrior to the 2019 presidential election, IPOB had threatened to boycott the election. According to the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, \"It [the boycott] is a multi-faceted approach. It is civil disobedience, passive resistance, it is an expression of our resentment of Nigeria and what it represents\". His position on election boycotts was widely criticised by local Nigerian politicians who argued to the contrary. On the eve of the election, Nnamdi Kanu lifted the boycott position and urged Biafrans to participate in the election after which he described as his condition as \"signed, sealed and delivered\". His shift was received in different quarters as being open to the appeal and opinions of others.\n\n==Imprisonment==\n===Arrest===\nOn 18 October 2015, it was reported that Kanu had been arrested in
