This was also the first book to feature the group of characters that featured in many of his future works: Bertram ('Berry') Pleydell, his wife and cousin Daphne Pleydell, Daphne's brother Boy Pleydell, another cousin Jonathan ('Jonah') Mansel, and Jonah's younger sister Jill Mansel.  The group of five - Berry, Daphne, Boy, Jonah and Jill - later came to be known collectively as 'Berry and Co'.{{sfn|Usborne|1974|pp=28-29}}\n\nThe short stories in the collection were originally published in ''[[The Windsor Magazine]]'',{{sfn|Smithers|1982|loc=Appendix I}} their publication in book form having been suggested to Mercer by the ''Windsor'''s editor Arthur Hutchinson.{{sfn|Smithers|1982|p=78}}\n\n== Plot ==\nFifteen short stories recounting the comic adventures of Boy, Daphne, Berry, Jonah and Jill, set in [[Hampshire]], [[Devon]], [[Cotswolds|The Cotswolds]], and [[Austria]]. They are narrated in the first person by Boy.\n\n== Background ==\n\nMercer was living in London and working as a barrister at the time these stories were written. He had sold short stories previously to [[Punch magazine|Punch]] (1910), [[The Harmsworth Red Magazine| the Harmsworth Red magazine]] (1910) and [[Pearson's Magazine]] (1910 and 1912) before developing a working relationship with the Windsor Magazine that continued (with breaks during the war years and between 1929 and 1935) until the magazine's final issue in 1939. The Berry family characters first appear in ''The Babes in the Wood'' in Pearson's in September 1910, in a story that has never appeared in book form. <ref> ''The Best of Berry'' (Dents Classic Thrillers 1989) introduction by Jack Adrian </ref>\n\n== Chapters == \n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Book Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| Punch And Judy\n| Punch And Judy\n| October 1911\n| XXXIV\n| 202\n| 541-551\n| H Radcliffe-Wilson\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| Clothes And The Man\n| There Is A Tide\n| August 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 224\n| 263-271\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n| When It Was Dark\n| A Drive In The Dark\n| November 1911\n| XXXIV\n| 203\n| 669-676\n| Fred Pegram\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n| Adam And New Year's Eve\n| Fair Exchange\n| January 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 229\n| 209-218\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5\n| The Judgement of Paris\n| The Judgement of Paris\n| June 1914\n| XL\n| 234\n| 79-86\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6\n| Which To Adore\n| Which To Adore\n| March 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 231\n| 486-494\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7\n| Every Picture Tells A Story\n| Every Picture Tells A Story\n| July 1914\n| XL\n| 235\n| 201-208\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 8\n| The Busy Beers\n| Busy Bees\n| September 1911\n| XXXIV\n| 201\n| 391-398\n| A Wallis Mills\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 9\n| A Point Of Honour\n| A Point Of Honour\n| October 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 226\n| 501-507\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10\n| Pride Goeth Before\n| Pride Goeth Before\n| April 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 232\n| 672-678\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 11\n| The Love Scene\n| The Love Scene\n| September 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 225\n| 383-391\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 12\n| The Order Of The Bath\n| The Order Of The Bath\n| May 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 233\n| 685-693\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 13\n| A Lucid Interval\n| A Lucid Interval\n| November 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 227\n| 621-627\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 14\n| A Private View\n| A Private View\n| July 1913\n| XXXVIII\n| 223\n| 141-148\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 15\n| All Found\n| All Found\n| February 1914\n| XXXIX\n| 230\n| 371-378\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n|}\n\n== Illustrations ==\n\nThe first edition of the book, published in 1914, included plates of the illustrations by George Cecil Wilmhurst (1873-1930), originally included in the Windsor Magazine serialisations, for the stories included as chapters 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
