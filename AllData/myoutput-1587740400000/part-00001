For some time during the 1980s, Santiago was also a boxing promoter in Puerto Rico; several of his boxing promotions were televised locally.\n\nPossessor of an outstanding [[curveball]], Santiago reached the [[American League]]  in [[1963 in baseball|1963]] with the [[Kansas City Athletics]]. His contract was sold to the [[Boston Red Sox]] after the [[1965 in baseball|1965]] season, and he became a key member of  pitching staff of the [[1967 in baseball|1967]] Red Sox, posting a 12\u20134 record with a 3.59 [[earned run average|ERA]] in 50 games. He was largely a middle relief pitcher that season, starting only 11 games, and compiled an 8\u20133 mark in relief with five [[save (sport)|saves]]. However, he also made several important starts, including Game 1 of the [[1967 World Series]], which he lost to [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Bob Gibson]], 2\u20131, accounting for the only Boston run with a [[home run]] in his first World Series plate appearance.\n\nAlthough Santiago lost both of his World Series decisions to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and compiled an ERA of 5.59, he began the [[1968 in baseball|1968]] campaign in the Boston rotation, compiling a 9\u20134 record with a 2.25 ERA in 18 starts before an elbow injury ended his season. The injury effectively ruined his major league career. After that, he appeared in only 18 more games during [[1969 in baseball|1969]] and [[1970 in baseball|1970]], and never won another major league game.\n\nSantiago ended his majors career with 163 appearances, 34 victories and 29 losses and an ERA of 3.74. He also was selected to the [[MLB All-Star Game|1968 MLB All-Star Game]].\n\nIn [[1979 in baseball|1979]], Santiago managed in a short-lived Class AAA circuit, the [[Inter-American League]], as skipper of the Puerto Rico Boricuas. His club won 16 of 55 games (.291), ending sixth and last in the six-team league, and folded June 17. Thirteen days later, the entire league shut down.\n\nAfter he retired Jos\u00e9 Santiago became a long time play by play announcer for the [[Cangrejeros de Santurce (baseball)|Cangrejeros de Santurce]] of the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]]. He was also a Pro Wrestling announcer during the 80's.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Bucek, Jeanine, editorial director, ''The Baseball Encyclopedia: 10th Edition.''
