Volume 96 pp. 23\u201367</ref> known to the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the '''Great Heathen  Army''' ({{lang-ang|mycel h\u00e6\u00feen here}}), was a coalition of [[Norsemen|Norse]] warriors, originating in [[Denmark]] but including warbands from [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], who came together under a unified command to invade the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that constituted England in AD 865.\n\nSince the late 8th century, the Vikings had primarily engaged in \"hit-and-run\" raids on centres of wealth such as monasteries. The Great Heathen Army was distinct from these raids in that it was much larger and formed to occupy and conquer large territories.\n\nThe name Great Heathen Army is derived from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' of 865. Legend has it that the force was led by four of the five sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], including [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bjorn Ironside]] and possibly [[Ubba]].{{efn|name=sons|The Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] gives Ragnar no less than 10 sons; however, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that only three took part in the invasion.

Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind.\n\nThe invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865\u201366 at [[Thetford]], before marching north to capture [[Scandinavian York|York]] in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of [[Eboracum]] and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of [[Scandinavian York|Eoforwic]].\n\nDuring 867, the army marched deep into [[Mercia]] and wintered in [[Nottingham]].  The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868\u201369. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford.\n\nIn 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] paid them to leave.  The army then marched to [[London]] to overwinter in 871-2. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at [[Torksey]], on the Trent close to the Humber.<ref name=hadley23/> The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'a foolish king's thegn' was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at [[Repton]] on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex.<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian D. |author-link=Julian D.

In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time. [[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|The Tale of Ragnar's Sons]], on the other hand, mentions that the invasion of England by the Great Heathen Army was aimed at avenging the death of Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary Viking ruler of Sweden and Denmark.{{efn|name=son2|There is nothing in the annals to suggest that the brothers invaded England to avenge their father's killing.

Evidence for this is the presence of two Viking cemeteries in Derbyshire that are believed to be connected to the Great Army, at Repton and at [[Heath Wood barrow cemetery|Heath Wood]].<ref name=richards2004 />\n\nIn 878, a third Viking army gathered on [[Fulham]] by the Thames. It seems they were partly discouraged by the defeat of Guthrum but also Alfred's success against the Vikings coincided with a period of renewed weakness in Francia. The Frankish emperor, Charles the Bald, died in 877 and his son shortly after, precipitating a period of political instability of which the Vikings were quick to take advantage. The assembled Viking army on the Thames departed in 879 to begin new campaigns on the continent.<ref>{{cite book | author= Peter Sawyer |title = The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings| isbn= 978-0-19-285434-6 | page=57|year = 2001}}</ref><ref name=sawyer91>Sawyer.

Burials of Viking type were made at the east end of the church, and an existing building was cut down and converted into the chamber of a burial mound that revealed the disarticulated remains of at least 249 people, with their long bones pointing towards the centre of the burial. A large stone coffin was found in the middle of the mass grave; however, the remains of this individual did not survive.

The Great Heathen Army was distinct from these raids in that it was much larger and formed to occupy and conquer large territories.\n\nThe name Great Heathen Army is derived from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' of 865. Legend has it that the force was led by four of the five sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], including [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bjorn Ironside]] and possibly [[Ubba]].{{efn|name=sons|The Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] gives Ragnar no less than 10 sons; however, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that only three took part in the invasion.

Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind.\n\nThe invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865\u201366 at [[Thetford]], before marching north to capture [[Scandinavian York|York]] in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of [[Eboracum]] and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of [[Scandinavian York|Eoforwic]].\n\nDuring 867, the army marched deep into [[Mercia]] and wintered in [[Nottingham]].  The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868\u201369. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford.\n\nIn 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] paid them to leave.  The army then marched to [[London]] to overwinter in 871-2. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at [[Torksey]], on the Trent close to the Humber.<ref name=hadley23/> The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'a foolish king's thegn' was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at [[Repton]] on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex.<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian D. |author-link=Julian D.

In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time.
