Starring [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Gene Wilder]], the film was written by Brooks, [[Andrew Bergman]], [[Richard Pryor]], Norman Steinberg and [[Alan Uger]], and was based on Bergman's story and draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |title=Director and Leading Actors |publisher=Getback.com |archive-date=October 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004054717/http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] and is ranked No. 6 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]'' list.\n\nBrooks appears in three supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane, a [[Yiddish]]-speaking Native American chief and \"a director\" in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]] and [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]] and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself, appearing with his orchestra.\n\nThe film satirizes the [[racism]] obscured by myth-making [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] accounts of the [[American frontier|American West]], with the hero being a [[African Americans|black]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] playing \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'', to the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German army]] of [[World War II]].\n\nIn 2006, ''Blazing Saddles'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[American frontier]] of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through [[quicksand]]. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, the conniving attorney general Hedley Lamarr (named after [[Hedy Lamarr]]) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (named after [[Le Petomane]]) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting Taggart earlier. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.\n\nAfter an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself as a hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the \"Waco Kid,\" to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then he beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Sht\u00fcpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Upon Mongo's release, he vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr's connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad work site and discover from Charlie, Bart's best friend, that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Just as Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, Jim outshoots the thugs, forcing Taggart to retreat to Lamarr. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, Nazis, and [[Methodism|Methodists]].\n\nEast of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \"[[New York State Thruway|Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway]]\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \"a shitload of dimes\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are booby-trapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.\n\nThe resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs literally breaks the [[fourth wall]] as the fight spills onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. film lot]] into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to \"drive me off this picture\". He ducks into [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], which is playing the premiere of ''Blazing Saddles''. As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on because his work in Rock Ridge is done (and he's bored). Riding out of town, he finds Jim, still eating his popcorn, and invites him along to \"nowhere special\". The two friends ride off into the sunset\u2014in a chauffeured [[limousine]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|1=\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Sheriff Bart\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Jim, \"The Waco Kid\"\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Taggart\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Hedley Lamarr\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Lili von Sht\u00fcpp, \"The Teutonic Titwillow\"\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as Gov.

It featured [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Bart and [[Steve Landesberg]] as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named \"Reb Jordan\". Other cast members included Millie Slavin and [[Noble Willingham]]. Bergman is listed as the sole creator.\n\nCBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode featured guest appearances by [[Gerrit Graham]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] and was written by [[Michael Elias]] and Rich Eustis. Elias and Eustis later created and executive produced the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Head of the Class]]'' (1986\u20131991).\n\nInterviewed in 1996, Steve Landesberg said ''Black Bart'' \"was like a joke. ... We did the pilot, and CBS dumped it at the end of the 1975 season in April or May on a Friday. We thought it was done, then CBS tells us to come back and film six more episodes. And then another six. Six episodes each season, when an order was usually for 24 or 26. I was on ''[[Barney Miller]]'' by that point, and we'd film during the winter break when all other TV shows were on hiatus. And they never aired any of them. It was like a sick joke. If I wasn't under contract I would have walked, but they were paying me so I can't complain.\"\n\nIn 1989, Louis Gossett, Jr. told ''Entertainment Tonight'', \"CBS and Warner Bros. made a deal. ... The deal was that CBS would get to air ''Blazing Saddles'', and any sequels from the movie, in exchange for co-producing a TV show. At the time Warners wanted to make ''Blazing Saddles'' into a comedy series of films, a new one coming out every year or so. They wanted to use the model that the Brits had for the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' films. But [Mel] Brooks had a clause in his contract that said Warner had to keep producing ''Blazing Saddles'' stories, in the movies or TV, or they'd lose the rights to make sequels. The TV show was a way to keep the rights. They didn't have to air it, just keep producing it. So for four years I spent my winter on a soundstage being paid to be in a show that would never see the light of day, just so Warners could keep the sequel rights to ''Blazing Saddles''. By 1979 they finally figured out the market had changed and they weren't going to make any sequels, so we were cancelled, if a show that never was supposed to air can be cancelled.\"\n\nMel Brooks addressed the existence of the ''Black Bart'' series in 2005: \"My lawyers, bless their souls, came to me and said, 'Warner Bros. is going to try and take away your control of the movie. Let's put in a crazy condition that says they can't do any sequels unless they make it right away or make a TV show out of it within six months.' Which is brilliant. They couldn't make a sequel in six months, and the movie was too vulgar to be a TV show. Now it would air in family hour if that was still a thing. So the lawyers put that in, never thinking they'd make a TV show. ... In 1977, three years later, Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another ''Blazing Saddles'', and I say, 'No. You don't have the right to do that.' They say, 'Yes we do, we've been making a TV series and still control the rights.' What TV series? I haven't seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it. [[Oy gevalt]]! Well, management changed and they never did ''Blazing Saddles 2'', and as far as I know they're still making that stupid show to this day.\"\n\nThe pilot episode of ''Black Bart'' was later included as a bonus feature on the ''Blazing Saddles'' 30th Anniversary DVD and the [[Blu-ray]] disc.<ref>{{IMDb title|0121113|Black Bart}}</ref>\n\n===Possible stage production===\nIn September 2017, Mel Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage play version of ''Blazing Saddles'' in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/21/stupidly-politically-correct-society-death-comedy-warns-veteran/ |title='Stupidly politically correct society is the death of comedy', warns veteran comedian Mel Brooks |last=Sabur |first=Rozina |date=September 21, 2017 |website=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |accessdate=September 22, 2017 |quote=The director said he hopes he is able to recreate Blazing Saddles on the stage in the future.}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe unreleased animated film ''[[Blazing Samurai]]'', starring [[Michael Cera]], [[Samuel L.

Le Petomane, a [[Yiddish]]-speaking Native American chief and \"a director\" in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]] and [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]] and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself, appearing with his orchestra.\n\nThe film satirizes the [[racism]] obscured by myth-making [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] accounts of the [[American frontier|American West]], with the hero being a [[African Americans|black]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] playing \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'', to the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German army]] of [[World War II]].\n\nIn 2006, ''Blazing Saddles'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[American frontier]] of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through [[quicksand]]. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, the conniving attorney general Hedley Lamarr (named after [[Hedy Lamarr]]) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (named after [[Le Petomane]]) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting Taggart earlier. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.\n\nAfter an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself as a hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the \"Waco Kid,\" to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then he beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Sht\u00fcpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Upon Mongo's release, he vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr's connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad work site and discover from Charlie, Bart's best friend, that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Just as Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, Jim outshoots the thugs, forcing Taggart to retreat to Lamarr. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, Nazis, and [[Methodism|Methodists]].\n\nEast of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \"[[New York State Thruway|Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway]]\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \"a shitload of dimes\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are booby-trapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.\n\nThe resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs literally breaks the [[fourth wall]] as the fight spills onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. film lot]] into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to \"drive me off this picture\". He ducks into [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], which is playing the premiere of ''Blazing Saddles''. As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on because his work in Rock Ridge is done (and he's bored). Riding out of town, he finds Jim, still eating his popcorn, and invites him along to \"nowhere special\". The two friends ride off into the sunset\u2014in a chauffeured [[limousine]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|1=\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Sheriff Bart\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Jim, \"The Waco Kid\"\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Taggart\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Hedley Lamarr\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Lili von Sht\u00fcpp, \"The Teutonic Titwillow\"\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as Gov.

It featured [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Bart and [[Steve Landesberg]] as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named \"Reb Jordan\". Other cast members included Millie Slavin and [[Noble Willingham]]. Bergman is listed as the sole creator.\n\nCBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode featured guest appearances by [[Gerrit Graham]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] and was written by [[Michael Elias]] and Rich Eustis. Elias and Eustis later created and executive produced the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Head of the Class]]'' (1986\u20131991).\n\nInterviewed in 1996, Steve Landesberg said ''Black Bart'' \"was like a joke. ... We did the pilot, and CBS dumped it at the end of the 1975 season in April or May on a Friday. We thought it was done, then CBS tells us to come back and film six more episodes. And then another six. Six episodes each season, when an order was usually for 24 or 26. I was on ''[[Barney Miller]]'' by that point, and we'd film during the winter break when all other TV shows were on hiatus. And they never aired any of them. It was like a sick joke. If I wasn't under contract I would have walked, but they were paying me so I can't complain.\"\n\nIn 1989, Louis Gossett, Jr. told ''Entertainment Tonight'', \"CBS and Warner Bros. made a deal. ... The deal was that CBS would get to air ''Blazing Saddles'', and any sequels from the movie, in exchange for co-producing a TV show. At the time Warners wanted to make ''Blazing Saddles'' into a comedy series of films, a new one coming out every year or so. They wanted to use the model that the Brits had for the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' films. But [Mel] Brooks had a clause in his contract that said Warner had to keep producing ''Blazing Saddles'' stories, in the movies or TV, or they'd lose the rights to make sequels. The TV show was a way to keep the rights. They didn't have to air it, just keep producing it. So for four years I spent my winter on a soundstage being paid to be in a show that would never see the light of day, just so Warners could keep the sequel rights to ''Blazing Saddles''. By 1979 they finally figured out the market had changed and they weren't going to make any sequels, so we were cancelled, if a show that never was supposed to air can be cancelled.\"\n\nMel Brooks addressed the existence of the ''Black Bart'' series in 2005: \"My lawyers, bless their souls, came to me and said, 'Warner Bros. is going to try and take away your control of the movie. Let's put in a crazy condition that says they can't do any sequels unless they make it right away or make a TV show out of it within six months.' Which is brilliant. They couldn't make a sequel in six months, and the movie was too vulgar to be a TV show. Now it would air in family hour if that was still a thing. So the lawyers put that in, never thinking they'd make a TV show. ... In 1977, three years later, Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another ''Blazing Saddles'', and I say, 'No. You don't have the right to do that.' They say, 'Yes we do, we've been making a TV series and still control the rights.' What TV series? I haven't seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it. [[Oy gevalt]]! Well, management changed and they never did ''Blazing Saddles 2'', and as far as I know they're still making that stupid show to this day.\"\n\nThe pilot episode of ''Black Bart'' was later included as a bonus feature on the ''Blazing Saddles'' 30th Anniversary DVD and the [[Blu-ray]] disc.<ref>{{IMDb title|0121113|Black Bart}}</ref>\n\n===Possible stage production===\nIn September 2017, Mel Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage play version of ''Blazing Saddles'' in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/21/stupidly-politically-correct-society-death-comedy-warns-veteran/ |title='Stupidly politically correct society is the death of comedy', warns veteran comedian Mel Brooks |last=Sabur |first=Rozina |date=September 21, 2017 |website=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |accessdate=September 22, 2017 |quote=The director said he hopes he is able to recreate Blazing Saddles on the stage in the future.}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe unreleased animated film ''[[Blazing Samurai]]'', starring [[Michael Cera]], [[Samuel L.
