Hasan said, I would gladly give you some, but my buffaloes are at present dry. Abdal laid his hand on one of them and said, \"Now milk it.\" He did so, and soon gave him a copious draught. Abdal expressed his gratitude to Hasan, and asked what he could do for him. Hasan replied that they were much straitened for want of water, on which Abdal struck the neighbouring hills in two places, from which the two streams of Hasan Abdal have come forth. On the departure of the Faqir, Hasan said the spot should hereafter be called after them jointly\".\n\n==Gurdwara==\nIn 1521 the founder of the Sikh faith, [[Guru Nanak]], arrived in Hasan Abdal, a Gurdwara was built on the spot that he stayed containing a sacred rock that is believed to contain the hand print of Guru Nanak.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> Punja or panja ({{lang-pa|{{Nastaliq|\u067e\u0646\u062c\u06c1}}}} <small>([[Shahmukhi]])</small>; \u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e <small>([[Gurmukhi]])</small>) :hand or paw. There are different traditions about the origin of the Hand print.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nHasan Abdal is located near the intersection of the [[Karakoram Highway]] heading northwest, and the [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M1 Motorway]] that connects Hassan Abdal to points northwest and southeast. As part of the multibillion-dollar [[China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), the Karakoram Highway will be rebuilt, while the Hasan Abdal area will serve as the terminus for CPEC's [[Western Alignment]].<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> From the nearby village of Hakla, the [[Hakla\u2013Dera Ismail Khan Motorway]] will run southwest out of the city and link Hassan Abdal to [[Dera Ismail Khan]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province.\n\n==Health and medical care==\nThere is a Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and numerous privately owned clinics in and around the city. Despite the exponential growth in population, the health care facilities are extremely insufficient. Many hospitals are located nearby [[Wah Cantonment]] or in [[Rawalpindi]].\n\n==Education==\nThe city has several state owned primary schools, a high school each for boys and girls, a higher secondary school each for boys and girls and a degree college for women. There are a number of privately run schools to make up for the shortfall of the state owned ones.presentation convent high school is also established since 1956.\n\n===Cadet College, Hasan Abdal===\n[[Cadet College Hasan Abdal]] is the first [[Cadet Colleges in Pakistan|Cadet College]] in [[Pakistan]] and was established by the government of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] at the initiative of General [[Muhammad Ayub Khan]], the then [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Pakistan Army]], originally to serve as a feeder institution to the Services Academies. For this purpose, Military Wings were started in 1952 in [[Government Post Graduate College Sahiwal|Government College]], [[Sahiwal]], and [[Islamia College (Peshawar)|Islamia College]], [[Peshawar]]. On the completion of buildings at the present location, the Military Wings were shifted to Hasan Abdal and the Cadet College started functioning as Punjab Cadet College in April 1954. In 1960, the government constituted a Board of Governors to exercise administrative control over the college. \n[[Hugh Catchpole]] (26thMay, 1907-1st February 1997) was the founder Principal of the College. According to his will he was buried at Cadet College Hasan Abdal. He served at Cadet College Hasan Abdal for 4 years then he joined [[PAF]]{{dn|date=March 2020}} Public School as founder principal.\n\nThe college is located on the [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Peshawar]] road about 29 miles (48&nbsp;km) from [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Islamabad]], in natural surroundings near the junction of the National Highway and [[Grand Trunk Road]].\n\n==Environment==\nSurrounded by the fresh water springs with crystal clear water and [[Loquat]] orchards the city used to be an idyllic place till recent past. Its beauty as mentioned in the earliest accounts<ref name=\"earlyEnglishTraveller\" /> has somehow survived the ill planning that has resulted in an exponential increase in its population.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grand Trunk Road]]\n*[[Karakoram Highway]]\n*[[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hasan Abdal}}\n*[https://www.scribd.com/doc/60858142/A-Trip-to-Hassan-Abdal/ A Trip to Hassan Abdal]\n\n{{Tehsils of Punjab (Pakistan)}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Attock District]]\n[[Category:Sikh places]]\n[[Category:Sikhism in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Guru Nanak Dev]]\nKulbhushan kharbanda birth place Hassan Abdal\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    =  Hasan Abdal\n| native_name             = {{lang|ur|{{nq|\u062d\u0633\u064e\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644}}}}\n| settlement_type         = [[City]]\n| image_skyline           =  Panja Sahib.jpg\n| imagesize               =\n| image_alt               =\n| image_caption           = The [[Panja Sahib]] Gurudwara dominates the skyline of Hasan Abdal\n| image_map               =\n| mapsize                 = 100px\n| map_alt                 =\n| map_caption             =\n| coordinates             = {{coord|33.819487|72.689026|region:PK_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n| pushpin_map             = Pakistan Punjab#Pakistan\n| pushpin_label_position  = <!-- left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n| pushpin_map_alt         =\n| pushpin_mapsize         =\n| pushpin_map_caption     =\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{PAK}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[Subdivisions of Pakistan|Province]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[Districts of Pakistan|District]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Attock District]]\n| population_total        = 37,789\n| population_as_of        = 1998\n| population_est          = 54,200\n| pop_est_as_of           = 2007\n| population_footnotes    =\n| area_total_km2          =\n| elevation_m             = 308\n| elevation_m_min         =\n| elevation_m_max         =\n| population_density_km2  =\n| leader_title            = [[Nazim]]\n| leader_name             =\n| leader_title1           =\n| leader_name1            =\n| blank_name_sec1         = Number of [[town]]s\n| blank_info_sec1         = 1\n| blank_name_sec2         = Number of [[Union councils of Pakistan|Union councils]]\n| blank_info_sec2         = 2\n| area_code               = 057\n| area_code_type          = [[List of dialling codes of Pakistan|Calling code]]\n| timezone1               = [[Pakistan Standard Time|PST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5\n| website                 = [http://www.attockonians.com www.attockonians.com]\n| footnotes               =\n}}\n'''Hasan Abdal''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|\u062d\u0633\u064e\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644}}}}), frequently misspelt as '''Hassan Abdal''', is a city in [[Attock District]] of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab Province]] in [[Pakistan]], located 40&nbsp;km northwest of the country's capital city, [[Islamabad]].

Hasan said, I would gladly give you some, but my buffaloes are at present dry. Abdal laid his hand on one of them and said, \"Now milk it.\" He did so, and soon gave him a copious draught. Abdal expressed his gratitude to Hasan, and asked what he could do for him. Hasan replied that they were much straitened for want of water, on which Abdal struck the neighbouring hills in two places, from which the two streams of Hasan Abdal have come forth. On the departure of the Faqir, Hasan said the spot should hereafter be called after them jointly\".\n\n==Gurdwara==\nIn 1521 the founder of the Sikh faith, [[Guru Nanak]], arrived in Hasan Abdal, a Gurdwara was built on the spot that he stayed containing a sacred rock that is believed to contain the hand print of Guru Nanak.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> Punja or panja ({{lang-pa|{{Nastaliq|\u067e\u0646\u062c\u06c1}}}} <small>([[Shahmukhi]])</small>; \u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e <small>([[Gurmukhi]])</small>) :hand or paw. There are different traditions about the origin of the Hand print.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nHasan Abdal is located near the intersection of the [[Karakoram Highway]] heading northwest, and the [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M1 Motorway]] that connects Hassan Abdal to points northwest and southeast. As part of the multibillion-dollar [[China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), the Karakoram Highway will be rebuilt, while the Hasan Abdal area will serve as the terminus for CPEC's [[Western Alignment]].<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> From the nearby village of Hakla, the [[Hakla\u2013Dera Ismail Khan Motorway]] will run southwest out of the city and link Hassan Abdal to [[Dera Ismail Khan]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province.\n\n==Health and medical care==\nThere is a Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and numerous privately owned clinics in and around the city. Despite the exponential growth in population, the health care facilities are extremely insufficient. Many hospitals are located nearby [[Wah Cantonment]] or in [[Rawalpindi]].\n\n==Education==\nThe city has several state owned primary schools, a high school each for boys and girls, a higher secondary school each for boys and girls and a degree college for women. There are a number of privately run schools to make up for the shortfall of the state owned ones.presentation convent high school is also established since 1956.\n\n===Cadet College, Hasan Abdal===\n[[Cadet College Hasan Abdal]] is the first [[Cadet Colleges in Pakistan|Cadet College]] in [[Pakistan]] and was established by the government of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] at the initiative of General [[Muhammad Ayub Khan]], the then [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Pakistan Army]], originally to serve as a feeder institution to the Services Academies. For this purpose, Military Wings were started in 1952 in [[Government Post Graduate College Sahiwal|Government College]], [[Sahiwal]], and [[Islamia College (Peshawar)|Islamia College]], [[Peshawar]]. On the completion of buildings at the present location, the Military Wings were shifted to Hasan Abdal and the Cadet College started functioning as Punjab Cadet College in April 1954. In 1960, the government constituted a Board of Governors to exercise administrative control over the college. \n[[Hugh Catchpole]] (26thMay, 1907-1st February 1997) was the founder Principal of the College. According to his will he was buried at Cadet College Hasan Abdal. He served at Cadet College Hasan Abdal for 4 years then he joined [[PAF]]{{dn|date=March 2020}} Public School as founder principal.\n\nThe college is located on the [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Peshawar]] road about 29 miles (48&nbsp;km) from [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Islamabad]], in natural surroundings near the junction of the National Highway and [[Grand Trunk Road]].\n\n==Environment==\nSurrounded by the fresh water springs with crystal clear water and [[Loquat]] orchards the city used to be an idyllic place till recent past. Its beauty as mentioned in the earliest accounts<ref name=\"earlyEnglishTraveller\" /> has somehow survived the ill planning that has resulted in an exponential increase in its population.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grand Trunk Road]]\n*[[Karakoram Highway]]\n*[[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hasan Abdal}}\n*[https://www.scribd.com/doc/60858142/A-Trip-to-Hassan-Abdal/ A Trip to Hassan Abdal]\n\n{{Tehsils of Punjab (Pakistan)}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Attock District]]\n[[Category:Sikh places]]\n[[Category:Sikhism in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Guru Nanak Dev]]\n", "name_user": "94.204.114.232", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_Abdal"}
