It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on 5 June 2018, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] on 29 October 2019. But should have never been released at all. It is a pathetic attempt at making an RPG.\nWhile some [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battles are mandatory, most combat can be avoided, and the player is under no obligation to kill innocents to finish the game. [[Dialogue options]] are used for conversation and hunting prey to feed on, which replenishes strength and [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levels up]] the lead character. Weapons and supernatural abilities are employed while combatting enemies. Set during the era of the [[Spanish flu]], [[London]] serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] composed of four districts, amenable to destruction based on the player's actions. Their choices also determine which of the four endings they receive.\n\nTo gather an understanding of the background, the developers researched the setting by travelling to London and consulting history books and documentaries. The visuals were made with fictional and factual reference points in mind. [[Olivier Deriviere]] composed the original score and infused it with [[industrial music]]. The game was met with mixed reviews from critics, who praised the primary game mechanic, setting, character development, and voice acting, but criticised the combat, overall narrative, technical problems, aspects of the choice-based system, and animations. The game surpassed one million copies sold within ten months.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Vampyr'' is an [[action role-playing game]] played from a [[third-person view]].<ref name=\"third person\" /> The player controls Jonathan E. Reid,<ref name=\"E\" /> a doctor who was made into a [[vampire]], and whose thirst for blood compels him to kill innocent people. To do this successfully, he must gather information about his targets\u2014study and change their habits, collect clues, and maintain relationships by [[Dialogue tree|communicating]] with the sixty citizens under his care in [[London]],<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"more\" /><ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> which serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] built around hubs of neighbourhoods tethered to other areas.<ref name=\"boss\" /><ref name=\"semi\" /><ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> A [[skill tree]] facilitates the improvement of abilities, which is fuelled by [[experience point]]s<ref name=\"skill tree\" /> gained from blood and, alternatively, investigation.<ref name=\"blood investigation\" /> Feeding on human blood provides nourishment in addition to unlocking new vampiric powers.<ref name=\"E\" /> Abilities can be manually activated and passively upgraded. Active skills afford defensive, aggressive, healing, and tactical measures; passive skills increase health, stamina, the blood gauge and absorption, bite damage and regeneration, and carry capacity.<ref name=\"Chandler-Jun2018\" />\n\nIf one so chooses, anyone can be targeted, bearing consequences for London.<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"America\" /><ref name=\"londizens\" /> It is possible to finish the game without killing citizens,<ref name=\"third person\" /> which best preserves the character's cover as a doctor,<ref name=\"cover\" /> but leaves him nearly incapable of [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levelling up]].<ref name=\"writer\" /> Killing no one unlocks one of four different endings.<ref name=\"unlock\" /> Reid can turn people into vampires,<ref name=\"if eaten\" /> and is only able to enter a house with an invitation.<ref name=\"lore\" /> Locals each have their different backgrounds, relationships, and daily routines. If killed, they impart their last thought to Reid.<ref name=\"impart\" /> The \"Mesmerise\" ability can control the behaviour of weaker targets, like coercing them into revealing information,<ref name=\"coercing\" /> or guiding them to less conspicuous areas so as to feed without resorting to combat.<ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> With crafted medicine, Reid can heal injured or sick victims, whom if eaten,<ref name=\"boss\" /><ref name=\"if eaten\" /> will yield more experience points in the process;<ref name=\"more\" /> the rate of their affliction can be viewed using vampire senses,<ref name=\"affliction\" /> which also detect blood.<ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> Each of the four districts has a score based on the average health of its citizens.<ref name=\"four\" /><ref name=\"districts\" /> Reid navigates London using a [[waypoint]],<ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> and collectible documents are scattered around the city.<ref name=\"Billcliffe-Jun2018\" />\n\n[[File:Vampyr gameplay.gif|right|thumb|250px|Reid engages in combat with his enemies, using supernatural abilities.]]\n\nReid can wield improvised [[melee weapon]]s, such as a saw, as well as [[ranged weapon]]s including the [[Webley Revolver]].<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"webley\" /> Being able to use three-hit [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]], dodge rolls, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]],<ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> he can fight against other vampires like him\u2014[[aristocrat]]s who go by the name of Ekon; sewer-dwelling vampires known as Skals; the Vulkod\u2014a stronger breed of vampire resembling [[werewolves]]; Nemrod\u2014vampires who hunt their own kind;<ref name=\"ekon\" /> and the Guard of Priwen\u2014a secret society of [[Vampire hunter|vampire slayers]].<ref name=\"turned to\" /> [[Boss (video gaming)|Boss]] fights are featured,<ref name=\"boss\" /> and in some cases mandatory.<ref name=\"Variety-May2018\" /> Reid is adaptable to other vampire features, like the claws of a Vulkod.<ref name=\"ekon\" /> Weapon improvement through crafting is made possible by looting items. While using vampiric powers in combat, the character's blood bar drains. This forces him to feed so he can immediately replenish his strength.<ref name=\"E\" /><ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> With the vitality attained from killing a human being, he can boil the blood of his enemies, cast blood spears,<ref name=\"viable\" /> throw mist [[bomb]]s, and turn invisible.<ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> He uses his control of shadows to hide himself and strike at his opponents.<ref name=\"ekon\" /> He can use \"Spring\" to scale locations otherwise out of reach and charge more rapidly across gaps,<ref name=\"third person\" /><ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> which is also useful for avoiding combat altogether.<ref name=\"altogether\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDoctor Jonathan Reid, returning to London from the [[Great War]] in 1918, awakes in a [[mass grave]] as a vampire. Overwhelmed with bloodlust, he causes the death of his sister Mary, who was searching for his body nearby. Reid takes shelter from vampire hunters in an abandoned house and starts hearing the disembodied voice of his maker, a typical feature in the progeny of vampires. Realising London is profuse with corpses, he follows a blood trail to a bar. The bartender points Reid to William Bishop, a suspicious patron. Bishop is caught feeding on a man named Sean Hampton and is killed by the vampire Lady Ashbury. Doctor Edgar Swansea rescues Hampton and hires Reid to practice medicine at Pembroke Hospital.\n\nAfter the room of patient Harriet Jones is found covered in blood and Hampton disappears, Reid tracks him down for questioning. Hampton insists he did not murder Jones and directs him to an underground haven for corrupted vampires known as Skals, where it is revealed that Jones faked her death. Reid later discovers a corpse in the street bearing his mother's [[brooch]]. He pursues the perpetrator towards the cemetery in [[Whitechapel]] and finds his sister Mary with their mother Emelyne, realising Mary was turned into a vampire the night he fed on her. Mary is intent on killing him to rid herself of his voice, but dies trying. Reid vows to uncover what is behind the Skal epidemic, which he learns has been mistaken for the [[Spanish flu]].\n\nLady Ashbury invites Reid to the [[West End of London|West End]] on behalf of the Ascalon Club, a secret society of highborn vampires. By the order of its leader Lord Redgrave, Reid roots out the source of Skals in the district. Swansea is later kidnapped and, once located, admits to attempting to heal Jones with Lady Ashbury's blood, thereby creating the Skal epidemic; once Ashbury finds out, she flees in shame. It is made known that the entity Myrddin, claimant to the role of Jonathan's maker, sired him to defeat his mother [[Morrigan]], also known as the \"Red Queen\", after she possessed Jones to wreak havoc upon London. Reid defeats Morrigan in battle, resolving then to travel after Lady Ashbury to her family castle, where she hid with her maker [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]].\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment began with a team of sixty people, later expanded to around eighty, many of whom worked on [[Dontnod Entertainment]]'s previous project ''[[Life Is Strange]]''.<ref name=\"more\" /><ref name=\"eighty\" /><ref name=\"MCV-Nov2017\" /> For a short time, the developer considered setting the game in [[United States in the 1950s|1950s America]],<ref name=\"America\" /> but after narrative director St\u00e9phane Beauverger joined the project,<ref name=\"MCV-Nov2017\" /> it was discarded to inspire a more [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] mood with focus on the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, set in London. The paintings of [[Phil Hale]] influenced the art style, also for the purpose of atmosphere.<ref name=\"tentative 17\" /> Dontnod researched the setting by visiting London and taking photographs,<ref name=\"more\" /> but since the city had been largely rebuilt, history books and documentaries concerning [[Whitechapel]], the [[London Docks]], and the [[Isle of Dogs]] were also consulted.<ref name=\"viable\" /> The literary sources ''Liquid History: The Thames Through Time'' and ''The Book of Facial Expressions: Babies to Teens'' provided [[Geography|geographical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] insight, respectively,<ref name=\"3dg3\" /> while the television series ''[[Casualty 1900s]]'' and ''[[The Knick]]'' were turned to for medical information.<ref name=\"turned to\" /> [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] was hired to voice Jonathan Reid.<ref name=\"VampyrGame-Jun2018\" /> The characters and dialogue were scripted by two French writers and translated into English by two native speakers. Dontnod decided on the British accent, though the marketing department wanted more.<ref name=\"Dealessandri-Jun2018\" /> The period was studied using both factual and fictional reference points{{efn|As such, the game world has been described as a [[uchronia]].<ref name=\"turned to\" />}} to create the visuals, realised with [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] lighting,<ref name=\"photorealistic\" /> and [[Image editing|post-processes]] running on the [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 4|Unreal Engine 4]].<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"tentative 17\" /> [[Motion capture]] was used to track character movement.<ref name=\"O'Connor-Feb2018\" /> In August 2016, the major obstacles in developing the [[Xbox One]] version had been overcome with the assurance that there would be no downgrades despite its hardware disadvantages.<ref name=\"hardware\" /> The game has one [[Saved game|save slot]], a decision Dontnod made for in-game choices to have \"real, meaningful impact\"; to avoid corrupted saves, they implemented [[backup]] systems.<ref name=\"Ashaari-May2018\" />\n\nAdhering to either Reid's [[Hippocratic Oath#\"First do no harm\"|Hippocratic Oath]] or vampiric nature intends to explore the dualism of his survival as both a doctor and vampire.<ref name=\"tentative 17\" /><ref name=\"oath\" /> [[Olivier Deriviere]] served as the composer throughout development,<ref name=\"Banas-May2018\" /> infusing the score with [[industrial music]] to portray the solitude and inner struggle of the main character. Eric-Maria Couturier played the [[cello]], whose sounds were intended to go from \"emotional\" to \"bestial\".<ref name=\"Prell-Jan2018\" /> The [[bass flute]], [[piano]], [[double bass]], and [[cimbalom]] (chosen for how it reflected that period in London) were also employed, each characterising an aspect of the story. Deriviere saw the [[choir]] as representing an oppressive influence on the main character, and thought its combination with industrial music was effective given the amount of [[Audio editing software|post-processing]].<ref name=\"Stevens-May2018\" /> The soundtrack was released on 3 May 2018 on [[Bandcamp]], and launched on all digital platforms the day the game came out.<ref name=\"Frometa-May2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' was [[released to manufacturing]] in May 2018.<ref name=\"Hart-May2018\" />\n\n==Release==\nAfter a technical issue delayed it from its original November 2017 launch date, ''Vampyr'' was rescheduled for Q1/Q2 2018.<ref name=\"Romano-2017\" /> The final episode of a [[making-of]] video series revealed that it would be released on 5 June (for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and Xbox One).<ref name=\"O'Connor-Feb2018\" /><ref name=\"Wood-Jan2018\" /> Those who pre-ordered the game gained access to bonus [[downloadable content]] called \"The Hunters Heirlooms\", which contained exclusive in-game cosmetics.<ref name=\"hunters heirlooms\" /><ref name=\"Vampyr-Game\" /> If pre-ordered through select retailers in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], a [[phonograph record]] of the soundtrack was included.<ref name=\"DONTNOD_Ent-Apr2018\" />\n\nIn May 2018, Dontnod confirmed that ''Vampyr'' would not be using [[Denuvo Anti-Tamper]], a technology criticised for damaging [[computer performance]].<ref name=\"Luces-May2018\" /> A launch trailer came out the following month, leading up to the release.<ref name=\"Patino-Jun2018\" /> Two new difficulties, Story and Hard mode, launched on 26 September 2018.<ref name=\"Rutledge-Sep2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' was added to [[Xbox Game Pass]], a subscription-based service for Xbox One games, on 28 March 2019.<ref name=\"Phillips-Mar2019\" /> A [[Nintendo Switch]] version developed by [[Saber Interactive]] was released on 29 October 2019.<ref name=\"Bukacek-Sep2019\" /><ref name=\"Gamekult-Sep2019\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 72/100<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><br />(PS4) 70/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><br />(XONE) 70/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\" /><br />(NS) 69/100<ref name=\"MCNS\" />\n| Destruct = 6/10<ref name=\"Destruct\" />\n| EGM = 8/10<ref name=\"EGM\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRev\" />\n| GSpot = 7/10<ref name=\"GSpot\" />\n| GRadar = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"GRadar\" />\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n| PCGUS = 68/100<ref name=\"PCGUS\" />\n| VG = 7/10<ref name=\"VG\" />\n}}\n''Vampyr'' received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><ref name=\"MCXONE\" /> ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Kevin Mersereau enjoyed the dialogue conversations, atmosphere, and character development.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Emma Schaefer of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' declared Reid's dualism between doctor and vampire the title's greatest strength, while also praising the character development for imbuing \"even the lowest beggar\" with some importance.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> Matt Utley at ''[[Game Revolution]]'' enjoyed the atmosphere, each district's distinct look, and aspects of the combat.<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Writing for ''[[GameSpot]]'', Justin Clark was impressed with the effect of decisions and how this tied into the core gameplay, calling it \"empowering\". He also commended the \"enthralling\" characterisations, \"exquisite\" setting, and \"captivating\" voice acting.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> ''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Leon Hurley, like Schaefer, found the mechanic of testing Reid's morality compelling, calling the characters well-realised and integral. Also approved of was the \"atmospheric victorian London setting\".<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Brandin Tyrrel, writing for ''[[IGN]]'', termed ''Vampyr'' \"a fresh and genuine take\" on vampire mythology. He was generally satisfied with how choices turned out and said the recreation of London as a \"gloomy, somber city\" was bolstered by authentic characters, whose writing and performances he also enjoyed. Tyrrel welcomed the story and enjoyed the citizen mechanics,<ref name=\"IGN\" /> something Andy Kelly at ''[[PC Gamer]]'' also appreciated, hoping that more video games would follow suit. He called the dialogue-driven storytelling \"compelling\" and the setting \"atmospheric\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Alice Bell of ''VideoGamer.com'' wrote, \"''Vampyr'' serves delicious ladles of angst and drama with a hearty slice of excellent, morally grey choice system that will genuinely surprise you, all wrapped up in a wonderfully gloomy London\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\nConversely, Mersereau scolded the overall narrative for its \"threadbare\" contribution. He called the combat \"a low-grade ''[[The Witcher (video game)|Witcher]]'' knockoff\", complaining about its lack of precision and \"sloppy\" mechanics. Lengthy [[loading screen]]s and constant [[Hang (computing)|hangings]] were also cited as a source of annoyance.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Schaefer lambasted the animations for being \"a little wonky\" and the unpolished nature of the game.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> To Utley, ''Vampyr'' failed to impress, in particular its character development and impact of choice. He also had technical problems (low resolution, \"choppy\" performance, and lengthy loading times).<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Already frustrated with the combat, Clark said frame rate drops and frequent loading screens worsened the experience. He found that the narrative became weaker in the final chapters.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Hurley viewed the combat as \"functional at best\"; \"solid if uninventive\", and chastised how small decisions led to big mistakes, which he felt forfeited responsibility for one's actions.<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Tyrrel cited lip syncing as a primary concern of the animation, criticised the lack of variety in combat, and experienced the same technical difficulties as Mersereau, Utley, and Clark, albeit noting that they amounted to minor annoyances.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Kelly disliked the \"dull, repetitive\" combat sequences and, despite noting a variety of fighting styles, saw this ultimately as a \"tiresome\" distraction.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Agreeing with many others on the combat, Bell described it as continuously turning \"sour\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\n===Sales and accolades===\nFocus Home Interactive stated that ''Vampyr'' would be considered successful if it sold one million copies, although half would turn a profit.<ref name=\"Dealessandri-Nov2017\" /> It debuted in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France as the best-selling video game across all formats,<ref name=\"Handrahan-Jun2018\" /><ref name=\"Vincent-Jul2018\" /> reaching second place on the Italian chart (behind ''[[FIFA 18]]'').<ref name=\"Pugliese-Jun2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' sold 450,000 copies after one month of release,<ref name=\"Jones-Jul2018\" /> contributing to an increase of over twenty percent of its publisher's revenue for the first quarter of 2018.<ref name=\"Vincent-Jul2018\" /> That October, the publisher cited ''Vampyr'' as a key factor in its second quarter's [[\u20ac]]44.3 million revenue.<ref name=\"Wise-Oct2018\" /> By April 2019, ''Vampyr'' had sold one million copies; these sales contributed to a 22.1% rise in revenue for Dontnod, equivalent to a {{\u20ac|10.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} increase from the previous [[fiscal year]].<ref name=\"Actusnews-Apr2019-A\" /><ref name=\"Actusnews-Apr2019-B\" />\n\nAt [[E3 2017]], ''Vampyr'' received one of [[GamesRadar+]]'s Best of E3 awards<ref name=\"e32017\" /> and was nominated for [[GamesBeat]]'s Unreal Underdog award<ref name=\"bestofu\" /> and [[Game Critics Awards]]' Best RPG award.<ref name=\"bestofgca\" /><ref name=\"gc4w\" /> It was later nominated for the Best Console Game, Best Screenplay, and Best Soundtrack awards at the 2018 Ping Awards,<ref name=\"PingAwards-Nov2018\" /> and for \"Best Role-Playing Game\" at the [[Fun & Serious Game Festival|Titanium Awards]],<ref name=\"TitaniumAwards-Dec2018\" /> and won the \"Game, Original Role Playing\" award at the [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers|NAVGTR]] Awards, whereas its other nominations were for the \"Original Dramatic Score, New IP\" and \"Use of Sound, New IP\" awards.<ref name=\"NAVGTR-Feb2019\" /><ref name=\"NAVGTR-Mar2019\" />\n\n==Television adaptation==\nIn August 2018, it was announced that the television production company [[Fox 21 Television Studios]] had [[optioned]] ''Vampyr'' as a series, with [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] and DJ2 Entertainment also attached to the project.

It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on 5 June 2018, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] on 29 October 2019. The plot relates to how Jonathan Reid, a doctor who has turned into a [[vampire]], comes to terms with his [[undead]] condition as he is torn between the [[Hippocratic Oath#\"First do no harm\"|Hippocratic Oath]] and his newfound bloodthirsty nature.\n\nWhile some [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battles are mandatory, most combat can be avoided, and the player is under no obligation to kill innocents to finish the game. [[Dialogue options]] are used for conversation and hunting prey to feed on, which replenishes strength and [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levels up]] the lead character. Weapons and supernatural abilities are employed while combatting enemies. Set during the era of the [[Spanish flu]], [[London]] serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] composed of four districts, amenable to destruction based on the player's actions. Their choices also determine which of the four endings they receive.\n\nTo gather an understanding of the background, the developers researched the setting by travelling to London and consulting history books and documentaries. The visuals were made with fictional and factual reference points in mind. [[Olivier Deriviere]] composed the original score and infused it with [[industrial music]]. The game was met with mixed reviews from critics, who praised the primary game mechanic, setting, character development, and voice acting, but criticised the combat, overall narrative, technical problems, aspects of the choice-based system, and animations. The game surpassed one million copies sold within ten months.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Vampyr'' is an [[action role-playing game]] played from a [[third-person view]].<ref name=\"third person\" /> The player controls Jonathan E. Reid,<ref name=\"E\" /> a doctor who was made into a [[vampire]], and whose thirst for blood compels him to kill innocent people. To do this successfully, he must gather information about his targets\u2014study and change their habits, collect clues, and maintain relationships by [[Dialogue tree|communicating]] with the sixty citizens under his care in [[London]],<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"more\" /><ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> which serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] built around hubs of neighbourhoods tethered to other areas.<ref name=\"boss\" /><ref name=\"semi\" /><ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> A [[skill tree]] facilitates the improvement of abilities, which is fuelled by [[experience point]]s<ref name=\"skill tree\" /> gained from blood and, alternatively, investigation.<ref name=\"blood investigation\" /> Feeding on human blood provides nourishment in addition to unlocking new vampiric powers.<ref name=\"E\" /> Abilities can be manually activated and passively upgraded. Active skills afford defensive, aggressive, healing, and tactical measures; passive skills increase health, stamina, the blood gauge and absorption, bite damage and regeneration, and carry capacity.<ref name=\"Chandler-Jun2018\" />\n\nIf one so chooses, anyone can be targeted, bearing consequences for London.<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"America\" /><ref name=\"londizens\" /> It is possible to finish the game without killing citizens,<ref name=\"third person\" /> which best preserves the character's cover as a doctor,<ref name=\"cover\" /> but leaves him nearly incapable of [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levelling up]].<ref name=\"writer\" /> Killing no one unlocks one of four different endings.<ref name=\"unlock\" /> Reid can turn people into vampires,<ref name=\"if eaten\" /> and is only able to enter a house with an invitation.<ref name=\"lore\" /> Locals each have their different backgrounds, relationships, and daily routines. If killed, they impart their last thought to Reid.<ref name=\"impart\" /> The \"Mesmerise\" ability can control the behaviour of weaker targets, like coercing them into revealing information,<ref name=\"coercing\" /> or guiding them to less conspicuous areas so as to feed without resorting to combat.<ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> With crafted medicine, Reid can heal injured or sick victims, whom if eaten,<ref name=\"boss\" /><ref name=\"if eaten\" /> will yield more experience points in the process;<ref name=\"more\" /> the rate of their affliction can be viewed using vampire senses,<ref name=\"affliction\" /> which also detect blood.<ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> Each of the four districts has a score based on the average health of its citizens.<ref name=\"four\" /><ref name=\"districts\" /> Reid navigates London using a [[waypoint]],<ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> and collectible documents are scattered around the city.<ref name=\"Billcliffe-Jun2018\" />\n\n[[File:Vampyr gameplay.gif|right|thumb|250px|Reid engages in combat with his enemies, using supernatural abilities.]]\n\nReid can wield improvised [[melee weapon]]s, such as a saw, as well as [[ranged weapon]]s including the [[Webley Revolver]].<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"webley\" /> Being able to use three-hit [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]], dodge rolls, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]],<ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> he can fight against other vampires like him\u2014[[aristocrat]]s who go by the name of Ekon; sewer-dwelling vampires known as Skals; the Vulkod\u2014a stronger breed of vampire resembling [[werewolves]]; Nemrod\u2014vampires who hunt their own kind;<ref name=\"ekon\" /> and the Guard of Priwen\u2014a secret society of [[Vampire hunter|vampire slayers]].<ref name=\"turned to\" /> [[Boss (video gaming)|Boss]] fights are featured,<ref name=\"boss\" /> and in some cases mandatory.<ref name=\"Variety-May2018\" /> Reid is adaptable to other vampire features, like the claws of a Vulkod.<ref name=\"ekon\" /> Weapon improvement through crafting is made possible by looting items. While using vampiric powers in combat, the character's blood bar drains. This forces him to feed so he can immediately replenish his strength.<ref name=\"E\" /><ref name=\"w4yp01nt\" /> With the vitality attained from killing a human being, he can boil the blood of his enemies, cast blood spears,<ref name=\"viable\" /> throw mist [[bomb]]s, and turn invisible.<ref name=\"Thirlwell-Feb2018\" /> He uses his control of shadows to hide himself and strike at his opponents.<ref name=\"ekon\" /> He can use \"Spring\" to scale locations otherwise out of reach and charge more rapidly across gaps,<ref name=\"third person\" /><ref name=\"mesmerise\" /> which is also useful for avoiding combat altogether.<ref name=\"altogether\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDoctor Jonathan Reid, returning to London from the [[Great War]] in 1918, awakes in a [[mass grave]] as a vampire. Overwhelmed with bloodlust, he causes the death of his sister Mary, who was searching for his body nearby. Reid takes shelter from vampire hunters in an abandoned house and starts hearing the disembodied voice of his maker, a typical feature in the progeny of vampires. Realising London is profuse with corpses, he follows a blood trail to a bar. The bartender points Reid to William Bishop, a suspicious patron. Bishop is caught feeding on a man named Sean Hampton and is killed by the vampire Lady Ashbury. Doctor Edgar Swansea rescues Hampton and hires Reid to practice medicine at Pembroke Hospital.\n\nAfter the room of patient Harriet Jones is found covered in blood and Hampton disappears, Reid tracks him down for questioning. Hampton insists he did not murder Jones and directs him to an underground haven for corrupted vampires known as Skals, where it is revealed that Jones faked her death. Reid later discovers a corpse in the street bearing his mother's [[brooch]]. He pursues the perpetrator towards the cemetery in [[Whitechapel]] and finds his sister Mary with their mother Emelyne, realising Mary was turned into a vampire the night he fed on her. Mary is intent on killing him to rid herself of his voice, but dies trying. Reid vows to uncover what is behind the Skal epidemic, which he learns has been mistaken for the [[Spanish flu]].\n\nLady Ashbury invites Reid to the [[West End of London|West End]] on behalf of the Ascalon Club, a secret society of highborn vampires. By the order of its leader Lord Redgrave, Reid roots out the source of Skals in the district. Swansea is later kidnapped and, once located, admits to attempting to heal Jones with Lady Ashbury's blood, thereby creating the Skal epidemic; once Ashbury finds out, she flees in shame. It is made known that the entity Myrddin, claimant to the role of Jonathan's maker, sired him to defeat his mother [[Morrigan]], also known as the \"Red Queen\", after she possessed Jones to wreak havoc upon London. Reid defeats Morrigan in battle, resolving then to travel after Lady Ashbury to her family castle, where she hid with her maker [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]].\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment began with a team of sixty people, later expanded to around eighty, many of whom worked on [[Dontnod Entertainment]]'s previous project ''[[Life Is Strange]]''.<ref name=\"more\" /><ref name=\"eighty\" /><ref name=\"MCV-Nov2017\" /> For a short time, the developer considered setting the game in [[United States in the 1950s|1950s America]],<ref name=\"America\" /> but after narrative director St\u00e9phane Beauverger joined the project,<ref name=\"MCV-Nov2017\" /> it was discarded to inspire a more [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] mood with focus on the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, set in London. The paintings of [[Phil Hale]] influenced the art style, also for the purpose of atmosphere.<ref name=\"tentative 17\" /> Dontnod researched the setting by visiting London and taking photographs,<ref name=\"more\" /> but since the city had been largely rebuilt, history books and documentaries concerning [[Whitechapel]], the [[London Docks]], and the [[Isle of Dogs]] were also consulted.<ref name=\"viable\" /> The literary sources ''Liquid History: The Thames Through Time'' and ''The Book of Facial Expressions: Babies to Teens'' provided [[Geography|geographical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] insight, respectively,<ref name=\"3dg3\" /> while the television series ''[[Casualty 1900s]]'' and ''[[The Knick]]'' were turned to for medical information.<ref name=\"turned to\" /> [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] was hired to voice Jonathan Reid.<ref name=\"VampyrGame-Jun2018\" /> The characters and dialogue were scripted by two French writers and translated into English by two native speakers. Dontnod decided on the British accent, though the marketing department wanted more.<ref name=\"Dealessandri-Jun2018\" /> The period was studied using both factual and fictional reference points{{efn|As such, the game world has been described as a [[uchronia]].<ref name=\"turned to\" />}} to create the visuals, realised with [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] lighting,<ref name=\"photorealistic\" /> and [[Image editing|post-processes]] running on the [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 4|Unreal Engine 4]].<ref name=\"information\" /><ref name=\"tentative 17\" /> [[Motion capture]] was used to track character movement.<ref name=\"O'Connor-Feb2018\" /> In August 2016, the major obstacles in developing the [[Xbox One]] version had been overcome with the assurance that there would be no downgrades despite its hardware disadvantages.<ref name=\"hardware\" /> The game has one [[Saved game|save slot]], a decision Dontnod made for in-game choices to have \"real, meaningful impact\"; to avoid corrupted saves, they implemented [[backup]] systems.<ref name=\"Ashaari-May2018\" />\n\nAdhering to either Reid's [[Hippocratic Oath#\"First do no harm\"|Hippocratic Oath]] or vampiric nature intends to explore the dualism of his survival as both a doctor and vampire.<ref name=\"tentative 17\" /><ref name=\"oath\" /> [[Olivier Deriviere]] served as the composer throughout development,<ref name=\"Banas-May2018\" /> infusing the score with [[industrial music]] to portray the solitude and inner struggle of the main character. Eric-Maria Couturier played the [[cello]], whose sounds were intended to go from \"emotional\" to \"bestial\".<ref name=\"Prell-Jan2018\" /> The [[bass flute]], [[piano]], [[double bass]], and [[cimbalom]] (chosen for how it reflected that period in London) were also employed, each characterising an aspect of the story. Deriviere saw the [[choir]] as representing an oppressive influence on the main character, and thought its combination with industrial music was effective given the amount of [[Audio editing software|post-processing]].<ref name=\"Stevens-May2018\" /> The soundtrack was released on 3 May 2018 on [[Bandcamp]], and launched on all digital platforms the day the game came out.<ref name=\"Frometa-May2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' was [[released to manufacturing]] in May 2018.<ref name=\"Hart-May2018\" />\n\n==Release==\nAfter a technical issue delayed it from its original November 2017 launch date, ''Vampyr'' was rescheduled for Q1/Q2 2018.<ref name=\"Romano-2017\" /> The final episode of a [[making-of]] video series revealed that it would be released on 5 June (for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and Xbox One).<ref name=\"O'Connor-Feb2018\" /><ref name=\"Wood-Jan2018\" /> Those who pre-ordered the game gained access to bonus [[downloadable content]] called \"The Hunters Heirlooms\", which contained exclusive in-game cosmetics.<ref name=\"hunters heirlooms\" /><ref name=\"Vampyr-Game\" /> If pre-ordered through select retailers in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], a [[phonograph record]] of the soundtrack was included.<ref name=\"DONTNOD_Ent-Apr2018\" />\n\nIn May 2018, Dontnod confirmed that ''Vampyr'' would not be using [[Denuvo Anti-Tamper]], a technology criticised for damaging [[computer performance]].<ref name=\"Luces-May2018\" /> A launch trailer came out the following month, leading up to the release.<ref name=\"Patino-Jun2018\" /> Two new difficulties, Story and Hard mode, launched on 26 September 2018.<ref name=\"Rutledge-Sep2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' was added to [[Xbox Game Pass]], a subscription-based service for Xbox One games, on 28 March 2019.<ref name=\"Phillips-Mar2019\" /> A [[Nintendo Switch]] version developed by [[Saber Interactive]] was released on 29 October 2019.<ref name=\"Bukacek-Sep2019\" /><ref name=\"Gamekult-Sep2019\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 72/100<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><br />(PS4) 70/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><br />(XONE) 70/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\" /><br />(NS) 69/100<ref name=\"MCNS\" />\n| Destruct = 6/10<ref name=\"Destruct\" />\n| EGM = 8/10<ref name=\"EGM\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRev\" />\n| GSpot = 7/10<ref name=\"GSpot\" />\n| GRadar = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"GRadar\" />\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n| PCGUS = 68/100<ref name=\"PCGUS\" />\n| VG = 7/10<ref name=\"VG\" />\n}}\n''Vampyr'' received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><ref name=\"MCXONE\" /> ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Kevin Mersereau enjoyed the dialogue conversations, atmosphere, and character development.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Emma Schaefer of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' declared Reid's dualism between doctor and vampire the title's greatest strength, while also praising the character development for imbuing \"even the lowest beggar\" with some importance.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> Matt Utley at ''[[Game Revolution]]'' enjoyed the atmosphere, each district's distinct look, and aspects of the combat.<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Writing for ''[[GameSpot]]'', Justin Clark was impressed with the effect of decisions and how this tied into the core gameplay, calling it \"empowering\". He also commended the \"enthralling\" characterisations, \"exquisite\" setting, and \"captivating\" voice acting.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> ''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Leon Hurley, like Schaefer, found the mechanic of testing Reid's morality compelling, calling the characters well-realised and integral. Also approved of was the \"atmospheric victorian London setting\".<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Brandin Tyrrel, writing for ''[[IGN]]'', termed ''Vampyr'' \"a fresh and genuine take\" on vampire mythology. He was generally satisfied with how choices turned out and said the recreation of London as a \"gloomy, somber city\" was bolstered by authentic characters, whose writing and performances he also enjoyed. Tyrrel welcomed the story and enjoyed the citizen mechanics,<ref name=\"IGN\" /> something Andy Kelly at ''[[PC Gamer]]'' also appreciated, hoping that more video games would follow suit. He called the dialogue-driven storytelling \"compelling\" and the setting \"atmospheric\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Alice Bell of ''VideoGamer.com'' wrote, \"''Vampyr'' serves delicious ladles of angst and drama with a hearty slice of excellent, morally grey choice system that will genuinely surprise you, all wrapped up in a wonderfully gloomy London\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\nConversely, Mersereau scolded the overall narrative for its \"threadbare\" contribution. He called the combat \"a low-grade ''[[The Witcher (video game)|Witcher]]'' knockoff\", complaining about its lack of precision and \"sloppy\" mechanics. Lengthy [[loading screen]]s and constant [[Hang (computing)|hangings]] were also cited as a source of annoyance.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Schaefer lambasted the animations for being \"a little wonky\" and the unpolished nature of the game.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> To Utley, ''Vampyr'' failed to impress, in particular its character development and impact of choice. He also had technical problems (low resolution, \"choppy\" performance, and lengthy loading times).<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Already frustrated with the combat, Clark said frame rate drops and frequent loading screens worsened the experience. He found that the narrative became weaker in the final chapters.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Hurley viewed the combat as \"functional at best\"; \"solid if uninventive\", and chastised how small decisions led to big mistakes, which he felt forfeited responsibility for one's actions.<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Tyrrel cited lip syncing as a primary concern of the animation, criticised the lack of variety in combat, and experienced the same technical difficulties as Mersereau, Utley, and Clark, albeit noting that they amounted to minor annoyances.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Kelly disliked the \"dull, repetitive\" combat sequences and, despite noting a variety of fighting styles, saw this ultimately as a \"tiresome\" distraction.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Agreeing with many others on the combat, Bell described it as continuously turning \"sour\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\n===Sales and accolades===\nFocus Home Interactive stated that ''Vampyr'' would be considered successful if it sold one million copies, although half would turn a profit.<ref name=\"Dealessandri-Nov2017\" /> It debuted in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France as the best-selling video game across all formats,<ref name=\"Handrahan-Jun2018\" /><ref name=\"Vincent-Jul2018\" /> reaching second place on the Italian chart (behind ''[[FIFA 18]]'').<ref name=\"Pugliese-Jun2018\" /> ''Vampyr'' sold 450,000 copies after one month of release,<ref name=\"Jones-Jul2018\" /> contributing to an increase of over twenty percent of its publisher's revenue for the first quarter of 2018.<ref name=\"Vincent-Jul2018\" /> That October, the publisher cited ''Vampyr'' as a key factor in its second quarter's [[\u20ac]]44.3 million revenue.<ref name=\"Wise-Oct2018\" /> By April 2019, ''Vampyr'' had sold one million copies; these sales contributed to a 22.1% rise in revenue for Dontnod, equivalent to a {{\u20ac|10.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} increase from the previous [[fiscal year]].<ref name=\"Actusnews-Apr2019-A\" /><ref name=\"Actusnews-Apr2019-B\" />\n\nAt [[E3 2017]], ''Vampyr'' received one of [[GamesRadar+]]'s Best of E3 awards<ref name=\"e32017\" /> and was nominated for [[GamesBeat]]'s Unreal Underdog award<ref name=\"bestofu\" /> and [[Game Critics Awards]]' Best RPG award.<ref name=\"bestofgca\" /><ref name=\"gc4w\" /> It was later nominated for the Best Console Game, Best Screenplay, and Best Soundtrack awards at the 2018 Ping Awards,<ref name=\"PingAwards-Nov2018\" /> and for \"Best Role-Playing Game\" at the [[Fun & Serious Game Festival|Titanium Awards]],<ref name=\"TitaniumAwards-Dec2018\" /> and won the \"Game, Original Role Playing\" award at the [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers|NAVGTR]] Awards, whereas its other nominations were for the \"Original Dramatic Score, New IP\" and \"Use of Sound, New IP\" awards.<ref name=\"NAVGTR-Feb2019\" /><ref name=\"NAVGTR-Mar2019\" />\n\n==Television adaptation==\nIn August 2018, it was announced that the television production company [[Fox 21 Television Studios]] had [[optioned]] ''Vampyr'' as a series, with [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] and DJ2 Entertainment also attached to the project.
