He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His [[alternating current]] (AC) [[induction motor]] and related [[polyphase system|polyphase]] AC patents, licensed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\n\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of [[wireless communication]] with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.<ref name=\"tsteslatower\">{{cite web|title=Tesla Tower in Shoreham, Suffolk County (Long Island), 1901\u201317) meant to be the \"World Wireless\" Broadcasting system|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslatower.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success.

Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system.

In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the \"instrument will&nbsp;... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".<ref>N.

In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the [[ozone]] generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by [[nitrous acid]]. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in [[waves in plasmas]]. These plasma waves can occur in [[force-free magnetic field]]s.<ref>Griffiths, David J.

He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His [[alternating current]] (AC) [[induction motor]] and related [[polyphase system|polyphase]] AC patents, licensed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\n\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of [[wireless communication]] with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.<ref name=\"tsteslatower\">{{cite web|title=Tesla Tower in Shoreham, Suffolk County (Long Island), 1901\u201317) meant to be the \"World Wireless\" Broadcasting system|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslatower.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success.

Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system.

It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition.

In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays.

In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the [[ozone]] generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by [[nitrous acid]].
