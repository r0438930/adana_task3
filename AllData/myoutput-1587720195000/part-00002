In a promissory coup, an incumbent elected government is deposed in a [[coup d'etat]] by coup leaders who claim to defend democracy and promise to hold elections in order to restore democracy. In these situations, coupmakers emphasize the temporary and necessary nature of their intervention in order to ensure democracy in the future.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is unlike the more open-ended coups that occurred during the Cold War. Political scientist Nancy Bermeo says that \"The share of successful coups that falls into the promissory category has risen significantly, from 35 percent before 1990 to 85 percent afterward.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Examining 12 promissory coups in democratic states between 1990 and 2012, Bermeo found that \"Few promissory coups were followed quickly by competitive elections, and fewer still paved the way for improved democracies.\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n* '''Executive aggrandizement.''' This process contains a series of institutional changes by the elected executives, impairing the ability of the political opposition to challenge the government and hold it to account. The most important feature of executive aggrandizement is that the institutional changes are made through legal channels, making it seem as if the elected official has a democratic mandate.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=How Democracies Die|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Ziblatt|first2=Daniel|publisher=Crown|year=2018|isbn=|location=United States|pages=76\u201378}}</ref> Some examples of executive aggrandizement are the decline of media freedom and the weakening of the [[rule of law]] (i.e., judicial and bureaucratic restraints on the government), such as when judicial autonomy is threatened.<ref name=\":02\" />\n* '''Strategic harassment and manipulation during elections.''' This form of democratic backsliding entails the impairment of [[free and fair elections]] through tactics such as blocking media access, disqualifying opposition leaders, or harassing opponents. This form of backsliding is done in such a way that the elections do not appear to be rigged and rarely involves any apparent violations of the law, making it difficult for international [[election monitoring]] organizations to observe or criticize these misconducts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nDemocratic backsliding is often led by democratically elected leaders, and uses tactics that are \"incremental rather than revolutionary.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://institute.global/sites/default/files/articles/The-Populist-Harm-to-Democracy-An-Empirical-Assessment.pdf|title=The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment|last=Kyle|first=Jordan|last2=Mounk|first2=Yascha|date=December 2018|publisher=Tony Blair Institute for Global Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This also makes it harder to pinpoint when a democracy breaks down, because as [[Steven Levitsky]] and [[Daniel Ziblatt]] pointed out, this happens \"slowly, in barely visible steps\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Causes of democratic backsliding==\n\n=== The Media ===\nThe Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem) contains more than eighteen-million data points relevant to democracy, measuring 350 highly specific indicators across 174 currently existing countries as of the end of 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mechkova|first=Valeriya|last2=L\u00fchrmann|first2=Anna|last3=Lindberg|first3=Staffan I.|date=2017|title=How Much Democratic Backsliding?|journal=Journal of Democracy|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=162\u2013169|doi=10.1353/jod.2017.0075|issn=1086-3214|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/052b0e535f6bc0da7bc418e74e614be39ef55154}}</ref> V-Dem's 2019 Democracy report discovered that the trend of autocratization continues, but global democracy levels are not in free fall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf |access-date=2 January 2020|title=Democracy Facing Global Challenges|last=|first=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|year=2019}}</ref> One of the main challenges V-Dem discovered to democracy was that freedom of expression and the media are the areas under the most severe attack by governments around the world, followed by closing space for civil society, and an erosion of the rule of law.

In fact, we suggest that populism tends to play a positive role in the promotion of an electoral or minimal democracy, but a negative role when it comes to fostering the development of a full-fledged liberal democratic regime. Consequently, while populism tends to favor the democratization of authoritarian regimes, it is prone to diminish the quality of liberal democracies.  Populism supports popular sovereignty, but it is inclined to oppose any limitations on majority rule, such as judicial independence and majority rights. Populism-in-power has led to processes of de-democratization (e.g., [[Viktor Orban|[Viktor] Orb\u00e1n]] in Hungary or [[Hugo Chavez|[Hugo] Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela) and, in some extreme cases, even to the breakdown of the democratic regime (e.g., [[Alberto Fujimori|[Alberto] Fujimori]] in Peru).<ref>[[Cas Mudde|Mudde, Cas]] and Kaltwasser, Crist\u00f3bal Rovira (2017) ''Populism: a Very Short Introduction''.

The authors examine the effect of populism on three major aspects of democracy: the quality of democracy in general, [[Checks and Balances|checks and balances]] on executive power and citizens' right to politically participate in a meaningful way. They conclude that populist governments are four times more likely to cause harm to democratic institutions than non-populist governments. Also, more than half of populist leaders have amended or rewritten the countries' constitution, frequently in a way that eroded checks and balances on executive power. Lastly, populists attack individual rights such as freedom of press, civil liberties and political rights.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn a 2018 journal article on democratic backsliding, scholars Licia Cianetti, James Dawson, and Se\u00e1n Hanley argued that the emergence of populist movements in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], such as [[Andrej Babi\u0161]]'s [[ANO 2011|ANO]] in the [[Czech Republic]], are \"a potentially ambiguous phenomenon, articulating genuine societal demands for political reform and pushing issues of good governance centre stage, but further loosening the weak checks and balances that characterise post-communist democracy and embedding private interests at the core of the state.\"<ref name=\"Cianetti\"/>\n\nIn a 2019 paper, presented to the International Society of Political Psychologists, Shawn Rosenberg argues that right wing populism is exposing a vulnerability in democratic structures and that \"democracy is likely to devour itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democracy Devouring Itself: The Rise of the Incompetent Citizen and the Appeal of Right Wing Populism|last=Rosenberg, S|date=2019-01-01|publisher=eScholarship, University of California|oclc=1055900632}}</ref>\n\n===Economic inequality and social discontent===\nMany [[political economy]] scholars, such as [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A.

In a promissory coup, an incumbent elected government is deposed in a [[coup d'etat]] by coup leaders who claim to defend democracy and promise to hold elections in order to restore democracy. In these situations, coupmakers emphasize the temporary and necessary nature of their intervention in order to ensure democracy in the future.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is unlike the more open-ended coups that occurred during the Cold War. Political scientist Nancy Bermeo says that \"The share of successful coups that falls into the promissory category has risen significantly, from 35 percent before 1990 to 85 percent afterward.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Examining 12 promissory coups in democratic states between 1990 and 2012, Bermeo found that \"Few promissory coups were followed quickly by competitive elections, and fewer still paved the way for improved democracies.\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n* '''Executive aggrandizement.''' This process contains a series of institutional changes by the elected executives, impairing the ability of the political opposition to challenge the government and hold it to account. The most important feature of executive aggrandizement is that the institutional changes are made through legal channels, making it seem as if the elected official has a democratic mandate.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=How Democracies Die|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Ziblatt|first2=Daniel|publisher=Crown|year=2018|isbn=|location=United States|pages=76\u201378}}</ref> Some examples of executive aggrandizement are the decline of media freedom and the weakening of the [[rule of law]] (i.e., judicial and bureaucratic restraints on the government), such as when judicial autonomy is threatened.<ref name=\":02\" />\n* '''Strategic harassment and manipulation during elections.''' This form of democratic backsliding entails the impairment of [[free and fair elections]] through tactics such as blocking media access, disqualifying opposition leaders, or harassing opponents. This form of backsliding is done in such a way that the elections do not appear to be rigged and rarely involves any apparent violations of the law, making it difficult for international [[election monitoring]] organizations to observe or criticize these misconducts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nDemocratic backsliding is often led by democratically elected leaders, and uses tactics that are \"incremental rather than revolutionary.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://institute.global/sites/default/files/articles/The-Populist-Harm-to-Democracy-An-Empirical-Assessment.pdf|title=The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assesment|last=Kyle|first=Jordan|last2=Mounk|first2=Yascha|date=December 2018|publisher=Tony Blair Institute for Global Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This also makes it harder to pinpoint when a democracy breaks down, because as [[Steven Levitsky]] and [[Daniel Ziblatt]] pointed out, this happens \"slowly, in barely visible steps\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Causes of democratic backsliding==\n\n=== The Media ===\nThe Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem) contains more than eighteen-million data points relevant to democracy, measuring 350 highly specific indicators across 174 currently existing countries as of the end of 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mechkova|first=Valeriya|last2=L\u00fchrmann|first2=Anna|last3=Lindberg|first3=Staffan I.|date=2017|title=How Much Democratic Backsliding?|journal=Journal of Democracy|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=162\u2013169|doi=10.1353/jod.2017.0075|issn=1086-3214|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/052b0e535f6bc0da7bc418e74e614be39ef55154}}</ref> V-Dem's 2019 Democracy report discovered that the trend of autocratization continues, but global democracy levels are not in free fall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf |access-date=2 January 2020|title=Democracy Facing Global Challenges|last=|first=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|year=2019}}</ref> One of the main challenges V-Dem discovered to democracy was that freedom of expression and the media are the areas under the most severe attack by governments around the world, followed by closing space for civil society, and an erosion of the rule of law.

In fact, we suggest that populism tends to play a positive role in the promotion of an electoral or minimal democracy, but a negative role when it comes to fostering the development of a full-fledged liberal democratic regime. Consequently, while populism tends to favor the democratization of authoritarian regimes, it is prone to diminish the quality of liberal democracies.  Populism supports popular sovereignty, but it is inclined to oppose any limitations on majority rule, such as judicial independence and majority rights. Populism-in-power has led to processes of de-democratization (e.g., [[Viktor Orban|[Viktor] Orb\u00e1n]] in Hungary or [[Hugo Chavez|[Hugo] Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuala) and, in some extreme cases, even to the breakdown of the democratic regime (e.g., [[Alberto Fujimori|[Alberto] Fujimori]] in Peru).<ref>[[Cas Mudde|Mudde, Cas]] and Kaltwasser, Crist\u00f3bal Rovira (2017) ''Populism: a Very Short Introduction''.

The authors examine the effect of populism on three major aspects of democracy: the quality of democracy in general, [[Checks and Balances|checks and balances]] on executive power and citizens' right to politically participate in a meaningful way. They conclude that populist governments are four times more likely to cause harm to democratic institutions than non-populist governments. Also, more than half of populist leaders have amended or rewritten the countries' constitution, frequently in a way that eroded checks and balances on executive power. Lastly, populists attack individual rights such as freedom of press, civil liberties and political rights.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn a 2018 journal article on democratic backsliding, scholars Licia Cianetti, James Dawson, and Se\u00e1n Hanley argued that the emergence of populist movements in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], such as [[Andrej Babi\u0161]]'s [[ANO 2011|ANO]] in the [[Czech Republic]], are \"a potentially ambiguous phenomenon, articulating genuine societal demands for political reform and pushing issues of good governance centre stage, but further loosening the weak checks and balances that characterise post-communist democracy and embedding private interests at the core of the state.\"<ref name=\"Cianetti\"/>\n\nIn a 2019 paper, presented to the International Society of Political Psychologists, Shawn Rosenberg argues that right wing populism is exposing a vulnerability in democratic structures and that \"democracy is likely to devour itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democracy Devouring Itself: The Rise of the Incompetent Citizen and the Appeal of Right Wing Populism|last=Rosenberg, S|date=2019-01-01|publisher=eScholarship, University of California|oclc=1055900632}}</ref>\n\n===Economic inequality and social discontent===\nMany [[political economy]] scholars, such as [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A.
