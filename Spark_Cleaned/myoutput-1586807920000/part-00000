It conducts research, development, test, and evaluation of aerospace systems from concept to deployment. It has test flown every aircraft in the Army Air Force's and the Air Force's inventory since World War II. The center employs nearly 13,000 people, and controls the second largest base in the Air Force.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6573 |title=AFFTC Fact Sheet |access-date=22 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602024549/http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6573 |archive-date=2 June 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nOn 6 July 2012, the previous Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) was redesignated as the Air Force Test Center (AFTC).<ref name=\"af.mil\">[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123309070 AFFTC to be re-designated as Air Force Test Center]</ref> Up until July 2012, the AFTC consisted of two subordinate wings. The [[95th Air Base Wing]] (95 ABW) provided installation support for all units on [[Edwards Air Force Base]] while the [[412th Test Wing]] (412 TW) conducted aircraft testing and evaluation at Edwards. In July 2012, the redesignated [[96th Test Wing]] (96 TW), an amalgamation of the former 96th Air Base Wing, the former [[46th Test Wing]] and the former [[Air Armament Center]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida, and the [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]] at [[Arnold Air Force Base]], Tennessee, also came under control of the AFTC.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Air Force Test Center (AFTC) conducts developmental and follow-on testing and evaluation of manned and unmanned aircraft and related avionics, flight-control, and weapon systems. AFTC also operates the USAF Test Pilot School, which trains test pilots, flight-test engineers, and flight-test navigators.\n\nThe Center has tested all the aircraft types in the Air Force inventory, and the center's work force\u2014civilian, military and contractor\u2014work together to flight test and evaluate new aircraft and upgrades to aircraft already in inventory for Air Force units, the Department of Defense, NASA and other government agencies. Upgrades to be tested here include improvements to radar, weapons-delivery and navigation systems, and a system to give tactical pilots the ability to strike ground targets from low altitudes at night and in adverse weather.\n\nThe Air Force Test Center develops, operates and maintains the Edwards Flight Test Range and Utah Test and Training Range. It also operates the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. The Center provides test infrastructure, overhead support for development, and operational test and evaluation support for aerospace research vehicles. AFFTC resources include the test and evaluation mission simulator, the Benefield Anechoic Chamber, Ridley Mission Control, and the Integration Facility for Avionics Systems Testing.\n\n==Units==\n[[File:HQ 412th Test Wing - Edwards AFB California.jpg|thumb|Headquarters, 412th Test Wing]]\n[[File:HQ USAF Test Pilot School - Edwards AFB California.jpg|thumb|Headquarters, USAF Test Pilot School.]]\n* [[412th Test Wing]] (Tail Code: ED)<ref name=\"Units\">[http://www.edwards.af.mil/units/index.asp Edwards AFB Units] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923235325/http://www.edwards.af.mil/units/index.asp |date=23 September 2015 }}</ref>\n: The 412th Test Wing plans, conducts, analyzes, and reports on all flight and ground testing of aircraft, weapons systems, software and components as well as modeling and simulation for the U.S. Air Force.

It dates to 17 February 1942 when the 477th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron (Reduced) was moved from [[Wright Field]], Ohio to the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range.   Its mission was to test the secret Bell Aircraft [[XP-59]]A jet fighter.<ref name=\"AFMC\">[https://www.scribd.com/doc/45555113/Air-Force-Flight-Test-History  Against the Wind, 90 Years of Flight Testing in the Miami Valley,  History office, Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, 1993]</ref> Muroc was chosen as it was a secluded site in the Mojave Desert out of the public eye.  The first XP-59A aircraft arrived on 21 September 1942 for ground tests and it was fitted with a dummy propeller attached to its nose, just in case the curious might see it and start asking why this aircraft didn't have a propeller.<ref name=\"ATS\">[http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/afhistory/AFFTC1961Opt.pdf  K286.69.37, Volume 1, History of the Air Force FLight Test Center, Air Force Systems Command, AFHRA, 1961.]</ref>\n\nOn 30 September, Bell's test pilot Robert Stanley was undergoing some high-speed taxiing trials with the XP-59A when the aircraft \"inadvertently\" became airborne for a short time, reaching an altitude of ten feet for one-half-mile during high speed taxi tests.   However, the first official flight was on 1 October with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Royal Air Force, Army, Bell and General Electric personnel on hand.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n[[File:XP-80A Gray Ghost af.jpg|thumb|Lockheed XP-80A, AAF Ser. No. 44-83021, Gray Ghost in flight.]]\nXP-59 aircraft testing continued at Muroc for the remainder of 1942 and in 1943.  The second XP-59A flew on 15 February 1943 and the third late in April.  Shortly before the first flight of the XP-59A, the USAAF had placed an order for one hundred P-59A Airacomets. However, the performance of the XP-59A service test aircraft had proved to be rather disappointing, not even up to the standards of conventional piston-engined fighter aircraft already in service with the USAAF. It was considered rather unlikely that any appreciable improvements in the performance of the P-59 would be soon be forthcoming, and by the early fall of 1943 the Airacomet was no longer considered by the USAAF as being worthy of consideration as an operational combat type.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nMost of the P-59s went to the [[Fourth Air Force]] [[412th Fighter Group]] where they served in the training role. The Airacomets provided USAAF pilots and ground crews with valuable data about the difficulties and pitfalls involved in converting to jet aircraft. This information proved quite useful when more advanced jet fighters finally became available in quantity.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1944, [[Eighth Air Force]] tested its [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es along with [[P-51D Mustang]]s against the XP-59 to see how well they stood up against the jet.  The results were obvious.   Also in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at Muroc for experimental work in rocket firing, remaining until the end of 1945.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nAlthough the XP-59A provided valuable experience to the USAAF in the operation of jet-powered aircraft, it was basically a flying testbed and not a combat-capable aircraft. The USAAF had to look elsewhere in its search for an effective jet fighter.   The first flight of the [[Lockheed XP-80]] took place on 8 January 1944 with test pilot Milo Burcham at the controls. The XP-80 was eventually transferred to the 412th Fighter Group for tactical evaluation.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\n===Postwar era===\n[[File:YB49-6 300.jpg|thumb|left|The Northrop YB-49 on a test flight, 1949]]\nFollowing the war flight testing officially became the base's primary mission. Test work on the Lockheed P-80, the successor to the XP-59 was undertaken for the greater part of 1945. The [[Convair XP-81]] and [[Republic XP-84]] Thunderjet arrived at Muroc in 1946 for testing. It was clear by this time that the base's mission would be a proving ground for aircraft and a testing site for experimental aircraft.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nOn 14 October 1947, Captain [[Charles E. Yeager]], piloted the [[Bell X-1]] to a speed of 760 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier for the first time. In the years since, multiple generations of experimental \"X-Planes\" have been tested and flown at Edwards, for the Air Force and other agencies, such as NASA.<ref name=\"ATS\"/> Simultaneously, the base was hosting testing for proposed weapon systems including the [[F-84 Thunderjet]], [[F-86 Sabre]], [[F-94 Starfire]], and [[B-45 Tornado]].<ref name=\"James O.

On this first flight, the aircraft was flown from Hawthorne to Muroc, a flight lasting 45 minutes.  The propeller-driven XB-35 however, was considered outdated and it was replaced by the jet-powered [[YB-49]] on 21 October 1947 from the [[Northrop Field]] at Hawthorne, California, piloted by Northrop's chief test pilot, Max Stanley. At the end of the flight, it landed at Muroc Air Force Base where it was to carry out its test program. On the morning of 5 June 1948, XB-49 42-102368 crashed just north of Muroc Dry Lake. The pilot, Air Force Capt. Glenn Edwards, and all four other members of the crew were killed. In 1951 Muroc AFB was re-designated '''Edwards Air Force Base''' in his honor.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\n===Air Force Flight Test Center===\n[[File:North American X-15A 56-6671.jpg|thumb|North American X-15A, AF Ser.

Later modified as an X-15A-2, it is now on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|NMUSAF]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio.]]\nWith the transfer of Edwards AFB from Air Materiel Command to the newly created Air Research and Development Command, the postwar 2759th Experimental Wing was inactivated, being replaced by the Air Force Flight Test Center on 25 June 1951.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nTechnology pioneered through the AFTC led to remarkable advancements in aviation.  The \"[[Century Series]]\" of aircraft, the [[F-100 Super Sabre]]; [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], the Mach 2 [[F-104 Starfighter]]; [[F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[F-106 Delta Dart]] made supersonic flight commonplace in combat aircraft.  The Century Series fighters defined the basic speed and altitude envelopes for fighters that are still in effect today.  Meanwhile, the aircraft of the X series continued to set speed and altitude records.<ref name=\"EAFB\">Edwards Air Force Base Guide, Edwards AFB Public Affairs Office, 2013</ref>\n\nThe 1960s ushered in the Space Age.  The Test Pilot School was re-designated as the Aerospace Research Pilot School as it began to train future astronauts.   The [[North American X-15]] arrived and began to explore hypersonic and exoatmospheric flight.  Major [[Robert Michael White|Robert \"Bob\" White]] became the first person to fly an aircraft into space on 17 July 1962 when he flew his [[North American X-15|X-15]] to an altitude of 314,750 feet.  Flying the same airframe a year later [[Joseph Albert Walker|Joe Walker]] reached an altitude of 354,200 feet (67 miles).  On 3 October 1967 [[William J. Knight|William \"Pete\" Knight]] set the standing aircraft speed record of Mach&nbsp;6.72 (4,520&nbsp;mph), again flying an X-15.  When the space program began a number of [[astronaut]]s were selected from the Air Force's test pilot cadre.  Additionally, the AFTC assisted with the testing of rocket engines and re-entry vehicles.<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\"/><ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n[[File:North American XB-70 above runway ECN-792.jpg|thumb|left|XB-70A Valkyrie on takeoff|alt=White delta-wing aircraft taking off with landing gears retracting. At the front of aircraft are canards.]]\nAlong with the X-15, pilots at Edwards were expanding the frontiers of atmospheric flight, testing the [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] high-altitude bomber, along with the [[YF-12]] interceptor for [[Air Defense Command]] and the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] Strategic Reconnaissance aircraft for [[Strategic Air Command]].<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n\nWith the decline of the military manned space mission after the [[NASA]] Lunar Landing Program ended, the Aerospace Research Pilot School was once again re-designated as the USAF Test Pilot School.   The school replaced its space-oriented curriculum with an entire new battery of courses focusing on systems and test management.   New aircraft arrived in the 1970s with the McDonnell [[F-15 Eagle]]. Two major \"fly-offs\" were conducted, one between the [[Northrop YA-9]] and the [[Fairchild Republic YA-10]], the other between the [[Northrop YF-17]] and [[General Dynamics YF-16]].  The Rockwell [[B-1 Lancer]] began flight testing in 1974 with its multitude of highly sophisticated offensive and defensive systems.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n\nIn April 1981, the wheels of [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] touched down on Rogers Dry Lakebed, with Astronauts John Young and Robert Crippin successfully landing the first orbiting space vehicle ever to leave the Earth under rocket power and return to Earth aerodynamically for re-use.  The \"Flying Wing\" returned to Edwards in the late 1980s when the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber began testing, and at a remote site, the [[F-117A Nighthawk]] stealth fighter.  [[Air-Launched Cruise Missile]], and [[LANTIRN]] systems were also tested during the 1980s.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n\nThe 1990s saw the arrival of the Lockheed YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23 prototype fighters, both using stealth technology and designed for air supremacy with agility, high-speed and supersonic cruise capability.  Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was tested that has subsequently been used extensively for high-level reconnaissance in the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq began testing in February 1998.   The MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper attack counterparts, tested at Edwards, today fill a critical role in the Global War on Terrorism.\n[[File:YAL-1A Airborne Laser unstowed crop.jpg|thumb|YAL-1A Airborne Laser undergoing flight testing.]]\nMore recently the AFTC has been part of the [[ASM-135 ASAT|anti-satellite missile]] and [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] development.  Additionally, the center has played a key role in the development of the Air Force's X-35A and X-32A prototypes for the Joint Strike Fighter program, both making their first flights in late 2000.  The resulting [[F-35 Lightning II]] is being built in three versions for the Air Force, the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as multiple allied military partners.<ref name=\"James O.

It dates to 17 February 1942 when the 477th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron (Reduced) was moved from [[Wright Field]], Ohio to the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range.   Its mission was to test the secret Bell Aircraft [[XP-59]]A jet fighter.<ref name=\"AFMC\">[https://www.scribd.com/doc/45555113/Air-Force-Flight-Test-History  Against the Wind, 90 Years of Flight Testing in the Miami Valley,  History office, Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, 1993]</ref> Muroc was chosen as it was a secluded site in the Mojave Desert out of the public eye.  The first XP-59A aircraft arrived on 21 September 1942 for ground tests and it was fitted with a dummy propeller attached to its nose, just in case the curious might see it and start asking why this aircraft didn't have a propeller.<ref name=\"ATS\">[http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/afhistory/AFFTC1961Opt.pdf  K286.69.37, Volume 1, History of the Air Force FLight Test Center, Air Force Systems Command, AFHRA, 1961.]</ref>\n\nOn 30 September, Bell's test pilot Robert Stanley was undergoing some high-speed taxiing trials with the XP-59A when the aircraft \"inadvertently\" became airborne for a short time, reaching an altitude of ten feet for one-half-mile during high speed taxi tests.   However, the first official flight was on 1 October with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Royal Air Force, Army, Bell and General Electric personnel on hand.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n[[File:XP-80A Gray Ghost af.jpg|thumb|Lockheed XP-80A, AAF Ser. No. 44-83021, Gray Ghost in flight.]]\nXP-59 aircraft testing continued at Muroc for the remainder of 1942 and in 1943.  The second XP-59A flew on 15 February 1943 and the third late in April.  Shortly before the first flight of the XP-59A, the USAAF had placed an order for one hundred P-59A Airacomets. However, the performance of the XP-59A service test aircraft had proved to be rather disappointing, not even up to the standards of conventional piston-engined fighter aircraft already in service with the USAAF. It was considered rather unlikely that any appreciable improvements in the performance of the P-59 would be soon be forthcoming, and by the early fall of 1943 the Airacomet was no longer considered by the USAAF as being worthy of consideration as an operational combat type.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nMost of the P-59s went to the [[Fourth Air Force]] [[412th Fighter Group]] where they served in the training role. The Airacomets provided USAAF pilots and ground crews with valuable data about the difficulties and pitfalls involved in converting to jet aircraft. This information proved quite useful when more advanced jet fighters finally became available in quantity.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1944, [[Eighth Air Force]] tested its [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es along with [[P-51D Mustang]]s against the XP-59 to see how well they stood up against the jet.  The results were obvious.   Also in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at Muroc for experimental work in rocket firing, remaining until the end of 1945.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nAlthough the XP-59A provided valuable experience to the USAAF in the operation of jet-powered aircraft, it was basically a flying testbed and not a combat-capable aircraft. The USAAF had to look elsewhere in its search for an effective jet fighter.   The first flight of the [[Lockheed XP-80]] took place on 8 January 1944 with test pilot Milo Burcham at the controls. The XP-80 was eventually transferred to the 412th Fighter Group for tactical evaluation.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\n===Postwar era===\n[[File:YB49-6 300.jpg|thumb|left|The Northrop YB-49 on a test flight, 1949]]\nFollowing the war flight testing officially became the base's primary mission. Test work on the Lockheed P-80, the successor to the XP-59 was undertaken for the greater part of 1945. The [[Convair XP-81]] and [[Republic XP-84]] Thunderjet arrived at Muroc in 1946 for testing. It was clear by this time that the base's mission would be a proving ground for aircraft and a testing site for experimental aircraft.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nOn 14 October 1947, Captain [[Charles E. Yeager]], piloted the [[Bell X-1]] to a speed of 760 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier for the first time. In the years since, multiple generations of experimental \"X-Planes\" have been tested and flown at Edwards, for the Air Force and other agencies, such as NASA.<ref name=\"ATS\"/> Simultaneously, the base was hosting testing for proposed weapon systems including the [[F-84 Thunderjet]], [[F-86 Sabre]], [[F-94 Starfire]], and [[B-45 Tornado]].<ref name=\"James O.

On this first flight, the aircraft was flown from Hawthorne to Muroc, a flight lasting 45 minutes.  The propeller-driven XB-35 however, was considered outdated and it was replaced by the jet-powered [[YB-49]] on 21 October 1947 from the [[Northrop Field]] at Hawthorne, California, piloted by Northrop's chief test pilot, Max Stanley. At the end of the flight, it landed at Muroc Air Force Base where it was to carry out its test program. On the morning of 5 June 1948, XB-49 42-102368 crashed just north of Muroc Dry Lake. The pilot, Air Force Capt. Glenn Edwards, and all four other members of the crew were killed. In 1951 Muroc AFB was re-designated '''Edwards Air Force Base''' in his honor.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\n===Air Force Flight Test Center===\n[[File:North American X-15A 56-6671.jpg|thumb|North American X-15A, AF Ser. No. 56-6671, with test pilots at Edwards AFB, California. 56-6671 was extensively damaged during an emergency landing at Edwards AFB on 9 November 1962 with John McKay at the controls. Later modified as an X-15A-2, it is now on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|NMUSAF]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio.]]\nWith the transfer of Edwards AFB from Air Materiel Command to the newly created Air Research and Development Command, the postwar 2759th Experimental Wing was inactivated, being replaced by the Air Force Flight Test Center on 25 June 1951.<ref name=\"ATS\"/>\n\nTechnology pioneered through the AFTC led to remarkable advancements in aviation.  The \"[[Century Series]]\" of aircraft, the [[F-100 Super Sabre]]; [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], the Mach 2 [[F-104 Starfighter]]; [[F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[F-106 Delta Dart]] made supersonic flight commonplace in combat aircraft.  The Century Series fighters defined the basic speed and altitude envelopes for fighters that are still in effect today.  Meanwhile, the aircraft of the X series continued to set speed and altitude records.<ref name=\"EAFB\">Edwards Air Force Base Guide, Edwards AFB Public Affairs Office, 2013</ref>\n\nThe 1960s ushered in the Space Age.  The Test Pilot School was re-designated as the Aerospace Research Pilot School as it began to train future astronauts.   The [[North American X-15]] arrived and began to explore hypersonic and exoatmospheric flight.  Major [[Robert Michael White|Robert \"Bob\" White]] became the first person to fly an aircraft into space on 17 July 1962 when he flew his [[North American X-15|X-15]] to an altitude of 314,750 feet.  Flying the same airframe a year later [[Joseph Albert Walker|Joe Walker]] reached an altitude of 354,200 feet (67 miles).  On 3 October 1967 [[William J. Knight|William \"Pete\" Knight]] set the standing aircraft speed record of Mach&nbsp;6.72 (4,520&nbsp;mph), again flying an X-15.  When the space program began a number of [[astronaut]]s were selected from the Air Force's test pilot cadre.  Additionally, the AFTC assisted with the testing of rocket engines and re-entry vehicles.<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\"/><ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n[[File:North American XB-70 above runway ECN-792.jpg|thumb|left|XB-70A Valkyrie on takeoff|alt=White delta-wing aircraft taking off with landing gears retracting. At the front of aircraft are canards.]]\nAlong with the X-15, pilots at Edwards were expanding the frontiers of atmospheric flight, testing the [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] high-altitude bomber, along with the [[YF-12]] interceptor for [[Air Defense Command]] and the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] Strategic Reconnaissance aircraft for [[Strategic Air Command]].<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n\nWith the decline of the military manned space mission after the [[NASA]] Lunar Landing Program ended, the Aerospace Research Pilot School was once again re-designated as the USAF Test Pilot School.   The school replaced its space-oriented curriculum with an entire new battery of courses focusing on systems and test management.   New aircraft arrived in the 1970s with the McDonnell [[F-15 Eagle]]. Two major \"fly-offs\" were conducted, one between the [[Northrop YA-9]] and the [[Fairchild Republic YA-10]], the other between the [[Northrop YF-17]] and [[General Dynamics YF-16]].  The Rockwell [[B-1 Lancer]] began flight testing in 1974 with its multitude of highly sophisticated offensive and defensive systems.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n\nIn April 1981, the wheels of [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] touched down on Rogers Dry Lakebed, with Astronauts John Young and Robert Crippin successfully landing the first orbiting space vehicle ever to leave the Earth under rocket power and return to Earth aerodynamically for re-use.  The \"Flying Wing\" returned to Edwards in the late 1980s when the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber began testing, and at a remote site, the [[F-117A Nighthawk]] stealth fighter.  [[Air-Launched Cruise Missile]], and [[LANTIRN]] systems were also tested during the 1980s.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n\nThe 1990s saw the arrival of the Lockheed YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23 prototype fighters, both using stealth technology and designed for air supremacy with agility, high-speed and supersonic cruise capability.  Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was tested that has subsequently been used extensively for high-level reconnaissance in the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq began testing in February 1998.   The MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper attack counterparts, tested at Edwards, today fill a critical role in the Global War on Terrorism.\n[[File:YAL-1A Airborne Laser unstowed crop.jpg|thumb|YAL-1A Airborne Laser undergoing flight testing.]]\nMore recently the AFTC has been part of the [[ASM-135 ASAT|anti-satellite missile]] and [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] development.  Additionally, the center has played a key role in the development of the Air Force's X-35A and X-32A prototypes for the Joint Strike Fighter program, both making their first flights in late 2000.  The resulting [[F-35 Lightning II]] is being built in three versions for the Air Force, the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as multiple allied military partners.<ref name=\"James O. Young, The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center\"/> [[NASA]] maintains its [[Armstrong Flight Research Center]] on Edwards and partners with the AFFTC on aircraft development.<ref name=\"EAFB\"/>\n\nEffective 6 July 2012, it was re-designated from the Air Force Flight Test Center to the Air Force Test Center, part of a new five-center construct across Air Force Materiel Command.
