Odom played for [[Wayland Baptist University|Wayland Baptist]] from 1953 to 1956 during which the team began a streak of 131 consecutive victories (the longest streak in college and professional sports team history).{{r|amarillo}}  Odom was a member of the [[United States women's national basketball team|U.S. women's national team]] which won the Gold Medal in [[basketball at the 1955 Pan American Games]]. In 2011 she was inducted into the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Biography==\nOdom was born November 29, 1933 in [[Washington, Oklahoma]]; her parents were David Hiram Odom{{r|obit}} (a farmer){{r|txmonth}} and Opal Lee Odom (nee Millican).{{r|obit}}\n\nThe family moved to [[Dimmitt, Texas]], in 1948.{{r|obit}} At [[Dimmitt High School]] she played four seasons of basketball, scoring 4,022 points{{r|pshof}} and averaging 41 points per game.{{r|txmonth}}{{r|pshof}} In 1951 she set the Texas single-game scoring record of 78 points.{{r|wbhof}}{{r|plainview}} She led her high school team to state titles three times (1950\u20131952){{r|wbhof}} and was selected for Texas All-State honors each of those seasons.{{r|wbhof}} Odom helped lead the Dimmitt team to victory over the [[Iowa]] state champions twice,{{r|plainview}} beating Slater High 47\u201320 in 1950 and Hansell High 39\u201330 in 1951.{{r|iowa1950}}{{r|iowa1951}}\n\n===AAU===\nOdom went on to play for the [[Wayland Baptist University|Wayland Baptist]] team in [[Plainview, Texas]] from 1952 through 1956. At the time the school played against women's [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) teams, most of which were run as semi-professional teams and were sponsored by businesses. Wayland convinced local businessman Claude Hutcherson, who ran a passenger and cargo air service in town, to fly the team to its away games. The team was renamed \"Hutcherson Flying Queens\" and became one of the most successful AAU women's teams.{{r|txmonth}}\n\nDuring her time at Wayland the team went 115\u20135,{{r|wbhof}} and began a series of 131 consecutive wins which ended in 1958.{{r|amarillo}} This 131 game run remains the longest winning streak in college and professional basketball history.{{r|wbu}} Odom was the team's top offensive player all four years, and she was the first Wayland player to become a four-time [[All-American]].{{r|amarillo}} The team won three [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] titles while she was at Wayland,{{r|pshof}} and she was the 1956 AAU Tournament [[MVP]].{{r|wbhof}} Two of her years Wayland went undefeated (1953\u201354 and 1954\u201355). While she played, Wayland teams set several school records which still stand including season wins (37 in 1952\u201353), consecutive wins (131 from 1953\u201358), and best defensive average (29.4 points per game in 1954\u201355).{{r|plainview}}\n\nFormer Wayland coach Harley Redin said of Odom, \"She was such a great post player. Her fundamentals were just perfect. She was just exceptional at faking and getting good, accurate shots.\"{{r|plainview}} Redin imposed some rules on his team, including that the players could not be married. (He thought it was unacceptable for women to travel without their husbands on road games). When Lometa's boyfriend in Dimmitt, Eloy Powell, proposed to her, she told him they had to wait. Just a few weeks later, Powell was killed by a train returning home from a visit to the campus. In 2013 Odom said, \"I thought I\u2019d never get over it, losing him. Some days I just wanted to go back to the farm. But I stayed. I knew I couldn\u2019t let the Flying Queens or my daddy down.\"{{r|txmonth}}\n\nOdom was chosen for the women's basketball team to represent the U.S. at the Second [[Pan American Games]] in March 1955{{r|panam1955}} in [[Mexico City]].{{r|wbhof}} The U.S. team went 8\u20130 and captured the gold medal.{{r|panam1955}}\n\n===Later life===\nAfter retiring as a player, Odom coached high school basketball and taught school for 37 years{{r|obit}} at schools including [[Gruver High School]], [[Spearman High School]], [[White Deer High School]], Coronado Junior High{{r|pshof}} and [[Plainview High School (Texas)|Plainview High School]] before retiring in 1994.{{r|obit}}{{r|plainview}} She was a member of the [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]], the [[National Science Teachers Association]] and the Texas High School Coaches Association.{{r|obit}}\n\nShe moved to [[Canyon, Texas]] in 2003 and then to [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] in 2010.{{r|plainview}} She died January 27, 2017 in Amarillo and is buried at Westlawn Memorial Park in Dimmitt.{{r|obit}}{{r|wbuobit}}\n\n===Honors===\nShe was named to the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] Hall of Fame in 1968.{{r|wbhof}} She was the first woman{{r|wbhof}} inducted into the Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame{{r|wbhof}} and the Texas Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame.{{r|pshof}} She was inducted into the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2011.{{r|wbhof}} The Hall of Fame inducted the Flying Queens in 2013 for their role in basketball history and the 131-game winning streak, naming the team \"Trailblazers of the
