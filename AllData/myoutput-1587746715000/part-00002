He writes: \"Two and a half miles from the sea, the Skien river flows into the [[fjord]], and that place is called Porsgrund.\" The name was probably given during medieval times to the then [[swamp]]y area by the [[nun]]s of [[Gims\u00f8y Abbey]], who went here to collect the shrub ''[[Myrica gale|pors]]'' (\"Bog Myrtle\"), and the Norwegian word ''grunn'' meaning \"ground\". Prior to 1931, the name was spelled \"Porsgrund\".\n\n===Coat-of-arms===\nThe [[coat of arms]] is from modern times.  They were granted on 16 January 1905.  The arms were devised in 1905 when the city needed a new [[Porsgrunn City Hall|city hall]]. The silver [[bend (heraldry)|bend]] is the small river running through the city.

Also in this period, Porsgrunn was considered the cultural centre of Norway. On the ecclesiastical side, Porsgrunn was separated from the ancient rural parishes of [[Eidanger]], [[Solum, Norway|Solum]], and [[Gjerpen]] in [[1764 in Norway|1764]] to become a [[prestegjeld]] with its own minister.  Churches within the Porsgrunn prestegjeld include [[\u00d8stre Porsgrunn Church]] and [[Vestre Porsgrunn Church]].  The city was granted limited city status in [[1807 in Norway|1807]], but this was expanded to full city status in 1842.\n\nPorsgrunn was once home to ''[[Skomv\u00e6r (barque)|Skomv\u00e6r]]'', the country's largest [[sailing ship]].  In 1985, the sculpture ''[[Amphitrite, the wave and the sea birds]]'' was unveiled in Porsgrunn.  The sculpture, which is one of [[J\u00f8rleif Uthaug]]'s best known works, has a nautical theme in honor of Porsgrunn's maritime history.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:The Porsgrunn River.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The river flowing through the town]]\nPorsgrunn borders the municipalities of [[Skien]] and [[Siljan, Norway|Siljan]] to the north, [[Bamble]] in the west, and [[Larvik]] in the east. It is part of a cluster of municipalities in southern [[Telemark]] that constitute the [[Grenland]] area of Norway. The city is situated near [[Gunneklevfjord]], and at the mouth of the river ''[[Telemarksvassdraget]]'' or Porsgrunn River (''Porsgrunnselva'').
