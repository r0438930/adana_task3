A Misl could be composed of a few hundred to tens of thousands soldiers. Any soldier was free to join whichever Misl he wished, and was free to cancel his membership of the Misl to whom he belonged. He could, if he wanted, cancel his membership of his old Misl and join another. The Barons would allow their armies to combine or coordinate their defences together against a hostile force if ordered by the Misldar Supreme Commander. These orders were only issued in military matters affecting the whole [[Sikh]] community. These orders would normally be related to defense against external threats, such as Afghan military attacks. The profits of a fighting action were divided by the misls to individuals based on the service rendered after the conflict using the [[#Administration|sardari system]].\n\nThe '''Sikh Confederacy''' is a description of the [[political]] structure, of how all the Barons' Kingdoms interacted with each other [[politically]] together in [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Although misls varied in strength, the use of primarily [[light cavalry]] with a smaller amount [[heavy cavalry]] was uniform throughout all of the Sikh misls. Cavalrymen in a misl were required to supply their own horses and equipment.<ref name=\"Singh 1963 page=23\">{{Harvnb|Singh|1963|page=23}}</ref> A standard cavalryman was armed with a [[spear]], [[matchlock]], and [[scimitar]].<ref name=\"Francklin1805\">{{cite book|last=Francklin|first=William|title=Military memoirs of Mr. George Thomas; who, by extraordinary talents and enterprise, rose from an obscure situation to the rank of a general, in the service of the native powers in the North-West of India|url=https://archive.org/details/militarymemoirs01frangoog|accessdate=30 June 2010|year=1805|publisher=Reprinted for John Stockdale|page=[https://archive.org/details/militarymemoirs01frangoog/page/n110 107]}}</ref> How the armies of the Sikh misls received payment varied with the leadership of each misl.

The misls adapted their tactics to their strength in cavalry and weakness in artillery and avoided pitched battles. Misls organized their armies around bodies of horsemen and their units fought battles in a series of skirmishes, a tactic which gave them an advantage over fighting pitched battles. Bodies of cavalry would attack a position, retreat, reload their muskets, and return to attack it again. The tactics used by misl field armies include [[Flanking maneuver#Maneuvering|flanking]] an enemy, obstructing river passages, cutting off a unit from its supplies, intercepting messengers, attacking isolated units like foraging parties, employing [[hit-and-run tactics]], overrunning camps, and attacking [[baggage train]]s. To fight large armies the misl would completely evacuate the areas in front of the enemy's marching route but follow in the rear of the opposition and reconquer areas the enemy had just captured, threaten agents of the enemy with retribution, and sweep over the countryside in the wake of the enemy's withdrawal.\n\nThe ''Running Skirmish'' was a tactic unique to the Sikh cavalrymen which was notable for its effectiveness and the high degree of skill required to execute it. [[George Thomas (soldier)|George Thomas]] and George Forster, contemporary writers who witnessed it described its use separately in their accounts of the military of the Sikhs. George Forster noted:\n\n\"A party from forty to fifty, advance in a quick pace to a distance of carbine shot from the enemy and then, that the fire may be given with the greatest certainty, the horses are drawn up and their pieces discharged, when speedily, retiring about a 100 paces, they load and repeat the same mode of annoying the enemy. Their horses have been so expertly trained to a performance of this operation that on receiving a stroke of hand, they stop from a full canter.\"\n\n==Administration==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NJSA.jpg|thumb|[[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]], leader of the [[Ahluwalia Misl]]]] -->\n\n{{Quote|quote  = The remainder was separated into Puttees or parcels for each Surkunda, and these were again subdivided and parcelled out to inferior leaders, according to the number of horse they brought into the field. Each took his portion as a co-sharer, and held it in absolute independence.|source = ''Origin of the Sikh power in the Punjab'' (1834) p.&nbsp;33 \u2013 [[Henry Thoby Prinsep]]}}\n\nThe Sikh Misls had four different classes of administrative divisions. The patadari, misaldari, tabadari, and jagirdari were the different systems of [[land tenure]] used by the misls, and land granted by the misl left the responsibility of establishing law and order to the owner of the land. The land under the direct administration of the chief of the misl was known as the ''sardari'' and the tabadari and jagirdari systems used land directly given by the chief from the sardari. The patadari and misaldari systems formed the basis of a misl, while tabadari and jagirdari lands would only be created after large acquisitions of land. The type of system that was used in an area depended on the importance of the chief [[sardar]] of the area to the rest of the misl.\n\nThe ''Patadari system'' affected newly annexed territories and was the original method used by the misls in administrating land.<ref>{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=33}}</ref> The patadari system relied on the cooperation of surkundas, the rank of a leader of a small party of [[cavalrymen]]. The chief of the misl would take his/her portion and divide the other parcels among his [[Sardar]]s proportional to the number of [[cavalrymen]] they had contributed to the misl.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=34\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34}}</ref> The Sardars would then divide their parcels among their Surkundas, and then the Surkundas subdivided the land they received among their individual cavalrymen. The Surkundas receiving parcels of land with settlements were required to fortify them{{#tag:ref|The owners of larger villages were required to erect [[stockade]]s and [[Ditch (fortification)|ditches]] while the owners of towns erected either [[keep]]s or [[fort]]s<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=34\"/>|group=note}} and establish fines and laws for their [[zamindar]]s and [[ryot]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34\u201335}}</ref> Parcels of land in the patadari system could not be sold, but could be given to relatives in an [[inheritance]].<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=35}}</ref> The soldiers who received parcels from the Patadari system held their land in complete freedom.<ref name=\"Kakshi 2007 page=73\"/>\n\nThe ''Misaldari system'' applied to sardars with a small number of cavalrymen as well as independent bodies of cavalrymen who voluntarily attached themselves to a misl.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\"/> They kept the lands they held before joining the misl as an allotment for their cooperation with the misl. The leaders of these groups, called misaldars, could transfer their allegiance and land to another misl without punishment.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\"/>\n\nThe ''Tabadari system'' referred to land under the control of a misl's tabadars. Tabadars served a similar function to retainers in Europe. They were required to serve as cavalrymen to the misl and were subservient to the misl's leader. Although tabadars received their land as a reward, their ownership was subject entirely on the misl's leader.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=36}}</ref> The tabadari grants were only hereditary on the choice of the chief of the misl.\n\nThe ''Jagirdari system'' used the grant of [[jagir]]s by the chief of the misl. [[Jagir]]s were given by the chief of the misl to relations, dependents, and people who \"deserved well\".<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\"/> The owners of jagirs were subservient to the chief of the misl as their ownership was subject to his/her needs.

A Misl could be composed of a few hundred to tens of thousands soldiers. Any soldier was free to join whichever Misl he wished, and was free to cancel his membership of the Misl to whom he belonged. He could, if he wanted, cancel his membership of his old Misl and join another. The Barons would allow their armies to combine or coordinate their defences together against a hostile force if ordered by the Misldar Supreme Commander. These orders were only issued in military matters affecting the whole [[Sikh]] community. These orders would normally be related to defense against external threats, such as Afghan military attacks. The profits of a fighting action were divided by the misls to individuals based on the service rendered after the conflict using the [[#Administration|sardari system]].\n\nThe '''Sikh Confederacy''' is a description of the [[political]] structure, of how all the Barons' Kingdoms interacted with each other [[politically]] together in [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Although misls varied in strength, the use of primarily [[light cavalry]] with a smaller amount [[heavy cavalry]] was uniform throughout all of the Sikh misls. Cavalrymen in a misl were required to supply their own horses and equipment.<ref name=\"Singh 1963 page=23\">{{Harvnb|Singh|1963|page=23}}</ref> A standard cavalryman was armed with a [[spear]], [[matchlock]], and [[scimitar]].<ref name=\"Francklin1805\">{{cite book|last=Francklin|first=William|title=Military memoirs of Mr. George Thomas; who, by extraordinary talents and enterprise, rose from an obscure situation to the rank of a general, in the service of the native powers in the North-West of India|url=https://archive.org/details/militarymemoirs01frangoog|accessdate=30 June 2010|year=1805|publisher=Reprinted for John Stockdale|page=[https://archive.org/details/militarymemoirs01frangoog/page/n110 107]}}</ref> How the armies of the Sikh misls received payment varied with the leadership of each misl.

The misls adapted their tactics to their strength in cavalry and weakness in artillery and avoided pitched battles. Misls organized their armies around bodies of horsemen and their units fought battles in a series of skirmishes, a tactic which gave them an advantage over fighting pitched battles. Bodies of cavalry would attack a position, retreat, reload their muskets, and return to attack it again. The tactics used by misl field armies include [[Flanking maneuver#Maneuvering|flanking]] an enemy, obstructing river passages, cutting off a unit from its supplies, intercepting messengers, attacking isolated units like foraging parties, employing [[hit-and-run tactics]], overrunning camps, and attacking [[baggage train]]s. To fight large armies the misl would completely evacuate the areas in front of the enemy's marching route but follow in the rear of the opposition and reconquer areas the enemy had just captured, threaten agents of the enemy with retribution, and sweep over the countryside in the wake of the enemy's withdrawal.\n\nThe ''Running Skirmish'' was a tactic unique to the Sikh cavalrymen which was notable for its effectiveness and the high degree of skill required to execute it. [[George Thomas (soldier)|George Thomas]] and George Forster, contemporary writers who witnessed it described its use separately in their accounts of the military of the Sikhs. George Forster noted:\n\n\"A party from forty to fifty, advance in a quick pace to a distance of carbine shot from the enemy and then, that the fire may be given with the greatest certainty, the horses are drawn up and their pieces discharged, when speedily, retiring about a 100 paces, they load and repeat the same mode of annoying the enemy. Their horses have been so expertly trained to a performance of this operation that on receiving a stroke of hand, they stop from a full canter.\"\n\n==Administration==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NJSA.jpg|thumb|[[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]], leader of the [[Ahluwalia Misl]]]] -->\n\n{{Quote|quote  = The remainder was separated into Puttees or parcels for each Surkunda, and these were again subdivided and parcelled out to inferior leaders, according to the number of horse they brought into the field.

The patadari, misaldari, tabadari, and jagirdari were the different systems of [[land tenure]] used by the misls, and land granted by the misl left the responsibility of establishing law and order to the owner of the land. The land under the direct administration of the chief of the misl was known as the ''sardari'' and the tabadari and jagirdari systems used land directly given by the chief from the sardari. The patadari and misaldari systems formed the basis of a misl, while tabadari and jagirdari lands would only be created after large acquisitions of land. The type of system that was used in an area depended on the importance of the chief [[sardar]] of the area to the rest of the misl.\n\nThe ''Patadari system'' affected newly annexed territories and was the original method used by the misls in administrating land.<ref>{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=33}}</ref> The patadari system relied on the cooperation of surkundas, the rank of a leader of a small party of [[cavalrymen]]. The chief of the misl would take his/her portion and divide the other parcels among his [[Sardar]]s proportional to the number of [[cavalrymen]] they had contributed to the misl.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=34\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34}}</ref> The Sardars would then divide their parcels among their Surkundas, and then the Surkundas subdivided the land they received among their individual cavalrymen. The Surkundas receiving parcels of land with settlements were required to fortify them{{#tag:ref|The owners of larger villages were required to erect [[stockade]]s and [[Ditch (fortification)|ditches]] while the owners of towns erected either [[keep]]s or [[fort]]s<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=34\"/>|group=note}} and establish fines and laws for their [[zamindar]]s and [[ryot]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34\u201335}}</ref> Parcels of land in the patadari system could not be sold, but could be given to relatives in an [[inheritance]].<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=35}}</ref> The soldiers who received parcels from the Patadari system held their land in complete freedom.<ref name=\"Kakshi 2007 page=73\"/>\n\nThe ''Misaldari system'' applied to sardars with a small number of cavalrymen as well as independent bodies of cavalrymen who voluntarily attached themselves to a misl.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\"/> They kept the lands they held before joining the misl as an allotment for their cooperation with the misl. The leaders of these groups, called misaldars, could transfer their allegiance and land to another misl without punishment.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=35\"/>\n\nThe ''Tabadari system'' referred to land under the control of a misl's tabadars. Tabadars served a similar function to retainers in Europe. They were required to serve as cavalrymen to the misl and were subservient to the misl's leader. Although tabadars received their land as a reward, their ownership was subject entirely on the misl's leader.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\">{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=36}}</ref> The tabadari grants were only hereditary on the choice of the chief of the misl.\n\nThe ''Jagirdari system'' used the grant of [[jagir]]s by the chief of the misl. [[Jagir]]s were given by the chief of the misl to relations, dependents, and people who \"deserved well\".<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\"/> The owners of jagirs were subservient to the chief of the misl as their ownership was subject to his/her needs. Like the Tabadars, jagirdars were subject to personal service when the chief of the misl requested.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\"/> However, because jagirs entailed more land and profit, they were required to use the money generated by their jagirs to equip and mount a quota of [[cavalrymen]] depending on the size of their jagir.<ref name=\"Prinsep 1834 page=36\"/> Jagirdari grants were hereditary in practice but a misl's chief could revoke the rights of the heir. Upon the death of the owner of a tabadari or jagadari grant, the land would revert to direct control of the chief (sardari).\n\n==Territory==\n[[File:PunjabDoabs.png|thumb|right|200px|A map of the [[Punjab region]] showing the different doabs]]\nThe two main divisions in territory between the misls were between those who were in the [[Malwa]] region and those who were in the [[Majha]] region.
