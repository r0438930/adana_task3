In 1887, Italian hotelier Antoine Sella bought the property, and opened the Grand H\u00f4tel du Cap in 1889. In 1914, the Eden Roc pavillon was built 400 yards away from the main hotel. [[Gerald and Sara Murphy]], a young American couple who had expatriated to [[France]] in the 1920s, once rented the hotel for an entire summer, a unique event for the era as the [[French Riviera]] was not a summer destination at the time, but a winter escape for the wealthy. With the Murphys came many writers and artists of the [[Lost Generation]], including [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].
