It served a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.  Rectors adopted a traditional Anglican Sunday liturgical pattern of Holy Communion, Morning Prayer and Evensong, and promoted well-supported educational and social activities like Ladies\u2019 and Men\u2019s Guilds, scouts and guides and youth groups.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church, Vancouver BC, 1959.jpg|thumb|Patrick Ellis (rector, 1951 - 1960) addresses the congregation at Morning Prayer, Christmas 1959]]  \n\nMortgage costs associated with extending the parish hall were exacerbated by the mid-thirties depression.

The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.
