These include:\n* Using Wikipedia's history functionality, which retains all prior versions of an article, restoring the article to the last version before the vandalism occurred; this is called ''reverting'' vandalism.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> The majority of vandalism on Wikipedia is reverted quickly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hicks|first=Jesse|title=This machine kills trolls|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|work=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=18 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827115824/http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|archive-date=27 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> There are various ways in which the vandalism gets detected so it can be reverted:\n**'''Bots''': In many cases, the vandalism is automatically detected and reverted by a [[internet bot|bot]] (robot). The vandal is always warned with no human intervention.\n** '''Recent changes patrol''': Wikipedia has a special page that lists all the most recent changes. Some editors will monitor these changes for possible vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA122#v=onepage|title=Wikipedia: the missing manual|last=Broughton|first=John|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=0-596-51516-2|location=|page=122|pages=}}</ref>\n** '''Watchlists''': Any registered user can watch a page that they have created or edited or that they otherwise have an interest in. This functionality also enables users to monitor a page for vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />\n** '''Incidental discovery''': Any reader who comes across vandalism by chance can revert it. In 2008, it was reported that the rarity of such incidental discovery indicated the efficacy of the other methods of vandalism removal.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />\n* Locking articles so only established users, or in some cases, only administrators can edit them.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> ''Semi-protected'' articles are those that can only be edited by those with an account that is considered to be ''autoconfirmed'' \u2013 an account that is at least 4 days old with at least 10 edits, for most accounts. ''Fully protected articles'' are those that can only be edited by administrators. Protection is generally instituted after one or more editors makes a request on a special page for that purpose, and an administrator familiar with the protection guidelines chooses whether or not to fulfill this request based on the guidelines.\n* Blocking and banning those who have repeatedly committed acts of vandalism from editing for a period of time or in some cases, indefinitely.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> Vandals are not blocked as an act of punishment&nbsp;\u2013 the purpose of the block is simply to [[preventive action|prevent]] further damage.<ref name=\"Broughton134\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton|first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>\n* The \"abuse filter\" extension, which uses [[regular expressions]] to detect common vandalism terms.<ref>See [[Wikipedia:Edit filter]]</ref>\nEditors are generally warned prior to being blocked. Wikipedia employs a 4-stage warning process up to a block. This includes:<ref name=\"Broughton130\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton |first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |pages=130\u201331 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>\n#The first warning [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assumes good faith]] and takes a relaxed approach to the user.

This occurred after inaccurate information was added to Wikipedia in which a journalist was accused of taking part in Kennedy's assassination.<ref name=\"newscientist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |title=Wikipedia tightens editorial rules after complaint&nbsp;\u2013 06 December 2005 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015074757/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWikipedia has experimented with systems in which edits to some articles, especially those of living people, are delayed until it can be reviewed and determined that they are not vandalism, and in some cases, that a source to verify accuracy is provided.

Titles on the blacklist can only be created by or moved to by administrators.  Pages that are also created repeatedly can be protected to prevent vandals from recreating bad pages.\n\nIn addition to the title blacklist, the spam blacklist prevents external link [[spamming]], a form of vandalism.  New/unregistered users who want to add external links are required to answer a [[CAPTCHA]].\n\nThe \"bad image list\" prevents images that could be used to vandalize pages from being inserted, such as images with sexual content. Images on the list can only be added to pages where the use of the image is explicitly allowed.\n\nThe entirety of the MediaWiki namespace, the main page, and high risk templates are protected to prevent high server load and sudden interface changes.\n\nThe edit filter can also prevent vandalism by disallowing the bad edit altogether.\n\n== Notable acts of vandalism ==\n\n=== Seigenthaler incident ===\n{{main|Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident}}\n[[File:John Seigenthaler Sr. speaking.jpg|thumb|alt=White-haired elderly gentleman in suit and tie speaks at a podium.|[[John Seigenthaler]], who in 2005 criticized Wikipedia]]\nIn May 2005, a user edited the [[biography|biographical]] article about [[John Seigenthaler, Sr.]] so that it contained several false and [[defamation|defamatory]] statements.<ref name=SeigenthalerUSAToday>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=29 November 2005|title=A false Wikipedia \"biography\"|first=John|last=Seigenthaler|authorlink=John Seigenthaler|access-date=17 September 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64PWOeCKO?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|archive-date=3 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The inaccurate claims went unnoticed between May and September 2005, when they were discovered by [[Victor S.

Wikipedia content is often mirrored at sites such as [[Answers.com]], which means that incorrect information can be replicated alongside correct information through a number of websites. Such information can develop a misleading air of authority because of its presence at such sites:<ref name=SeigenthalerABC>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1613571.htm|title=Mistakes and hoaxes on-line|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 April 2006|accessdate=28 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608054128/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1613571.htm|archive-date=8 June 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{quote|\nThen [Seigenthaler's] son discovered that his father's hoax biography also appeared on two other sites, Reference.com and Answers.com, which took direct feeds from Wikipedia.

This was in response to a [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] hypothesis that mass editing of the [[Sarah Palin]] page the day before she was announced as [[John McCain]]'s running mate could help predict who would be chosen as [[Mitt Romney]]'s running mate in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]]. After Colbert's request and his viewers' subsequent actions, all these articles were put under {{srlink|Wikipedia:Protection policy#Semi-protection|semi-protection}} by Wikipedia administrators, with editing restricted to established users.<ref>{{cite web | title=Stephen Colbert's Wikipedia Vice Presidential Scheme Short Circuited | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stephen-colberts-wikipedia-vice-presidential-359985 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=8 August 2012 | accessdate=8 August 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811002143/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stephen-colberts-wikipedia-vice-presidential-359985 | archive-date=11 August 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhen Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] appeared as a guest on 24 May 2007 episode of ''The Colbert Report'', they discussed Colbert-related vandalism.

The vandal is always warned with no human intervention.\n** '''Recent changes patrol''': Wikipedia has a special page that lists all the most recent changes. Some editors will monitor these changes for possible vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA122#v=onepage|title=Wikipedia: the missing manual|last=Broughton|first=John|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=0-596-51516-2|location=|page=122|pages=}}</ref>\n** '''Watchlists''': Any registered user can watch a page that they have created or edited or that they otherwise have an interest in. This functionality also enables users to monitor a page for vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />\n** '''Incidental discovery''': Any reader who comes across vandalism by chance can revert it. In 2008, it was reported that the rarity of such incidental discovery indicated the efficacy of the other methods of vandalism removal.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />\n* Locking articles so only established users, or in some cases, only administrators can edit them.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> ''Semi-protected'' articles are those that can only be edited by those with an account that is considered to be ''autoconfirmed'' \u2013 an account that is at least 4 days old with at least 10 edits, for most accounts. ''Fully protected articles'' are those that can only be edited by administrators. Protection is generally instituted after one or more editors makes a request on a special page for that purpose, and an administrator familiar with the protection guidelines chooses whether or not to fulfill this request based on the guidelines.\n* Blocking and banning those who have repeatedly committed acts of vandalism from editing for a period of time or in some cases, indefinitely.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> Vandals are not blocked as an act of punishment&nbsp;\u2013 the purpose of the block is simply to [[preventive action|prevent]] further damage.<ref name=\"Broughton134\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton|first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>\n* The \"abuse filter\" extension, which uses [[regular expressions]] to detect common vandalism terms.<ref>See [[Wikipedia:Edit filter]]</ref>\nEditors are generally warned prior to being blocked.

This occurred after inaccurate information was added to Wikipedia in which a journalist was accused of taking part in Kennedy's assassination.<ref name=\"newscientist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |title=Wikipedia tightens editorial rules after complaint&nbsp;\u2013 06 December 2005 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015074757/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWikipedia has experimented with systems in which edits to some articles, especially those of living people, are delayed until it can be reviewed and determined that they are not vandalism, and in some cases, that a source to verify accuracy is provided.

Titles on the blacklist can only be created by or moved to by administrators.  Pages that are also created repeatedly can be protected to prevent vandals from recreating bad pages.\n\nIn addition to the title blacklist, the spam blacklist prevents external link [[spamming]], a form of vandalism.  New/unregistered users who want to add external links are required to answer a [[CAPTCHA]].\n\nThe \"bad image list\" prevents images that could be used to vandalize pages from being inserted, such as images with sexual content. Images on the list can only be added to pages where the use of the image is explicitly allowed.\n\nThe entirety of the MediaWiki namespace, the main page, and high risk templates are protected to prevent high server load and sudden interface changes.\n\nThe edit filter can also prevent vandalism by disallowing the bad edit altogether.\n\n== Notable acts of vandalism ==\n\n=== Seigenthaler incident ===\n{{main|Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident}}\n[[File:John Seigenthaler Sr. speaking.jpg|thumb|alt=White-haired elderly gentleman in suit and tie speaks at a podium.|[[John Seigenthaler]], who in 2005 criticized Wikipedia]]\nIn May 2005, a user edited the [[biography|biographical]] article about [[John Seigenthaler, Sr.]] so that it contained several false and [[defamation|defamatory]] statements.<ref name=SeigenthalerUSAToday>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=29 November 2005|title=A false Wikipedia \"biography\"|first=John|last=Seigenthaler|authorlink=John Seigenthaler|access-date=17 September 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64PWOeCKO?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|archive-date=3 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The inaccurate claims went unnoticed between May and September 2005, when they were discovered by [[Victor S.

This was in response to a [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] hypothesis that mass editing of the [[Sarah Palin]] page the day before she was announced as [[John McCain]]'s running mate could help predict who would be chosen as [[Mitt Romney]]'s running mate in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]].
