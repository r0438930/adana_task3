The first match began on 10 February 1996, in which Deep Blue became the first machine to win [[Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1996, Game 1|a chess game against a reigning world champion]] ([[Garry Kasparov]]) under regular time controls. However, Kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games, beating Deep Blue by a score of 4\u20132 (wins count 1 point, draws count \u00bd point).  The match concluded on 17 February 1996.\n\nDeep Blue was then heavily upgraded (unofficially nicknamed \"Deeper Blue\")<ref>[http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/games/game2/html/c.2.shtml IBM Research Game 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019031508/http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/games/game2/html/c.2.shtml |date=19 October 2007 }}, Deep Blue [[IBM]]</ref> and played Kasparov again in May 1997, winning the six-game rematch 3\u00bd\u20132\u00bd, ending on 11 May. Deep Blue won the deciding [[Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1997, Game 6|game six]] after Kasparov made a mistake in the opening, becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls.\n\nThe system derived its playing strength mainly from [[brute-force search|brute force]] computing power. It was a [[massively parallel]], [[IBM Scalable POWERparallel|RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC]]-based system with 30 nodes, with each node containing a 120&nbsp;MHz [[POWER2|P2SC]] [[microprocessor]], enhanced with 480 special purpose [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] chess chips. Its chess playing program was written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and ran under the [[AIX operating system|AIX]] [[operating system]]. It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second, twice as fast as the 1996 version. In June 1997, Deep Blue was the 259th most powerful [[supercomputer]] according to the [[TOP500]] list, achieving 11.38 [[GFLOPS]] on the High-Performance [[LINPACK]] benchmark.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/list/1997/06/300 TOP500 Super Computer List \u2013 June 1997 (201\u2013300)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213103245/http://www.top500.org/list/1997/06/300 |date=13 February 2009 }} Top500.org</ref>\n\nThe Deep Blue chess computer that defeated [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and eight moves to a maximum of twenty or even more moves in some situations.<ref>Campbell 1998, p. 88.</ref> [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]] and [[Monty Newborn]] estimate that one additional [[Ply (game theory)|ply]] (half-move) increases the playing strength between 50 and 70 [[Elo rating system|Elo]] points.<ref>Levy & Newborn 1991, p. 192</ref>\n\n[[File:Kasparov Magath 1985 Hamburg-2.png|thumb|Kasparov in 1985]]\n\nDeep Blue's [[evaluation function]] was initially written in a generalized form, with many to-be-determined parameters (e.g. how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center, etc.). The optimal values for these parameters were then determined by the system itself, by analyzing thousands of master games. The evaluation function had been split into 8,000 parts, many of them designed for special positions. In the opening book there were over 4,000 positions and 700,000 [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] games. The endgame database contained many six-piece endgames and five or fewer piece positions. Before the second match, the chess knowledge of the program was fine-tuned by grandmaster [[Joel Benjamin]]. The opening library was provided by grandmasters [[Miguel Illescas]], [[John Fedorowicz]], and [[Nick de Firmian]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/18/nyregion/what-deep-blue-learned-in-chess-school.html|title=What Deep Blue Learned in Chess School|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=1997-05-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> When Kasparov requested that he be allowed to study other games that Deep Blue had played so as to better understand his opponent, IBM refused.

IBM denied that it cheated, saying the only human intervention occurred between games. The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games, an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer's play that were revealed during the course of the match.

The first match began on 10 February 1996, in which Deep Blue became the first machine to win [[Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1996, Game 1|a chess game against a reigning world champion]] ([[Garry Kasparov]]) under regular time controls. However, Kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games, beating Deep Blue by a score of 4\u20132 (wins count 1 point, draws count \u00bd point).  The match concluded on 17 February 1996.\n\nDeep Blue was then heavily upgraded (unofficially nicknamed \"Deeper Blue\")<ref>[http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/games/game2/html/c.2.shtml IBM Research Game 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019031508/http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/games/game2/html/c.2.shtml |date=19 October 2007 }}, Deep Blue [[IBM]]</ref> and played Kasparov again in May 1997, winning the six-game rematch 3\u00bd\u20132\u00bd, ending on 11 May. Deep Blue won the deciding [[Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1997, Game 6|game six]] after Kasparov made a mistake in the opening, becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls.\n\nThe system derived its playing strength mainly from [[brute-force search|brute force]] computing power. It was a [[massively parallel]], [[IBM Scalable POWERparallel|RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC]]-based system with 30 nodes, with each node containing a 120&nbsp;MHz [[POWER2|P2SC]] [[microprocessor]], enhanced with 480 special purpose [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] chess chips. Its chess playing program was written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and ran under the [[AIX operating system|AIX]] [[operating system]]. It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second, twice as fast as the 1996 version. In June 1997, Deep Blue was the 259th most powerful [[supercomputer]] according to the [[TOP500]] list, achieving 11.38 [[GFLOPS]] on the High-Performance [[LINPACK]] benchmark.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/list/1997/06/300 TOP500 Super Computer List \u2013 June 1997 (201\u2013300)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213103245/http://www.top500.org/list/1997/06/300 |date=13 February 2009 }} Top500.org</ref>\n\nThe Deep Blue chess computer that defeated [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and eight moves to a maximum of twenty or even more moves in some situations.<ref>Campbell 1998, p. 88.</ref> [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]] and [[Monty Newborn]] estimate that one additional [[Ply (game theory)|ply]] (half-move) increases the playing strength between 50 and 70 [[Elo rating system|Elo]] points.<ref>Levy & Newborn 1991, p. 192</ref>\n\n[[File:Kasparov Magath 1985 Hamburg-2.png|thumb|Kasparov in 1985]]\n\nDeep Blue's [[evaluation function]] was initially written in a generalized form, with many to-be-determined parameters (e.g. how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center, etc.). The optimal values for these parameters were then determined by the system itself, by analyzing thousands of master games. The evaluation function had been split into 8,000 parts, many of them designed for special positions. In the opening book there were over 4,000 positions and 700,000 [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] games. The endgame database contained many six-piece endgames and five or fewer piece positions. Before the second match, the chess knowledge of the program was fine-tuned by grandmaster [[Joel Benjamin]]. The opening library was provided by grandmasters [[Miguel Illescas]], [[John Fedorowicz]], and [[Nick de Firmian]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/18/nyregion/what-deep-blue-learned-in-chess-school.html|title=What Deep Blue Learned in Chess School|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=1997-05-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> When Kasparov requested that he be allowed to study other games that Deep Blue had played so as to better understand his opponent, IBM refused.

IBM denied that it cheated, saying the only human intervention occurred between games. The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games, an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer's play that were revealed during the course of the match.
