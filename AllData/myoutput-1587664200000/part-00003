By analogy with the biogenetic law of [[recapitulation theory]] he puts forward the hypothesis of the basic law of evolution of mankind, describe the relationship between human development and evolution of the human brain: the evolution of human population actually repeats the evolution of the number of nerve cells in the brain, as a consequence, - evolution of mankind repeats some of the information and functional characteristics of the brain. \nLiving currently on the planet people are heirs of the world's richest cultural heritage in industrial, public, and mentally, - genetic keepers [[memory]] of global intellectual system.

Joint global highly intelligent activity of humanity has led in the second half of the twentieth century to the acts, showing the unity and the level of intellectual potential of humanity: organization of the UN, the victory over smallpox, the use of atomic energy, space exploration, organization of the satellite television, satellite navigation systems, etc. \nOpening, further searching and researchs in the twenty-first century formulas of intellect and mathematical foundations of the mind, the translation of \"intellectual\" in the plane of mathematical physiology and physics could, according to Alexey Eryomin, would can to contribute to a number of useful things.

By analogy with the biogenetic law of [[recapitulation theory]] he puts forward the hypothesis of the basic law of evolution of mankind, describe the relationship between human development and evolution of the human brain: the evolution of human population actually repeats the evolution of the number of nerve cells in the brain, as a consequence, - evolution of mankind repeats some of the information and functional characteristics of the brain. \nLiving currently on the planet people are heirs of the world's richest cultural heritage in industrial, public, and mentally, - genetic keepers [[memory]] of global intellectual system.

Joint global highly intelligent activity of humanity has led in the second half of the twentieth century to the acts, showing the unity and the level of intellectual potential of humanity: organization of the UN, the victory over smallpox, the use of atomic energy, space exploration, organization of the satellite television, satellite navigation systems, etc. \nOpening, further searching and researchs in the twenty-first century formulas of intellect and mathematical foundations of the mind, the translation of \"intellectual\" in the plane of mathematical physiology and physics could, according to Alexey Eryomin, would can to contribute to a number of useful things.
