Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered [[book]]lets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text (much like today's [[Stock photography|stock photos]]), and were often read aloud to an audience.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.europeana.eu/2019/08/chapbooks-the-poor-persons-reading-material/|title=Chapbooks: the poor person's reading material|last=Hagan|first=Dr. Anette|date=August 2019|website=[[Europeana]] (CC By-SA)|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]].\n\nThe tradition of chapbooks arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tale]]s, [[ballads]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tract]]s.\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are ''[[biblioth\u00e8que bleue]]'' (blue library) and ''Volksbuch'' (people's book), respectively. In Spain they were known as ''[[Cordel_literature|pliegos de cordel]]'' (Cordel sheets).<ref>From ''[[chapmen]]'', chap, a variety of [[peddler]], which folks circulated such literature as part of their stock.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Spufford, Margaret |date=1984|title= The Great Reclothing of Rural England|publisher= Hambledon Press|location= London|isbn= 0-907628-47-8|author-link=Margaret_Spufford}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author= Leitch, R. |date=1990|title='Here Chapman Billies Take Their Stand': A Pilot Study of Scottish Chapmen, Packmen and Pedlars|work=Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquarians 120|pages= 173\u2013188}}</ref> ''[[Lubok]]'' is the Russian equivalent of the chapbook.<ref>Lyons, Martyn.

The first element of ''chapman'' comes in turn from Old English ''c\u0113ap'' ('barter, business, dealing')<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.vv. ''chap-book, n.'' and ''chapman, n.''.</ref> from which is subsequently derived the modern adjective ''cheap.''\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fairies dancing in a ring woodcut.png|thumb|Woodcut of a [[fairy-circle]] from a 17th-century chapbook]]\n[[Broadside ballads]] were popular songs, sold for a [[penny]] or [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] in the streets of towns and villages around Britain between the 16th century and early 20th centuries. They preceded chapbooks, but had similar content, marketing and distribution systems. There are records from [[Cambridgeshire]] as early as in 1553 of a man offering a scurrilous ballad \"maistres mass\" at an [[alehouse]], and a pedlar selling \"lytle books\" to people, including a patcher of old clothes in 1578. These sales are probably characteristic of the market for chapbooks.\n\nChapbooks gradually disappeared from the mid-19th century in the face of competition from cheap newspapers and, especially in Scotland, religious tract societies that regarded them as \"ungodly\". Although the form originated in Britain, many were made in the U.S. during the same period.\n\nBecause of their flimsy nature such [[ephemera]] rarely survive as individual items. They were aimed at buyers without formal libraries and, in an era when paper was expensive, were used for wrapping or baking. Paper has also always had hygienic uses; there are contemporary references to the use of chapbooks as [[toilet paper|\"bum fodder\"]]{{cn|date=April 2020}}. Many of the surviving chapbooks come from the collections of [[Samuel Pepys]] between 1661 and 1688 which are now held at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. The antiquary [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] also collected 65 chapbooks, (including 20 from before 1660), which are now in the [[Bodleian Library]]. There are also significant Scottish collections, such as those held by the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = University of Glasgow: Scottish Chapbooks|url = http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/chapbooks/search/|website = special.lib.gla.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nModern collectors, such as [[Peter Opie]], have chiefly a scholarly interest in the form.<ref>[http://admin.oral-tradition.chs.orphe.us/wp-content/uploads/files/articles/28ii/05_28.2.pdf \"The Working Papers of Iona and Peter Opie\" Julia C.

Members of the upper classes occasionally owned chapbooks, perhaps bound in leather with a personal monogram. Printers typically tailored their texts for the popular market. Chapbooks were usually between four and twenty-four pages long, and produced on rough paper with crude, frequently recycled, woodcut illustrations. They sold in the millions.<ref>Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA. Getty Publications. (pp.121-122).</ref>\n\nAfter 1696 English chapbook peddlers had to be licensed, and 2,500 of them were then authorized, 500 in London alone. In France, there were 3,500 licensed ''[[Colportage|colporteurs]]'' by 1848, and they sold 40 million books annually.<ref>Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA. Getty Publications. (pp.121-122).</ref>\n\nThe centre of chapbook and ballad production was [[London]], and until the [[Great Fire of London]] the printers were based around [[London Bridge]]. However, a feature of chapbooks is the proliferation of provincial printers, especially in [[Scotland]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>See the \"Introduction\" ''in'' Simons, John (1998) ''Guy of Warwick and other Chapbook Romances'' University of Exeter Press, Exeter, England, {{ISBN|0-85989-445-2}}, for issues of definition.</ref> The first Scottish publication was the tale of ''[[Tom Thumb]],'' in 1682.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Content==\n[[File:Chapbook Jack the Giant Killer.jpg|thumbnail|left|The chapbook ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]'']]\nChapbooks were an important medium for the dissemination of popular culture to the common people, especially in rural areas. They were a medium of entertainment, information and (generally unreliable) history. In general, the content of chapbooks has been criticized, though, for their unsophisticated narratives which were heavily loaded with repetition and emphasized adventure through mostly anecdotal structures.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoeveler|first=D.L.|title=Gothic Chapbooks and the Urban Reader|journal=Wordsworth Circle|year=2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=155\u2013158|doi=10.1086/TWC24043706}}</ref> They are nonetheless valued as a record of popular culture, preserving cultural artifacts that may not survive in any other form.\n\nChapbooks were priced for sales to workers, although their market was not limited to the working classes. Broadside ballads were sold for a [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], or a few [[pence]]. Prices of chapbooks were from 2d. to 6d., when agricultural labourers' wages were 12d. per day. The literacy rate in England in the 1640s was around 30 percent for males and rose to 60 percent in the mid-18th century (see [[Education in the Age of Enlightenment]]). Many working people were readers, if not writers, and pre-industrial working patterns provided periods during which they could read. Chapbooks were undoubtedly used for reading to family groups or groups in alehouses.\n\nThey even contributed to the development of literacy. The author and publisher [[Francis Kirkman]] wrote about how they fired his imagination and his love of books. There is other evidence of their use by [[Autodidacticism|autodidacts]].\n\nNevertheless, the numbers printed are astonishing. In the 1660s as many as 400,000 [[almanac]]s were printed annually, enough for one family in three in England. One 17th-century publisher of chapbooks in London stocked one book for every 15 families in the country. In the 1520s the [[Oxford]] bookseller John Dorne noted in his day-book selling up to 190 [[ballads]] a day at a halfpenny each. The probate inventory of the stock of Charles Tias, of ''The sign of the Three Bibles'' on London Bridge, in 1664 included books and printed sheets to make approximately 90,000 chapbooks (including 400 reams of paper) and 37,500 ballad sheets. Tias was not regarded as an outstanding figure in the trade. The inventory of Josiah Blare, of ''The Sign of the Looking Glass'' on London Bridge, in 1707 listed 31,000 books, plus 257 reams of printed sheets. A conservative estimate of their sales in Scotland alone in the second half of the 18th century was over 200,000 per year.\n\nThese printers provided chapbooks to [[chapmen]] on credit, who carried them around the country, selling from door to door, at markets and fairs, and returning to pay for the stock they sold. This facilitated wide distribution and large sales with minimum outlay, and also provided the printers with feedback about what titles were most popular. Popular works were reprinted, pirated, edited, and produced in different editions. [[Francis Kirkman]], whose eye was always on the market, wrote two [[sequels]] to the popular ''Don Bellianus of Greece'', first printed in 1598.\n\nPublishers also issued catalogues, and chapbooks are found in the libraries of provincial [[yeomen]] and [[gentry]]. John Whiting, a Quaker yeoman imprisoned at [[Ilchester]], [[Somerset]], in the 1680s had books sent by carrier from London, and left for him at an inn.\n\nPepys had a collection of ballads bound into volumes, under the following classifications, into which could fit the subject matter of most chapbooks: \n# Devotion and Morality\n# History \u2013 true and fabulous\n# Tragedy: viz. Murders, executions, and judgments of God\n# State and Times\n# Love \u2013 pleasant\n# Ditto \u2013 unpleasant\n# Marriage, Cuckoldry, &c.\n# Sea \u2013 love, gallantry & actions\n# Drinking and good fellowship\n# Humour, frollicks and mixt.\n\nThe stories in many of the popular chapbooks can be traced back to much earlier origins. ''Bevis of Hampton'' was an Anglo-Norman romance of the 13th century, which probably drew on earlier themes. The structure of ''[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Sages of Rome]]'' was from the orient, and was used by [[Chaucer]]. Many jests about ignorant and greedy clergy in chapbooks were taken from ''The Friar and the Boy'' printed about 1500 by [[Wynkyn de Worde]], and ''The Sackfull of News'' (1557).\n\nHistorical stories set in a mythical and fantastical past were popular. The selection is interesting. [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and [[Oliver Cromwell]] do not appear as historical figures in the Pepys collection, and [[Elizabeth I]] only once. [[The Wars of the Roses]] and the [[English Civil War]] do not appear at all. [[Henry VIII]] and [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] appear in disguise, standing up for the right with cobblers and millers and then inviting them to Court and rewarding them. There was a pattern of high born heroes overcoming reduced circumstances by valour, such as [[St George]], [[Guy of Warwick]], [[Robin Hood]] (who at this stage has yet to give to the poor what he was stealing from the rich), and heroes of low birth who achieve status through force of arms, such as Clim of Clough, and William of Cloudesley. Clergy often appear as figures of fun, and stupid countrymen were also popular (e.g., ''[[The Wise Men of Gotham]]''). Other works were aimed at regional and rural audience (e.g., ''The Country Mouse and the Town Mouse'').\n\nFrom 1597 works appeared aimed at specific trades, such as [[cloth merchant|clothier]]s, [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] and [[shoemakers]]. The latter were commonly literate. Thomas Deloney, a weaver, wrote ''Thomas of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]'', about six clothiers from [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Gloucester]], [[Worcester]], [[Exeter]], [[Salisbury]] and [[Southampton]], travelling together and meeting at [[Basingstoke]] their fellows from [[Kendal]], [[Manchester]] and [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. In his, ''Jack of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]'', 1600, set in [[Henry VIII]]'s time, an apprentice to a [[broadcloth]] weaver takes over his business and marries his widow on his death. On achieving success, he is liberal to the poor and refuses a knighthood for his substantial services to the king.\n\nOther examples from the Pepys collection include ''The Countryman's Counsellor, or Everyman his own Lawyer'', and ''Sports and Pastimes'', written for schoolboys, including magic tricks, like how to \"fetch a shilling out of a handkerchief\", write invisibly, make roses out of paper, snare wild duck, and make a maid-servant fart uncontrollably.\n\nThe provinces and Scotland had their own local heroes. [[Robert Burns]] commented that one of the first two books he read in private was \"the history of Sir [[William Wallace]] ... poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest\".\n\n==Influence==\nThey had a wide and continuing influence. Eighty percent of English [[Folk song|folk songs]] collected by early-20th-century collectors have been linked to printed broadsides, including over 90 of which could only be derived from those printed before 1700. It has been suggested the majority of surviving ballads can be traced to 1550\u20131600 by internal evidence.\n\nOne of the most popular and influential chapbooks was Richard Johnson's ''Seven Champions of Christendom'' (1596), believed to be the source for the introduction of the character [[St George]] into English [[folk play]]s.\n\n[[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s novel ''Dorastus and Fawnia'' (originally ''Pandosto'') (1588), the basis of Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', was still being published in cheap editions in the 1680s. Some stories were still being published in the 19th century, (e.g., ''Jack of Newbury'', ''Friar Bacon'', ''Dr Faustus'' and ''[[The Seven Champions of Christendom]]'').\n\n==Modern chapbooks==\n[[File:Chapbook.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A modern-day chapbook]]\n''Chapbook'' is also a term currently used to denote publications of up to about 40 pages, usually [[poetry]] bound with some form of [[saddle stitch]], though many are [[perfect bound]], folded, or wrapped. These publications range from low-cost productions to finely produced, hand-made editions that may sell to collectors for hundreds of dollars. More recently, the popularity of fiction and nonfiction chapbooks has also increased. In the UK they are more often referred to as [[pamphlets]].\n\nThe genre has been revitalized in the past 40 years by the widespread availability of first [[mimeograph]] technology, then low-cost copy centers and digital printing, and by the cultural revolutions spurred by both [[zines]] and [[poetry slam]]s, the latter generating hundreds upon hundreds of self-published chapbooks that are used to fund tours. In New York, a joint effort of the Center for the Humanities at the Graduate Center, CUNY and their sponsors has come up with the NYC/CUNY Chapbook festival where, as it states in their about page, \u201cThe NYC/CUNY Chapbook Festival celebrates the chapbook as a work of art, and as a medium for alternative and emerging writers and publishers\u2026 the festival features a day-long bookfair with chapbook publishers from around the country, workshops, panels, a chapbook exhibition, and a reading of prize-winning Chapbook Fellows.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=NYC/CUNY Chapbook Festival|url=http://chapbookfestival.org|access-date=2018-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917155034/http://chapbookfestival.org/#|archive-date=2017-09-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWith the recent popularity of blogs, online literary journals, and other online publishers, short collections of poetry published online are frequently referred to as \"online chapbooks\", \"electronic chapbooks\", \"e-chapbooks\", or \"e-chaps\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Stephen King]] wrote a few parts of an early draft of ''[[The Plant (novel)|The Plant]]'' and sent them out as chapbooks to his friends, instead of [[Christmas card]]s, in 1982, 1983, and 1985. \"[[Philtrum Press]] produced just three installments before the story was shelved, and the original editions have been hotly sought-after collector's items.\" \n\n==Chapbook collections==\n* The [[National Library of Scotland]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nls.uk/collections/rarebooks/collections/chapbooks|title=Chapbooks \u2013 Rare Book Collections \u2013 National Library of Scotland \u2013 National Library of Scotland|website=www.nls.uk|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref> holds a large collection of Scottish chapbooks; approximately 4,000 of an estimated total of 15,000 published \u2013 including several in [[Lowland Scots Language|Lowland Scots]] and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Records for most Scottish chapbooks have been catalogued online.\n* The [[Glasgow University Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/specialcollections/introductiontoourcollections/|title=University of Glasgow \u2013 MyGlasgow \u2013 Special collections \u2013 Introduction to our Collections|website=www.gla.ac.uk|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref> has over 1,000 examples throughout the collections, searchable online via the Scottish Chapbooks Catalogue of c. 4,000 works, which covers the Lauriston Castle collection, Edinburgh City libraries and Stirling University.

Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered [[book]]lets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text (much like today's [[Stock photography|stock photos]]), and were often read aloud to an audience.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.europeana.eu/2019/08/chapbooks-the-poor-persons-reading-material/|title=Chapbooks: the poor person's reading material|last=Hagan|first=Dr. Anette|date=August 2019|website=[[Europeana]] (CC By-SA)|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]].\n\nThe tradition of chapbooks arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tale]]s, [[ballads]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tract]]s.\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are ''[[biblioth\u00e8que bleue]]'' (blue library) and ''Volksbuch'' (people's book), respectively. In Spain they were known as ''[[Cordel_literature|pliegos de cordel]]'' (Cordel sheets).<ref>From ''[[chapmen]]'', chap, a variety of [[peddler]], which folks circulated such literature as part of their stock.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Spufford, Margaret |date=1984|title= The Great Reclothing of Rural England|publisher= Hambledon Press|location= London|isbn= 0-907628-47-8|author-link=Margaret_Spufford}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author= Leitch, R. |date=1990|title='Here Chapman Billies Take Their Stand': A Pilot Study of Scottish Chapmen, Packmen and Pedlars|work=Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquarians 120|pages= 173\u2013188}}</ref> ''[[Lubok]]'' is the Russian equivalent of the chapbook.<ref>Lyons, Martyn.

The first element of ''chapman'' comes in turn from Old English ''c\u0113ap'' ('barter, business, dealing')<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.vv. ''chap-book, n.'' and ''chapman, n.''.</ref> from which is subsequently derived the modern adjective ''cheap.''\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fairies dancing in a ring woodcut.png|thumb|Woodcut of a [[fairy-circle]] from a 17th-century chapbook]]\n[[Broadside ballads]] were popular songs, sold for a [[penny]] or [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] in the streets of towns and villages around Britain between the 16th century and early 20th centuries. They preceded chapbooks, but had similar content, marketing and distribution systems. There are records from [[Cambridgeshire]] as early as in 1553 of a man offering a scurrilous ballad \"maistres mass\" at an [[alehouse]], and a pedlar selling \"lytle books\" to people, including a patcher of old clothes in 1578. These sales are probably characteristic of the market for chapbooks.\n\nChapbooks gradually disappeared from the mid-19th century in the face of competition from cheap newspapers and, especially in Scotland, religious tract societies that regarded them as \"ungodly\". Although the form originated in Britain, many were made in the U.S. during the same period.\n\nBecause of their flimsy nature such [[ephemera]] rarely survive as individual items. They were aimed at buyers without formal libraries and, in an era when paper was expensive, were used for wrapping or baking. Paper has also always had hygienic uses; there are contemporary references to the use of chapbooks as [[toilet paper|\"bum fodder\"]]{{cn|date=April 2020}}. Many of the surviving chapbooks come from the collections of [[Samuel Pepys]] between 1661 and 1688 which are now held at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. The antiquary [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] also collected 65 chapbooks, (including 20 from before 1660), which are now in the [[Bodleian Library]]. There are also significant Scottish collections, such as those held by the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = University of Glasgow: Scottish Chapbooks|url = http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/chapbooks/search/|website = special.lib.gla.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nModern collectors, such as [[Peter Opie]], have chiefly a scholarly interest in the form.<ref>[http://admin.oral-tradition.chs.orphe.us/wp-content/uploads/files/articles/28ii/05_28.2.pdf \"The Working Papers of Iona and Peter Opie\" Julia C.

Members of the upper classes occasionally owned chapbooks, perhaps bound in leather with a personal monogram. Printers typically tailored their texts for the popular market. Chapbooks were usually between four and twenty-four pages long, and produced on rough paper with crude, frequently recycled, woodcut illustrations. They sold in the millions.<ref>Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA. Getty Publications. (pp.121-122).</ref>\n\nAfter 1696 English chapbook peddlers had to be licensed, and 2,500 of them were then authorized, 500 in London alone. In France, there were 3,500 licensed ''[[Colportage|colporteurs]]'' by 1848, and they sold 40 million books annually.<ref>Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA. Getty Publications. (pp.121-122).</ref>\n\nThe centre of chapbook and ballad production was [[London]], and until the [[Great Fire of London]] the printers were based around [[London Bridge]]. However, a feature of chapbooks is the proliferation of provincial printers, especially in [[Scotland]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>See the \"Introduction\" ''in'' Simons, John  (1998) ''Guy of Warwick and other Chapbook Romances'' University of Exeter Press, Exeter, England, {{ISBN|0-85989-445-2}}, for issues of definition.</ref> The first Scottish publication was the tale of ''[[Tom Thumb]],'' in 1682.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Content==\n[[File:Chapbook Jack the Giant Killer.jpg|thumbnail|left|The chapbook ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]'']]\nChapbooks were an important medium for the dissemination of popular culture to the common people, especially in rural areas. They were a medium of entertainment, information and (generally unreliable) history. In general, the content of chapbooks has been criticized, though, for their unsophisticated narratives which were heavily loaded with repetition and emphasized adventure through mostly anecdotal structures.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoeveler|first=D.L.|title=Gothic Chapbooks and the Urban Reader|journal=Wordsworth Circle|year=2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=155\u2013158|doi=10.1086/TWC24043706}}</ref> They are nonetheless valued as a record of popular culture, preserving cultural artifacts that may not survive in any other form.\n\nChapbooks were priced for sales to workers, although their market was not limited to the working classes. Broadside ballads were sold for a [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], or a few [[pence]]. Prices of chapbooks were from 2d. to 6d., when agricultural labourers' wages were 12d. per day. The literacy rate in England in the 1640s was around 30 percent for males and rose to 60 percent in the mid-18th century (see [[Education in the Age of Enlightenment]]). Many working people were readers, if not writers, and pre-industrial working patterns provided periods during which they could read. Chapbooks were undoubtedly used for reading to family groups or groups in alehouses.\n\nThey even contributed to the development of literacy. The author and publisher [[Francis Kirkman]] wrote about how they fired his imagination and his love of books. There is other evidence of their use by [[Autodidacticism|autodidacts]].\n\nNevertheless, the numbers printed are astonishing. In the 1660s as many as 400,000 [[almanac]]s were printed annually, enough for one family in three in England. One 17th-century publisher of chapbooks in London stocked one book for every 15 families in the country. In the 1520s the [[Oxford]] bookseller John Dorne noted in his day-book selling up to 190 [[ballads]] a day at a halfpenny each. The probate inventory of the stock of Charles Tias, of ''The sign of the Three Bibles'' on London Bridge, in 1664 included books and printed sheets to make approximately 90,000 chapbooks (including 400 reams of paper) and 37,500 ballad sheets. Tias was not regarded as an outstanding figure in the trade. The inventory of Josiah Blare, of ''The Sign of the Looking Glass'' on London Bridge, in 1707 listed 31,000 books, plus 257 reams of printed sheets. A conservative estimate of their sales in Scotland alone in the second half of the 18th century was over 200,000 per year.\n\nThese printers provided chapbooks to [[chapmen]] on credit, who carried them around the country, selling from door to door, at markets and fairs, and returning to pay for the stock they sold. This facilitated wide distribution and large sales with minimum outlay, and also provided the printers with feedback about what titles were most popular. Popular works were reprinted, pirated, edited, and produced in different editions. [[Francis Kirkman]], whose eye was always on the market, wrote two [[sequels]] to the popular ''Don Bellianus of Greece'', first printed in 1598.\n\nPublishers also issued catalogues, and chapbooks are found in the libraries of provincial [[yeomen]] and [[gentry]].  John Whiting, a Quaker yeoman imprisoned at [[Ilchester]], [[Somerset]], in the 1680s had books sent by carrier from London, and left for him at an inn.\n\nPepys had a collection of ballads bound into volumes, under the following classifications, into which could fit the subject matter of most chapbooks: \n# Devotion and Morality\n# History \u2013 true and fabulous\n# Tragedy: viz. Murders, executions, and judgments of God\n# State and Times\n# Love \u2013 pleasant\n# Ditto \u2013 unpleasant\n# Marriage, Cuckoldry, &c.\n# Sea \u2013 love, gallantry & actions\n# Drinking and good fellowship\n# Humour, frollicks and mixt.\n\nThe stories in many of the popular chapbooks can be traced back to much earlier origins. ''Bevis of Hampton'' was an Anglo-Norman romance of the 13th century, which probably drew on earlier themes. The structure of ''[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Sages of Rome]]'' was from the orient, and was used by [[Chaucer]]. Many jests about ignorant and greedy clergy in chapbooks were taken from ''The Friar and the Boy'' printed about 1500 by [[Wynkyn de Worde]], and ''The Sackfull of News'' (1557).\n\nHistorical stories set in a mythical and fantastical past were popular. The selection is interesting. [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and [[Oliver Cromwell]] do not appear as historical figures in the Pepys collection, and [[Elizabeth I]] only once. [[The Wars of the Roses]] and the [[English Civil War]] do not appear at all. [[Henry VIII]] and [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] appear in disguise, standing up for the right with cobblers and millers and then inviting them to Court and rewarding them. There was a pattern of high born heroes overcoming reduced circumstances by valour, such as [[St George]], [[Guy of Warwick]], [[Robin Hood]] (who at this stage has yet to give to the poor what he was stealing from the rich), and heroes of low birth who achieve status through force of arms, such as Clim of Clough, and William of Cloudesley. Clergy often appear as figures of fun, and stupid countrymen were also popular (e.g., ''[[The Wise Men of Gotham]]''). Other works were aimed at regional and rural audience (e.g., ''The Country Mouse and the Town Mouse'').\n\nFrom 1597 works appeared aimed at specific trades, such as [[cloth merchant|clothier]]s, [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] and [[shoemakers]]. The latter were commonly literate. Thomas Deloney, a weaver, wrote ''Thomas of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]'', about six clothiers from [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Gloucester]], [[Worcester]], [[Exeter]], [[Salisbury]] and [[Southampton]], travelling together and meeting at [[Basingstoke]] their fellows from [[Kendal]], [[Manchester]] and [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. In his, ''Jack of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]'', 1600, set in [[Henry VIII]]'s time, an apprentice to a [[broadcloth]] weaver takes over his business and marries his widow on his death. On achieving success, he is liberal to the poor and refuses a knighthood for his substantial services to the king.\n\nOther examples from the Pepys collection include ''The Countryman's Counsellor, or Everyman his own Lawyer'', and ''Sports and Pastimes'', written for schoolboys, including magic tricks, like how to \"fetch a shilling out of a handkerchief\", write invisibly, make roses out of paper, snare wild duck, and make a maid-servant fart uncontrollably.\n\nThe provinces and Scotland had their own local heroes. [[Robert Burns]] commented that one of the first two books he read in private was \"the history of Sir [[William Wallace]] ... poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest\".\n\n==Influence==\nThey had a wide and continuing influence. Eighty percent of English [[Folk song|folk songs]] collected by early-20th-century collectors have been linked to printed broadsides, including over 90 of which could only be derived from those printed before 1700. It has been suggested the majority of surviving ballads can be traced to 1550\u20131600 by internal evidence.\n\nOne of the most popular and influential chapbooks was Richard Johnson's ''Seven Champions of Christendom'' (1596), believed to be the source for the introduction of the character [[St George]] into English [[folk play]]s.\n\n[[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s novel ''Dorastus and Fawnia'' (originally ''Pandosto'') (1588), the basis of Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', was still being published in cheap editions in the 1680s. Some stories were still being published in the 19th century, (e.g., ''Jack of Newbury'', ''Friar Bacon'', ''Dr Faustus'' and ''[[The Seven Champions of Christendom]]'').\n\n==Modern chapbooks==\n[[File:Chapbook.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A modern-day chapbook]]\n''Chapbook'' is also a term currently used to denote publications of up to about 40 pages, usually [[poetry]] bound with some form of [[saddle stitch]], though many are [[perfect bound]], folded, or wrapped. These publications range from low-cost productions to finely produced, hand-made editions that may sell to collectors for hundreds of dollars. More recently, the popularity of fiction and nonfiction chapbooks has also increased. In the UK they are more often referred to as [[pamphlets]].\n\nThe genre has been revitalized in the past 40 years by the widespread availability of first [[mimeograph]] technology, then low-cost copy centers and digital printing, and by the cultural revolutions spurred by both [[zines]] and [[poetry slam]]s, the latter generating hundreds upon hundreds of self-published chapbooks that are used to fund tours. In New York, a joint effort of the Center for the Humanities at the Graduate Center, CUNY and their sponsors has come up with the NYC/CUNY Chapbook festival where, as it states in their about page, \u201cThe NYC/CUNY Chapbook Festival celebrates the chapbook as a work of art, and as a medium for alternative and emerging writers and publishers\u2026 the festival features a day-long bookfair with chapbook publishers from around the country, workshops, panels, a chapbook exhibition, and a reading of prize-winning Chapbook Fellows.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=NYC/CUNY Chapbook Festival|url=http://chapbookfestival.org|access-date=2018-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917155034/http://chapbookfestival.org/#|archive-date=2017-09-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWith the recent popularity of blogs, online literary journals, and other online publishers, short collections of poetry published online are frequently referred to as \"online chapbooks\", \"electronic chapbooks\", \"e-chapbooks\", or \"e-chaps\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Stephen King]] wrote a few parts of an early draft of ''[[The Plant (novel)|The Plant]]'' and sent them out as chapbooks to his friends, instead of [[Christmas card]]s, in 1982, 1983, and 1985. \"[[Philtrum Press]] produced just three installments before the story was shelved, and the original editions have been hotly sought-after collector's items.\" \n\n==Chapbook collections==\n* The [[National Library of Scotland]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nls.uk/collections/rarebooks/collections/chapbooks|title=Chapbooks \u2013 Rare Book Collections \u2013 National Library of Scotland \u2013 National Library of Scotland|website=www.nls.uk|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref> holds a large collection of Scottish chapbooks; approximately 4,000 of an estimated total of 15,000 published \u2013 including several in [[Lowland Scots Language|Lowland Scots]] and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Records for most Scottish chapbooks have been catalogued online.\n* The [[Glasgow University Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/specialcollections/introductiontoourcollections/|title=University of Glasgow \u2013 MyGlasgow \u2013 Special collections \u2013 Introduction to our Collections|website=www.gla.ac.uk|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref> has over 1,000 examples throughout the collections, searchable online via the Scottish Chapbooks Catalogue of c. 4,000 works, which covers the Lauriston Castle collection, Edinburgh City libraries and Stirling University.
