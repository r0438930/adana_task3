Antinori, a [[Palermo, Sicily|Sicilian]]-born immigrant, became a well-known drug kingpin and the Italian crime boss of Tampa in the late 1920s. A smaller Italian gang in the area was controlled by [[Santo Trafficante Sr.]], who had lived in Tampa since the age of 18. Trafficante had already set up [[Bolita]] games throughout the city and was a very powerful man. Antinori took notice of Santo Trafficante and invited him into his organization and together they expanded the Bolita games across the state. By the 1930s Ignacio Antinori and Charlie Wall were in a bloody war for ten years, which would later be known as \"Era of Blood\". Wall's closest associate, [[Evaristo \"Tito\" Rubio]], was shot on his porch on March 8, 1938. The war ended in the 1940s with Ignacio Antinori being shot and killed with a sawn-off shotgun. Both Wall's and Antinori's organizations were weakened leaving Santo Trafficante as one of the last and most powerful bosses in Tampa.<ref name=\"Scott Deitche\"/>\n\n===Trafficante Sr. era===\n[[Santo Trafficante Sr.]] had now taken over a majority of the city and started to teach his son Santo Trafficante Jr. how to run the city.

With the untimely [[Kefauver]] hearings and Charlie Wall testifying in 1950, both Trafficantes fled to [[Cuba]]. He always wanted to make it big in Cuban casinos and dispatched his son, Santo, Jr., to [[Havana]] in 1946 to help operate a mob owned [[casino]]. The Tampa mob made a lot of money in Cuba, but never achieved its ambition of making the island part of its own territory. After the hearings ended the Trafficantes returned to Tampa to find out that Italiano had just fled to Mexico leaving Jimmy Lumia the biggest mobster in the city. Santo had Lumia killed after finding out he was bad mouthing him while he was in Cuba and he took over again. In 1953 Santo Jr. survived a shooting. The family suspected it was Charlie Wall and they had him killed in 1955.
