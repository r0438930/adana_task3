[https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4\u20138</ref> The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much \"[[high culture]]\" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also \"popular.\" \"Pop culture\" is also defined as the culture that is \"leftover\" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]],[[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Orwell]].\n\nA third definition equates pop culture with \"[[mass culture]]\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].<ref>S\u00e9rgio Campos Gon\u00e7alves, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190127163020/https://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ea000713.pdf Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]\", InRevista \u2013 N\u00facleo de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica em Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 UNAERP (Ribeir\u00e3o Preto), v. 3, pp. 18\u201328, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.</ref> From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\"{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"\n\nStorey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}\n\nPopular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Levels===\nWithin the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>\n\n===Folklore===\nAdaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A.

With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.\n\nAlthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves. \n\n== Criticism ==\nMany people say that popular culture is a tool that higher-ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Postmodernist Baudrillard argued that the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion, since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful. Baudrillard stated in an interview: \n\"The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction. Basically, its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself. On this point it is worth recalling Marshall McLuhan: the medium is the message.

However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]],[[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Orwell]].\n\nA third definition equates pop culture with \"[[mass culture]]\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].<ref>S\u00e9rgio Campos Gon\u00e7alves, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190127163020/https://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ea000713.pdf Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]\", InRevista \u2013 N\u00facleo de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica em Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 UNAERP (Ribeir\u00e3o Preto), v. 3, pp. 18\u201328, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.</ref> From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\"{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"\n\nStorey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}\n\nPopular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Levels===\nWithin the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>\n\n===Folklore===\nAdaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A.

With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.\n\nAlthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves. \n\n== Criticism ==\nMany people say that popular culture is a tool that higher-ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Postmodernist Baudrillard argued that the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion, since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful. Baudrillard stated in an interview: \n\"The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction. Basically, its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself. On this point it is worth recalling Marshall McLuhan: the medium is the message.
