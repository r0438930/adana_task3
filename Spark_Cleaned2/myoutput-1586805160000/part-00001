''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>. Juvenile ornate butterflyfish are solitary and can be found singly, living in the arms of branching corals, but form pairs during breeding <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\" />.  \n\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>.

''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77\u201386.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  \n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.''

Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.  \n\n<br />\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references />\n\n# \n\n==References==\n{{Commons|Chaetodon ornatissimus}}\n* Adam, T.
