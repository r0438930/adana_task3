He was the son of Samuel Archibald, and grandson of James Archibald, judge of the court of common pleas, Nova Scotia. He was also related to [[Samuel George William Archibald|Samuel G. W. Archibald]], who had served as the province's Attorney General from 1830 to 1841. Sir Adams Archibald studied science and medicine for a few years, subsequently articled in law, and was called to the Nova Scotia bar in January 1839. He held a number of local offices over the next decade, and was appointed a probate judge in 1848.<ref name=DCB>{{cite DCB |first=K. G. |last=Pryke |title=Archibald, Sir Adams George |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/archibald_adams_george_12E.html |volume=12}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nArchibald was elected to the Nova Scotia legislature in 1851 as a supporter of Joseph Howe's governing [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Reformers]], topping the poll in the two-member riding of [[Colchester County, Nova Scotia|Colchester County]]. Once in the legislature, Archibald frequently took positions that were opposed by other members of the Liberal caucus. He supported elected municipal governments, for instance, and was a vociferous proponent of taxation for a state-run school system (regarded by many Nova Scotia Liberals as an unnecessary expense). Archibald also supported reciprocity with the United States, and opposed any efforts to expand the province's electoral franchise.\n\nArchibald was re-elected in 1855, and was appointed [[Solicitor|Solicitor General]] of Nova Scotia on August 14, 1856. His term in office was cut short by a sectarian quarrel in the legislature, which occurred after the President of the [[Charitable Irish Society]] was dismissed from his government job and charged with treason. The Liberal government had previously been supported by a majority of the province's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] population, but in early 1857 eight Catholic Liberals and two Protestant Liberals from Catholic ridings defected to the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia|Conservative]] opposition, which was then able to form government. Archibald was forced to resign his position on February 21, 1857.\n\nIn the provincial election of 1859, Howe's Liberals were returned to office on a platform of defending Protestant interests. This was essentially a cynical appeal to popular prejudice, and no significant actions were taken against the province's Catholics following the election. Archibald did not run, but was nevertheless appointed [[Attorney General]] in Howe's government on February 10, 1860. He returned to parliament following a by-election victory on March 8, 1860. In his new capacity, Archibald was a leading proponent of provincial railway development, even following the economic downturn of 1862.\n\nIn December 1862, Premier Howe was appointed Imperial Fisheries Commissioner by the British government. Archibald succeeded him as Liberal leader, although Howe continued to serve as Premier until the next election was called.\n\nIn early 1863, Howe's outgoing ministry passed a bill which re-introduced property qualifications for voters. The bill did not become law before the provincial election of May 1863, however, and it was largely due to the bill's unpopularity that Archibald's Liberals were dealt a crushing defeat. The party won only 14 seats out of 55, though Archibald was personally re-elected in [[Colchester South]].\n\nDespite serving as leader of the opposition from 1863 to 1867, Archibald frequently sided with the Conservative ministry against his own caucus on important legislative initiatives. He supported the education tax plan put forward by [[Charles Tupper]]'s government, although it was opposed by most members of his own party. Archibald was later the Nova Scotia Liberal Party's representative to the first conference on Canadian Confederation, held at [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] in 1864. Following the conference, he was the ''only'' member of the Liberal caucus to support Nova Scotia's entry into confederation.\n\nArchibald faced a leadership challenge from anti-confederate [[William Annand]] in 1866, but emerged victorious. When Nova Scotia joined the new nation of Canada on July 1, 1867, Archibald was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Provinces]] in the cabinet of [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\nNova Scotia's political system was transformed by the debate on Confederation, and its concurrent provincial and federal elections in September 1867 were fought by Confederation and anti-Confederation parties, rather than by Liberals and Conservatives. The Confederation Party suffered a massive defeat, and Archibald (despite spending a very large sum of money) was defeated by [[Archibald McLelan]] in the riding of [[Colchester (electoral district)|Colchester]]. He resigned his cabinet post on April 30, 1868.\n\nPopular opinion in Nova Scotia subsequently shifted in favour of Confederation, particularly after one-time anti-confederate Joseph Howe joined Macdonald's government in 1869. McLelan followed Howe to the Confederation side, and was appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] in August 1869. This allowed Archibald to run for the riding in a by-election, in which he defeated [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Frederick M. Pearson|Frederick Pearson]], 1585 votes to 1230. Archibald was by this time a Liberal-Conservative, and continued to support the Macdonald government in parliament (though he was not re-appointed to cabinet).\n\nIn 1870, Archibald gave a speech in favour of conciliation towards the leaders of the [[Red River Rebellion]] in Manitoba. This was noticed by [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], who was the ''de facto'' leader of the Canadian government while Macdonald was recovering from a serious illness. Cartier asked Archibald to become the first Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and the [[Northwest Territories]]. Although he had little interest in the region, he agreed on condition that he be appointed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia after serving a single term.\n\nArchibald was sworn into office in August 1870, in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. He then travelled to Manitoba, and began piecing together the province's first government. There was considerable antagonism between the province's [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] population and recently arrived soldiers from Ontario, and Archibald had difficulties finding suitable candidates to work with him. Until January 1871, the only members of his cabinet were local merchant [[Alfred Boyd]] and [[Marc-Amable Girard]], a recent arrival from Quebec. Archibald himself was the province's ''de facto'' Premier, and often determined policy without consulting his ministers.\n\nDespite opposition from many of the province's Anglophones, Archibald was able to settle the province's electoral boundaries by December 1870. Archibald himself was the leader of the government side in the election which followed; the francophone population was mostly united in support of him, while [[John Christian Schultz]] led a group of ultra-loyalist Anglophones who opposed the conciliation policy. Archibald was successful, as Schultz's opposition won only five seats and Schultz was personally defeated in [[Winnipeg and St. John]].\n\nArchibald put together a five-member cabinet in January 1871, which included Boyd, Girard, [[Henry Joseph Clarke]], [[James Mackay (Canada)|James Mackay]] and [[Thomas Howard (Manitoba politician)|Thomas Howard]] \u2014 a group which balanced the province's ethnic, religious and linguistic divisions. Archibald himself remained the real Premier.\n\nArchibald continued to pursue a policy of conciliation with the province's M\u00e9tis population, encouraging them to register their lands and even meeting with [[Louis Riel]] after an armed M\u00e9tis band had defended the government against [[Fenian]] invaders from America. His real intentions were to prevent another M\u00e9tis uprising in the short-term, and to allow for the gradual hegemony of new Canadian settlers in the region. Nevertheless, the specifics of his conciliation policy were opposed by Macdonald and Howe alike (Howe was by this time Macdonald's Indian Affairs minister). In the face of this opposition, Archibald submitted his resignation in late 1871. Macdonald initially had difficulty finding a replacement and asked Archibald to reconsider. The federal government chose [[Francis Godschall Johnson]] as his replacement on April 9, 1872, but this commission was revoked before Johnson was sworn in. It was not until October 1872 that Archibald returned to [[Ontario]].\n\nArchibald was not immediately appointed to the Nova Scotia court, and was instead made a director of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific Railway Company]] in February 1873. He was finally appointed to the bench in June, but withdrew days later to be appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia (former Conservative Premier [[James W. Johnston]] initially received this appointment, but withdrew due to ill health). This position required less intervention than Archibald had exercised in Manitoba, although he attended cabinet meetings in 1873 and 1874. After 1876, he came to regard the position as primarily ceremonial, and above partisan concerns.\n\nArchibald served as the 4th Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia until June 1883. In 1886, he became President of the [[Nova Scotia Historical Society]], which he had helped to found six years earlier. He courted controversy by a public defence of the 18th-century [[Acadian expulsion]] later in the year.\n\nIn 1888, [[Archibald McLellan]] was appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]]. McLellan had resigned his Senate seat in 1881 and subsequently returned to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. His appointment meant that the riding of Colchester again became vacant, and, ironically, Archibald was again prevailed upon to stand for the riding as a Liberal-Conservative candidate. He was re-elected to the Commons on August 15, 1888, 18 years after his previous departure. Archibald was little involved in the activities of the House following his return, and did not make any speeches. Due to ill health, he did not run again in 1891.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mrs Elizabeth Alice Jones by Parsons, St. John's, Nfld.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mrs Elizabeth Alice Jones (n\u00e9e Archibald) by Parsons, St. John's, Nfld]]\nHon.

Although he had little interest in the region, he agreed on condition that he be appointed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia after serving a single term.\n\nArchibald was sworn into office in August 1870, in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. He then travelled to Manitoba, and began piecing together the province's first government. There was considerable antagonism between the province's [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] population and recently arrived soldiers from Ontario, and Archibald had difficulties finding suitable candidates to work with him. Until January 1871, the only members of his cabinet were local merchant [[Alfred Boyd]] and [[Marc-Amable Girard]], a recent arrival from Quebec. Archibald himself was the province's ''de facto'' Premier, and often determined policy without consulting his ministers.\n\nDespite opposition from many of the province's Anglophones, Archibald was able to settle the province's electoral boundaries by December 1870. Archibald himself was the leader of the government side in the election which followed; the francophone population was mostly united in support of him, while [[John Christian Schultz]] led a group of ultra-loyalist Anglophones who opposed the conciliation policy. Archibald was successful, as Schultz's opposition won only five seats and Schultz was personally defeated in [[Winnipeg and St. John]].\n\nArchibald put together a five-member cabinet in January 1871, which included Boyd, Girard, [[Henry Joseph Clarke]], [[James Mackay (Canada)|James Mackay]] and [[Thomas Howard (Manitoba politician)|Thomas Howard]] \u2014 a group which balanced the province's ethnic, religious and linguistic divisions. Archibald himself remained the real Premier.\n\nArchibald continued to pursue a policy of conciliation with the province's M\u00e9tis population, encouraging them to register their lands and even meeting with [[Louis Riel]] after an armed M\u00e9tis band had defended the government against [[Fenian]] invaders from America. His real intentions were to prevent another M\u00e9tis uprising in the short-term, and to allow for the gradual hegemony of new Canadian settlers in the region. Nevertheless, the specifics of his conciliation policy were opposed by Macdonald and Howe alike (Howe was by this time Macdonald's Indian Affairs minister). In the face of this opposition, Archibald submitted his resignation in late 1871. Macdonald initially had difficulty finding a replacement and asked Archibald to reconsider. The federal government chose [[Francis Godschall Johnson]] as his replacement on April 9, 1872, but this commission was revoked before Johnson was sworn in. It was not until October 1872 that Archibald returned to [[Ontario]].\n\nArchibald was not immediately appointed to the Nova Scotia court, and was instead made a director of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific Railway Company]] in February 1873. He was finally appointed to the bench in June, but withdrew days later to be appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia (former Conservative Premier [[James W. Johnston]] initially received this appointment, but withdrew due to ill health). This position required less intervention than Archibald had exercised in Manitoba, although he attended cabinet meetings in 1873 and 1874. After 1876, he came to regard the position as primarily ceremonial, and above partisan concerns.\n\nArchibald served as the 4th Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia until June 1883. In 1886, he became President of the [[Nova Scotia Historical Society]], which he had helped to found six years earlier. He courted controversy by a public defence of the 18th-century [[Acadian expulsion]] later in the year.\n\nIn 1888, [[Archibald McLellan]] was appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]]. McLellan had resigned his Senate seat in 1881 and subsequently returned to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. His appointment meant that the riding of Colchester again became vacant, and, ironically, Archibald was again prevailed upon to stand for the riding as a Liberal-Conservative candidate. He was re-elected to the Commons on August 15, 1888, 18 years after his previous departure. Archibald was little involved in the activities of the House following his return, and did not make any speeches. Due to ill health, he did not run again in 1891.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mrs Elizabeth Alice Jones by Parsons, St. John's, Nfld.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mrs Elizabeth Alice Jones (n\u00e9e Archibald) by Parsons, St. John's, Nfld]]\nHon.
