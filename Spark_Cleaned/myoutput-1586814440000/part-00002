Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her\u2014the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it. This piece of cloth became known as the [[Veil of Veronica]].<ref name=\"N&Q\" /><ref name=\"AI\" /><ref name=\"Butler2000p=84\" />\nThe story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth [[Stations of the Cross|Station of the Cross]] in many [[Anglican]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Western Orthodox]] churches.<ref name=Trinity/><ref>Vatican Website [https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2005/via_crucis/en/station_06.html Sixth Station]</ref><ref name=\"Prothero2009p=284\" />\n\n== Background==\n[[File:Saint veronica.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Veronica by [[Francesco Mochi]] in a niche of the pier supporting the main dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].]]\n[[File:Cloth_of_St._Veronica,_Bernardino_Zaganelli,_c._1500,_oil_on_panel,_Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art.jpg|left|thumb|''Cloth of Saint Veronica'', [[Bernardino Zaganelli]], c. 1500, oil on panel, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\n[[File:Veronica.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s 1513 ''Veronica'']]\nThere is no reference to the story of Veronica and her veil in the [[canonical gospels]]. The closest is the miracle of the unnamed woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus\u2019s garment (Luke 8:43\u201348). The [[apocrypha]]l [[Gospel of Nicodemus]] gives her name as Berenik\u0113 or Beronike ({{lang-grc-koi|\u0392\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7}}). The name Veronica is a Latinisation of this [[ancient Macedonian language|ancient Macedonian]] name. The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor [[Tiberius]]. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion only occurs around 1380, in the internationally popular book ''Meditations on the life of Christ''.<ref name=\"Wilson1991p=175\" />\n\nAt some point a relic became associated with the story. [[Pedro Tafur]], a Spanish knight visiting Rome in 1436, describes the following in the Church of St. Peter in his 1454 travel account:<ref name=\"Letts1926\" />\n{{quote|\nOn the right hand is a pillar as high as a small tower, and in it is the holy Veronica. When it is to be exhibited an opening is made in the roof of the church and a wooden chest or cradle is let down, in which are two clerics, and when they have descended, the chest or cradle is drawn up, and they, with the greatest reverence, take out the Veronica and show it to the people, who make concourse there upon the appointed day. It happens often that the worshipers are in danger of their lives, so many are they and so great is the press.\n|source=}}\n\nHowever, he does not say specifically that he witnessed for himself this exhibition of the relic. \n\nSome academic sources suggest a different origin for the legend of St. Veronica: that the cloth bearing an image of Jesus' face was known in Latin as the ''vera icon'' (\"true image\"), and that this name for the relic was misinterpreted as the name of a saint. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913 writes:<ref name=\"D\u00e9gert1913\" />\n{{quote|\nThe belief in the existence of authentic images of Christ is connected with the old legend of King [[Abgar V|Abgar of Edessa]] and the apocryphal writing known as the ''\"[[Pontius Pilate#Minor Pilate literature|Mors Pilati]]\"'' (''\"the Death of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]\"''). To distinguish at Rome the oldest and best known of these images it was called the ''vera icon'' (true image), which in the common tongue soon became ''\"Veronica.\"''\nIt is thus designated in several [[medieval]] texts mentioned by the [[Bollandist]]s (e.g. an old Missal of Augsburg has a Mass ''\"De S. Veronica seu Vultus Domini\"'' \u2013 ''\"Saint Veronica, or the Face of the Lord\"''), and [[Matthew of Westminster]] speaks of the imprint of the image of the Savior which is called Veronica: ''\"Effigies Domenici vultus quae Veronica nuncupatur\"'' \u2013 ''\"effigy of the face of the Lord which is called a Veronica\"''. By degrees, popular imagination mistook this word for the name of a person and attached thereto several legends which vary according to the country. [''translations in italics added'']\n|source=}}\n\nThe reference to Abgar is related to a similar legend in the Eastern Church, the [[Image of Edessa]] or Mandylion.\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' says this about the legend:\n{{quote|\nEusebius in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' (vii 18) tells how at [[Caesarea Philippi]] lived the [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|woman whom Christ healed of an issue of blood]] ([[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 9|Matthew 9]]:20\u201322). Legend was not long in providing the woman of the Gospel with a name. In the West she was identified with [[Martha|Martha of Bethany]]; in the East she was called Berenike, or Beronike, the name appearing in as early a work as the ''\"[[Acta Pilati]]\",'' the most ancient form of which goes back to the fourth century. The fanciful derivation of the name Veronica from the words Vera Icon (eikon) \"true image\" dates back to the ''\"Otia Imperialia\"'' (iii 25) of [[Gervase of Tilbury]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1211), who says: ''\"Est ergo Veronica pictura Domini vera\"'' (translated: \"The Veronica is, therefore, a true picture of the Lord.\")\n|source=}}\n\nVeronica was mentioned in the reported [[visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus]] by [[Marie of St Peter]], a [[Carmelites|Carmelite nun]] who lived in [[Tours]], France and started the [[Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]]. In 1844, Sister Marie reported that in a vision, she saw Veronica wiping away the spit and mud from the face of Jesus with her veil on the way to Calvary. She said that sacrilegious and blasphemous acts today are adding to the spit and mud that Veronica wiped away that day. According to Marie of St Peter, in her visions, Jesus told her that he desired devotion to His Holy Face in [[reparation (legal)|reparation]] for [[sacrilege]] and [[blasphemy]]. [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]] are thus compared to Veronica wiping the face of Jesus.<ref name=\"Cruz2003p=\" /><ref name=\"ScallanScallan1994p=\" />\n\nThe Devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] was eventually approved by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1885. Veronica is commemorated on 12 July.\n\n== Official Patronage ==\nSaint Veronica is the patron of the French [[Mulquinerie|mulquiniers]] whose representations they celebrated biannually ([[summer]] and [[winter]]) as in many pious [[Christianity by country|Christian countries]]. She is also the patron saint of photographers.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Veronicazejtun.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of ''Veronica,'' used during the [[Good Friday]] [[procession]] in [[Zejtun]], [[Malta]].]]\nIn Volume 5 of her work, ''[[The Poem of the Man-God]]'', Italian writer and alleged mystic [[Maria Valtorta]] depicts Veronica as Nike, who offered the linen cloth to Christ. It is also stated earlier in the same volume that \"The one we call Veronica and whom Jesus called Nike...\" suggesting that Nike has been mistakenly referred to as Veronica throughout history.<ref name=\"Valtorta1956pp=305-316\" />\n\n[[Selma Lagerl\u00f6f]] in Christ Legends<ref name=\"Lagerl\u00f6f1908p=119\" /> expands the legend by making Veronica a former servant of the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]], named Faustina, who travels to Jerusalem in search of the Prophet of Nazareth, after learning that he once cured a young woman of leprosy. She travels on behalf of Tiberius, now himself stricken,  hoping to bring him a cure and redemption from his evil ways.  Faustina arrives on the day of the Crucifixion, and the rest is legend.\n\nMel Gibson's film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) included an episode of Veronica wiping Jesus's face, although she is not referred to by name in the film (she is credited in the film as Seraphia). [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]], one of the inspirational sources to the cited movie, depicts a long description of the Veronica episode and she identifies the true name of Veronica also as Seraphia.<ref name=\"Emmerich1862p=239\" />\n\nThe most common pass with the cape in [[bullfighting]] is called a ''ver\u00f3nica'', as the ''[[torero]]'' holds the cape in the same way as Veronica is usually depicted holding the cloth.\n\nThe song \"Climb\" by [[Tori Amos]] on her 2017 album ''[[Native Invader]]'' contains repeated references to Veronica.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Scapular of the Holy Face]]\n* [[List of names for the biblical nameless]]\n* [[Relics associated with Jesus]]\n* [[Veil of Veronica|Veronica's Veil]]\n* [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 9|Matthew 9]]\n* [[s:Bible (King James)/Mark#Chapter 5|Mark 5]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"catholic.org\">[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1953 Catholic Online]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"N&Q\">{{citation |title=St. Veronica |journal=Notes and Queries |volume= 6 |date=July\u2013December 1852 |location= London |page=252 |url=https://archive.org/stream/notesqueriesmedi06lond#page/252/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"sqpn.com\">{{webarchive| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512064350/http://saints.sqpn.com/saintv02.htm |title=Saint Veronica }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Trinity>{{cite web |url= http://www.trinityevansville.org/stations-of-the-cross/ |title= Stations of the Cross |date=24 March 2013 |publisher= Trinity UMC |access-date=17 April 2015 |quote= This tradition began most prominently with St. Francis of Assisi (1182\u20131226) and spread to other churches in the medieval period.
