The name 'Luftschiffbau' is a German word meaning ''building of airships''.\n\nThe company was founded by [[Count]] [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] in 1908 as a formal entity to continue advancing his pioneering research into rigid airships. ''Luftschiffbau Zeppelin'' became the leading manufacturer in the field of large lighter-than-air vehicles; its products were used in both military and civilian capacities. The firm founded [[DELAG]], the [[List of airlines by foundation|world's first airline]] to use an aircraft in revenue service, in 1909 on the back of public interest and using its own airships. During the [[First World War]], Zeppelins were employed as the first [[German strategic bombing during World War I|long distance strategic bombers]], launching numerous raids upon [[Belgium]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Following Count von Zeppelin's death in 1917, control of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin fell to Dr. [[Hugo Eckener]], an enthusiastic proponent of the civil value of airships. However, Germany's zeppelins were claimed by the Allies as [[war reparations]].\n\nThe company continued to innovate during the [[Interwar period]], constructing the largest rigid airship in history, the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]], the [[lead ship]] of the [[Hindenburg class airship|''Hindenburg'' class]]. However, the company's fortunes soured during the [[Nazism|Nazi]] era, particularly following the high-profile [[Hindenburg disaster]]. Its airships were grounded and scrapped in 1940 to produce fixed-wing combat aircraft for [[Nazi Germany]]'s war machine. During the [[Second World War]], the company became involved in the manufacture of the [[V2 rocket]]; its facilities were hit by Allied bombing raids and it all but ceased to exist in the final months of the conflict. During the 1980s, Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH was revived from its residual assets, it has since become a major shareholder in the company ''ZLT Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH'', which developed and produces the [[Zeppelin NT]], a next generation airship.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:ZeppelinLZ127a.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'' departing for [[DELAG]], the world's first airline]]\n[[File:Zeppelin over St. Paul's.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Graf Zeppelin'' above [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]]]]\n===Formative years===\n{{see|Zeppelin}}\nDuring 1900, Count von Zeppelin's first airship performed its [[maiden flight]].

The company played a leading role in the field of large lighter-than-air vehicles, establishing numerous firsts and innovations over the following decades.

Luftschiffbau Zeppelin came under government control and new personnel were recruited to cope with the increased demand, including the aerodynamicist [[Paul Jaray]] and the stress engineer [[Karl Arnstein]]. Many technological advances originated from the firm's competitor, the [[Mannheim]]-based Sch\u00fctte-Lanz company. While their dirigibles were never as successful, Professor Sch\u00fctte's more scientific approach to airship design led to innovations such as the streamlined hull shape, the simpler cruciform fins (replacing the more complicated box-like arrangements of older Zeppelins), individual direct-drive engine cars, anti-aircraft machine-gun positions,<ref>University of Constance.

New production facilities were set up to assemble Zeppelins from components fabricated in Friedrichshafen.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 89-90.</ref>\n\nIn 1917, Count von Zeppelin died; control of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin fell to Dr. [[Hugo Eckener]], who had long envisioned dirigibles as vessels of peace rather than of war and hoped to quickly resume civilian flights. Despite considerable difficulties, they completed two small passenger airships; [[Zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee|LZ 120 ''Bodensee'']] {Scrapped July 1928}, which first flew in August 1919 and in the following months transported passengers between Friedrichshafen and Berlin, and a sister-ship ''LZ 121 Nordstern'', {Scrapped September 1926} which was intended for use on a regular route to [[Stockholm]].<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 257-258.</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1921, the Allied Powers demanded that these airships should be handed over as [[war reparations]] as compensation for the dirigibles destroyed by their crews in 1919. Germany was not allowed to construct military aircraft and only airships of less than {{convert|1000000|ft3|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} were permitted. This brought a halt to Zeppelin's plans for airship development, and the company temporarily resorted to the manufacture of aluminium cooking utensils.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 259.</ref>\n\n===Interwar and Second World War===\nBetween the mid 1920s and 1940, the company worked closely with the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] to manufacture a pair of Zeppelins in the [[United States]]; to cement this relationship, a [[joint venture]] company, the [[Goodyear Aerospace|Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation]], was created to handle such activities. The first airship to be produced under this iniative, the [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|LZ&nbsp;126]], performed its first flight on 27 August 1924.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= U.S. Zeppelin on Trial|section=News in Brief |day_of_week= Friday|date=29 August 1924 |page_number= 9|issue=43743 |column=A }}</ref> However, the Goodyear-Zeppelin partnership was terminated following the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second world War]].<ref>http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=899&nm=Goodyear-Zeppelin-Company</ref> Despite this, the American company continued to produce [[blimp]]s for several decades under the Goodyear name.\n\nDuring 1926, restrictions on airship construction were relaxed by the [[Locarno treaties]], but acquiring the necessary funds for Luftschiffbau Zeppelin's next project proved problematic in the difficult economic situation of post\u2013First World War Germany, requiring two years of lobbying and publicity work to secure the realization of [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']], christened in honour of the firm's founder. On 18 September 1928, when the completed ''Graf Zeppelin'' flew for the first time.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Largest Zeppelin |section=News |day_of_week=  Wednesday |date=19 September 1928 |page_number= 14 |issue=45002 |column=F }}</ref> In the following years, it was not only commenced [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] commercial passenger flights but performed several record-breaking flights, including a successful [[circumnavigation]] of the globe.<ref>Swinfield 2012, pp. 237-239.</ref> Luftschiffbau Zeppelin was keen to continue advancing the capabilities of its airships and begun design work on an even larger airship during the late 1920s.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 283.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the single most famous airship was the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]], the [[lead ship]] of the [[Hindenburg class airship|''Hindenburg'' class]]. It was a large commercial passenger-carrying [[rigid airship]], being the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume.<ref name=\"specs\">[http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/size-speed \"Hindenburg Statistics.\"] airships.net, 2009.

On the whole, [[Nazi Germany]] placed a greater value on 'heavier than air' aircraft over that of zeppelins due to their military superiority. Despite this, zeppelins were prominently used by the nation for a number of major [[propaganda]] campaigns, allegedly to great effect.<ref>Lehmann 1937, pp. 323\u2013332.</ref> As a consequence of accepting 11 million marks from [[Goebbels]]' Ministry of Propaganda and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring's]] Air Ministry, the company was effectively divided, with Luftschiffbau Zeppelin making the airships and the [[Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei]] company (affiliated with [[Lufthansa]]) operating them. Officially, [[Hugo Eckener]] was the head of both entities but, in practice, [[Ernst Lehmann]], who was less opposed to the Nazi regime, ran the latter. As a result of Eckener's criticism of the Nazi regime, Goebbels had ordered his censoring across all forms of public media in 1936.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;282.</ref>\n\nHowever, Luftschiffbau Zeppelin lose much of its favour amongst political circles following the high-profile [[Hindenburg disaster]]; the event compelled the firm to terminate Zeppelin manufacturing in 1938, while all operations of existing airships was ceased by 1940. In August 1939, the [[LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II|''Graf Zeppelin II'']] conducted a reconnaissance flight along [[Great Britain]]'s coastline in an attempt to determine whether the 100&nbsp;metre towers erected from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Scapa Flow]] were used for aircraft radio location.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;295.</ref> The frames of [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']] and ''Graf Zeppelin II'', along with scrap material from the Hindenburg, were subsequently were scrapped that same year for their materials, which were used to fulfil wartime demands for fixed-wing military aircraft for the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''.<ref>Mooney 1972, p. 262.</ref> \n\nDuring the autumn of 1941, the company accepted contracts to produce elements of the [[V-2 rocket]], specifically propellant tanks and fuselage sections.<ref name=Neufeld>{{cite book |last=Neufeld |first=Michael J. |title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenem\u00fcnde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951 |url-access=registration |year=1995 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951/page/143 143]}}</ref> By 17 August 1942, the Allies had suspected that the Zeppelin Works in [[Friedrichshafen]] (as well as the Henschel [[Raxwerke]]) were involved in the supply chain of the V-2,<ref name=Ordway>{{cite book |last=Ordway |first=Frederick I, III |authorlink=Frederick I.

A stipulation had been placed upon the endowment that limited the use of its funds to the field of airships. Over the many years, the investment value of the endowment grew to a point where it had become viable for the funds to be put to use for the purpose of designing, developing, and constructing of a new generation of Zeppelins. In 1988, the first considerations into the technological and economic feasibility of reviving the Zeppelin industry began; this included examinations of historic Zeppelin documentation as well as current designs for airships.<ref name = \"off hist\">[http://zeppelin-nt.de/en/zeppelin-NT/history.html \"History: From first concept, to series production.\"] ''Zeppelin NT'', Retrieved: 7 July 2016.</ref> In December 1990, a feasibility study and accompanying market research program found an initial sales potential for around 80 Zeppelin airships for purposes such as tourism, advertising, and scientific research.

Luftschiffbau Zeppelin came under government control and new personnel were recruited to cope with the increased demand, including the aerodynamicist [[Paul Jaray]] and the stress engineer [[Karl Arnstein]]. Many technological advances originated from the firm's competitor, the [[Mannheim]]-based Sch\u00fctte-Lanz company. While their dirigibles were never as successful, Professor Sch\u00fctte's more scientific approach to airship design led to innovations such as the streamlined hull shape, the simpler cruciform fins (replacing the more complicated box-like arrangements of older Zeppelins), individual direct-drive engine cars, anti-aircraft machine-gun positions,<ref>University of Constance.

New production facilities were set up to assemble Zeppelins from components fabricated in Friedrichshafen.<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 89-90.</ref>\n\nIn 1917, Count von Zeppelin died; control of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin fell to Dr. [[Hugo Eckener]], who had long envisioned dirigibles as vessels of peace rather than of war and hoped to quickly resume civilian flights. Despite considerable difficulties, they completed two small passenger airships; [[Zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee|LZ 120 ''Bodensee'']] {Scrapped July 1928}, which first flew in August 1919 and in the following months transported passengers between Friedrichshafen and Berlin, and a sister-ship ''LZ 121 Nordstern'', {Scrapped September 1926} which was intended for use on a regular route to [[Stockholm]].<ref>Robinson 1973, pp. 257-258.</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1921, the Allied Powers demanded that these airships should be handed over as [[war reparations]] as compensation for the dirigibles destroyed by their crews in 1919. Germany was not allowed to construct military aircraft and only airships of less than {{convert|1000000|ft3|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} were permitted. This brought a halt to Zeppelin's plans for airship development, and the company temporarily resorted to the manufacture of aluminium cooking utensils.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 259.</ref>\n\n===Interwar and Second World War===\nBetween the mid 1920s and 1940, the company worked closely with the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] to manufacture a pair of Zeppelins in the [[United States]]; to cement this relationship, a [[joint venture]] company, the [[Goodyear Aerospace|Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation]], was created to handle such activities. The first airship to be produced under this iniative, the [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|LZ&nbsp;126]], performed its first flight on 27 August 1924.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= U.S. Zeppelin on Trial|section=News in Brief |day_of_week= Friday|date=29 August 1924 |page_number= 9|issue=43743 |column=A }}</ref> However, the Goodyear-Zeppelin partnership was terminated following the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second world War]].<ref>http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=899&nm=Goodyear-Zeppelin-Company</ref> Despite this, the American company continued to produce [[blimp]]s for several decades under the Goodyear name.\n\nDuring 1926, restrictions on airship construction were relaxed by the [[Locarno treaties]], but acquiring the necessary funds for Luftschiffbau Zeppelin's next project proved problematic in the difficult economic situation of post\u2013First World War Germany, requiring two years of lobbying and publicity work to secure the realization of [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']], christened in honour of the firm's founder. On 18 September 1928, when the completed ''Graf Zeppelin'' flew for the first time.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Largest Zeppelin |section=News |day_of_week=  Wednesday |date=19 September 1928 |page_number= 14 |issue=45002 |column=F }}</ref> In the following years, it was not only commenced [[transatlantic]] commercial passenger flights but performed several record-breaking flights, including a successful [[circumnavigation]] of the globe.<ref>Swinfield 2012, pp. 237-239.</ref> Luftschiffbau Zeppelin was keen to continue advancing the capabilities of its airships and begun design work on an even larger airship during the late 1920s.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 283.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the single most famous airship was the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]], the [[lead ship]] of the [[Hindenburg class airship|''Hindenburg'' class]]. It was a large commercial passenger-carrying [[rigid airship]], being the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume.<ref name=\"specs\">[http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/size-speed \"Hindenburg Statistics.\"] airships.net, 2009.

On the whole, [[Nazi Germany]] placed a greater value on 'heavier than air' aircraft over that of zeppelins due to their military superiority. Despite this, zeppelins were prominently used by the nation for a number of major [[propaganda]] campaigns, allegedly to great effect.<ref>Lehmann 1937, pp. 323\u2013332.</ref> As a consequence of accepting 11 million marks from [[Goebbels]]' Ministry of Propaganda and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring's]] Air Ministry, the company was effectively divided, with Luftschiffbau Zeppelin making the airships and the [[Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei]] company (affiliated with [[Lufthansa]]) operating them. Officially, [[Hugo Eckener]] was the head of both entities but, in practice, [[Ernst Lehmann]], who was less opposed to the Nazi regime, ran the latter. As a result of Eckener's criticism of the Nazi regime, Goebbels had ordered his censoring across all forms of public media in 1936.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;282.</ref>\n\nHowever, Luftschiffbau Zeppelin lose much of its favour amongst political circles following the high-profile [[Hindenburg disaster]]; the event compelled the firm to terminate Zeppelin manufacturing in 1938, while all operations of existing airships was ceased by 1940. In August 1939, the [[LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II|''Graf Zeppelin II'']] conducted a reconnaissance flight along [[Great Britain]]'s coastline in an attempt to determine whether the 100&nbsp;metre towers erected from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Scapa Flow]] were used for aircraft radio location.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.&nbsp;295.</ref> The frames of [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']] and ''Graf Zeppelin II'', along with scrap material from the Hindenburg, were subsequently were scrapped that same year for their materials, which were used to fulfil wartime demands for fixed-wing military aircraft for the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''.<ref>Mooney 1972, p. 262.</ref> \n\nDuring the autumn of 1941, the company accepted contracts to produce elements of the [[V-2 rocket]], specifically propellant tanks and fuselage sections.<ref name=Neufeld>{{cite book |last=Neufeld |first=Michael J. |title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenem\u00fcnde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951 |url-access=registration |year=1995 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951/page/143 143]}}</ref> By 17 August 1942, the Allies had suspected that the Zeppelin Works in [[Friedrichshafen]] (as well as the Henschel [[Raxwerke]]) were involved in the supply chain of the V-2,<ref name=Ordway>{{cite book |last=Ordway |first=Frederick I, III |authorlink=Frederick I.

A stipulation had been placed upon the endowment that limited the use of its funds to the field of airships. Over the many years, the investment value of the endowment grew to a point where it had become viable for the funds to be put to use for the purpose of designing, developing, and constructing of a new generation of Zeppelins. In 1988, the first considerations into the technological and economic feasibility of reviving the Zeppelin industry began; this included examinations of historic Zeppelin documentation as well as current designs for airships.<ref name = \"off hist\">[http://zeppelin-nt.de/en/zeppelin-NT/history.html \"History: From first concept, to series production.\"] ''Zeppelin NT'', Retrieved: 7 July 2016.</ref> In December 1990, a feasibility study and accompanying market research program found an initial sales potential for around 80 Zeppelin airships for purposes such as tourism, advertising, and scientific research. In mid 1991, the newly formed development team filed several patents on various technologies that would be later used on the subsequent airship, these included propeller arrangements, structure and girder design, and ballonet implementation.<ref name = \"off hist\"/> In March 1991, a flyable remote control [[proof of concept]] model was demonstrated, which is claimed to have revealed excellent flight characteristics from the onset.<ref name = \"off hist\"/>\n\nIn September 1993, the Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH (ZLT) was founded in Friedrichshafen as a corporate spin-off of the original Zeppelin company to pursue development and production of the new generation of Zeppelins, later known as the Zeppelin NT (New Technology). By spring 1994, preparatory studies for a full-sized prototype were underway.<ref name = \"off hist\"/> In 1995, the [[Luftfahrt-Bundesamt]], Germany's [[civil aviation authority]], officially recognized ZLT as a design organisation, and approved new construction regulations for airships.
