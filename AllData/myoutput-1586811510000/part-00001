As well as playing for Hampshire, Harris appeared for a number of other teams including [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire]], [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]], [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]], [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and several invitation XIs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/29/29984/all_teams.html|title=Teams played for by David Harris|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nNoted for his fast and accurate bowling, Harris was a right arm fast [[underarm bowling|underarm]] bowler and a left-handed batsman.\n\n==Career==\nBorn c. 1755, [[Elvetham]], Hampshire, The earliest known mention of David Harris occurs in a minor match at [[Odiham]] on 27 May 1782 when he played for [[Alresford Cricket Club|Alresford]] and Odiham against a Hampshire County XI.<ref>Waghorn, p.55.</ref> He played for Odiham again in October 1782 in a match against a Berkshire XI, when another Odiham player in the game was one T. Harris.<ref>Waghorn, p.56.</ref>\n\nHarris' first recorded game for Hampshire was against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] on 3\u20135 July 1782, a match which also featured the known debut of Kent's [[Joey Ring]].<ref name=\"SB51\">Haygarth, p. 51.</ref> Although he was never noted as a batsman, Harris made the top score of 27 in Hampshire's first innings, in which they were dismissed for 87.<ref name=\"SB51\"/> Harris played three times for Hampshire in the 1783 season, twice against Kent and once against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]]. He took nine wickets in these matches.<ref>Haygarth, p.57\u201359.</ref>\n\nHarris is only recorded once in 1784 when he again played for Odiham in a minor match. In 1785, when few first-class matches took place, Harris played for [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire]] against [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex]].<ref>Waghorn, p. 64.</ref>\n\nOn 13 July 1776, Harris had his best known performance to date when he took four 1st innings wickets for Hampshire v. Kent at [[Windmill Down]], Hampshire winning the game by 1 wicket. This was the match in which [[Tom Sueter]] was given out [[hit the ball twice]], the earliest recorded instance of this form of dismissal.<ref>Haygarth, p. 66.</ref> On 8\u201312 August of the same year, Harris played for the [[White Conduit Club]] against Kent at [[Bourne Paddock]] and took six wickets in the match, three in each innings, to help White Conduit to a 164 run victory. White Conduit's big win was due to [[Tom Walker (cricketer)|Tom Walker]] and [[Thomas Taylor (cricketer)|Tom Taylor]] becoming the first players known to score a century in the same innings. Walker made 95* and 102, just missing the honour of becoming the first player to score two centuries in a match.<ref>Haygarth, p. 68.</ref>\n\nPlaying for [[Sir Horatio Mann]]'s XI against the [[George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Winchilsea]]'s XI at the new [[Lord's Old Ground]] on 26\u201328 May 1788, Harris took 10 wickets in the match with 4 in the 1st innings and 6 in the 2nd. But it was to little avail as Winchilsea's XI won by 106 runs.<ref>Haygarth, p.81.</ref>\n\nBy now, Harris' reputation was well established and he played regularly in major matches into the 1790s. He was a frequent taker of wickets and again took ten in a match on 30\u201331 August 1790 when he guided Hampshire to a 10-wicket win against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] at Lord's Old Ground.<ref>Haygarth, p.108.</ref> On 15\u201317 August 1792, Harris had the best known return of his career when he took 11 wickets in the match for Hampshire against Kent at Cobham Park, including eight in the first innings. Hampshire won by 8 wickets.<ref>Haygarth, p.140.</ref>\n\nHis later career was ruined by attacks of [[gout]] and Harris played his final match on 13\u201315 August 1798 for All-England v. Surrey at Lord's Old Ground. He took five wickets in the 1st innings and his last, subject to the batting order, was when he bowled [[W. Wells (Middlesex cricketer)|W Wells]] for 5. He scored 0* in his final innings and his team won the match by an innings and 1 run.<ref>Haygarth, p.243\u2013244.</ref> He died 19 May 1803, [[Crookham Village]], Hampshire\n\n==Style and technique==\n{{cquote|In taking my place at the wicket, I almost felt as if taking my ground in a duel... and my terrors were so much increased by the mock pity and sympathy of Hammond, Beldham, and others round the wicket, that when this mighty bowler, this ''Jupiter tonas'', hurled his bolt at me, I shut my eyes in the intensity of my panic, and mechanically gave a random desperate blow, which, to my utter astonishment, was followed by a loud cry all over the ring of 'run, run'.<sub> \u2013 Playwright Lord [[Frederic Reynolds|Frederick Reynolds]] on facing Harris.</sub><ref name=\"Major2007\">{{cite book|last=Major|first=John S.|title=More than a Game: the Story of Cricket's Early Years|year=2007|publisher=HarperPress|location=London|isbn=0-00-718364-X|page=122}}</ref>}}\n\nHarris was highly rated by his contemporaries, especially [[John Nyren]], who called him \"the very best bowler; a bowler who, between any one and himself, comparison must fail\".<ref name=\"N93\"/>\n\nNyren described Harris' style and technique in some detail.
