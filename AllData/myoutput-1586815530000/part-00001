San Giacomo was originally cast in the starring role, since the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show and with top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.\n\nSan Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997\u20131998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Television, Best Actress, Comedy/Musical|Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical]]; the award went to ''[[Ally McBeal|Ally McBeal's]]'' [[Calista Flockhart]].\n\n===Post-''Just Shoot Me!'' and appearances===\nAfter NBC cancelled ''Just Shoot Me!'' in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Handler (TV series)|The Handler]]'' in 2003 and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Unscripted]]'' in 2005. She was the narrator for the [[true crime]] series ''Snapped: Killer Couples'' on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films ''[[Checking Out (2005 film)|Checking Out]]'' and ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', as well as the 2006 film ''Conquistadora''. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on [[The WB Television Network|The WB's]] new drama ''[[Related]]'' in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. [[Kiele Sanchez]] took her place as \"Anne Sorelli\" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the ''15th Annual Environmental Media Awards''.  She made two more public appearances at the ''Crystal and Lucy Awards'' on 6 June 2006 and at the ''3rd Annual [[Alfred E. Mann|Alfred Mann]] Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala'' on 9 September 2006.\n\nIn 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of ''[[Veronica Mars]]''. She reunited with her former [[love interest]] from ''Just Shoot Me!'', [[Enrico Colantoni]], playing Harmony Chase. Both Colantoni and San Giacomo enjoyed their reunion so much that they lobbied for their characters to appear together in further episodes.<ref>[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars,0,2855432.story Former 'Just Shoot Me' Stars Enjoy Life on 'Mars' \u2013 Laura San Giacomo and Enrico Colantoni reunite on CW drama \u2013 Zap2it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926125445/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars%2C0%2C2855432.story |date=2012-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, San Giacomo secured her first starring role on a television program after ''Just Shoot Me!'', when she reunited with a former peer and co-starred opposite fellow Carnegie-Mellon alum [[Holly Hunter]] in [[Turner Network Television|TNT's]] [[drama]] series ''[[Saving Grace (TV Series)|Saving Grace]]''. San Giacomo played Grace's best friend Rhetta Rodriguez.\n\nIn June 2010, San Giacomo guest starred in the episode titled \"Death Becomes Her\" on the [[USA Network|USA network's]] ''[[In Plain Sight]]''. She played a woman from an organized crime family with a terminal illness. In December 2011, San Giacomo appeared on the episode titled \"Beards\" on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', as Caroline, Melanie's estranged sister.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSan Giacomo has been married twice, first to actor [[Cameron Dye]] (1990\u20131998), with whom she had a son, Mason Dye (b. November 19, 1995), who has [[cerebral palsy]], and second to actor [[Matt Adler]] (m. 2000).\nSan Giacomo is a cousin of [[Torry Castellano]], former drummer of the rock group [[The Donnas]].\n\nShe lives in the [[San Fernando Valley]], [[California]]. Her hobbies include horseback riding, gymnastics, ice skating, ballet, tennis, golf and playing piano.\n\nSan Giacomo is a strong supporter of charitable causes, most prominently those related to [[disabilities]]. She has appeared at the [[Environmental Media Awards]], the \"Voices For Change\" gala benefit and concert which benefits Children with Disabilities, and the \"Friends Finding a Cure\" gala benefiting Project [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. She is also a founder of the CHIME Charter Elementary School, an [[elementary school]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California. Chime is an inclusion school for all children of all abilities. The school opened its doors in 2001. As a charter school, CHIME provides free [[public education]] to students and admits them through a lottery system.

She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.\n\nSan Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997\u20131998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Television, Best Actress, Comedy/Musical|Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical]]; the award went to ''[[Ally McBeal|Ally McBeal's]]'' [[Calista Flockhart]].\n\n===Post-''Just Shoot Me!'' and appearances===\nAfter NBC cancelled ''Just Shoot Me!'' in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Handler (TV series)|The Handler]]'' in 2003 and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Unscripted]]'' in 2005. She was the narrator for the [[true crime]] series ''Snapped: Killer Couples'' on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films ''[[Checking Out (2005 film)|Checking Out]]'' and ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', as well as the 2006 film ''Conquistadora''. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on [[The WB Television Network|The WB's]] new drama ''[[Related]]'' in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. [[Kiele Sanchez]] took her place as \"Anne Sorelli\" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the ''15th Annual Environmental Media Awards''.  She made two more public appearances at the ''Crystal and Lucy Awards'' on 6 June 2006 and at the ''3rd Annual [[Alfred E. Mann|Alfred Mann]] Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala'' on 9 September 2006.\n\nIn 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of ''[[Veronica Mars]]''. She reunited with her former [[love interest]] from ''Just Shoot Me!'', [[Enrico Colantoni]], playing Harmony Chase. Both Colantoni and San Giacomo enjoyed their reunion so much that they lobbied for their characters to appear together in further episodes.<ref>[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars,0,2855432.story Former 'Just Shoot Me' Stars Enjoy Life on 'Mars' \u2013 Laura San Giacomo and Enrico Colantoni reunite on CW drama \u2013 Zap2it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926125445/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars%2C0%2C2855432.story |date=2012-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, San Giacomo secured her first starring role on a television program after ''Just Shoot Me!'', when she reunited with a former peer and co-starred opposite fellow Carnegie-Mellon alum [[Holly Hunter]] in [[Turner Network Television|TNT's]] [[drama]] series ''[[Saving Grace (TV Series)|Saving Grace]]''.

In December 2011, San Giacomo appeared on the episode titled \"Beards\" on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', as Caroline, Melanie's estranged sister.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSan Giacomo has been married twice, first to actor [[Cameron Dye]] (1990\u20131998), with whom she had a son, Mason Dye (b. November 19, 1995), who has [[cerebral palsy]], and second to actor [[Matt Adler]] (m. 2000).\nSan Giacomo is a cousin of [[Torry Castellano]], former drummer of the rock group [[The Donnas]].\n\nShe lives in the [[San Fernando Valley]], [[California]].
