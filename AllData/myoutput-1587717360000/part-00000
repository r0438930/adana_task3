Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they can compete in some games for money. In some countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term \"gaming\" can refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional and digital forms, through [[online gambling]]. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the Internet, many communities take the form of [[Internet forum]]s or [[YouTube]] or [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[virtual communities]], as well as [[Real life#As distinct from the Internet|in-person]] [[social clubs]]. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a [[Professional gamer|profession]] for some.\n\n== Origin of the term ''gamer'' ==\nThe term ''gamer'' originally meant ''[[gambling|gambler]]'', and has been in use since at least 1422, when the town laws of [[Walsall]], England, referred to \"any dice-player, carder, tennis player, or other unlawful gamer\". However, this description has not been adopted in the United States, where it became associated with other pastimes. In the US, they made their appearance as [[wargame]]s. Wargames were originally created as a military and strategy tool. When ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' was released, it was originally marketed as a wargame, but later was described by its creators as a [[role-playing game]]. They too called their players ''gamers'' and this is where the word changed definition from someone who gambles to someone who plays [[board game]]s and/or [[video game]]s.<ref name=\"willaert\">{{cite web |last1=Willaert |first1=Kate |title=The Origin Of The Term \"Gamer\" |url=http://www.acriticalhit.com/origin-of-gamer/ |website=ACriticalHit |accessdate=June 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Categories==\n{{Further|Video game#Demographics}}\nIn the United States as of 2018, 28% of gamers are under 18, 29% are 18\u201335, 20% are 36-49 and 23% are over 50.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/|title=U.S. average age of video gamers 2018 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref> In the UK as of 2014, 29% are under 18, 32% are 18-35 and 39% are over 36.<ref name=\"Facts and Figures\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/29/gaming-advocacy-group-the-average-gamer-is-31-and-most-play-on-a-console/|title=Facts and Figures|publisher=Askaboutgames|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613033013/http://www.askaboutgames.com/?c=%2Fpages%2FfactsFigures.jsp|archivedate=June 13, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> According to [[Pew Research Center]], 49% of adults have played a video game at some point in their life and those who have are more likely to let their children or future children play.

However, oftentimes, these popular gamers can locate even more lucrative options. One such option is found through online [[live streaming]] of their games. These gamers who take time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream, usually through sponsorships with large companies looking for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer.  Live streaming often occurs through popular websites such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], [[Hitbox]], [[Mixer.com|Mixer]] and [[YouTube]]. Professional gamers with particularly large followings can often bring their fan bases to watch them play on live streams. An example of this is shown through retired professional [[League of Legends]] player, Wei Han-Dong also known as \"CaoMei\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/3/7149137/league-of-legends-pro-player-retires-to-stream|title=League of Legends pro-player retires to stream games for more than $800,000|last=emilygera|date=2014-11-03|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Han-Dong had decided to retire from [[Esports]] due to his ability to acquire substantially higher pay through live streaming.

They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=2004-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607203445/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2004/07/gars-07142004.ars|archive-date=2011-06-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Classification in taxonomies===\n\nA number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:\n* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.\n* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[glitch]]es, and expose all game mechanics.\n* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.\n* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.\n* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it such as Atrox, the God of Knowledge..\nThe [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described esthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Avatar==\n{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}\n{{See also|Player character}}\nCreating an avatar sets the stage of a player becoming an avatar; it is the first interaction that a potential player must make to identify themselves among the gaming community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|title=26 Important Steps To Become A Pro Gamer|date=2018-08-13|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121040/https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|archive-date=2019-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} While some well-known gamers only go by their online handle, a number have adopted to using their handle within their real name typically presented as a [[middle name]], such as [[Ninja (video game player)|Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins]] or [[sinatraa|Jay \"sinatraa\" Won]].\n\nSimilarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\n==Clans and guilds==\nA [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\n==Identity==\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].<ref name=\"overlandClueless\"/> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]'' founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"[[cinemaphile]]\".<ref name=\"escapistPublisherNote\">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming|access-date=2015-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117150925/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|archive-date=2016-01-17|url-status=live}}</ref> People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\">{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014|access-date=2015-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123185112/http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|archive-date=2015-11-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"newmediaDoYou\">{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they can compete in some games for money. In some countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term \"gaming\" can refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional and digital forms, through [[online gambling]]. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the Internet, many communities take the form of [[Internet forum]]s or [[YouTube]] or [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[virtual communities]], as well as [[Real life#As distinct from the Internet|in-person]] [[social clubs]]. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a [[Professional gamer|profession]] for some.\n\n== Origin of the term ''gamer'' ==\nThe term ''gamer'' originally meant ''[[gambling|gambler]]'', and has been in use since at least 1422, when the town laws of [[Walsall]], England, referred to \"any dice-player, carder, tennis player, or other unlawful gamer\". However, this description has not been adopted in the United States, where it became associated with other pastimes. In the US, they made their appearance as [[wargame]]s.

However, oftentimes, these popular gamers can locate even more lucrative options. One such option is found through online [[live streaming]] of their games. These gamers who take time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream, usually through sponsorships with large companies looking for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer.  Live streaming often occurs through popular websites such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], [[Hitbox]], [[Mixer.com|Mixer]] and [[YouTube]]. Professional gamers with particularly large followings can often bring their fan bases to watch them play on live streams. An example of this is shown through retired professional [[League of Legends]] player, Wei Han-Dong also known as \"CaoMei\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/3/7149137/league-of-legends-pro-player-retires-to-stream|title=League of Legends pro-player retires to stream games for more than $800,000|last=emilygera|date=2014-11-03|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Han-Dong had decided to retire from [[Esports]] due to his ability to acquire substantially higher pay through live streaming.

They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=2004-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607203445/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2004/07/gars-07142004.ars|archive-date=2011-06-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Classification in taxonomies===\n\nA number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:\n* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.\n* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[glitch]]es, and expose all game mechanics.\n* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.\n* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.\n* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it such as Atrox, the God of Knowledge..\nThe [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described esthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Avatar==\n{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}\n{{See also|Player character}}\nCreating an avatar sets the stage of a player becoming an avatar; it is the first interaction that a potential player must make to identify themselves among the gaming community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|title=26 Important Steps To Become A Pro Gamer|date=2018-08-13|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121040/https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|archive-date=2019-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} While some well-known gamers only go by their online handle, a number have adopted to using their handle within their real name typically presented as a [[middle name]], such as [[Ninja (video game player)|Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins]] or [[sinatraa|Jay \"sinatraa\" Won]].\n\nSimilarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\n==Clans and guilds==\nA [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\n==Identity==\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].<ref name=\"overlandClueless\"/> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]'' founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"[[cinemaphile]]\".<ref name=\"escapistPublisherNote\">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming|access-date=2015-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117150925/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|archive-date=2016-01-17|url-status=live}}</ref> People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\">{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014|access-date=2015-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123185112/http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|archive-date=2015-11-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"newmediaDoYou\">{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?
