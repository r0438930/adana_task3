The club currently plays in the Norwegian [[Eliteserien]], the first tier in the [[Norwegian football league system]], after having been promoted in the 2008/2009-season. FK Haugesund previously played in the top division in 1996-1998 and 2000. FKH have been runners-up in the [[Norwegian Cup]] in 2007 and 2019 as well as having competed in the qualifying stages for the [[UEFA Europa League]] in 2014-15, 2017-18 and 2019-20. The club's best achievement in the league is the bronze medal in the Eliteserien in 2013, second place in 2016 and 2018.\n\nIt was originally founded on October 28 1993, after a merger between the Haugesund-based football clubs [[SK Djerv 1919|Djerv 1919]] and [[SK Haugar]]. The club's home matches are played at [[Haugesund Stadion]]. Their current head coach is former player, head coach and sporting director [[Jostein Grindhaug]].\n\n==History==\n===Domestic history===\n'''1993-2000: A new era of football in the city of Haugesund'''\n\nFotballklubben Haugesund was originally founded on October 28th 1993 after local Haugesund-based football clubs [[Haugar]] and [[Djerv 1919]] merged their elite teams with the goal of establishing a team, with strong local roots, from the Haugaland-region in the top division in Norway. Teams in age-appropriate classes and for women was originally not a part of the deal in the merger. As of 2017 there have been talks of incorporating a women's team with uncertain future prospects, but with the possibility of a merger with [[Avaldsnes IL]] <ref>https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/bVlVA/avaldsnes-frir-til-haugesund-vil-ha-fkh-i-toppserien </ref>. The local football club [[SK Vard Haugesund]] was also present to participate in the merger, but in the general meeting of the club, Vard chose to not to be part of the incorporation. In the autumn of 2005, however, talks and negotiations to incorporate Vard were resumed, and since the 2007-season Vard has played the role as a [[farmer club]] for FK Haugesund. \n\nIn the first season in the divisional system, 1994, FK Haugesund got promoted from the second division, under head-coach [[Conny Karlsson]] <ref> https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/2._divisjon_fotball_for_menn_1994 </ref> <ref> http://www.altomfotball.no/element.do?cmd=teamAbout&teamId=306&tournamentId=1&seasonId=210&useFullUrl=false </ref>. Karlsson who unexpectedly did not get his contract renewed at [[Landskrona]] after promotion to [[Allsvenskan]], went to take over the newly formed FK Haugesund. This became a formidable success with promotion in the debut season in 1994, a great debut in the 1st division with a 4th place in his second season, before promotion to Tippeligaen in 1996. After an impressive 9th place in Karlssons debut season in the top division, Haugesund got relegated in Karlsson's fifth season in 1998. <ref> http://www.altomfotball.no/element.do?cmd=team&teamId=306&tournamentId=1&seasonId=207 </ref> However, the team again got promoted the following year, but ended with only one year in [[Tippeligaen]]. Even if Conny Karlsson's stay at FK Haugesund ended with relegation, he still is a popular figure among the supporter club of FK Haugesund, [[Maakeberget]], having named club anthem after him (''\"Connys Englar\"'') <ref>https://maakeberget.no/2010/04/fkh-sanger/</ref> <ref> https://www.h-avis.no/haugesund/puls/sport/se-vamp-spille-connys-englar/s/5-62-904300</ref>\n\n'''The 2000s: Relegation, promotion and the Norwegian cup final'''\n\nAfter having played four consecutive seasons in the first division after the club's relegation in 2000 from Tippeligaen, FK Haugesund relegated from the 1st division in 2004 <ref> https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/7ln8zw/graat-etter-nedrykk </ref>. The team thus spent the 2005 season in the 2nd division, however, FK Haugesund moved right back up after becoming the best team to advance from the 2nd division. The seasons 2006-2009 the club established itself as a stable team in the first division, under head coach [[Rune Skarsfjord]], with growing potential of promotion to the Tippeligaen <ref> https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/zL5lOw/skarsfjord-overtar-haugesund </ref> <ref> https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/A4rKq/haugesund-forlenget-med-skarsfjord </ref>. In 2008 however, Rune Skarsfjord became extremely disliked by both players and members of the club and unpopular among fans, due to his brash and unfriendly persona and eventually got sacked <ref> https://www.nettavisen.no/sport/fotball/skarsfjord-takker-for-seg/2412501.html </ref> <ref> https://www.h-avis.no/sport/skarsfjord-bekrefter-motet/s/2-2.921-1.1760537 </ref> <ref> https://www.h-avis.no/sport/fotball/fkh/rune-skarsfjord-kom-og-han-kjopte-sikkert-25-spillere-da-var-det-slutt-for-meg/s/5-62-612582 </ref> <ref> https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/fotball/i/mR5pqg/fkh-fansen-bitre-paa-skarsfjord </ref> and was replaced with former long time-FK Haugesund-player Jostein Grindhaug <ref> https://www.h-avis.no/sport/haugesund/fkh/peiste-pa-i-sju-ar/s/5-62-116798 </ref>. The 2009 season was a great success as the team won promotion once again the Tippeligaen. From the 2010 season the team has played in the Tippeligaen, now renamed [[Eliteserien]]. At the end of 2009, the club chose to start its own corporation for financial purposes. \n\nThe club's best performance in the [[Norwegian Cup]] came in 2007 when the club reached the final, as a 2nd division team. However the final at the Norwegian national arena, [[Ullevaal Stadium]], on November 11 2007, [[Lillestr\u00f8m SK]] won 2-0 after two goals by [[Canadian]] striker [[Olivier Occean]]. On their way to the final, FK Haugesund beat Nybergsund in the quarterfinals and [[Odd Grenland]] in the semi-final. This was also the fifth time a team from Haugesund has played a final in the cup - previously the city has been represented by [[Sportsklubben Haugar]] (''1961'', ''1979''), [[SK Vard Haugesund]] (''1962'', ''1975''). However, all four previous finals in the Norwegian Cup has ended with losses. \n\n'''The 2010s: A proven club in the Eliteserien'''\n\nAfter the promotion in 2009, FKH did relatively well both in terms of sporting results and financially. This meant the team were able to compete on the upper half of the table most seasons, with a team that in large part consisted of homegrown players from the Haugesund/Haugalandet-area. \n\nIn financial terms, the club has frequently been praised by sport commentators and journalists for being an effective, meticulous and well-driven club. This is due to the clubs focus on bringing up local talents rather than buying players elsewhere. In 2013 the club presented a profit of NOK 6.6 million NOK before tax, and a market revenues, ticket revenues of NOK 57.5 million in 2013, revenue was almost NOK 10 million more than budgeted (66.3 million). In 2012, the equity was estimated to NOK 6.8 million. At the end of the year it had risen to NOK 11.6 million. <ref>https://www.tv2.no/a/5405773/</ref> <ref>https://karmoynytt.no/fkh-attraktive-pa-sponsormarkedet/28.04-09:29</ref>. In 2019 FK Haugesund could once again present very good financial results, as one of 7 clubs in the Eliteserien. The Norwegian Football Association's presentation of club operations for the first six months of the year. This means that they were back in the green category after falling into the yellow category in the previous two reports.<ref>http://www.fkh.no/nyheter/tilbake-i-gronn-kategori</ref>\n\nIn the first few years the team ended up in the middle of the table: Two sixth places in the 2010 and 2011 season were followed by a seventh place in 2012. In the 2013 season, the team's preliminary ranking came third, with third place. After the bronze, the results have been poorer, with 11th and 12th place in the following two years, before there was a rise in 2016 with 4 place. 2018 was again a strong year with either good placement in the series with a strong fourth place. In 2019 FK Haugesund reached the cup final for the second time after beating Odd 3-0, but in the final Viking became too strong with a 1-0 victory.\n\n===European tournament history===\n\nIn 2014 FK Haugesund for the first time participated in the qualifying stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]], [[UEFA Europa League]]. Welsh team [[Airbus UK Broughton]] was beaten 3-2 overall. In the second round Bosnian team [[FK Sarajevo]] won 3-2 overall.\n\nIn 2017 FK Haugesund once again got to participate in the qualifying stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]]. This time, the Northern-Irish team [[Coleraine]] easily got beaten 7-0 overall, before a 3-2 win at home over Polish team [[Lech Poznan]] thus followed by a 2-0 loss away and exit from the qualifying stages. \n \nIn 2019 FK Haugesund got qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League]] qualification and went out with the lowest possible margin against [[PSV]] in the third qualifying round 0-1 at home, and 0-0 away. FK Haugesund beat Northern Irish [[Cliftonville]] in the first round, winning 6-1 overall, before beating [[Sturm Graz]] of Austria 2-0 at home in the second round, and 1-2 losses away, and thus 3-2 further overall.\n\n===Statistics from recent seasons===\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-table;\">\n{{main|List of FK Haugesund seasons}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

The supporter club was founded on May 8, 1996. The origin of the name \"Maakeberget\" comes from the 3 [[gulls]] in the city's [[coat of arms]] and \"''The mountain inward the fjord and along the sea''\" when arriving at the city by sea. FK Haugesund has a strong presence in the City of Haugesund. \n\nMaakebergets residence is the West Stand (''\"Vestre St\u00e5\"'') at [[Haugesund Stadion]]. The West stand is considered sacred ground among the supporters, not because there is anyone buried there, but because the supporters, who have their presence in the said stand, view this terrace as a temple for football in [[Haugesund]]. Maakeberget is a non-profit organization with strong democratic principles. There are no criteria that must be met to be a member, nor any age limit. The supporter club holds several member meetings a year, and the Board meets once a month. The board has a certain link to the management of the club, but still strives to keep the board / administration at arm's length. The supporter club also deals with the sale of supporter equipment in its own supporter shop, at the stadium and at Stamstedet on match days. All sales are based on [[dugnad]], with a small profit to the Maakeberget, which goes back in full to the members with the main emphasis on support for away matches.\n\nMaakeberget and supporters of FK Haugesund are often called \"''Maaker''\" (\"''Seagulls''\"), and sometimes \"''Arabs''\" by outside fans and commentators. However, FKH-supporters and people from Haugesund very rarely refer to themselves as \"Arabs\", and it is by some considered pejorative. It is unclear where the term \"Maaker\" originated. A typical \"maake\" is often described as being born in the city, raised in the [[Flotmyr]]-part of the city of [[Haugesund]], has little sympathy for rivals [[Viking FK]] and [[SK Brann]], votes for right-wing [[H\u00f8yre]] or [[Progress Party (Norway) ]] (oddly enough) and has a passion, not only for the football team, but also for the city of Haugesund. However, one does not have to be \"typical maake\" at all to be a passionate supporter of the Fotballklubben Haugesund <ref>https://maakeberget.no/om_maakeberget/</ref>.\n\n==Rivalry==\n\n'''The main rivals''' of FK Haugesund is [[Viking FK]] and to a lesser degree [[SK Brann]]. Historically, [[SK Vard Haugesund]] are perceived as minor local rivals due to the resistance in forming FK Haugesund in 1993. The rivalries with Brann and Viking are often referred to as ''Vestlandsderbyet'' (the [[Western Norway]] derby).\n\n==Stadium and facilities==\n{{ infobox stadium\n| name                = Haugesund Stadion\n| nickname            = Gaml\u00e5\n| image               = File:Haugesund Stadion.jpg\n| fullname            = \n| former_names        = \n| location            = [[Haugesund]], [[Norway]]\n| coordinates         = {{coord|59.413068|5.279379|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| broke_ground        = \n| built               = 1920\n| opened              = \n| renovated           = \n| expanded            = 2013\n| closed              = \n| demolished          = \n| owner               = FKH AS (60%), Haugesund Kommune (40%)\n| operator            = HKFKH AS\n| surface             = Natural Grass\n| scoreboard          = \n| estimated_cost      = \n| suites              = \n| project_manager     = \n| structural engineer = \n| services engineer   = \n| general_contractor  = \n| main_contractors    = \n| capacity            = 8,754\n| record_attendance   = \n| executive_suites    = \n| dimensions          = 105 x 68 m\n| acreage             = \n}}\n\n'''Haugesund Stadion''' officially opened on 17 May 1920. The ground was built by the council and initially shared by three local football clubs. The ground was first nothing more than a bare gravel pitch and some changing facilities, and it took until 1926 for the first stand to be built. The stadium got further expanded in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe stadium has an official capacity of 8,754. The stadium is colloquially referred to as \"Gaml\u00e5\" (the Old One).\n\nHaugesund Stadion set its record attendance in [[1961]] when 17,000 spectators attended a match between [[Haugesund]] and [[Steinkjer]]. Over the years, the stadium remained a basic structure with an athletics [[track]] and little cover. In the mid 2000s, Haugesund explored the option to build an entirely new stadium, but in the end opted to renovate Haugesund Stadium. Redevelopment works were performed in 2012 and 2013 and included the removal of the athletics track and construction of new stands, including a new main stand. The stadium is located on the western edge of Haugesund's city centre.<ref>https://www.stadiumguide.com/haugesund-stadion/</ref>\n\nThere were demands from the clubs that a grass pitch should be installed. The municipal council voted in December 1945 in favor of laying a grass field on the stadium, as well as building a training ground next door at Flotmyr. The upgrades of the main stadium came at NOK&nbsp;75,000, while the Flotmyr field cost NOK&nbsp;120,000. The new pitch there was opened in July 1946 with a match between Vard and the Bergen City Team in front of 3,000 spectators. The new grass turf field on the main stadium was opened in August 1948. It also received a new entrance, and the following year stands for a further 500 spectators. The grass and stands were improved several times in the following years and decades.

The club currently plays in the Norwegian [[Eliteserien]], the first tier in the [[Norwegian football league system]], after having been promoted in the 2008/2009-season. FK Haugesund previously played in the top division in 1996-1998 and 2000. FKH have been runners-up in the [[Norwegian Cup]] in 2007 and 2019 as well as having competed in the qualifying stages for the [[UEFA Europa League]] in 2014-15, 2017-18 and 2019-20. The club's best achievement in the league is the bronze medal in the Eliteserien in 2013, second place in 2016 and 2018.\n\nIt was originally founded on October 28 1993, after a merger between the Haugesund-based football clubs [[SK Djerv 1919|Djerv 1919]] and [[SK Haugar]]. The club's home matches are played at [[Haugesund Stadion]]. Their current head coach is former player, head coach and sporting director [[Jostein Grindhaug]].\n\n==History==\n===Domestic history===\n'''1993-2000: A new era of football in the city of Haugesund'''\n\nFotballklubben Haugesund was originally founded on October 28th 1993 after local Haugesund-based football clubs [[Haugar]] and [[Djerv 1919]] merged their elite teams with the goal of establishing a team, with strong local roots, from the Haugaland-region in the top division in Norway. Teams in age-appropriate classes and for women was originally not a part of the deal in the merger. As of 2017 there have been talks of incorporating a women's team with uncertain future prospects, but with the possibility of a merger with [[Avaldsnes IL]] <ref>https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/bVlVA/avaldsnes-frir-til-haugesund-vil-ha-fkh-i-toppserien </ref>. The local football club [[SK Vard Haugesund]] was also present to participate in the merger, but in the general meeting of the club, Vard chose to not to be part of the incorporation. In the autumn of 2005, however, talks and negotiations to incorporate Vard were resumed, and since the 2007-season Vard has played the role as a [[farmer club]] for FK Haugesund. \n\nIn the first season in the divisional system, 1994, FK Haugesund got promoted from the second division, under head-coach [[Conny Karlsson]] <ref> https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/2._divisjon_fotball_for_menn_1994 </ref> <ref> http://www.altomfotball.no/element.do?cmd=teamAbout&teamId=306&tournamentId=1&seasonId=210&useFullUrl=false </ref>. Karlsson who unexpectedly did not get his contract renewed at [[Landskrona]] after promotion to [[Allsvenskan]], went to take over the newly formed FK Haugesund. This became a formidable success with promotion in the debut season in 1994, a great debut in the 1st division with a 4th place in his second season, before promotion to Tippeligaen in 1996. After an impressive 9th place in Karlssons debut season in the top division, Haugesund got relegated in Karlsson's fifth season in 1998. <ref> http://www.altomfotball.no/element.do?cmd=team&teamId=306&tournamentId=1&seasonId=207 </ref> However, the team again got promoted the following year, but ended with only one year in [[Tippeligaen]]. Even if Conny Karlsson's stay at FK Haugesund ended with relegation, he still is a popular figure among the supporter club of FK Haugesund, [[Maakeberget]], having named club anthem after him (''\"Connys Englar\"'') <ref>https://maakeberget.no/2010/04/fkh-sanger/</ref> <ref> https://www.h-avis.no/haugesund/puls/sport/se-vamp-spille-connys-englar/s/5-62-904300</ref>\n\n'''The 2000s: Relegation, promotion and the Norwegian cup final'''\n\nAfter having played four consecutive seasons in the first division after the club's relegation in 2000 from Tippeligaen, FK Haugesund relegated from the 1st division in 2004 <ref> https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/7ln8zw/graat-etter-nedrykk </ref>. The team thus spent the 2005 season in the 2nd division, however, FK Haugesund moved right back up after becoming the best team to advance from the 2nd division. The seasons 2006-2009 the club established itself as a stable team in the first division, under head coach [[Rune Skarsfjord]], with growing potential of promotion to the Tippeligaen <ref> https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/zL5lOw/skarsfjord-overtar-haugesund </ref> <ref> https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/A4rKq/haugesund-forlenget-med-skarsfjord </ref>. In 2008 however, Rune Skarsfjord became extremely disliked by both players and members of the club and unpopular among fans, due to his brash and unfriendly persona and eventually got sacked <ref> https://www.nettavisen.no/sport/fotball/skarsfjord-takker-for-seg/2412501.html </ref> <ref> https://www.h-avis.no/sport/skarsfjord-bekrefter-motet/s/2-2.921-1.1760537 </ref> <ref> https://www.h-avis.no/sport/fotball/fkh/rune-skarsfjord-kom-og-han-kjopte-sikkert-25-spillere-da-var-det-slutt-for-meg/s/5-62-612582 </ref> <ref> https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/fotball/i/mR5pqg/fkh-fansen-bitre-paa-skarsfjord </ref> and was replaced with former long time-FK Haugesund-player Jostein Grindhaug <ref> https://www.h-avis.no/sport/haugesund/fkh/peiste-pa-i-sju-ar/s/5-62-116798 </ref>. The 2009 season was a great success as the team won promotion once again the Tippeligaen. From the 2010 season the team has played in the Tippeligaen, now renamed [[Eliteserien]]. At the end of 2009, the club chose to start its own corporation for financial purposes. \n\nThe club's best performance in the [[Norwegian Cup]] came in 2007 when the club reached the final, as a 2nd division team. However the final at the Norwegian national arena, [[Ullevaal Stadium]], on November 11 2007, [[Lillestr\u00f8m SK]] won 2-0 after two goals by [[Canadian]] striker [[Olivier Occean]]. On their way to the final, FK Haugesund beat Nybergsund in the quarterfinals and [[Odd Grenland]] in the semi-final. This was also the fifth time a team from Haugesund has played a final in the cup - previously the city has been represented by [[Sportsklubben Haugar]] (''1961'', ''1979''), [[SK Vard Haugesund]] (''1962'', ''1975''). However, all four previous finals in the Norwegian Cup has ended with losses. \n\n'''The 2010s: A proven club in the Eliteserien'''\n\nAfter the promotion in 2009, FKH did relatively well both in terms of sporting results and financially. This meant the team were able to compete on the upper half of the table most seasons, with a team that in large part consisted of homegrown players from the Haugesund/Haugalandet-area. \n\nIn financial terms, the club has frequently been praised by sport commentators and journalists for being an effective, meticulous and well-driven club. This is due to the clubs focus on bringing up local talents rather than buying players elsewhere. In 2013 the club presented a profit of NOK 6.6 million NOK before tax, and a market revenues, ticket revenues of NOK 57.5 million in 2013, revenue was almost NOK 10 million more than budgeted (66.3 million). In 2012, the equity was estimated to NOK 6.8 million. At the end of the year it had risen to NOK 11.6 million. <ref>https://www.tv2.no/a/5405773/</ref> <ref>https://karmoynytt.no/fkh-attraktive-pa-sponsormarkedet/28.04-09:29</ref>. In 2019 FK Haugesund could once again present very good financial results, as one of 7 clubs in the Eliteserien. The Norwegian Football Association's presentation of club operations for the first six months of the year. This means that they were back in the green category after falling into the yellow category in the previous two reports.<ref>http://www.fkh.no/nyheter/tilbake-i-gronn-kategori</ref>\n\nIn the first few years the team ended up in the middle of the table: Two sixth places in the 2010 and 2011 season were followed by a seventh place in 2012. In the 2013 season, the team's preliminary ranking came third, with third place. After the bronze, the results have been poorer, with 11th and 12th place in the following two years, before there was a rise in 2016 with 4 place. 2018 was again a strong year with either good placement in the series with a strong fourth place. In 2019 FK Haugesund reached the cup final for the second time after beating Odd 3-0, but in the final Viking became too strong with a 1-0 victory.\n\n===European tournament history===\n\nIn 2014 FK Haugesund for the first time participated in the qualifying stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]], [[UEFA Europa League]]. Welsh team [[Airbus UK Broughton]] was beaten 3-2 overall. In the second round Bosnian team [[FK Sarajevo]] won 3-2 overall.\n\nIn 2017 FK Haugesund once again got to participate in the qualifying stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]]. This time, the Northern-Irish team [[Coleraine]] easily got beaten 7-0 overall, before a 3-2 win at home over Polish team [[Lech Poznan]] thus followed by a 2-0 loss away and exit from the qualifying stages. \n \nIn 2019 FK Haugesund got qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League]] qualification and went out with the lowest possible margin against [[PSV]] in the third qualifying round 0-1 at home, and 0-0 away. FK Haugesund beat Northern Irish [[Cliftonville]] in the first round, winning 6-1 overall, before beating [[Sturm Graz]] of Austria 2-0 at home in the second round, and 1-2 losses away, and thus 3-2 further overall.\n\n===Statistics from recent seasons===\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-table;\">\n{{main|List of FK Haugesund seasons}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

The supporter club was founded on May 8, 1996. The origin of the name \"Maakeberget\" comes from the 3 [[gulls]] in the city's [[coat of arms]] and \"''The mountain inward the fjord and along the sea''\" when arriving at the city by sea. FK Haugesund has a strong presence in the City of Haugesund. \n\nMaakebergets residence is the West Stand (''\"Vestre St\u00e5\"'') at [[Haugesund Stadion]]. The West stand is considered sacred ground among the supporters, not because there is anyone buried there, but because the supporters, who have their presence in the said stand, view this terrace as a temple for football in [[Haugesund]]. Maakeberget is a non-profit organization with strong democratic principles. There are no criteria that must be met to be a member, nor any age limit. The supporter club holds several member meetings a year, and the Board meets once a month. The board has a certain link to the management of the club, but still strives to keep the board / administration at arm's length. The supporter club also deals with the sale of supporter equipment in its own supporter shop, at the stadium and at Stamstedet on match days. All sales are based on [[dugnad]], with a small profit to the Maakeberget, which goes back in full to the members with the main emphasis on support for away matches.\n\nMaakeberget and supporters of FK Haugesund are often called \"''Maaker''\" (\"''Seagulls''\"), and sometimes \"''Arabs''\" by outside fans and commentators. However, FKH-supporters and people from Haugesund very rarely refer to themselves as \"Arabs\", and it is by some considered pejorative. It is unclear where the term \"Maaker\" originated. A typical \"maake\" is often described as being born in the city, raised in the [[Flotmyr]]-part of the city of [[Haugesund]], has little sympathy for rivals [[Viking FK]] and [[SK Brann]], votes for right-wing [[H\u00f8yre]] or [[Progress Party (Norway) ]] (oddly enough) and has a passion, not only for the football team, but also for the city of Haugesund. However, one does not have to be \"typical maake\" at all to be a passionate supporter of the Fotballklubben Haugesund <ref>https://maakeberget.no/om_maakeberget/</ref>.\n\n==Rivalry==\n\n'''The main rivals''' of FK Haugesund is [[Viking FK]] and to a lesser degree [[SK Brann]]. Historically, [[SK Vard Haugesund]] are perceived as minor local rivals due to the resistance in forming FK Haugesund in 1993. The rivalries with Brann and Viking are often referred to as ''Vestlandsderbyet'' (the [[Western Norway]] derby).\n\n==Stadium and facilities==\n{{ infobox stadium\n| name                = Haugesund Stadion\n| nickname            = Gaml\u00e5\n| image               = File:Haugesund Stadion.jpg\n| fullname            = \n| former_names        = \n| location            = [[Haugesund]], [[Norway]]\n| coordinates         = {{coord|59.413068|5.279379|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| broke_ground        = \n| built               = 1920\n| opened              = \n| renovated           = \n| expanded            = 2013\n| closed              = \n| demolished          = \n| owner               = FKH AS (60%), Haugesund Kommune (40%)\n| operator            = HKFKH AS\n| surface             = Natural Grass\n| scoreboard          = \n| estimated_cost      = \n| suites              = \n| project_manager     = \n| structural engineer = \n| services engineer   = \n| general_contractor  = \n| main_contractors    = \n| capacity            = 8,754\n| record_attendance   = \n| executive_suites    = \n| dimensions          = 105 x 68 m\n| acreage             = \n}}\n\n'''Haugesund Stadion''' officially opened on 17 May 1920. The ground was built by the council and initially shared by three local football clubs. The ground was first nothing more than a bare gravel pitch and some changing facilities, and it took until 1926 for the first stand to be built. The stadium got further expanded in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe stadium has an official capacity of 8,754. The stadium is colloquially referred to as \"Gaml\u00e5\" (the Old One).\n\nHaugesund Stadion set its record attendance in [[1961]] when 17,000 spectators attended a match between [[Haugesund]] and [[Steinkjer]]. Over the years, the stadium remained a basic structure with an athletics [[track]] and little cover. In the mid 2000s, Haugesund explored the option to build an entirely new stadium, but in the end opted to renovate Haugesund Stadium. Redevelopment works were performed in 2012 and 2013 and included the removal of the athletics track and construction of new stands, including a new main stand. The stadium is located on the western edge of Haugesund's city centre.<ref>https://www.stadiumguide.com/haugesund-stadion/</ref>\n\nThere were demands from the clubs that a grass pitch should be installed. The municipal council voted in December 1945 in favor of laying a grass field on the stadium, as well as building a training ground next door at Flotmyr. The upgrades of the main stadium came at NOK&nbsp;75,000, while the Flotmyr field cost NOK&nbsp;120,000. The new pitch there was opened in July 1946 with a match between Vard and the Bergen City Team in front of 3,000 spectators. The new grass turf field on the main stadium was opened in August 1948. It also received a new entrance, and the following year stands for a further 500 spectators. The grass and stands were improved several times in the following years and decades. The grass turf on Flotmyr gradually fell into disrepair and was later relegated to a gravel field. The Haugesund Stadion name was adopted in 1968.<ref name=djerv>Fjon: 57</ref>\n\nDiscussions of a new stadium or an upgrade have been carried out since the mid 2000s. In 2005 there was a proposal to build an all-new 8,000 seat stadium at Flotmyr.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.h-avis.no/sport/slik-blir-nye-haugesund-stadion-1.1687709 |title=Slik blir nye Haugesund stadion |last=Engerstvedt |first=Vidar |date=24 November 2005 |work=[[Haugesunds Avis]] |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2012 survey carried out by the [[Norwegian Players' Association]] among away-team captains, Haugesund Stadion was ranked ninth amongst league stadiums, with a score of 3.20 on a scale from one to five.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |title=Lerkendal nest beste fotballbane |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CYl4tTGG?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=30 November 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nHaugesund Stadion was previously a [[multi-purpose stadium]], but the [[running track]] was removed after the 2012 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.h-avis.no/sport/gravingen-er-i-full-gang-1.7640138 |language=Norwegian |title=Gravingen er i full gang |publisher=Haugesunds Avis |first=Audun |last=Egenber |date=12 November 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n{{updated|5 April 2020}}<ref>{{cite web|title=A-lag spillere|url=http://www.fkh.no/lag|website=fkh.no/|publisher=FK Haugesund|accessdate=21 March 2019|language=Norwegian|date=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n===Current squad===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|nat=NOR|name=[[Helge Sandvik]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|nat=CIV|name=[[Benjamin Karamoko]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=NOR|name=[[Fredrik Pallesen Knudsen]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=DNK|name=[[Benjamin Hansen]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=NOR|name=[[Joakim V\u00e5ge Nilsen]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=NOR|name=[[Christian Grindheim]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=NOR|name=[[Kevin Martin Kryg\u00e5rd]]|pos=MF}} \n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=FIN|name=[[Benjamin K\u00e4llman]]|pos=FW|other=on loan from [[FC Inter Turku|Inter Turku]]}} \n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=NOR|name=[[Niklas Sandberg (Norwegian footballer)|Niklas Sandberg]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=DNK|name=[[Alexander Ammitzb\u00f8ll]]|pos=FW|other=on loan from [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|AGF]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=NOR|name=[[Torbj\u00f8rn Kallev\u00e5g]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=NOR|name=[[Ulrik Fredriksen]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=CPV|name=[[Bruno Leite]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=SEN|name=[[Ibrahima Wadji]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=NOR|name=Kristoffer Gunnarshaug|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=DNK|name=[[Mikkel Desler]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=NGR|name=[[Shuaibu Ibrahim]]|pos=FW}} \n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=NOR|name=[[Alexander St\u00f8l\u00e5s]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=NOR|name=Thore Baardsen Pedersen|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=NOR|name=Mads Berg Sande|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=32|nat=NOR|name=Frank Stolpe|pos=GK}} \n{{Fs player|no=99|nat=NOR|name=[[Kristoffer Velde]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs end}}\n''For season transfers, see [[List of Norwegian football transfers winter 2019\u201320|transfers winter 2019\u201320]] and [[List of Norwegian football transfers summer 2020|transfers summer 2020]].''\n\n===Out on loan===\n{{fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=MLI|name=[[Ibrahima Kon\u00e9 (footballer, born 1999)|Ibrahima Kon\u00e9]]|pos=FW|other=on loan to [[Adana Demirspor]] until 31 July 2020}}  \n{{Fs player|no=93|nat=NOR|name=Dennis Horneland|pos=DF|other=on loan to [[SK Vard Haugesund|Vard Haugesund]] until 31 December 2020}}  \n{{fs end}}\n\n===Famous players===\n{{column start}}\n* {{flag|Nigeria}} [[Felix Ademola]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Tor Arne Andreassen]]\n* {{flag|Sweden}} [[Hasse Berggren]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Morten Berre]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Trond Erik Bertelsen]]\n* {{flag|Sweden}} [[Anders Blomquist]]\n* {{flag|Serbia}} [[Nikola \u0110ur\u0111i\u0107]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Geir Ludvig Fevang]]\n* {{flag|Nigeria}} [[Bala Garba]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Jostein Grindhaug]] \n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Christian Grindheim]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Asbj\u00f8rn Helgeland]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Kenneth H\u00f8ie]]\n* {{flag|Sweden}} [[Magnus Johansson]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Per Morten Kristiansen]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Jan Kjell Larsen]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Kjetil L\u00f8vvik]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Joakim V\u00e5ge Nilsen]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[H\u00e5vard Nordtveit]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Trygve Nygaard]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Alexander S\u00f8derlund]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Jone Samuelsen]]\n* {{flag|Norway}} [[Thomas S\u00f8rum]]\n{{col end}}\n\n==Staff==\n===Coaching staff===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
