The church is a short walk from [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads station]]. The church building was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries, and it has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. The church is renowned for the beauty of its [[Gothic architecture]] and is classed as a Grade I [[listed building]] by [[Historic England]].<ref name=nhle>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1218848 |desc=Church of St Mary Redcliffe |grade=I |accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> It was famously described by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] as \"the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England.\"{{sfn|Burrough|1970|pp=13-14}}{{sfn|Little|1967}}\n\nLittle remains of the earliest churches on the site although a little of the fabric has been dated to the 12th century. Much of the current building dates from the late 13th and 14th centuries when it was built and decorated by wealthy merchants of the city whose tomb and monuments decorate the church. The spire fell after being struck by lightning in 1446 and was not rebuilt until 1872. Little of the original stained glass remains following damage in the [[English Civil War]] with extensive new glass being added during the [[Victorian era]]. The tower contains 15 bells designed for full-circle English-Style [[change ringing]]. Other music in the church is provided by several choirs and the [[Harrison & Harrison]] organ.\n\n==History==\nThe first church on this site was built in Saxon times, as the [[Port of Bristol]] first began.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Visit&nbsp;\u2014 Heritage|url=http://stmaryredcliffe.co.uk/your-visit/heritage/|publisher=St Mary Redcliffe|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], St Mary Redcliffe, sitting on a red cliff above the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]], was a sign to seafarers, who would pray in it at their departure, and give thanks there upon their return.

Although its plan dates from an earlier period, much of the church as it now stands was built between 1292 and 1370, with the south aisle and transept in the Decorated Gothic of the 13th century and the greater part of the building in the late 14th century [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]]. The patrons included Simon de Burton, Mayor of Bristol, and William I Canynges, merchant, five times Mayor of Bristol and three times MP. In the 15th century Canynges' grandson, the great merchant [[William II Canynges]], also five times Mayor and three times MP, assumed responsibility for bringing the work of the interior to completion and filling the windows with stained glass. In 1446 much of this work was damaged when the spire was struck by lightning, and fell, causing damage to the interior; however the angle of the falling masonry and the extent of the damage is unclear.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tower Vaulting&nbsp;\u2014 Archaeological Survey|url=http://stmaryredcliffe.co.uk/files/2014/08/St-Mary-Redcliffe-NW-tower-vaulting-report-revised-assembled-reduced.pdf|website=St Mary Redcliffe|publisher=Jerry Sampson Buildings Archaeology|accessdate=29 March 2015|year=2014}}</ref> Although the spire was to remain damaged for the next 400 years, Canynges continued in his commitment to restore and beautify the church.

The church is a short walk from [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads station]]. The church building was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries, and it has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. The church is renowned for the beauty of its [[Gothic architecture]] and is classed as a Grade I [[listed building]] by [[Historic England]].<ref name=nhle>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1218848 |desc=Church of St Mary Redcliffe |grade=I |accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> It was famously described by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] as \"the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England.\"{{sfn|Burrough|1970|pp=13-14}}{{sfn|Little|1967}}\n\nLittle remains of the earliest churches on the site although a little of the fabric has been dated to the 12th century. Much of the current building dates from the late 13th and 14th centuries when it was built and decorated by wealthy merchants of the city whose tomb and monuments decorate the church. The spire fell after being struck by lightning in 1446 and was not rebuilt until 1872. Little of the original stained glass remains following damage in the [[English Civil War]] with extensive new glass being added during the [[Victorian era]]. The tower contains 15 bells designed for full-circle English-Style [[change ringing]]. Other music in the church is provided by several choirs and the [[Harrison & Harrison]] organ.\n\n==History==\nThe first church on this site was built in Saxon times, as the [[Port of Bristol]] first began.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Visit&nbsp;\u2014 Heritage|url=http://stmaryredcliffe.co.uk/your-visit/heritage/|publisher=St Mary Redcliffe|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], St Mary Redcliffe, sitting on a red cliff above the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]], was a sign to seafarers, who would pray in it at their departure, and give thanks there upon their return. The church was built and beautified by Bristol's wealthy merchants, who paid to have masses sung for their souls and many of whom are commemorated there.{{sfn|Jenkins|1999}}\n\n[[File:St Mary Redcliffe Church, Bristol, BRO Picbox-7-StMR-9, 1250x1250.jpg|thumb|left|An etching of St Mary Redcliffe from the North West c. 1850.]]\nParts of the church date from the beginning of the 12th century. Although its plan dates from an earlier period, much of the church as it now stands was built between 1292 and 1370, with the south aisle and transept in the Decorated Gothic of the 13th century and the greater part of the building in the late 14th century [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]]. The patrons included Simon de Burton, Mayor of Bristol, and William I Canynges, merchant, five times Mayor of Bristol and three times MP. In the 15th century Canynges' grandson, the great merchant [[William II Canynges]], also five times Mayor and three times MP, assumed responsibility for bringing the work of the interior to completion and filling the windows with stained glass. In 1446 much of this work was damaged when the spire was struck by lightning, and fell, causing damage to the interior; however the angle of the falling masonry and the extent of the damage is unclear.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tower Vaulting&nbsp;\u2014 Archaeological Survey|url=http://stmaryredcliffe.co.uk/files/2014/08/St-Mary-Redcliffe-NW-tower-vaulting-report-revised-assembled-reduced.pdf|website=St Mary Redcliffe|publisher=Jerry Sampson Buildings Archaeology|accessdate=29 March 2015|year=2014}}</ref> Although the spire was to remain damaged for the next 400 years, Canynges continued in his commitment to restore and beautify the church.

The tree design in the window of the south transept was also by Wailes and was installed in 1854. In the north transept is a memorial window to Samuel Lucas who died in 1853, designed and installed by the St Helens Crown Glass Company which later became [[Pilkington]]. Another Wailes design depicting the ''Offering of the Wise Men'' was installed in the Lady Chapel, alongside one designed by Arthur O'Connor.
