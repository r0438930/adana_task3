Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an [[Involucral bract|involucre]] of large, typically white petal-like [[bracts]], while others have more open clusters of [[petal]]-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are [[native plant|native]] throughout much of [[temperateness|temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] Eurasia and North America, with China, Japan, and the southeastern United States being particularly rich in native species.\n\nSpecies include the common dogwood ''[[Cornus sanguinea]]'' of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood ''([[Cornus florida]])'' of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood ''[[Cornus nuttallii]]'' of western North America, the Kousa dogwood ''[[Cornus kousa]]'' of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), ''[[Cornus canadensis]]'' and ''[[Cornus suecica]]'' respectively.\n\nDepending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine [[genus|genera]] or [[subgenus|subgenera]]; a broadly inclusive genus ''Cornus'' is accepted here.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe name \"dog-tree\" entered the English vocabulary before 1548, becoming \"dogwood\" by 1614. Once the name dogwood was affixed to this kind of tree, it soon acquired a secondary name as the Hound's Tree, while the fruits came to be known as '''dogberries''' or '''houndberries''' (the latter a name also for the berries of [[Solanum nigrum|black nightshade]], alluding to [[Hecate|Hecate's]] hounds). Another theory advances the view that \"dogwood\" was derived from the [[Old English]] '''''dagwood'''''{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} (''*dagwood'' is a form which is unattested), from the use of the slender stems of its very hard [[wood]] for making sharp objects:<ref>{{cite web |title=dogwood |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/dogwood }}</ref> \"dags\" (daggers, skewers, and arrows).<ref name=vedel>Vedel, H., & Lange, J.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] uses \"whippletree\" in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (\"[[The Knight's Tale]]\", verse 2065) to refer to the dogwood. A [[whippletree (mechanism)|whippletree]] is also an element of the traction of a horse-drawn [[cart]], linking the drawpole of the cart to the harnesses of the horses in file; these items still bear the name of the tree from which they are commonly carved.[[File:2016-05-08 1452 Cherokee Princess dogwood.png|thumb|Cherokee Princess dogwood]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nDogwoods have simple, untoothed [[leaf|leaves]] with the [[leaf vein|veins]] curving distinctively as they approach the leaf margins. Most dogwood species have opposite leaves, while a few, such as ''Cornus alternifolia'' and ''C. controversa,'' have their leaves alternate. Dogwood [[flower]]s have four parts. In many species, the flowers are borne separately in open (but often dense) clusters, while in various other species (such as the [[flowering dogwood]]), the flowers themselves are tightly clustered, lacking showy [[petal]]s, but surrounded by four to six large, typically white petal-like [[bract]]s.\n\nThe [[fruit]]s of all dogwood species are [[drupe]]s with one or two seeds, often brightly colorful. The drupes of species in the subgenera ''Cornus'' are edible. Many are without much flavor. ''[[Cornus kousa]]'' and ''[[Cornus mas]]'' are sold commercially as edible fruit trees. The fruits of  ''Cornus kousa'' have a sweet, tropical pudding like flavor in addition to hard pits.  The fruits of ''Cornus mas'' are both tart and sweet when completely ripe. They have been eaten in Eastern Europe for centuries, both as food and medicine to fight colds and flus. They are very high in [[vitamin C]]. However, those of species in subgenus  ''Swida'' are mildly toxic to [[human|people]], though readily eaten by [[bird]]s.\n\nDogwoods are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some species of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], including the [[Pavonia pavonia|emperor moth]], [[the engrailed]], the [[small angle shades]], and the following case-bearers of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. ahenella'', ''C. salicivorella'' (recorded on ''Cornus canadensis''), ''C. albiantennaella'', ''C. cornella'' and ''C. cornivorella,'' with the latter three all feeding exclusively on ''Cornus.''\n\n==Uses==\nDogwoods are widely planted horticulturally, and the dense wood of the larger-stemmed species is valued for certain specialized purposes. Cutting boards and other fine turnings can be made from this fine grained and beautiful wood. Over 32 different varieties of game birds, including quail, feed on the red seeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Dogwood Trees|url=http://www.preppergarden.biz/Dogwood-Trees-for-Preppers-p/wld-dogwood.htm|publisher=Prepper Gardens|accessdate=January 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116024043/http://www.preppergarden.biz/Dogwood-Trees-for-Preppers-p/wld-dogwood.htm|archive-date=2013-11-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Horticulture===\nVarious species of ''Cornus,'' particularly the [[Cornus florida|flowering dogwood]] ''(Cornus florida),'' are ubiquitous in American [[garden]]s and [[landscape|landscaping]]; [[horticulture|horticulturist]] [[Donald Wyman]] stated, \"There is a dogwood for almost every part of the U.S. except the hottest and driest areas\".<ref>Wyman's Garden Encyclopedia, ''s.v.'' \"Cornus\"</ref> In contrast, in [[England]] the lack of sharp winters and hot summers makes ''Cornus florida'' very shy of flowering.<ref>Alice M. Coats, ''Garden Shrubs and their Histories'' (1964) 1992, ''s.v.'' \"Cornus\".</ref>\n\nOther ''Cornus'' species are [[stolon]]iferous shrubs that grow naturally in wet habitats and along waterways. Several of these are used along highways and in naturalizing landscape plantings, especially those species with bright red or bright yellow stems, particularly conspicuous in winter, such as ''[[Cornus stolonifera]]''.\n\nThe following [[cultivars]], of mixed or uncertain origin, have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]\u2019s [[Award of Garden Merit]] (confirmed 2017):<ref>{{cite web  | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 16 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 24 January 2018}}</ref> \n*\u2018Eddie\u2019s White Wonder\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/94390/i-Cornus-i-Eddie-s-White-Wonder/Details\n| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Cornus'' \u2018Eddie\u2019s White Wonder\u2019\n| accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n*\u2018Norman Hadden\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/30663/i-Cornus-i-Norman-Hadden/Details\n| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Cornus'' \u2018Norman Hadden\u2019\n| accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n*\u2018Ormonde\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/30654/i-Cornus-i-Ormonde/Details\n| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Cornus'' \u2018Ormonde\u2019\n| accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n*\u2018Porlock\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/103072/i-Cornus-i-Porlock/Details\n| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Cornus'' \u2018Porlock\u2019\n| accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fruits===\nThe species ''[[Cornus mas]]'' is commonly cultivated in southeastern Europe for its showy, edible berries, that have the color of the carnelian gemstone.

Dogwood wood is an excellent substitute for [[persimmon]] wood in the heads of certain [[golf|golf clubs]] (\"woods\"). Dogwood lumber is rare in that it is not readily available with any manufacturer and must be cut down by the person(s) wanting to use it.\n\nLarger items have also been occasionally made of dogwood, such as the screw-in basket-style wine or fruit presses. The first kinds of [[laminate]]d [[tennis racket]]s were also made from this wood, cut into thin strips.\n\nDogwood [[Teeth cleaning twig|twigs]] were used by U.S. pioneers to brush their teeth.

Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an [[Involucral bract|involucre]] of large, typically white petal-like [[bracts]], while others have more open clusters of [[petal]]-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are [[native plant|native]] throughout much of [[temperateness|temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] Eurasia and North America, with China, Japan, and the southeastern United States being particularly rich in native species.\n\nSpecies include the common dogwood ''[[Cornus sanguinea]]'' of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood ''([[Cornus florida]])'' of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood ''[[Cornus nuttallii]]'' of western North America, the Kousa dogwood ''[[Cornus kousa]]'' of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), ''[[Cornus canadensis]]'' and ''[[Cornus suecica]]'' respectively.\n\nDepending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine [[genus|genera]] or [[subgenus|subgenera]]; a broadly inclusive genus ''Cornus'' is accepted here.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe name \"dog-tree\" entered the English vocabulary before 1548, becoming \"dogwood\" by 1614. Once the name dogwood was affixed to this kind of tree, it soon acquired a secondary name as the Hound's Tree, while the fruits came to be known as '''dogberries''' or '''houndberries''' (the latter a name also for the berries of [[Solanum nigrum|black nightshade]], alluding to [[Hecate|Hecate's]] hounds). Another theory advances the view that \"dogwood\" was derived from the [[Old English]] '''''dagwood'''''{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} (''*dagwood'' is a form which is unattested), from the use of the slender stems of its very hard [[wood]] for making sharp objects:<ref>{{cite web |title=dogwood |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/dogwood }}</ref> \"dags\" (daggers, skewers, and arrows).<ref name=vedel>Vedel, H., & Lange, J.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] uses \"whippletree\" in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (\"[[The Knight's Tale]]\", verse 2065) to refer to the dogwood. A [[whippletree (mechanism)|whippletree]] is also an element of the traction of a horse-drawn [[cart]], linking the drawpole of the cart to the harnesses of the horses in file; these items still bear the name of the tree from which they are commonly carved.[[File:2016-05-08 1452 Cherokee Princess dogwood.png|thumb|Cherokee Princess dogwood]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nDogwoods have simple, untoothed [[leaf|leaves]] with the [[leaf vein|veins]] curving distinctively as they approach the leaf margins. Most dogwood species have opposite leaves, while a few, such as ''Cornus alternifolia'' and ''C. controversa,'' have their leaves alternate. Dogwood [[flower]]s have four parts. In many species, the flowers are borne separately in open (but often dense) clusters, while in various other species (such as the [[flowering dogwood]]), the flowers themselves are tightly clustered, lacking showy [[petal]]s, but surrounded by four to six large, typically white petal-like [[bract]]s.\n\nThe [[fruit]]s of all dogwood species are [[drupe]]s with one or two seeds, often brightly colorful. The drupes of species in the subgenera ''Cornus'' are edible. Many are without much flavor. ''[[Cornus kousa]]'' and ''[[Cornus mas]]'' are sold commercially as edible fruit trees. The fruits of  ''Cornus kousa'' have a sweet, tropical pudding like flavor in addition to hard pits.  The fruits of ''Cornus mas'' are both tart and sweet when completely ripe. They have been eaten in Eastern Europe for centuries, both as food and medicine to fight colds and flus. They are very high in [[vitamin C]]. However, those of species in subgenus  ''Swida'' are mildly toxic to [[human|people]], though readily eaten by [[bird]]s.\n\nDogwoods are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some species of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], including the [[Pavonia pavonia|emperor moth]], [[the engrailed]], the [[small angle shades]], and the following case-bearers of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. ahenella'', ''C. salicivorella'' (recorded on ''Cornus canadensis''), ''C. albiantennaella'', ''C. cornella'' and ''C. cornivorella,'' with the latter three all feeding exclusively on ''Cornus.''\n\n==Uses==\nDogwoods are widely planted horticulturally, and the dense wood of the larger-stemmed species is valued for certain specialized purposes. Cutting boards and other fine turnings can be made from this fine grained and beautiful wood. Over 32 different varieties of game birds, including quail, feed on the red seeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Dogwood Trees|url=http://www.preppergarden.biz/Dogwood-Trees-for-Preppers-p/wld-dogwood.htm|publisher=Prepper Gardens|accessdate=January 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116024043/http://www.preppergarden.biz/Dogwood-Trees-for-Preppers-p/wld-dogwood.htm|archive-date=2013-11-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Horticulture===\nVarious species of ''Cornus,'' particularly the [[Cornus florida|flowering dogwood]] ''(Cornus florida),'' are ubiquitous in American [[garden]]s and [[landscape|landscaping]]; [[horticulture|horticulturist]] [[Donald Wyman]] stated, \"There is a dogwood for almost every part of the U.S. except the hottest and driest areas\".<ref>Wyman's Garden Encyclopedia, ''s.v.'' \"Cornus\"</ref> In contrast, in [[England]] the lack of sharp winters and hot summers makes ''Cornus florida'' very shy of flowering.<ref>Alice M.
