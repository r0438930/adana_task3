He also wears a [[turban]] and a more traditional set of clothing, rather than his strange hat and unique dress sense in the comic.\n\n===Captain Philip Horton===\nThough Capt. Philip Horton (played by [[Robert Coleby]]) appears to be the leader of the Jungle Patrol, it is actually the Phantom that leads them. This is because the Patrol was started by an earlier Phantom to protect the jungle when he is not there.
