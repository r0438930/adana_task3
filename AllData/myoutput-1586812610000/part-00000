It was developed by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] in response to [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] issued by the [[Air Ministry]] for a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] jet-powered bomber. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the [[Handley Page Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan]], which were more advanced. The Valiant has the distinction of being the only V bomber to have dropped live nuclear weapons.<ref name = \"black wright 33\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 33.</ref>\n\nThe Valiant was intended as a high-altitude [[strategic bomber]]. During the late 1950s, in response to rapid advances in [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) technology, the Valiant fleet was switched to flying low-level for the strike role. Beyond the [[nuclear deterrence]] role, the Valiant was also used by the RAF for other purposes, as a number were converted to perform support roles such as [[aerial refuelling]] tankers and [[aerial reconnaissance]] aircraft. Valiants were used for conventional bombing missions over [[Egypt]] for [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956.\n\nBy late 1964 it was found that all variants of the Valiant showed premature fatigue and inter-crystalline corrosion in wing spar attachment forgings, traced to the use of a poorly understood aluminium alloy, DTD683.<ref>\u201cPitfalls of the substitution of sophistication for Common Sense\u201d  D Howe, Cranfield University. IMechE Vol 212 Part G, Sec 5.1 Metals, p. 307. May 1998</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rapid development of aircraft during World War II led to a demand for very high strength aluminium alloy, especially for use in highly loaded tension and compression members. One result was a zinc /magnesium based alloy given the identification DTD 683. It was ideal for such applications as wing spar caps providing, as was the case with wartime operations, the life of the aircraft was short. Use in early post-War transport aircraft showed that DTD 683 was very crack-sensitive and hence prone to fatigue failure. In many cases it had to be replaced by steel components. DTD 683 is an example of a material developed to meet a particular need, but whose wider characteristics were not investigated until too late.\nD.Howe 1998|group=N}} Rather than proceeding with an expensive rebuilding program, the Ministry of Defence retired the Valiant in 1965. Its duties were continued by the other V-bombers which remained in service until the 1980s.\n\n==Development==\n===Background and origins===\nIn November 1944, the Joint Technical Warfare  Committee, along with a separate committee chaired by Sir [[Henry Tizard]], examined the future potential  of \"weapons of war\" and the accompanying Tizard Report published on 3 July 1945 made specific policy directions for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]].<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\">Turpin 2002, p. 71.</ref> After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the policy of using heavy four-engined bombers for massed raids continued into the immediate postwar period; the [[Avro Lincoln]], an updated version of the [[Avro Lancaster]], became the RAF's standard bomber.<ref>McLelland 2013, p. 18.</ref> In 1946, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued Operational Requirements OR229 and OR230 for the development of [[jet aircraft|turbojet]]-powered heavy bombers capable of carrying [[nuclear weapon]]s at high altitude and speed, without defensive armament, to act as a deterrent to hostile powers and, if deterrence failed, to perform a nuclear strike.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\"/> In conjunction with this ambition, Britain set about developing its own [[nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|atomic weapons]].<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\nIn January 1947, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] for an advanced jet bomber intended to carry nuclear weapons and to fly near the speed of sound at altitudes of {{cvt|50000|ft|m}}.<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Three firms: [[Avro|A.V. Roe]], [[Handley-Page Aircraft Company|Handley-Page]] and [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] submitted advanced designs intended to meet the stringent requirements.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 397.</ref> While [[Short Brothers]] submitted a design, by [[Geoffrey T.

Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist described Specification B.14/46 as \"calling for little more than a traditional aircraft fitted with jet engines\"<ref name = \"bomber 72\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 72.</ref> Short submitted a conservative design to meet B.14/46, which became the [[Short Sperrin|S.A.4 Sperrin]].<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Two prototypes were completed, the first conducting its [[maiden flight]] in 1951, but the Sperrin was ultimately relegated to research and development purposes only.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\"/><ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\nVickers had emerged from the Second World War as one of the world's pre-eminent companies in the field of aeronautical manufacturing and development. Furthermore, the company operated its own secretive [[Skunk Works]]-like development organisation based at Weybridge, Surrey, which had been involved in several secret wartime development projects. It was this secretive division in which the early stages of the development of the Valiant took place, including the later assembly of the initial two prototypes.<ref name = \"bomber 72 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> Vickers initially produced a six-engine jet bomber design proposal to meet Specification B.35/46; as rapid progress in the development of more powerful jet engines had been made, this was re-worked to a four-engine proposal in 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 73.</ref> The proposed design submitted by Vickers was relatively straightforward, being less aerodynamically advanced in comparison to competing bids made by rival firms.<ref name = \"bomber 72\"/><ref name = \"black wright 17\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 17.</ref>\n\nBoth Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These would be produced as the [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] respectively; the Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of these designs failed. The submissions became known as the [[V bomber]]s, or V-class, with the aircraft all being given names that started with the letter \"V\".<ref>Downey 1985, p. 5.</ref> Vickers' submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan,<ref name = 'Rose 52'>Rosemeyer 2009, p. 52.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> but Vickers' chief designer [[George Edwards (aviation)|George Edwards]] lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a flight-capable prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gunston and Gilchrist observe that measures offered by Edwards were a \"gigantic risk\", and that gaining the bomber contract has been deemed of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/>\n\nAlthough developing and operating three overlapping large aircraft in response to a single Operational Requirement (OR) was wasteful and very costly, events such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] had led to officials placing a sense of urgency in the necessity to provide an effective deterrent to the Soviet Union from acts of aggression in Europe.<ref>Rosemeyer 2009, pp. 52\u201353.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> In April 1948, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued a specification with the designation B.9/48 written around the Vickers design, which was given the company designation of Type 660; an 'Instruction to Proceed' was received by Vickers on 16 April 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/> In February 1949, two prototypes of the aircraft were ordered. The first of these was to be fitted with four [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Avon|RA.3 Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines, while the second was to be fitted with four [[Armstrong Siddeley]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire|Sapphire]] engines as the Type 667.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p438\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 438.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:Vickers Valiant Farnborough 1951.jpg|thumb|First prototype performing a flight display at [[Farnborough Airshow]], 1951]]\nOn 18 May 1951, the first prototype, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] WB210 took to the air for its [[maiden flight]],<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p439\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 439.</ref> within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, and preceding the first [[Short Sperrin]] into the air by several months, it being only 27 months since the contract had been issued. The pilot was [[Joseph Summers|Captain Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers]], who had also been the original test pilot on the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], and wanted to add another \"first\" to his record before he retired.

The short delay until the second prototype became available for testing, which was accelerated by three months, meant that loss of the initial prototype did not seriously compromise the schedule.<ref name=\"Turpin p74\">Turpin 2002, p. 74.</ref><ref name=\"Jones p34\">Jones 2007, p. 34.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17\"/>\n\nOf the three prototypes, two were representative of the Valiant B.1,<ref name=\"Jones p26\">Jones 2007, p. 26.</ref> while one was built as a further developed version, referred to as the Valiant B.2. The B.2 variant was intended to serve as a [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder]] aircraft, flying at high speed at low level to mark targets for the main bomber force. To cope with the rougher ride compared with high altitude operations, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing received design alterations to strengthen it, a key change being the removal of the large cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage; instead the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two large wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]]s set into the rear of the wings.<ref name = \"bomber 77 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 77\u201378.</ref> The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of {{convert|112|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, in contrast to a length of {{convert|108|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.<ref name=\"Jones p32,6\">Jones 2007, pp. 32, 36.</ref>\n\nThe prototype B.2, serial number WJ954 first flew on 4 September 1953.<ref name=\"AndrewsVickers p445\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 445.</ref> Finished in a gloss black night operations paint scheme, it became known as the \"Black Bomber\". Its performance at low level was superior to that of the B.1 (or any other V-bomber), being strong enough to fly at full power at [[sea level#Aviation|sea level]],<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/> with the aircraft being cleared for {{convert|580|mph|abbr=on}} at low level (with speeds of up to {{convert|640|mph|abbr=on}} being reached in testing). This was compared to the B.1's sea-level limit of {{convert|414|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}. The Air Ministry ordered 17 production B.2s, which were to be powered by [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] [[turbofan]]s. Although the Valiant B.2's low-level capabilities later proved to be highly desirable, the B.2 program was abandoned as the RAF considered that the Pathfinder concept, born in a time of mass raids, was obsolete in the nuclear era.<ref name = \"bomber 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 78.</ref> The B.2 prototype was used for tests for a few years, including testing use of rockets to boost takeoff, contributing to improvements for the Valiant B.1, before being scrapped in 1958.<ref name=\"Jones p36-7\">Jones 2007, pp. 36\u201337.</ref><ref name=\"Osprey p83-4\">Brookes 2012, pp. 83\u201384.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 20\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Vickers Valian B.1 WZ393 90 Sqn SGT 10.06.57.jpg|thumb|Valiant B(PR)K.1 WZ393 of 90 Squadron in original all-metal finish displaying at Blackpool Squires Gate airport in 1957]]\nIn April 1951, an initial production order for 25 Valiant B.1 (Bomber Mark 1) aircraft was placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the RAF.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p400\">Burnet and Morgan ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 400.</ref> The timing of this order was key to establishing production quickly.

The Victor and Vulcan would soon follow the Valiant into service, for a total of three types of nuclear-armed strategic bombers in RAF service. In September 1957, the final Valiant was delivered.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, all production aircraft had been delivered on time and below budget.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>\n\nA total of 108 Valiants were manufactured, including the sole B.2 prototype. In addition to its principal role as the RAF's delivery platform for Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]], the Valiant bomber also dropped high explosive bombs. The bombers were followed into service by a strategic reconnaissance version and a multi-purpose version capable conventional bombing, [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]]. One squadron operated 6 Valiants with [[electronic countermeasure]]s equipment.<ref name = \"black wright 19 20\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>  Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through the addition of a Hose Drum Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs.  This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay).  Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel]] nuclear-armed [[standoff missile]], which was later added to the arsenal of munitions the other V-bombers were equipped with.<ref name = \"black wright 24 26\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 24\u201326.</ref><ref name = \"flint 133\">Flintham 2008, p. 133.</ref>\n\nUnlike its Vulcan and Victor peers, the Valiant did not see the production of a refined and more capable B.2 model.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/> Instead, the Valiant B.1 fleet was later switched to a low-level flight profile, after which [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] due to the resulting increased turbulence was discovered and ultimately led to the type's premature retirement. Vic Flintham observed that: \"There is a fine irony to the situation, for Vickers had produced the Type 673 B Mk 2 version designed as a fast, low-level pathfinder... The Air Ministry was not interested...\"<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> The Valiant was Vickers' last purpose-built military aircraft. It was followed by the [[Vickers Vanguard|Vanguard]], a passenger turboprop designed in 1959, and the [[Vickers VC10]], a jet passenger aircraft in 1962, also used as a military transport and tanker by the RAF.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Vickers Valiant (27363801724).jpg|thumb|Forward view of preserved Vickers Valiant XD818 at [[RAF Museum Cosford]] ]]\nThe Valiant was a conservative design of the era, having a shoulder-mounted wing and four [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3]] [[turbojet]] engines, each providing up to {{convert|6500|lbf|kN}} of thrust, installed in pairs in [[fireproof]] bays in each wing root.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The design of the Valiant gave an overall impression of a plain and clean aircraft with simple aerodynamics. George Edwards described the Valiant appropriately and simply as an \"unfunny\" aircraft.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p449\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 449.</ref> The root chord thickness ratio was 12% and allowed the Avon engines to be within the wing rather than on pods as in the contemporary [[B-47 Stratojet|Boeing B-47]].<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\">Andrews and Morgan, p. 442.</ref> This \"buried engine\" installation contributed to the aircraft's aerodynamic cleanness, and was British practice at the time. It made engine access for maintenance and repair difficult and increased the risk that an uncontained failure of one engine would cause damage to the adjacent engine; it also increased the complexity of the design of the main spar which had to be routed around the engines.<ref name = \"bomber 73 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nThe wing of the Valiant used a \"compound sweep\" configuration, devised by Vickers [[aerodynamics|aerodynamicist]] Elfyn Richards.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\">Barfield ''Air International'' September 1992, p. 158.</ref> Richards found that it would be advantageous to increase the sweep on the inboard section of the wing, a discovery which he later [[patent]]ed; the Valiant's wing made use of a 37\u00b0 angle of sweepback for the inner third of the wing, which reduced to an angle of about 21\u00b0 at the tips.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p398\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 398.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 74.</ref> This was because the thickness/chord ratio could be reduced closer to the tips, balancing this against the sweep reduction in postponement of supersonic airflow effects such as buffeting and increased drag.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\"/> The choice to have mild sweepback around the aerodynamic control surfaces meant that in-service speeds were limited to Mach 0.84 and a typical cruise of Mach 0.75 at heights up to {{convert|55000|ft}} when lightly loaded.<ref name=\"Profile p16\">Andrews 1966, p. 16.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17 18\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> A [[drogue parachute]] was deemed unnecessary even operating from runways as short as {{Convert|6000|ft}}.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>\n\nThe wing was mounted high on the aircraft's fuselage and this created a limited fuel capacity when combined with the other necessary compromises in design such as the placement of the engines and main [[landing gear]] within the wing's internal space.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The [[leading edge]] of the wing was fixed while the [[trailing edge]] incorporated large outboard two-section [[aileron]]s, the inner section featuring [[trim tab]]s, alongside double-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s again split into inboard and outboard sections.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Direct [[electric motor|electrical drive]]s were used to move the flaps and other, usually hydraulically-operated, equipment on the aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 76\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 76.</ref>\n\n[[File:Valiant 2 (3446560911).jpg|thumb|left|The wing root and air intakes]]\nProduction aircraft were powered by four Avon 201 turbojet engines, with {{convert|9500|lbf|kN}} thrust.

They were repainted in grey/green camouflage with normal markings, replacing their [[anti-flash white]] scheme.<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> By 1963, four Valiant squadrons (49, 148, 207 and 214) had been assigned to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SACEUR]] in the low-level tactical bombing role.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/> By this point, there had been a noticeable decline in flying rates for the type.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>\n\n===Conventional warfare===\n[[File:vickers valiant camouflaged on ground arp.jpg|thumb|Camouflaged Valiant at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton]], [[England]]. Circa mid-1960s]]\nPeacetime practice involved the dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, and a system of predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of the bomb drop over non-range targets, the bomb error being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant's Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, who were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, meant a high level of bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of {{convert|45,000|ft}} within a few meters of their assigned target.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>\n\nThe Valiant was the first of the V-bombers to see combat, during the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez intervention in October and November 1956. During [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]], the British military operation in what became known as the [[Suez Crisis]], Valiants operating from the airfield at Luqa on Malta repeatedly dropped conventional bombs on targets inside Egypt. Egyptian military airfields were the principal target of these bombing raids; other targets included communications such as [[radio station]]s and transport hubs.<ref>Bowman 2016, p. 158</ref> On the first night of the operation, six Valiants were dispatched to bomb [[Cairo West Air Base]] (which was aborted in flight due to potential risk to US personnel in the vicinity) while six more attacked [[Almaza Air Base]] and a further five bombed [[Kibrit Air Base]] and Huckstep Barracks.<ref name = \"black wright 42\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 42.</ref><ref name = \"darling 42\">Darling 2012, p. 42.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Egyptians did not oppose the attacks and there were no Valiant combat losses incurred, the results of the raids were reportedly disappointing. Although the Valiants dropped a total of {{convert|842|LT}} of bombs, only three of the seven airfields attacked were seriously damaged.{{#tag:ref|The Valiants had not yet been fitted with their operational Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and were dropping using Second World War techniques.|group=N}} The Egyptian Air Force had been effectively destroyed in a wider series of multinational attacks of which the Valiant bombing missions had been a part.<ref>Bowman 2016, pp. 158, 161.</ref> It was the last time the V-bombers flew a live combat mission until Avro Vulcans bombed Port Stanley airfield in the Falkland Islands during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.<ref>McClelland, pp.175\u2013178.</ref>\n\n===Tanker operations===\nValiant tankers were flown by No. 214 Squadron at [[RAF Marham]], operational in 1958, and No. 90 Squadron at Honington, operational in 1959.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> The two lost their bomber role and became full-time tanker squadrons on 1 April 1962.<ref>Brookes 1982, p. 142</ref> Aircraft assigned to the tanker role were fitted with a Hose Drum Unit (HDU or \"HooDoo\") in the bomb bay. The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened in order to give fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU.  All of the HDU equipment was designed to be easily removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role.<ref>Tanner 2006, pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nWith in-flight refuelling probes fitted to Valiants, Vulcans and Victors and Valiant tankers available to give fuel and extend the range of the aircraft being refuelled, the RAF Medium Bomber Force could go beyond \"medium range\", and the RAF had a long range capability. Long-range demonstration flights were made using Valiant tankers pre-deployed along the route.

Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, and after six flights the aileron and elevator artificial feel was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and these data were used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a safe life of 75 hours was recommended, which became \"the real figure might be less than 200 hours\".<ref>Morgan p. 66-68</ref> The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was an operational issue for the RAF.<ref>Valiant Units of the Cold War, Brookes p. 88.</ref>\n\n[[File:15 Vickers Valiant WZ397 (15216077444).jpg|thumb|left|Vickers Valiant on display]]\nLater the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] ran a similar series of tests that more closely resembled actual operational conditions including low level and taxiing; the corresponding report published in 1958 produced data that could be used to get a better grasp on which flight conditions produced the most damage, and enable a better projection of the future life span for the type.<ref>[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0521.pdf \"Fatigue Loadings in Flight-Loads in the Nose Undercarriage and Wing of a Valiant.\"] E.W.

The aircraft landed back at Gaydon but without flap deployment because damage to the starboard rear spar caused the flap rollers to come out of their guides so that the flap would not lower on that side. Later inspection of the aircraft also showed the fuselage skin below the starboard inner plane had buckled, popping the rivets; the engine door had cracked and the rivets had been pulled and the skin buckled on the top surface of the mainplane between the two engines.<ref name = \"darling 39 40\">Darling 2012, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Both of these aircraft were PR variants.<ref>Morgan, App 2, Individual Valiant Histories pp. 89\u201394.</ref>\n\nInspections of the entire fleet showed that the wing spars were suffering from fatigue at between 35% and 75% of the assessed safe fatigue life, probably due to low level turbulence.<ref name = \"darling 40\">Darling 2012, p. 40.</ref> After this inspection, the aircraft were divided into three categories, Cat A aircraft continuing to fly, Cat B to fly to a repair base, and Cat C requiring repair before flying again.

Repairs were actively taking place at Valiant bases such as Marham using working parties from Vickers plus RAF technicians from the base.  In January 1965, the Wilson government with [[Denis Healey]] as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] decided that the expense of the repairs could not be justified, given the short operational life left to the Valiant, and the fleet was permanently grounded as of 26 January 1965.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wGNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nKMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5895,4007485&dq=vickers+valiant&hl=en \"Valiants to be Scrapped.\"] ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 January 1965.</ref> The QRA alert that had been in place for [[SACEUR]] was maintained until the final grounding and was then allowed to lapse.<ref>Wynn 1996, pp. 464\u2013471, 500.</ref> When asked to make a statement regarding the Valiant's scrapping in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Denis Healey stated that it \"was not in any way connected with low-level flying\" and that the \"last Government took the decision to continue operating the Valiant force for another four years after its planned fatigue life was complete\".<ref>{{cite |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/feb/01/royal-air-force-valiant-aircraft#column_725|title=ROYAL AIR FORCE (VALIANT AIRCRAFT) |work=House of Commons Debates |date=1 February 1965 |volume=vol 705||at=cc723-7}}</ref>\n\nAviation author Barry Jones commented in his book that: \"A question has to be asked.

It was developed by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] in response to [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] issued by the [[Air Ministry]] for a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] jet-powered bomber. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the [[Handley Page Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan]], which were more advanced. The Valiant has the distinction of being the only V bomber to have dropped live nuclear weapons.<ref name = \"black wright 33\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 33.</ref>\n\nThe Valiant was intended as a high-altitude [[strategic bomber]]. During the late 1950s, in response to rapid advances in [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) technology, the Valiant fleet was switched to flying low-level for the strike role. Beyond the [[nuclear deterrence]] role, the Valiant was also used by the RAF for other purposes, as a number were converted to perform support roles such as [[aerial refuelling]] tankers and [[aerial reconnaissance]] aircraft. Valiants were used for conventional bombing missions over [[Egypt]] for [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956.\n\nBy late 1964 it was found that all variants of the Valiant showed premature fatigue and inter-crystalline corrosion in wing spar attachment forgings, traced to the use of a poorly understood aluminium alloy, DTD683.<ref>\u201cPitfalls of the substitution of sophistication for Common Sense\u201d  D Howe, Cranfield University. IMechE Vol 212 Part G, Sec 5.1 Metals, p. 307. May 1998</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rapid development of aircraft during World War II led to a demand for very high strength aluminium alloy, especially for use in highly loaded tension and compression members. One result was a zinc /magnesium based alloy given the identification DTD 683. It was ideal for such applications as wing spar caps providing, as was the case with wartime operations, the life of the aircraft was short. Use in early post-War transport aircraft showed that DTD 683 was very crack-sensitive and hence prone to fatigue failure. In many cases it had to be replaced by steel components. DTD 683 is an example of a material developed to meet a particular need, but whose wider characteristics were not investigated until too late.\nD.Howe 1998|group=N}} Rather than proceeding with an expensive rebuilding program, the Ministry of Defence retired the Valiant in 1965. Its duties were continued by the other V-bombers which remained in service until the 1980s.\n\n==Development==\n===Background and origins===\nIn November 1944, the Joint Technical Warfare  Committee, along with a separate committee chaired by Sir [[Henry Tizard]], examined the future potential  of \"weapons of war\" and the accompanying Tizard Report published on 3 July 1945 made specific policy directions for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]].<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\">Turpin 2002, p. 71.</ref> After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the policy of using heavy four-engined bombers for massed raids continued into the immediate postwar period; the [[Avro Lincoln]], an updated version of the [[Avro Lancaster]], became the RAF's standard bomber.<ref>McLelland 2013, p. 18.</ref> In 1946, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued Operational Requirements OR229 and OR230 for the development of [[jet aircraft|turbojet]]-powered heavy bombers capable of carrying [[nuclear weapon]]s at high altitude and speed, without defensive armament, to act as a deterrent to hostile powers and, if deterrence failed, to perform a nuclear strike.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\"/> In conjunction with this ambition, Britain set about developing its own [[nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|atomic weapons]].<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\nIn January 1947, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] for an advanced jet bomber intended to carry nuclear weapons and to fly near the speed of sound at altitudes of {{cvt|50000|ft|m}}.<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Three firms: [[Avro|A.V.

Furthermore, the company operated its own secretive [[Skunk Works]]-like development organisation based at Weybridge, Surrey, which had been involved in several secret wartime development projects. It was this secretive division in which the early stages of the development of the Valiant took place, including the later assembly of the initial two prototypes.<ref name = \"bomber 72 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> Vickers initially produced a six-engine jet bomber design proposal to meet Specification B.35/46; as rapid progress in the development of more powerful jet engines had been made, this was re-worked to a four-engine proposal in 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 73.</ref> The proposed design submitted by Vickers was relatively straightforward, being less aerodynamically advanced in comparison to competing bids made by rival firms.<ref name = \"bomber 72\"/><ref name = \"black wright 17\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 17.</ref>\n\nBoth Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These would be produced as the [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] respectively; the Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of these designs failed. The submissions became known as the [[V bomber]]s, or V-class, with the aircraft all being given names that started with the letter \"V\".<ref>Downey 1985, p. 5.</ref> Vickers' submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan,<ref name = 'Rose 52'>Rosemeyer 2009, p. 52.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> but Vickers' chief designer [[George Edwards (aviation)|George Edwards]] lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a flight-capable prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gunston and Gilchrist observe that measures offered by Edwards were a \"gigantic risk\", and that gaining the bomber contract has been deemed of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/>\n\nAlthough developing and operating three overlapping large aircraft in response to a single Operational Requirement (OR) was wasteful and very costly, events such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] had led to officials placing a sense of urgency in the necessity to provide an effective deterrent to the Soviet Union from acts of aggression in Europe.<ref>Rosemeyer 2009, pp. 52\u201353.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> In April 1948, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued a specification with the designation B.9/48 written around the Vickers design, which was given the company designation of Type 660; an 'Instruction to Proceed' was received by Vickers on 16 April 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/> In February 1949, two prototypes of the aircraft were ordered. The first of these was to be fitted with four [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Avon|RA.3 Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines, while the second was to be fitted with four [[Armstrong Siddeley]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire|Sapphire]] engines as the Type 667.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p438\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 438.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:Vickers Valiant Farnborough 1951.jpg|thumb|First prototype performing a flight display at [[Farnborough Airshow]], 1951]]\nOn 18 May 1951, the first prototype, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] WB210 took to the air for its [[maiden flight]],<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p439\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 439.</ref> within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, and preceding the first [[Short Sperrin]] into the air by several months, it being only 27 months since the contract had been issued.

The short delay until the second prototype became available for testing, which was accelerated by three months, meant that loss of the initial prototype did not seriously compromise the schedule.<ref name=\"Turpin p74\">Turpin 2002, p. 74.</ref><ref name=\"Jones p34\">Jones 2007, p. 34.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17\"/>\n\nOf the three prototypes, two were representative of the Valiant B.1,<ref name=\"Jones p26\">Jones 2007, p. 26.</ref> while one was built as a further developed version, referred to as the Valiant B.2. The B.2 variant was intended to serve as a [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder]] aircraft, flying at high speed at low level to mark targets for the main bomber force. To cope with the rougher ride compared with high altitude operations, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing received design alterations to strengthen it, a key change being the removal of the large cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage; instead the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two large wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]]s set into the rear of the wings.<ref name = \"bomber 77 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 77\u201378.</ref> The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of {{convert|112|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, in contrast to a length of {{convert|108|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.<ref name=\"Jones p32,6\">Jones 2007, pp. 32, 36.</ref>\n\nThe prototype B.2, serial number WJ954 first flew on 4 September 1953.<ref name=\"AndrewsVickers p445\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 445.</ref> Finished in a gloss black night operations paint scheme, it became known as the \"Black Bomber\". Its performance at low level was superior to that of the B.1 (or any other V-bomber), being strong enough to fly at full power at [[sea level#Aviation|sea level]],<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/> with the aircraft being cleared for {{convert|580|mph|abbr=on}} at low level (with speeds of up to {{convert|640|mph|abbr=on}} being reached in testing). This was compared to the B.1's sea-level limit of {{convert|414|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}. The Air Ministry ordered 17 production B.2s, which were to be powered by [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] [[turbofan]]s. Although the Valiant B.2's low-level capabilities later proved to be highly desirable, the B.2 program was abandoned as the RAF considered that the Pathfinder concept, born in a time of mass raids, was obsolete in the nuclear era.<ref name = \"bomber 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 78.</ref> The B.2 prototype was used for tests for a few years, including testing use of rockets to boost takeoff, contributing to improvements for the Valiant B.1, before being scrapped in 1958.<ref name=\"Jones p36-7\">Jones 2007, pp. 36\u201337.</ref><ref name=\"Osprey p83-4\">Brookes 2012, pp. 83\u201384.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 20\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Vickers Valian B.1 WZ393 90 Sqn SGT 10.06.57.jpg|thumb|Valiant B(PR)K.1 WZ393 of 90 Squadron in original all-metal finish displaying at Blackpool Squires Gate airport in 1957]]\nIn April 1951, an initial production order for 25 Valiant B.1 (Bomber Mark 1) aircraft was placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the RAF.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p400\">Burnet and Morgan ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 400.</ref> The timing of this order was key to establishing production quickly.

The Victor and Vulcan would soon follow the Valiant into service, for a total of three types of nuclear-armed strategic bombers in RAF service. In September 1957, the final Valiant was delivered.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, all production aircraft had been delivered on time and below budget.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>\n\nA total of 108 Valiants were manufactured, including the sole B.2 prototype. In addition to its principal role as the RAF's delivery platform for Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]], the Valiant bomber also dropped high explosive bombs. The bombers were followed into service by a strategic reconnaissance version and a multi-purpose version capable conventional bombing, [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]]. One squadron operated 6 Valiants with [[electronic countermeasure]]s equipment.<ref name = \"black wright 19 20\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>  Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through the addition of a Hose Drum Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs.  This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay).  Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel]] nuclear-armed [[standoff missile]], which was later added to the arsenal of munitions the other V-bombers were equipped with.<ref name = \"black wright 24 26\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 24\u201326.</ref><ref name = \"flint 133\">Flintham 2008, p. 133.</ref>\n\nUnlike its Vulcan and Victor peers, the Valiant did not see the production of a refined and more capable B.2 model.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/> Instead, the Valiant B.1 fleet was later switched to a low-level flight profile, after which [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] due to the resulting increased turbulence was discovered and ultimately led to the type's premature retirement. Vic Flintham observed that: \"There is a fine irony to the situation, for Vickers had produced the Type 673 B Mk 2 version designed as a fast, low-level pathfinder... The Air Ministry was not interested...\"<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> The Valiant was Vickers' last purpose-built military aircraft. It was followed by the [[Vickers Vanguard|Vanguard]], a passenger turboprop designed in 1959, and the [[Vickers VC10]], a jet passenger aircraft in 1962, also used as a military transport and tanker by the RAF.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Vickers Valiant (27363801724).jpg|thumb|Forward view of preserved Vickers Valiant XD818 at [[RAF Museum Cosford]] ]]\nThe Valiant was a conservative design of the era, having a shoulder-mounted wing and four [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3]] [[turbojet]] engines, each providing up to {{convert|6500|lbf|kN}} of thrust, installed in pairs in [[fireproof]] bays in each wing root.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The design of the Valiant gave an overall impression of a plain and clean aircraft with simple aerodynamics. George Edwards described the Valiant appropriately and simply as an \"unfunny\" aircraft.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p449\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 449.</ref> The root chord thickness ratio was 12% and allowed the Avon engines to be within the wing rather than on pods as in the contemporary [[B-47 Stratojet|Boeing B-47]].<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\">Andrews and Morgan, p. 442.</ref> This \"buried engine\" installation contributed to the aircraft's aerodynamic cleanness, and was British practice at the time. It made engine access for maintenance and repair difficult and increased the risk that an uncontained failure of one engine would cause damage to the adjacent engine; it also increased the complexity of the design of the main spar which had to be routed around the engines.<ref name = \"bomber 73 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nThe wing of the Valiant used a \"compound sweep\" configuration, devised by Vickers [[aerodynamics|aerodynamicist]] Elfyn Richards.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\">Barfield ''Air International'' September 1992, p. 158.</ref> Richards found that it would be advantageous to increase the sweep on the inboard section of the wing, a discovery which he later [[patent]]ed; the Valiant's wing made use of a 37\u00b0 angle of sweepback for the inner third of the wing, which reduced to an angle of about 21\u00b0 at the tips.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p398\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 398.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 74.</ref> This was because the thickness/chord ratio could be reduced closer to the tips, balancing this against the sweep reduction in postponement of supersonic airflow effects such as buffeting and increased drag.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\"/> The choice to have mild sweepback around the aerodynamic control surfaces meant that in-service speeds were limited to Mach 0.84 and a typical cruise of Mach 0.75 at heights up to {{convert|55000|ft}} when lightly loaded.<ref name=\"Profile p16\">Andrews 1966, p. 16.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17 18\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> A [[drogue parachute]] was deemed unnecessary even operating from runways as short as {{Convert|6000|ft}}.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>\n\nThe wing was mounted high on the aircraft's fuselage and this created a limited fuel capacity when combined with the other necessary compromises in design such as the placement of the engines and main [[landing gear]] within the wing's internal space.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The [[leading edge]] of the wing was fixed while the [[trailing edge]] incorporated large outboard two-section [[aileron]]s, the inner section featuring [[trim tab]]s, alongside double-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s again split into inboard and outboard sections.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Direct [[electric motor|electrical drive]]s were used to move the flaps and other, usually hydraulically-operated, equipment on the aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 76\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 76.</ref>\n\n[[File:Valiant 2 (3446560911).jpg|thumb|left|The wing root and air intakes]]\nProduction aircraft were powered by four Avon 201 turbojet engines, with {{convert|9500|lbf|kN}} thrust.

The aircraft's electrical [[Electric generator|generator]]s were also driven by the engines.<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/> [[Napier & Son|Napier Spraymat]] [[electric heating|electric heaters]] were installed in the engine inlets to prevent engine damage due to ice forming on the duct surfaces and then shedding into the compressors.

Vickers test-pilot Brian Trubshaw believed that George Edwards was put under some pressure to build the Boeing B-47 under license. The only result from the visit was Le May's insistence that the Valiant pilot side-by-side seating be incorporated in the B-52 instead of the tandem arrangement in the B-47 and prototype B-52.<ref>Brian Trubshaw Test Pilot, Brian Trubshaw and Sally Edmondson, Sutton Publishing Limited 1999, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p.35</ref>\n\nOn 11 October 1956, a Valiant B.1 (WZ366) of No 49 Squadron was the first RAF aircraft to drop a British operational atomic bomb when it performed a test drop of a down-rated [[Blue Danube bomb|Blue Danube]] weapon on [[Maralinga]], [[South Australia]].<ref name=\"Mason Bomber p378\">Mason 1994, p. 378.</ref> Windscreen blinds were fitted in advance of the test to protect the crew from the intense flash of light from the nuclear detonation.

They were repainted in grey/green camouflage with normal markings, replacing their [[anti-flash white]] scheme.<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> By 1963, four Valiant squadrons (49, 148, 207 and 214) had been assigned to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SACEUR]] in the low-level tactical bombing role.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/> By this point, there had been a noticeable decline in flying rates for the type.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>\n\n===Conventional warfare===\n[[File:vickers valiant camouflaged on ground arp.jpg|thumb|Camouflaged Valiant at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton]], [[England]]. Circa mid-1960s]]\nPeacetime practice involved the dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, and a system of predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of the bomb drop over non-range targets, the bomb error being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant's Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, who were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, meant a high level of bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of {{convert|45,000|ft}} within a few meters of their assigned target.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>\n\nThe Valiant was the first of the V-bombers to see combat, during the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez intervention in October and November 1956. During [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]], the British military operation in what became known as the [[Suez Crisis]], Valiants operating from the airfield at Luqa on Malta repeatedly dropped conventional bombs on targets inside Egypt. Egyptian military airfields were the principal target of these bombing raids; other targets included communications such as [[radio station]]s and transport hubs.<ref>Bowman 2016, p. 158</ref> On the first night of the operation, six Valiants were dispatched to bomb [[Cairo West Air Base]] (which was aborted in flight due to potential risk to US personnel in the vicinity) while six more attacked [[Almaza Air Base]] and a further five bombed [[Kibrit Air Base]] and Huckstep Barracks.<ref name = \"black wright 42\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 42.</ref><ref name = \"darling 42\">Darling 2012, p. 42.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Egyptians did not oppose the attacks and there were no Valiant combat losses incurred, the results of the raids were reportedly disappointing. Although the Valiants dropped a total of {{convert|842|LT}} of bombs, only three of the seven airfields attacked were seriously damaged.{{#tag:ref|The Valiants had not yet been fitted with their operational Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and were dropping using Second World War techniques.|group=N}} The Egyptian Air Force had been effectively destroyed in a wider series of multinational attacks of which the Valiant bombing missions had been a part.<ref>Bowman 2016, pp. 158, 161.</ref> It was the last time the V-bombers flew a live combat mission until Avro Vulcans bombed Port Stanley airfield in the Falkland Islands during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.<ref>McClelland, pp.175\u2013178.</ref>\n\n===Tanker operations===\nValiant tankers were flown by No. 214 Squadron at [[RAF Marham]], operational in 1958, and No. 90 Squadron at Honington, operational in 1959.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> The two lost their bomber role and became full-time tanker squadrons on 1 April 1962.<ref>Brookes 1982, p. 142</ref> Aircraft assigned to the tanker role were fitted with a Hose Drum Unit (HDU or \"HooDoo\") in the bomb bay. The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened in order to give fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU.  All of the HDU equipment was designed to be easily removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role.<ref>Tanner 2006, pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nWith in-flight refuelling probes fitted to Valiants, Vulcans and Victors and Valiant tankers available to give fuel and extend the range of the aircraft being refuelled, the RAF Medium Bomber Force could go beyond \"medium range\", and the RAF had a long range capability. Long-range demonstration flights were made using Valiant tankers pre-deployed along the route. In 1960, a Valiant bomber flew non-stop from Marham in the UK to Singapore and in 1961 a Vulcan flew non-stop from the UK to Australia.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\">Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 26.</ref> The two tanker squadrons regularly practised long range missions, refuelled by other Valiant tankers on the way. These included non-stop flights from the UK to [[Nairobi]], [[Singapore]] and [[Sydney]].<ref>Brookes 1982, pp. 141\u2013142</ref> In 1963 a squadron of [[Gloster Javelin]] fighters was refuelled by tankers and flew in stages from the UK to India (Exercise \"Shiksha\") to support the Indian Air Force in a dispute over their border with China.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pprune.org/aviation-history-nostalgia/525734-javelins-kalaikunda.html |title=Javelins at Kalaikunda |website=pprune.org |access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref> Other aircraft refuelled by Valiants at this time included Victor and Vulcan bombers, [[English Electric Lightning]] fighters, and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] and [[Supermarine Scimitar]] fighters of the Royal Navy.<ref>Wynn 1994, p. 168.</ref>\n\n===Countermeasures and reconnaissance roles===\nValiants of [[No. 18 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Finningley]] were modified to the \"radio countermeasures\" (RCM) role\u2014now called \"[[Electronic warfare support measures|electronic countermeasures]]\" (ECM). These aircraft were ultimately fitted with American APT-16A and ALT-7 jamming transmitters, Airborne Cigar and Carpet [[Radar jamming and deception|jammers]], APR-4 and APR-9 \"sniffing\" receivers, and [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] dispensers. At least seven Valiants were configured to the RCM role.<ref>Brookes 2012, pp. 45\u201346.</ref><ref>[http://radionerds.com/images/a/af/JAM-EQP_HTM.txt]</ref>\n\nValiants of No. 543 Squadron at [[RAF Wyton]] were modified to serve in the photographic reconnaissance role.

Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, and after six flights the aileron and elevator artificial feel was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and these data were used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a safe life of 75 hours was recommended, which became \"the real figure might be less than 200 hours\".<ref>Morgan p. 66-68</ref> The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was an operational issue for the RAF.<ref>Valiant Units of the Cold War, Brookes p. 88.</ref>\n\n[[File:15 Vickers Valiant WZ397 (15216077444).jpg|thumb|left|Vickers Valiant on display]]\nLater the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] ran a similar series of tests that more closely resembled actual operational conditions including low level and taxiing; the corresponding report published in 1958 produced data that could be used to get a better grasp on which flight conditions produced the most damage, and enable a better projection of the future life span for the type.<ref>[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0521.pdf \"Fatigue Loadings in Flight-Loads in the Nose Undercarriage and Wing of a Valiant.\"] E.W.

The aircraft landed back at Gaydon but without flap deployment because damage to the starboard rear spar caused the flap rollers to come out of their guides so that the flap would not lower on that side. Later inspection of the aircraft also showed the fuselage skin below the starboard inner plane had buckled, popping the rivets; the engine door had cracked and the rivets had been pulled and the skin buckled on the top surface of the mainplane between the two engines.<ref name = \"darling 39 40\">Darling 2012, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Both of these aircraft were PR variants.<ref>Morgan, App 2, Individual Valiant Histories pp. 89\u201394.</ref>\n\nInspections of the entire fleet showed that the wing spars were suffering from fatigue at between 35% and 75% of the assessed safe fatigue life, probably due to low level turbulence.<ref name = \"darling 40\">Darling 2012, p. 40.</ref> After this inspection, the aircraft were divided into three categories, Cat A aircraft continuing to fly, Cat B to fly to a repair base, and Cat C requiring repair before flying again. The tanker squadrons had the highest proportion of Cat A aircraft because their role had been mainly at high level.<ref name = \"darling 40\"/> This also caused the methods of assessing fatigue lives to be reviewed.<ref>Wynn 1996, p. 465.</ref> By the time the type was scrapped, only about 50 aircraft were still in service; the rest had been slowly accumulating at various RAF Maintenance Units designated as \"Non effective Aircraft\".<ref>Morgan App2, pp. 89\u201394.</ref>\n\nInitially there was no question of retiring the type, or even a majority of affected aircraft. Repairs were actively taking place at Valiant bases such as Marham using working parties from Vickers plus RAF technicians from the base.  In January 1965, the Wilson government with [[Denis Healey]] as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] decided that the expense of the repairs could not be justified, given the short operational life left to the Valiant, and the fleet was permanently grounded as of 26 January 1965.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wGNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nKMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5895,4007485&dq=vickers+valiant&hl=en \"Valiants to be Scrapped.\"] ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 January 1965.</ref> The QRA alert that had been in place for [[SACEUR]] was maintained until the final grounding and was then allowed to lapse.<ref>Wynn 1996, pp. 464\u2013471, 500.</ref> When asked to make a statement regarding the Valiant's scrapping in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Denis Healey stated that it \"was not in any way connected with low-level flying\" and that the \"last Government took the decision to continue operating the Valiant force for another four years after its planned fatigue life was complete\".<ref>{{cite |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/feb/01/royal-air-force-valiant-aircraft#column_725|title=ROYAL AIR FORCE (VALIANT AIRCRAFT) |work=House of Commons Debates |date=1 February 1965 |volume=vol 705||at=cc723-7}}</ref>\n\nAviation author Barry Jones commented in his book that: \"A question has to be asked.
