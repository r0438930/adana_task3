Victor has left everything to Irene. Tina sees Cord at Llanfair, but he is still angry at her for endangering other members of the family with her schemes during her 2008 visit. Tina's dog goes missing, and the search for him brings Tina and Cord closer. They reminisce about their past together and nearly kiss, but are interrupted by Clint. Tina and Viki talk about their troubled relationship, mostly influenced by Tina's many past mistakes, but the sisters decide to put the past aside. Tina's dog returns. Tina and Cord nearly get intimate with each other again after they babysit Jessica and [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]]'s son [[Ryder Ford|Ryder]], but Natalie interrupts them. Natalie confronts Tina for being partly responsible for having her locked in the basement by Tess. Tina apologizes to Natalie, and offers to plan Natalie's upcoming wedding with [[Brody Lovett]]. Natalie accepts. Viki tells Tina that she is pushing too hard to rekindle things with Cord. Tina and Cord hash out their problems in the stables, but end up having sex. Cord tells Tina that despite this, he does not know if he can trust her again. Tina vows to regain his trust. Her commitment to changing is tested when she inherits all of Victor Jr.'s fortune, Irene's money, and ''The Sun'' newspaper. Tina is elated to be rich at last, but recalls her intentions to not be fueled by greed and hands over both fortunes and ''The Sun'' to Todd, the rightful owner. Todd, Viki, and Victor Jr.'s widow [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] are pleasantly surprised. Cord learns of Tina's benevolence, the two declare their love and share a passionate kiss. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts Natalie and Brody's wedding with the missing paternity test results proving that Natalie's ex-boyfriend [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]], not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. The wedding is called off. Cord proposes to Tina, who accepts. They marry then and there for the fourth time.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/cast/653/Tina_Lord Tina Lord profile - Soaps.com]\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/whoswho/tina.php Tina Clayton Lord profile - SoapCentral.com]\n* [http://llanviewlabyrinth.webs.com/notoriouslyremembered/1968_1989/remembered_tinalord.html Notoriously Remembered: Tina Lord]\n* [http://soapnet.go.com/soapnet/gallery/path-galleryNum_1667/category_shows/subcategory_daytimeemmysredcarpet2008 \"''OLTL'''s Tina Lord: Through the Years.\" (Photo gallery) - SOAPnet.com]\n\n{{One Life to Live}}\n{{Tina Lord actresses}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord, Tina}}\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:One Life to Live characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Tina Lord\n| series         = One Life to Live\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Andrea Evans]] (1978\u20131981, 1985\u20131990, 2008\u20132011)\n* [[Kelli Maroney]] (1984)\n* [[Marsha Clark]] (1984\u20131985)\n* [[Karen Witter]] (1990\u20131994)\n* [[Krista Tesreau]] (1994\u20131997)\n}}\n| first          = {{start date|1978|07|2}}\n| last           = {{end date|2011|11|15}}\n| years          = {{Flatlist|\n* 1978\u20131981\n* 1984\u20131997\n* 2008\n* 2011\n}}\n| creator        = [[Gordon Russell (writer)|Gordon Russell]]\n| introducer     = {{Plainlist|\n* Joseph Stuart\n* [[Paul Rauch]] (1984)\n* [[Frank Valentini]] (2008, 2011)\n}}\n| classification = [[List of One Life to Live characters|Past; recurring]]\n| image1         = Tina-AndreaEvans-2008-06-11.jpg\n| caption1       = Andrea Evans as Tina Lord\n| image2         = Tina-KarenWitter-1990.jpg\n| caption2       = Karen Witter as Tina Lord\n| image3         = Tina-Krista_Tesreau-1995.jpg\n| caption3       = Krista Tesreau as Tina Lord\n| alias          = {{Plainlist|\n* Tina Clayton\n* Tina Roberts\n* Tina Rogan\n* Tina Vickers\n}}\n| occupation     = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Socialite]]\n* [[Trustee]] to the [[Lord family]] estate\n* Crown Princess \n* Personal shopper\n* Interior designer\n}}\n| family         = [[Lord family|Lord]]\n| father         = [[Victor Lord]]\n| mother         = [[Irene Manning (One Life to Live)|Irene Manning Lord]]\n| stepfather     = [[Ted Clayton (One Life to Live)|Ted Clayton]]\n| brothers       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Todd Manning]]\n* [[Victor Lord, Jr.]]\n}}\n| halfbrothers   = [[Tony Lord (One Life to Live)|Tony Lord]]\n| halfsisters    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Victoria Lord]]\n* [[Meredith Lord]]\n}}\n| spouse         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Cord Roberts]] (1986\u20131993, 2011){{efn|The first ceremony for Cord and Tina was in 1986.

She makes fast friends with Natalie, a relative newcomer and former fellow \"black sheep of the family,\" but Tina's once-loving relationship with Jessica is now fractious and antagonistic. Stunned by Jessica's cold and rude behavior, Tina is unaware that Jessica is actually \"Tess,\" her dangerous alternate personality, who has secretly emerged from Jessica's psyche to take control and seek revenge on Natalie and her lover [[Jared Banks]], whom Tess blames for the death of [[Nash Brennan]], Jessica's husband and the love of Tess's life. As Tina settles into Llanfair, she takes care to hide the stolen Mendorran Crown Jewels in Viki's wall safe, fearing she will be apprehended by international authorities. Tina grows increasingly suspicious of \"Jessica's\" strange actions when she discovers her niece has ordered construction to be done in the Llanfair basement. \"Jessica\" claims the construction work is a surprise for the family, but when Tina and her beloved [[shih tzu]] \"David Vickers\" go snooping in the basement, they discover the soundproofed secret room Tess has built below the house. Tina reflects on her memories of her father Victor Lord's own secret room, and its significance to Viki and her own alternate personalities, one of whom had imprisoned Dorian Lord below Llanfair. Remembering her own complicated relationship with Viki's alters such as Niki Smith, Tina realizes that Tess has emerged. Before Tina can alert the family, Tess traps her in the secret room.<ref>[http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/5128/Enjoy_Your_New_Digs ''One Life to Live'' recap (9/3/08) - Soaps.com]</ref> Tess discovers the jewels in the safe and threatens to not only tell the authorities, but a vengeful Carlo as well. Fearing for herself and especially Sarah, Tina begrudgingly agrees to not only stay quiet, but to help Tess drag a drugged Natalie down into the secret room. A guilty Tina tries to thwart Tess several times, but is always caught; Tina sends Jared down to the basement to find Natalie, but Tess traps him as well. Viki returns to town in time to realize that Tess is on the loose. With a bomb set to go off, Tina leads Viki and Jared's father [[Charlie Banks (One Life to Live)|Charlie Banks]] down to the secret room in time to save Natalie and Jared. On November 14, 2008, Tina comes clean to a furious Viki, who tells Tina to leave and never return.<ref>[http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/5551/You_Never_Know_Whos_Around_The_Corner ''One Life to Live'' recap (11/14/08) - Soaps.com]</ref> Tina says goodbye to a disappointed Sarah on November 25, 2008, too ashamed to explain why she is leaving town.<ref name=\"Soaps 2008-11-25\"/> Tina  peers into Jessica's hospital room, sadly watching Viki, Clint and Natalie surrounding Jessica and her daughters \u2014 the family Tina may never be a part of again.<ref name=\"Soaps 2008-11-25\"/> Finally, Tina goes to the crypt of her father Victor, curses him for the damage he has done to Viki and the rest of the family, and vows to return to Llanview someday.<ref name=\"Soaps 2008-11-25\"/>\n\n===2011===\nTina returns to Llanview with her dog David Vickers for the reading of Todd's will on September 27, 2011. She is shocked to discover that her mother Irene is alive and well, and that the brother who has just died is not Todd, but his secret twin brother, [[Victor Lord, Jr.|Victor Lord, Jr]]. Victor has left everything to Irene. Tina sees Cord at Llanfair, but he is still angry at her for endangering other members of the family with her schemes during her 2008 visit. Tina's dog goes missing, and the search for him brings Tina and Cord closer. They reminisce about their past together and nearly kiss, but are interrupted by Clint. Tina and Viki talk about their troubled relationship, mostly influenced by Tina's many past mistakes, but the sisters decide to put the past aside. Tina's dog returns. Tina and Cord nearly get intimate with each other again after they babysit Jessica and [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]]'s son [[Ryder Ford|Ryder]], but Natalie interrupts them. Natalie confronts Tina for being partly responsible for having her locked in the basement by Tess. Tina apologizes to Natalie, and offers to plan Natalie's upcoming wedding with [[Brody Lovett]]. Natalie accepts. Viki tells Tina that she is pushing too hard to rekindle things with Cord. Tina and Cord hash out their problems in the stables, but end up having sex. Cord tells Tina that despite this, he does not know if he can trust her again. Tina vows to regain his trust. Her commitment to changing is tested when she inherits all of Victor Jr.'s fortune, Irene's money, and ''The Sun'' newspaper. Tina is elated to be rich at last, but recalls her intentions to not be fueled by greed and hands over both fortunes and ''The Sun'' to Todd, the rightful owner. Todd, Viki, and Victor Jr.'s widow [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] are pleasantly surprised. Cord learns of Tina's benevolence, the two declare their love and share a passionate kiss. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts Natalie and Brody's wedding with the missing paternity test results proving that Natalie's ex-boyfriend [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]], not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. The wedding is called off. Cord proposes to Tina, who accepts. They marry then and there for the fourth time.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/cast/653/Tina_Lord Tina Lord profile - Soaps.com]\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/whoswho/tina.php Tina Clayton Lord profile - SoapCentral.com]\n* [http://llanviewlabyrinth.webs.com/notoriouslyremembered/1968_1989/remembered_tinalord.html Notoriously Remembered: Tina Lord]\n* [http://soapnet.go.com/soapnet/gallery/path-galleryNum_1667/category_shows/subcategory_daytimeemmysredcarpet2008 \"''OLTL'''s Tina Lord: Through the Years.\" (Photo gallery) - SOAPnet.com]\n\n{{One Life to Live}}\n{{Tina Lord actresses}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord, Tina}}\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:One Life to Live characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "78.246.10.107", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(tina lord)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Lord"}
