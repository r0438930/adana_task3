Incidents were reported wherein the defaulters were put to \"public shame\" by the recovery agents.\n\nThe bank also faced allegations of inappropriate behavior in recovering its loans. These allegations started initially when the \"recovery agents\" and bank employees started threatening the defaulters. In some cases, notes were written by the bank's employees asking the defaulters to \"sell everything in the house including family members\", were found. Such charges faced by the bank rose to a peak when suicide cases were reported wherein the suicide notes spoke of the Bank's recovery methods as the cause of the suicide.

A number of cases were filed against the bank and its employees for using \"brutal measures\" to recover the money. Most of the allegations were that the bank was using goons to recover the credit card payments and that these \"recovery agents\" exhibited inappropriately and in some cases, inhuman behavior. Incidents were reported wherein the defaulters were put to \"public shame\" by the recovery agents.\n\nThe bank also faced allegations of inappropriate behavior in recovering its loans. These allegations started initially when the \"recovery agents\" and bank employees started threatening the defaulters. In some cases, notes were written by the bank's employees asking the defaulters to \"sell everything in the house including family members\", were found. Such charges faced by the bank rose to a peak when suicide cases were reported wherein the suicide notes spoke of the Bank's recovery methods as the cause of the suicide. This led to a lot of legal battles and the bank paying huge compensation.<ref name=\"RBI warns ICICI Bank on recovery agents\">{{cite news|last=PTI|title=RBI warns ICICI Bank on recovery agents|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-11-21/india-business/27978291_1_recovery-agents-icici-bank-private-banks|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=21 November 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"How to deal with rising abuse of bank recovery agents\">{{cite news|last=Sarang|first=Bindisha|title=How to deal with rising abuse of bank recovery agents|url=http://www.firstpost.com/investing/how-to-deal-with-rising-abuse-of-bank-recovery-agents-487476.html|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=first post|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Money laundering allegations===\nICICI Bank was one of the leading Indian banks accused of blatant [[money laundering]] through violation of RBI guidelines in the famous CobraPost<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/rbi-probes-cobrapost-report-reveals-violations-by-banks_870061.html|title=''RBI response to Cobra Post Expos\u00e9''}}</ref> sting operation which shook up Indian banking industry during April\u2013May 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-05-10/india/39168568_1_cobrapost-axis-bank-icici-bank|title = Cobra Post Exposure of Indian Banks | work=The Times of India}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 March 2013 the online magazine Cobrapost released video footage from [[Operation Red Spider]] showing high-ranking officials and some employees of ICICI Bank agreeing to convert black money into white, an act in violation of [[Money Laundering Control Act]].
