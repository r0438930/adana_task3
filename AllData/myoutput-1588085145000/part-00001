It aired from March 2, 1992 until December 29, 2006. It was produced by [[Cheryl Wagner]] and Robert Mills, [[television director|directed]] by Wayne Moss, Robert Mills and Steve Wright. It premiered on March 2, 1992 in Canada and on January 9, 1995 in the [[United States]] on PBS stations across the country. The program was broadcast on [[Treehouse TV]] from 1997 to 2006, and rerun episodes from 2007 to 2011, as seen in its [[List of programs broadcast by Treehouse TV|list of programs]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nEach episode contains numerous standard elements that take place throughout the episode. Early in each show, Loonette performs an exercise routine she calls the Clock Rug Stretch, and toward the end after reading a story, she notices that their bedroom stuff is all over the floor, and in which with a screaming tone she asks, \"HEY! WHO MADE THIS BIG MESS?!?\", the camera would then zoom in on either Loonette or Molly in which she asks it was either her or Molly (the answer depends in each episode) then the camera would quickly pan up and down as a way of saying yes, then Loonette explains it's only fair for them to clean it up, and she performs a fastest clean-up routine called the Ten Second Tidy. After Loonette and Molly go to sleep, the credits then roll over a lullaby version of the theme song ending with Loonette doing a short role-play of Hey Diddle Diddle saying \"And the clown jumped over the moon!\" before the ending logos are shown ending the episode (on early episodes, there's no audio in them). In the episode, \"Gesundheit\", Loonette says, \"AH, AH, AH-CHOO!\" And in the episode, \"Hiccups\", Loonette says, \"And the clown\uff0d''hiccup!''\uff0dover the moon!\"\n\nOther oft-repeated elements include reading a story to Molly, who sometimes either chooses a story to hear, gives Loonette a book and oversized glasses, or turning on the lights for Loonette; encounters with the dust bunnies who live under the couch; visits to different places in Clowntown, songs that emphasize the episode's lessons or themes, and a trip to Granny Garbanzo's garden and house. Here she encounters Snicklefritz, Granny's cat; Major Bedhead, the local mail-delivery clown, who travels on a unicycle; and of course, Granny herself. The conversation with Granny is often used as the episode's teachable moment, where Granny offers Loonette advice or lessons, often with the help of Major Bedhead, who delivers gifts and messages from Auntie Macassar or Uncle Chester. All episodes end with Loonette and Molly having a nap and sometimes reminding the viewers to remember the rules on today's episode.\n\nIn season 7, Loonette and Molly play the Dream Game and Molly gives out the letter that the dream starts with and provide what they will be dreaming about. In season 6, Loonette and Molly go to Doll School where Molly learns the alphabet as well as numbers. A similar element used in seasons 1\u20133 (and in one episode of Season 5) is the Alphabet Game, where a certain letter is shown on a giant alphabet block and Loonette uses certain words beginning with that letter and also makes the letter's shape with her body to get the viewers to guess the letter.\n\nAlong with the lessons and problem solving sequences, the show also emphasized imaginative play. These episodes often take place in the context of a visit to Clowntown, such as Granny Garbanzo's Cabbage Club Cooking School and Major Bedhead's Clown Chi Dojo and Dancing School. Additionally, Loonette is gifted in the art of classical dance and runs Miss Loonette's Dance Academy. From Seasons 1 to 6, Loonette was too young to visit Clowntown alone, but in Season 7, she makes frequent trips to Clowntown, and volunteers at the Clowndergarten, where she teaches young clowns games, songs and stories. This imaginative play was also demonstrated through dress-up games and through Loonette's dollhouse, in which she imagined the adventures of The Foley Family. Shown first as a doll-sized family, in Loonette's imagination they would become a family of regular-sized clowns, whose actions were shown in high speed and with a musical background in the style of old silent movies. The Foleys do not speak. Early in the first season, Molly had discovered the Dust Bunnies. However, Loonette didn't believe that there were dust bunnies under the couch.\n\nThe two lounge around the couch all day, with the exception of the Clock Rug Stretch and daily adventure, sometimes involving Granny or Major Bedhead, a postal service employee who also plays bit parts. Each day includes a few songs and a story (which, when told by Loonette, involves her wearing huge yellow glasses and holding a blue storybook); and is ended with the Ten Second Tidy and a nice nap. The end credits roll as a clown moon rises into the starry background above the couch ending with Loonette and Molly jumping over it (Similar to the ending sequence of ''[[The Friendly Giant]]'').\n\n==Production==\nThe show was originally produced by [[Radical Sheep Productions]] with Owl Television (later Owl Communications), then Canadian children's television network [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[WITF-TV]] Harrisburg, with a run of 65 episodes. In 2000, the previous episodes were produced with Benny Smart, an US children's television production company, Tadpole Kids and [[Treehouse TV]], a sister channel of YTV, and [[WNPT (TV)|Nashville Public Television]]. At the end of this show (previously produced with Benny Smart), a companion guide appears for the viewers to learn about it.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2002, the show was filmed at Wallace Avenue Studios in Toronto, and in 2006, it was filmed at Toronto's Studio City.\n\n[[Radical Sheep Productions]] and Amity Entertainment, in association with [[Treehouse TV]] and [[WNPT (TV)|Nashville Public Television]], produced 22 additional episodes, which debuted on [[American Public Television]] in 2006.\n\n==Characters==\n===Loonette===\nLoonette is the freckled-faced female lead of the series, portrayed by [[Alyson Court]] from 1992 to 2002 and [[Ramona Gilmour-Darling]] in 2006. She is a young clown living with her doll, Molly, in their house, on the eponymous Big Comfy Couch, an oversized green floral couch with She wears a red jumper and a white shirt with suns and moons with purple sleeves. She also wears a purple hat on her head with her pigtails coming out and wears black and white striped tights with black shoes adorned with suns on each side.\nShe frequently reads stories to Molly, always performs a Clock Rug Stretch, and likes to visit Granny Garbanzo. Auntie Macassar or Uncle Chester frequently send Loonette postcards which Major Bedhead delivers on his unicycle. Her parents are never seen or mentioned although it was implied in \u201cWhere Do Clowns Come From?\u201d that she was adopted by Granny, Auntie Macassar, and Uncle Chester after the event of the \u201cSecret Circus\u201d and Fool Moon. Loonette is gifted in the art of classical dance and runs Miss Loonette's Dance Academy. Another gift she possesses is the unusual skill to clean just about any mess up in ten seconds, which she calls the Ten Second Tidy. She frequently used the word \"pickle juice\" when she is upset about situations in a few episodes.\n\nInitially, Loonette was bossy and stubborn, even when Molly dislike it, and she was too young to visit Clowntown, but starting from 2006, Loonette makes frequent trips to Clowntown to visit Granny's Cabbage Club Cooking School and Major Bedhead's Clown Chi Dojo and Dancing School. The trips to the first location help teach Loonette how to cook. The trips to this second location indicate that she practices martial arts. Loonette also takes Molly to Clowndergarten and helps out with the other young clowns. This third location is similar to kindergarten.\n\n===Molly===\nMolly, the sidekick of the series, is Loonette's living doll. Loonette found her in a barrel with a sign marked \"Free to a good home\", and adopted her. She is puppeteered by [[Bob Stutt]].\n\nMolly wears a blue (Occasionally yellow) dress. She believes that dust bunnies really exist, despite Loonette's disbelief. Her favorite food is donuts. She only speaks by cartoon bubbles, and usually answers Loonette's yes or no questions by either nodding or shaking her head.\n\n===Additional characters===\n*'''Fuzzy and Wuzzy''' (puppeteered/voiced by Bob Stutt and Robert Mills): they are the twin dust bunnies who live under the Big Comfy Couch.

Her name is derived from the garbanzo bean.\n*'''Snicklefritz''' (puppeteered by Bob Stutt): Granny's cat, who was introduced in Season 2. Likes to play pranks on the others and sometimes tries to get out of getting flea-baths. The name ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Snicklefritz#English Snicklefritz]'' comes from [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/snicklefritz slang in German culture].\n*'''Major Bedhead''' ([[Fred C. Stinson]]): The local clown courier who makes deliveries to Loonette from Auntie Macassar or Uncle Chester. He can be quite goofy at times and a bit clumsy. He also hates lying and being dishonest.\n*'''Auntie Macassar''' ([[Taborah Johnson]]): Loonette\u2019s travelling aunt who likes to make an entrance whenever she visits. She appears in Seasons 1\u20135. Her name is a pun on antimacassar.\n*'''Wobbly''' ([[Gary Farmer]]): A close friend who lives in Clowntown. Appears in two episodes in Season 2.\n*'''Uncle Chester''' (Edward Knuckles): Loonette's travelling uncle who appears in the show's last two seasons.\n\n==Reruns and other original channels==\nIn the United States, the series was syndicated by [[American Public Television]] to public television stations in that country, most of which were affiliated with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], starting on January 9, 1995 and ending in February 2007, with reruns airing discontinued in 2009.

It aired from March 2, 1992 until December 29, 2006. It was produced by [[Cheryl Wagner]] and Robert Mills, [[television director|directed]] by Wayne Moss, Robert Mills and Steve Wright. It premiered on March 2, 1992 in Canada and on January 9, 1995 in the [[United States]] on PBS stations across the country. The program was broadcast on [[Treehouse TV]] from 1997 to 2006, and rerun episodes from 2007 to 2011, as seen in its [[List of programs broadcast by Treehouse TV|list of programs]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nEach episode contains numerous standard elements that take place throughout the episode. Early in each show, Loonette performs an exercise routine she calls the Clock Rug Stretch, and toward the end after reading a story, she notices that their bedroom stuff is all over the floor, and in which with a screaming tone she asks, \"HEY! WHO MADE THIS BIG MESS?!?\", the camera would then zoom in on either Loonette or Molly in which she asks it was either her or Molly (the answer depends in each episode) then the camera would quickly pan up and down as a way of saying yes, then Loonette explains it's only fair for them to clean it up, and she performs a fastest clean-up routine called the Ten Second Tidy. After Loonette and Molly go to sleep, the credits then roll over a lullaby version of the theme song ending with Loonette doing a short role-play of Hey Diddle Diddle saying \"And the clown jumped over the moon!\" before the ending logos are shown ending the episode (on early episodes, there's no audio in them). In the episode, \"Gesundheit\", Loonette says, \"AH, AH, AH-CHOO!\" And in the episode, \"Hiccups\", Loonette says, \"And the clown\uff0d''hiccup!''\uff0dover the moon!\"\n\nOther oft-repeated elements include reading a story to Molly, who sometimes either chooses a story to hear, gives Loonette a book and oversized glasses, or turning on the lights for Loonette; encounters with the dust bunnies who live under the couch; visits to different places in Clowntown, songs that emphasize the episode's lessons or themes, and a trip to Granny Garbanzo's garden and house. Here she encounters Snicklefritz, Granny's cat; Major Bedhead, the local mail-delivery clown, who travels on a unicycle; and of course, Granny herself. The conversation with Granny is often used as the episode's teachable moment, where Granny offers Loonette advice or lessons, often with the help of Major Bedhead, who delivers gifts and messages from Auntie Macassar or Uncle Chester. All episodes end with Loonette and Molly having a nap and sometimes reminding the viewers to remember the rules on today's episode.\n\nIn season 7, Loonette and Molly play the Dream Game and Molly gives out the letter that the dream starts with and provide what they will be dreaming about. In season 6, Loonette and Molly go to Doll School where Molly learns the alphabet as well as numbers. A similar element used in seasons 1\u20133 (and in one episode of Season 5) is the Alphabet Game, where a certain letter is shown on a giant alphabet block and Loonette uses certain words beginning with that letter and also makes the letter's shape with her body to get the viewers to guess the letter.\n\nAlong with the lessons and problem solving sequences, the show also emphasized imaginative play. These episodes often take place in the context of a visit to Clowntown, such as Granny Garbanzo's Cabbage Club Cooking School and Major Bedhead's Clown Chi Dojo and Dancing School. Additionally, Loonette is gifted in the art of classical dance and runs Miss Loonette's Dance Academy. From Seasons 1 to 6, Loonette was too young to visit Clowntown alone, but in Season 7, she makes frequent trips to Clowntown, and volunteers at the Clowndergarten, where she teaches young clowns games, songs and stories. This imaginative play was also demonstrated through dress-up games and through Loonette's dollhouse, in which she imagined the adventures of The Foley Family. Shown first as a doll-sized family, in Loonette's imagination they would become a family of regular-sized clowns, whose actions were shown in high speed and with a musical background in the style of old silent movies. The Foleys do not speak. Early in the first season, Molly had discovered the Dust Bunnies. However, Loonette didn't believe that there were dust bunnies under the couch.\n\nThe two lounge around the couch all day, with the exception of the Clock Rug Stretch and daily adventure, sometimes involving Granny or Major Bedhead, a postal service employee who also plays bit parts. Each day includes a few songs and a story (which, when told by Loonette, involves her wearing huge yellow glasses and holding a blue storybook); and is ended with the Ten Second Tidy and a nice nap. The end credits roll as a clown moon rises into the starry background above the couch ending with Loonette and Molly jumping over it (Similar to the ending sequence of ''[[The Friendly Giant]]'').\n\n==Production==\nThe show was originally produced by [[Radical Sheep Productions]] with Owl Television (later Owl Communications), then Canadian children's television network [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[WITF-TV]] Harrisburg, with a run of 65 episodes. In 2000, the previous episodes were produced with Benny Smart, an US children's television production company, Tadpole Kids and [[Treehouse TV]], a sister channel of YTV, and [[WNPT (TV)|Nashville Public Television]]. At the end of this show (previously produced with Benny Smart), a companion guide appears for the viewers to learn about it.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2002, the show was filmed at Wallace Avenue Studios in Toronto, and in 2006, it was filmed at Toronto's Studio City.\n\n[[Radical Sheep Productions]] and Amity Entertainment, in association with [[Treehouse TV]] and [[WNPT (TV)|Nashville Public Television]], produced 22 additional episodes, which debuted on [[American Public Television]] in 2006.\n\n==Characters==\n===Loonette===\nLoonette is the freckled-faced female lead of the series, portrayed by [[Alyson Court]] from 1992 to 2002 and [[Ramona Gilmour-Darling]] in 2006. She is a young clown living with her doll, Molly, in their house, on the eponymous Big Comfy Couch, an oversized green floral couch with She wears a red jumper and a white shirt with suns and moons with purple sleeves. She also wears a purple hat on her head with her pigtails coming out and wears black and white striped tights with black shoes adorned with suns on each side.\nShe frequently reads stories to Molly, always performs a Clock Rug Stretch, and likes to visit Granny Garbanzo. Auntie Macassar or Uncle Chester frequently send Loonette postcards which Major Bedhead delivers on his unicycle. Her parents are never seen or mentioned although it was implied in \u201cWhere Do Clowns Come From?\u201d that she was adopted by Granny, Auntie Macassar, and Uncle Chester after the event of the \u201cSecret Circus\u201d and Fool Moon. Loonette is gifted in the art of classical dance and runs Miss Loonette's Dance Academy. Another gift she possesses is the unusual skill to clean just about any mess up in ten seconds, which she calls the Ten Second Tidy. She frequently used the word \"pickle juice\" when she is upset about situations in a few episodes.\n\nInitially, Loonette was bossy and stubborn, even when Molly dislike it, and she was too young to visit Clowntown, but starting from 2006, Loonette makes frequent trips to Clowntown to visit Granny's Cabbage Club Cooking School and Major Bedhead's Clown Chi Dojo and Dancing School. The trips to the first location help teach Loonette how to cook. The trips to this second location indicate that she practices martial arts. Loonette also takes Molly to Clowndergarten and helps out with the other young clowns. This third location is similar to kindergarten.\n\n===Molly===\nMolly, the sidekick of the series, is Loonette's living doll. Loonette found her in a barrel with a sign marked \"Free to a good home\", and adopted her. She is puppeteered by [[Bob Stutt]].\n\nMolly wears a blue (Occasionally yellow) dress. She believes that dust bunnies really exist, despite Loonette's disbelief. Her favorite food is donuts. She only speaks by cartoon bubbles, and usually answers Loonette's yes or no questions by either nodding or shaking her head.\n\n===Additional characters===\n*'''Fuzzy and Wuzzy''' (puppeteered/voiced by Bob Stutt and Robert Mills): they are the twin dust bunnies who live under the Big Comfy Couch.

Her name is derived from the garbanzo bean.\n*'''Snicklefritz''' (puppeteered by Bob Stutt): Granny's cat, who was introduced in Season 2. Likes to play pranks on the others and sometimes tries to get out of getting flea-baths. The name ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Snicklefritz#English Snicklefritz]'' comes from [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/snicklefritz slang in German culture].\n*'''Major Bedhead''' (Fred Stinson): The local clown courier who makes deliveries to Loonette from Auntie Macassar or Uncle Chester. He can be quite goofy at times and a bit clumsy. He also hates lying and being dishonest.\n*'''Auntie Macassar''' ([[Taborah Johnson]]): Loonette\u2019s travelling aunt who likes to make an entrance whenever she visits. She appears in Seasons 1\u20135. Her name is a pun on antimacassar.\n*'''Wobbly''' ([[Gary Farmer]]): A close friend who lives in Clowntown. Appears in two episodes in Season 2.\n*'''Uncle Chester''' (Edward Knuckles): Loonette's travelling uncle who appears in the show's last two seasons.\n\n==Reruns and other original channels==\nIn the United States, the series was syndicated by [[American Public Television]] to public television stations in that country, most of which were affiliated with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], starting on January 9, 1995 and ending in February 2007, with reruns airing discontinued in 2009.
