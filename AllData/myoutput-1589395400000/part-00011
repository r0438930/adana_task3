Twenty-year-old Anna Christina ([[Tania Raymonde]]) is smitten by Colonel Tariq ([[Jan Uddin]]), a rising star in the Turkish army who has growing doubts about his countrymen's brutal methods of governance, and who had once spared her life on a cliff-top when she was a child. However, their budding romance brings tragedy to her family and her village.\n\nSwearing revenge against the Turks, Christina joins the Greek rebellion and inadvertently becomes a local symbol of the Greek resistance movement, inspiring her countrymen and attracting the ire of the Turks, who place a bounty on her head. Having believed that she could leave her feelings behind, Christina must face off against the man who still loves her and wants to keep her safe, but who has now been tasked with her capture. Their encounters and skirmishes inevitably lead to a tragic confrontation during a pivotal battle between the Greeks and Turks that will change the course of history.<ref name=\"CFRT\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apostolospapapostolou.com/cliffs-of-freedom-movie/ |title=Cliffs of Freedom Movie |website=Apostolos Papapostolou |accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Tania Raymonde]] as Anna Christina\n** Josey Smith as Young Anna Christina\n* [[Jan Uddin]] as Colonel Tariq\n* [[Raza Jaffrey]] as Sunal Demir\n* [[Patti LuPone]] as Yiayia\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Thanasis\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Christos\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Demetris\n** Jamie Christian Ward as Young Demetris\n* Dino Kelly as Vangelis\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as Constantine \n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Stavros Valvianos\n* [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Christina Vakrinos\n* [[Carlo Rota]] as Mustapha Bey\n* [[Ruth Gemmell]] as Varvara Vakrinos\n* [[Ivan Kaye]] as Ghazi Kalif\n* [[Simon Kassianides]] as Gregory\n* [[Dennis Boutsikaris]] as [[Theodoros Kolokotronis|Kolokotronis]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nOn October 12, 2016, filming began in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/866105/dunaway-plummer-begin-filming-cliffs-of-freedom-in-nm.html |title=LuPone, Plummer begin filming 'Cliffs of Freedom' in New Mexico |website=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |publisher=Journal Publishing Company |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |date=October 12, 2016 |accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref> On January 10, 2017, the film wrapped production.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://hollywood.greekreporter.com/2017/01/10/greek-drama-cliffs-of-freedom-wraps-production-in-new-mexico/ |title=Greek Drama 'Cliffs of Freedom' Wraps Production in New Mexico |website=Hollywood Greek Reporter |last=Kalafatis |first=Joanna |date=January 10, 2017 |accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film was released in the United States on March 1, 2019 by Round Hill Media.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"CliffsofFreedomTheNumbers\" /> {{As of|2019|4|20}}, ''Cliffs of Freedom'' has grossed an estimated $72,476 in North America and $228,336 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $300,842.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n=== Critical response ===\nMichael Ordo\u00f1a of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave a mixed review by stating \"''Cliffs of Freedom'' is a bit rocky, but takes its leap in earnest.
