Since [[Homer]]ic literature (the [[Trojan Wars]]), through the accounts of the [[Persian Wars]] of [[Greeks]] against [[Persia]]ns by [[Herodotus]], and right up until the time of [[Alexander the Great]], there was a [[paradigm]] of a contrast between Greeks and other civilizations.

However, this would become the centre of a new West. Europe fell into political anarchy, with many warring kingdoms and principalities. Under the Frankish kings, it eventually, and partially, reunified, and the anarchy evolved into [[feudalism]].\n\nMuch of the basis of the post-Roman cultural world had been set before the fall of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], mainly through the integration and reshaping of Roman ideas through Christian thought. The Greek and Roman [[Religion in ancient Rome|paganism]] had been completely replaced by [[Christianity]] around the 4th and 5th centuries, since it became the official State religion following the baptism of emperor [[Constantine I]]. [[Orthodox Christian]] Christianity and the [[Nicene Creed]] served as a unifying force in Christian parts of Europe, and in some respects replaced or competed with the secular authorities.

The philosophy and science of Classical Greece was largely forgotten in Europe after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, other than in isolated monastic enclaves (notably in Ireland, which had become Christian but was never conquered by Rome).<ref>\"How The Irish Saved Civilisation\", by Thomas Cahill, 1995{{page needed|date=February 2015}}</ref> The learning of [[Classical Antiquity]] was better preserved in the [[Byzantine]] [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Justinian's [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] Roman civil law code was created in the East in his capital of Constantinople,<ref name=\"The Cambridge Companion to Roman La\"/> and that city maintained trade and intermittent political control over outposts such as [[Venice]] in the West for centuries. Classical Greek learning was also subsumed, preserved and elaborated in the rising Eastern world, which gradually supplanted Roman-Byzantine control as a dominant cultural-political force. Thus, much of the learning of classical antiquity was slowly reintroduced to European civilization in the centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nThe rediscovery of the [[Roman law|Justinian Code]] in Western Europe early in the 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. In the [[Catholic]] or [[Franks|Frankish]] west, [[Roman law]] became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence is found in all Western legal systems, although in different manners and to different extents. The study of [[canon law]], the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship. During the Reformation and Enlightenment, the ideas of [[civil rights]], [[social equality|equality]] before the [[law]], [[procedural justice]], and [[democracy]] as the ideal form of [[society]] began to be institutionalized as principles forming the basis of modern Western culture, particularly in Protestant regions.\n\nIn the 14th century, starting from Italy and then spreading throughout Europe,<ref>Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' (1998)</ref> there was a massive artistic, architectural, scientific and philosophical revival, as a result of the Christian revival of Greek philosophy, and the long Christian medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities.<ref name=Grant9>Grant ''God and Reason'' p. 9</ref> This period is commonly referred to as the [[Renaissance]]. In the following century, this process was further enhanced by an exodus of Greek Christian priests and [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|scholars]] to Italian cities such as [[Venice]] after the end of the [[Byzantine Empire]] with the [[fall of Constantinople]].\n\n[[File:Landing of Columbus (2).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Age of Discovery|discovery of the New World]] by [[Christopher Columbus]].]]\nFrom [[Late Antiquity]], through the [[Middle Ages]], and onwards, while Eastern Europe was shaped by the [[Orthodox Church]], Southern and Central Europe were increasingly stabilized by the [[Catholic Church]] which, as Roman imperial governance faded from view, was the only consistent force in Western Europe.<ref name=\"Koch 1994\">{{cite book |last=Koch |first=Carl |title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission |year=1994 |publisher=St. Mary's Press |location=Early Middle Ages |isbn=978-0-88489-298-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/catholicchurchjo00koch }}</ref> In 1054 came the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] that, following the [[Greek East and Latin West]] divide, separated Europe into religious and cultural regions present to this day.

During the [[Great Divergence]], a term coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]{{sfn|Frank|2001}} the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]] of the time, eclipsing [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions.\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[United States Constitution]]]]\n\nComing into the [[modern era]], the historical understanding of the East\u2013West contrast\u2014as the opposition of [[Christendom]] to its geographical neighbors\u2014began to weaken. As religion became less important, and Europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples, the old concept of Western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today. The [[Age of Discovery]] faded into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in Western Europe emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the [[Catholic Church]]; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and [[skepticism]].\n\nPhilosophers of the Enlightenment included [[Francis Bacon]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778), [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref>Sootin, Harry. \"Isaac Newton.\" New York, Messner (1955)</ref> influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as [[enlightened absolutism]]. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' (1751\u201372) that was edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. The ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733) written by [[Voltaire]] spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.\n\nCoinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the [[scientific revolution]], spearheaded by Newton. This included the emergence of [[modern science]], during which developments in [[History of mathematics#Mathematics during the Scientific Revolution|mathematics]], [[History of physics#Scientific Revolution|physics]], [[History of astronomy#Renaissance Period|astronomy]], [[History of biology#Renaissance and early modern developments|biology]] (including [[History of anatomy|human anatomy]]) and [[History of chemistry#17th and 18th centuries: Early chemistry|chemistry]] transformed views of society and nature.<ref name=\"Galileo\">Galileo Galilei, ''Two New Sciences'', trans.

The emergent [[mass media]] (film, radio, television and recorded music) created a global culture that could ignore national frontiers. Literacy became almost universal, encouraging the growth of books, magazines and newspapers. The influence of cinema and radio remained, while televisions became near essentials in every home. \n\nBy the mid-[[20th century]], Western culture was exported worldwide, and the development and growth of international [[transport]] and [[telecommunication]] (such as [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] and the [[radiotelephone]]) played a decisive role in modern [[globalization]]. The West has contributed a great many technological, political, philosophical, artistic and religious aspects to modern international culture: having been a crucible of [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], democracy, industrialisation; the first major civilisation to seek to [[Abolitionism|abolish slavery]] during the 19th century, the first to [[Women's suffrage|enfranchise women]] (beginning in [[Australasia]] at the end of the 19th century) and the first to put to use such technologies as [[steam power|steam]], [[electric power|electric]] and [[nuclear power]]. The West invented [[film|cinema]], [[television]], the [[personal computer]] and the [[Internet]]; produced artists such as [[Michelangelo]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], and [[Mozart]]; developed sports such as [[soccer]], [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and [[basketball]]; and transported humans to an [[astronomical object]] for the first time with the [[1969 in spaceflight|1969]] [[Apollo 11]] [[Moon Landing]].\n\n== Arts and humanities ==\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene44 William Odo Robert.jpg|Detail of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] showing [[William the Conqueror]] (centre), his half-brothers [[Robert, Count of Mortain]] (right) and [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Odo]], Bishop of [[Bayeux]] in the [[Duchy of Normandy]] (left).

There are essentially no taboos against depicting a god, or other religious figures, in a representational fashion.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{for|modern Western music|music industry}}\nIn music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,<ref name=\"Hall100\">Hall, p. 100.</ref> and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.<ref name=\"Murray45\">Murray, p. 45.</ref>\n\nThe [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[sonata]], [[opera]], and [[oratorio]] have their origins in Italy. Many [[musical instrument]]s developed in the West have come to see widespread use all over the world; among them are the [[violin]], [[piano]], [[pipe organ]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[accordion]], and the [[theremin]].

Of course, extended prose fiction had existed much earlier; both novels of adventure and romance in the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] world and in [[Heian period|Heian]] Japan. Both [[Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]'' (c. 60 CE) and the ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] (c. 1000 CE) have been cited as the world's first major novel but they had a very limited long-term impact on literary writing beyond their own day until much more recent times.\n\nThe novel, which made its appearance in the 18th century, is an essentially European creation. Chinese and Japanese literature contain some works that may be thought of as novels, but only the European novel is couched in terms of a personal analysis of personal dilemmas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs in its artistic tradition, European literature pays deep tribute to human suffering.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Tragedy]], from its ritually and mythologically inspired Greek origins to modern forms where struggle and downfall are often rooted in psychological or social, rather than mythical, motives, is also widely considered a specifically European creation and can be seen as a forerunner of some aspects of both the novel and of classical [[opera]].\n\nThe validity of reason was postulated in both [[Christian philosophy]] and the Greco-Roman classics.<ref name=\":0\" /> Christianity laid a stress on the inward aspects of actions and on motives, notions that were foreign to the ancient world.

The method of preventing [[Rh disease]], the treatment of [[diabetes]], and the [[germ theory]] of disease were discovered by Westerners. The eradication of [[smallpox]], was led by a Westerner, [[Donald Henderson]]. [[Radiography]], [[computed tomography]], [[positron emission tomography]] and [[medical ultrasonography]] are important diagnostic tools developed in the West. Other important diagnostic tools of [[clinical chemistry]], including the methods of [[spectrophotometry]], [[electrophoresis]] and [[immunoassay]], were first devised by Westerners. So were the [[stethoscope]], the [[electrocardiograph]], and the [[endoscope]]. [[Vitamins]], [[hormonal contraception]], [[hormones]], [[insulin]], [[beta blocker]]s and [[ACE inhibitors]], along with a host of other medically proven drugs, were first utilized to treat disease in the West.

Before this time many Europeans from the north, especially Scandinavians, remained polytheistic, though southern Europe was predominantly Christian from the 5th century onwards. \n\nWestern culture is most strongly influenced by the [[Judeo-Christian]] and [[Greco-Roman]] cultures.<ref name=\"PerryChase2012\"/> These cultures had a number of similarities, such as a common emphasis on the individual, but they also embody fundamentally conflicting worldviews.

Sport has been an important part of Western cultural expression since [[Classical Antiquity]].]]\n[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]], and considered father of the modern [[Olympic Games]].]]\n\nSince [[classical antiquity]], sport has been an important facet of Western cultural expression. A wide range of sports was already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the [[Olympic Games]], which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympics were held at [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Athens in]].\n\nThe Romans built immense structures such as the [[Colisseum]] in Rome to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for [[blood sports]], such as the infamous [[Gladiator]]ial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of [[Classical Antiquity]]\u2014such as [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], [[discus]] and [[javelin]].\nThe sport of [[bullfighting]] is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric [[bull worship]] and [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and is often linked to [[Roman Empire|Rome]], where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.\n\n[[Jousting]] and hunting were popular sports in the Western Europe of the [[Middle Ages]], and the aristocratic classes of Europe developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of [[golf]] originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is [[James II of Scotland|James II]]'s banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning [[archery]]. The [[Industrial Revolution]] that began in Britain in the 18th Century brought increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of [[cricket]] was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the [[British Empire]]. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in Britain during the 19th Century and obtained global prominence\u2014these include [[ping pong]], modern [[tennis]], [[association football]], [[netball]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]].\n\nFootball (also known as [[soccer]]) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the ''world game''. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing nations, while victory in the [[Rugby World Cup]] has been shared among the Western states of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and England.\n\n[[Australian Rules Football]], an Australian variation of football with similarities to [[Gaelic football]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] evolved in the British [[colony of Victoria]] in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of [[baseball]] to America during the colonial period. The history of [[American football]] can be traced to early versions of rugby football and [[association football]]. Many games are known as \"football\" were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by [[Walter Camp]], the \"Father of American Football\".

This set the basis for a new critical attitude and open questioning of religion, favouring [[freethinking]] and questioning of the church as an authority, which resulted in open-minded and reformist ideals inside, such as [[liberation theology]], which partly adopted these currents, and secular and political tendencies such as [[laicism]], [[agnosticism]] and [[atheism]].\n* Generalized usage of some form of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] or [[Greek alphabet]], and derived forms, such as [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], used by those southern and eastern Slavic countries of [[Eastern Christianity|Christian Orthodox]] tradition, historically under the [[Byzantine Empire]] and later within the Russian [[czarist]] or [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] area of influence. Other variants of the Latin or Greek alphabets are found in the [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] and [[Coptic alphabet]]s, which historically superseded older scripts, such as [[Runic|runes]], and the Egyptian [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and [[Hieroglyphic]] systems.\n* [[Natural law]], [[human rights]], [[constitutionalism]], [[parliamentarism]] (or [[presidentialism]]) and formal [[liberal democracy]] in recent times\u2014prior to the 19th century, most Western governments were still monarchies.\n* A large influence, in [[modern history|modern times]], of many of the ideals and values developed and inherited from [[Romanticism]].\n* An emphasis on, and use of, [[science]] as a means of understanding the natural world and humanity's place in it.\n* More pronounced use and application of innovation and scientific developments, as well as a more rational approach to scientific progress (what has been known as the [[scientific method]]), as opposed to more empiric discoveries in the [[Eastern world]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Society|Europe}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Atlanticism]]\n* [[Christendom]]\n* [[Classical tradition]]\n* [[Culture during the Cold War]]\n* [[Eastern world]]\n* [[Eastern culture]]\n* [[European diaspora]]\n* [[Greco-Roman world]]\n* [[Western religion]]\n* [[Western world]]\n* [[Westernization]]\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist |colwidth = 30em }}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{Cite book |last=Ankerl |first=Guy |title=Global communication wi5thout universal civilization |series=INU societal research |volume=Vol. 1: Coexisting contemporary civilizations: Arabo-Muslim, Bharati, Chinese, and Western |publisher=INU Press |location=Geneva |isbn=978-2-88155-004-1 |pages= |year=2000 |ref=harv}}\n* Barzun, Jacques ''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life 1500 to the Present'' HarperCollins (2000) {{ISBN|0-06-017586-9}}.\n* Daly, Jonathan. \"[http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-rise-of-western-power-9781441161314/ The Rise of Western Power: A Comparative History of Western Civilization]\" (London and New York: Bloomsbury, 2014). {{ISBN|978-1441161314}}.\n* Daly, Jonathan. \"[http://www.tandfindia.com/books/details/9781138774810/ Historians Debate the Rise of the West]\" (London and New York: Routledge, 2015). {{ISBN|978-1138774810}}.\n* Jones, Prudence and Pennick, Nigel ''A History of Pagan Europe'' Barnes & Noble (1995) {{ISBN|0-7607-1210-7}}.\n* Merriman, John ''Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Present'' W.

Later, ideas of the West were formed by the concepts of [[Greek East and Latin West|Latin Christendom]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Since [[Homer]]ic literature (the [[Trojan Wars]]), through the accounts of the [[Persian Wars]] of [[Greeks]] against [[Persia]]ns by [[Herodotus]], and right up until the time of [[Alexander the Great]], there was a [[paradigm]] of a contrast between Greeks and other civilizations. Greeks felt they were the most civilized and saw themselves (in the formulation of [[Aristotle]]) as something between the advanced civilisations of the [[Near East]] (who they viewed as soft and slavish) and the wild [[barbarians]] of most of Europe to the west.\n\nAlexander's conquests led to the emergence of a [[Hellenistic civilization]], representing a synthesis of Greek and [[Near-East]]ern cultures in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] region.<ref name=\"Green\">Green, Peter.

Justinian's [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] Roman civil law code was created in the East in his capital of Constantinople,<ref name=\"The Cambridge Companion to Roman La\"/> and that city maintained trade and intermittent political control over outposts such as [[Venice]] in the West for centuries. Classical Greek learning was also subsumed, preserved and elaborated in the rising Eastern world, which gradually supplanted Roman-Byzantine control as a dominant cultural-political force. Thus, much of the learning of classical antiquity was slowly reintroduced to European civilization in the centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nThe rediscovery of the [[Roman law|Justinian Code]] in Western Europe early in the 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. In the [[Catholic]] or [[Franks|Frankish]] west, [[Roman law]] became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence is found in all Western legal systems, although in different manners and to different extents. The study of [[canon law]], the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship. During the Reformation and Enlightenment, the ideas of [[civil rights]], [[social equality|equality]] before the [[law]], [[procedural justice]], and [[democracy]] as the ideal form of [[society]] began to be institutionalized as principles forming the basis of modern Western culture, particularly in Protestant regions.\n\nIn the 14th century, starting from Italy and then spreading throughout Europe,<ref>Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' (1998)</ref> there was a massive artistic, architectural, scientific and philosophical revival, as a result of the Christian revival of Greek philosophy, and the long Christian medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities.<ref name=Grant9>Grant ''God and Reason'' p. 9</ref> This period is commonly referred to as the [[Renaissance]].

During the [[Great Divergence]], a term coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]{{sfn|Frank|2001}} the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]] of the time, eclipsing [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions.\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[United States Constitution]]]]\n\nComing into the [[modern era]], the historical understanding of the East\u2013West contrast\u2014as the opposition of [[Christendom]] to its geographical neighbors\u2014began to weaken. As religion became less important, and Europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples, the old concept of Western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today. The [[Age of Discovery]] faded into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in Western Europe emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the [[Catholic Church]]; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and [[skepticism]].\n\nPhilosophers of the Enlightenment included [[Francis Bacon]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778), [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref>Sootin, Harry. \"Isaac Newton.\" New York, Messner (1955)</ref> influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as [[enlightened absolutism]]. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' (1751\u201372) that was edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. The ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733) written by [[Voltaire]] spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.\n\nCoinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the [[scientific revolution]], spearheaded by Newton.

The emergent [[mass media]] (film, radio, television and recorded music) created a global culture that could ignore national frontiers. Literacy became almost universal, encouraging the growth of books, magazines and newspapers. The influence of cinema and radio remained, while televisions became near essentials in every home. \n\nBy the mid-[[20th century]], Western culture was exported worldwide, and the development and growth of international [[transport]] and [[telecommunication]] (such as [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] and the [[radiotelephone]]) played a decisive role in modern [[globalization]]. The West has contributed a great many technological, political, philosophical, artistic and religious aspects to modern international culture: having been a crucible of [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], democracy, industrialisation; the first major civilisation to seek to [[Abolitionism|abolish slavery]] during the 19th century, the first to [[Women's suffrage|enfranchise women]] (beginning in [[Australasia]] at the end of the 19th century) and the first to put to use such technologies as [[steam power|steam]], [[electric power|electric]] and [[nuclear power]]. The West invented [[film|cinema]], [[television]], the [[personal computer]] and the [[Internet]]; produced artists such as [[Michelangelo]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], and [[Mozart]]; developed sports such as [[soccer]], [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and [[basketball]]; and transported humans to an [[astronomical object]] for the first time with the [[1969 in spaceflight|1969]] [[Apollo 11]] [[Moon Landing]].\n\n== Arts and humanities ==\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene44 William Odo Robert.jpg|Detail of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] showing [[William the Conqueror]] (centre), his half-brothers [[Robert, Count of Mortain]] (right) and [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Odo]], Bishop of [[Bayeux]] in the [[Duchy of Normandy]] (left).

This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives.

Sport has been an important part of Western cultural expression since [[Classical Antiquity]].]]\n[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]], and considered father of the modern [[Olympic Games]].]]\n\nSince [[classical antiquity]], sport has been an important facet of Western cultural expression. A wide range of sports was already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the [[Olympic Games]], which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympics were held at [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Athens in]].\n\nThe Romans built immense structures such as the [[Colisseum]] in Rome to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for [[blood sports]], such as the infamous [[Gladiator]]ial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of [[Classical Antiquity]]\u2014such as [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], [[discus]] and [[javelin]].\nThe sport of [[bullfighting]] is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric [[bull worship]] and [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and is often linked to [[Roman Empire|Rome]], where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.\n\n[[Jousting]] and hunting were popular sports in the Western Europe of the [[Middle Ages]], and the aristocratic classes of Europe developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of [[golf]] originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is [[James II of Scotland|James II]]'s banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning [[archery]]. The [[Industrial Revolution]] that began in Britain in the 18th Century brought increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of [[cricket]] was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the [[British Empire]]. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in Britain during the 19th Century and obtained global prominence\u2014these include [[ping pong]], modern [[tennis]], [[association football]], [[netball]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]].\n\nFootball (also known as [[soccer]]) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the ''world game''. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing nations, while victory in the [[Rugby World Cup]] has been shared among the Western states of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and England.\n\n[[Australian Rules Football]], an Australian variation of football with similarities to [[Gaelic football]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] evolved in the British [[colony of Victoria]] in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of [[baseball]] to America during the colonial period. The history of [[American football]] can be traced to early versions of rugby football and [[association football]]. Many games are known as \"football\" were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by [[Walter Camp]], the \"Father of American Football\". [[Basketball]] was invented in 1891 by [[James Naismith]], a Canadian physical education instructor working in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States.\n\n== Themes and traditions ==\n[[File:Anonymous Madonna with big breasts.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Madonna and Child]] painting by an anonymous Italian from the first half of the 19th century, oil on canvas.]]\nWestern culture has developed many themes and traditions, the most significant of which are:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n* Greco-Roman classic letters, arts, architecture, philosophical and cultural tradition, which include the influence of preeminent authors and philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Homer]], [[Virgil]], and [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]], as well as a long [[Greek mythology|mythologic tradition]].\n* [[Christianity|Christian]] ethical, philosophical, and [[Jewish mythology|mythological]] tradition, stemming largely from the [[Bible|Christian Bible]], particularly the [[New Testament]] Gospels.\n* Monasteries, [[schools]], [[libraries]], [[books]], book making, [[universities]], teaching, [[education]], and lecture halls.\n* A tradition of the importance of [[the rule of law]].\n* [[Secular humanism]], [[rationalism]] and Enlightenment thought. This set the basis for a new critical attitude and open questioning of religion, favouring [[freethinking]] and questioning of the church as an authority, which resulted in open-minded and reformist ideals inside, such as [[liberation theology]], which partly adopted these currents, and secular and political tendencies such as [[laicism]], [[agnosticism]] and [[atheism]].\n* Generalized usage of some form of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] or [[Greek alphabet]], and derived forms, such as [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], used by those southern and eastern Slavic countries of [[Eastern Christianity|Christian Orthodox]] tradition, historically under the [[Byzantine Empire]] and later within the Russian [[czarist]] or [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] area of influence. Other variants of the Latin or Greek alphabets are found in the [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] and [[Coptic alphabet]]s, which historically superseded older scripts, such as [[Runic|runes]], and the Egyptian [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and [[Hieroglyphic]] systems.\n* [[Natural law]], [[human rights]], [[constitutionalism]], [[parliamentarism]] (or [[presidentialism]]) and formal [[liberal democracy]] in recent times\u2014prior to the 19th century, most Western governments were still monarchies.\n* A large influence, in [[modern history|modern times]], of many of the ideals and values developed and inherited from [[Romanticism]].\n* An emphasis on, and use of, [[science]] as a means of understanding the natural world and humanity's place in it.\n* More pronounced use and application of innovation and scientific developments, as well as a more rational approach to scientific progress (what has been known as the [[scientific method]]), as opposed to more empiric discoveries in the [[Eastern world]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Society|Europe}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Atlanticism]]\n* [[Christendom]]\n* [[Classical tradition]]\n* [[Culture during the Cold War]]\n* [[Eastern world]]\n* [[Eastern culture]]\n* [[European diaspora]]\n* [[Greco-Roman world]]\n* [[Western religion]]\n* [[Western world]]\n* [[Westernization]]\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist |colwidth = 30em }}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{Cite book |last=Ankerl |first=Guy |title=Global communication wi5thout universal civilization |series=INU societal research |volume=Vol. 1: Coexisting contemporary civilizations: Arabo-Muslim, Bharati, Chinese, and Western |publisher=INU Press |location=Geneva |isbn=978-2-88155-004-1 |pages= |year=2000 |ref=harv}}\n* Barzun, Jacques ''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life 1500 to the Present'' HarperCollins (2000) {{ISBN|0-06-017586-9}}.\n* Daly, Jonathan. \"[http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-rise-of-western-power-9781441161314/ The Rise of Western Power: A Comparative History of Western Civilization]\" (London and New York: Bloomsbury, 2014). {{ISBN|978-1441161314}}.\n* Daly, Jonathan. \"[http://www.tandfindia.com/books/details/9781138774810/ Historians Debate the Rise of the West]\" (London and New York: Routledge, 2015). {{ISBN|978-1138774810}}.\n* Jones, Prudence and Pennick, Nigel ''A History of Pagan Europe'' Barnes & Noble (1995) {{ISBN|0-7607-1210-7}}.\n* Merriman, John ''Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Present'' W.
