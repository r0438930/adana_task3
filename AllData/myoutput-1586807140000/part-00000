The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as [[cornstarch]]. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing [[carbon dioxide]] gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus [[leavening agent|leavening]] the mixture.  The first single-acting baking powder was  developed by a Birmingham based food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in England in 1843.

Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called [[quick bread]]s.  The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n==Formulation and mechanism==\nBaking powder is made up of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], an [[acid]], and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\"/> \nMost commercially available baking powders are made up of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, also known as [[baking soda]] or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more [[acid salt]]s.<ref name=\"KO\"/>\n\n===Acid-base reactions===\nWhen combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous [[carbon dioxide]]. \nWhether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same.

Finally, the added bulk allows for more accurate measurements.<ref>{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=534 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &amp; Schuster | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA534#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Before baking powder===\nWhen Amelia Simmons published ''[[American Cookery]]'' (1792), the first American cookbook, the recipes she included used three possible types of leavening: [[baker's yeast]], emptins (from the leavings of [[brewer's yeast]]), and [[pearlash]]. \nAt that time, the mechanisms underlying the action of yeasts and other leavenings were not understood, and reliable commercial products were not available.  Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or \"emptins\" in their baking.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n  \nThe effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste.  Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and [[pound cake]]s. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts.  Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening.  Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\n===Pearlash===\nThe third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of [[potash]].  It was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make  [[lye]], and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain \"salts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nThe active ingredient in pearlash was [[potassium carbonate]] ([[potassium|K<sub>2</sub>]][[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like [[sour milk]] or [[lemon juice]] resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"FPF\">{{cite web |title=The History Dish: Pearlash, The First Chemical Leavening |url=http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/the-history-dish-pearlash-the-first-chemical-leavening/ |website=Four Pounds Flour |accessdate=11 January 2019|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\nOnce prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks' worth of bread at one time.  ''American Cookery'' was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last. With pearlash, cooks were able to create new recipes for new types of cakes, cookies, and biscuits that were quicker and easier to make than yeast-based recipes.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Martha C. |title=Of Pearl Ash, Emptins, And Tree Sweetnin' America's First Native Cookbook |journal=American Heritage |date=1981 |volume=32 |issue=5 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/pearl-ash-emptins-and-tree-sweetnin%E2%80%99 |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Stavely\">{{cite news |last1=Stavely |first1=Keith |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=Kathleen |title=What America\u2019s First Cookbook Says About Our Country and Its Cuisine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-americas-first-cookbook-says-about-our-country-its-cuisine-180967809/ |accessdate=24 January 2019 |work=Smithsonian magazine |date=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Longone\">{{cite web |last1=Longone |first1=Jan |title=Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project By Jan Longone, Curator of American Culinary History, Clements Library, University of Michigan |url=https://d.lib.msu.edu/fa/introduction |website=Clements Library, University of Michigan |accessdate=26 January 2019|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n===Experimentation===\nBetween the publication of ''American Cookery'' in 1796, and the mid-1800s, cooks experimented with a variety of acids, alkalis, and mineral salts as possible chemical leaveners.

[[Smelling salts]], [[hartshorn]], and [[sal volatile]] were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of [[ammonium carbonate]].  The term \"saleratus\" was  applied confusingly to both [[potassium bicarbonate]] and to [[sodium bicarbonate]] ([[sodium|Na]][[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], what we now call baking soda).<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}} Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|39}} [[Cream of tartar]], also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nIn 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher's cookbook ''Domestic Recipe Book'' (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar.  \nSeveral recipes in the compilation cookbook ''Practical American Cookery'' (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough.

In 1856, he was awarded a patent for \"pulverulent phosphoric acid,\" a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, [[monocalcium phosphate|monocalcium pyrophosphate]] provided a double-acting form of leavening.  Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced  dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nIn 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of [[Count Rumford]]. In 1861, Horsford published ''The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment'', describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or \"Bread preparation\" in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nHorsford's research was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using [[cornstarch]] as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford's leavening products were marketed originally as \"Horsford's Yeast Powder\" and later as \"Rumford Baking Powder\". They were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/> In 2006 the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, Rhode Island were designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in recognition of baking powder's impact in making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.<ref name=\"Landmark\">{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder: National Historic Chemical Landmark|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder.html |website=ACS Chemistry for Life|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, Horsford shared his formula for baking powder with his former teacher, Justus von Liebig, who in turn shared it with [[Ludwig Clamor Marquart]] and Carl Zimmer in Germany.

Calumet Baking Powder contained baking soda, a cornstarch buffer, [[sodium aluminum sulfate]] ({{chem|NaAl(SO|4|)|2|\u00b712H|2|O}}) as a leavening agent, and [[albumen]].<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|83\u201385}}  In 1899, after years of experimentation with various possible formulae beginning in the 1870s, [[Hulman & Company|Herman Hulman]] of [[Terre Haute]] also introduced a baking powder made with sodium aluminium sulfate. He called his baking powder  [[Clabber Girl|Clabber]], referencing a German baking tradition in which [[Clabber (food)|soured milk]] was used for leavening.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|92\u201395}}\n\n====Cream of tartar vs. alum====\nSodium aluminum sulfate baking powders were double-acting, and much less expensive to produce than cream of tartar-based baking powders. Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect.  As a result alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder's cream of tartar-based products.  William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminum-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in [[Missouri]] briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminum compounds from use in baking powders.  At the same time, he changed his own \"Dr. Price\" baking powder to an aluminum-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|97\u2013113}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=The Great Uprising: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-uprising-how-powder-revolutionized-baking-180963772/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that aluminum in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler's attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support.

They may now use combinations of acids, or different acids altogether.  Nonetheless,\nRumford Baking Power in the United States<ref name=\"CooksCountry\"/> and Magic Baking Powder in Canada continue to produce double-acting baking powders containing  monocalcium phosphate, baking soda, and cornstarch. \nAs of 2010, the two main baking powder companies in the United States were Clabber Girl and Calumet, both of which use sodium aluminum sulfate.  Calument held about 1/3 of the American baking powder market, with Clabber Girl dominating 2/3.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|187\u2013188}}\n\n== How much to use ==\n[[File:BakingPowderFoaming.jpg|thumb|125px|Effective baking powder foams when placed in hot water.]]\nGenerally, one [[teaspoon]] (5 g or 1/6 oz) of baking powder is used to [[leavening|raise]] a mixture of one [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (120&nbsp;g or 4oz) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder's additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[citrus]], or [[honey]]. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only \u00bd teaspoon of baking powder\u2014the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with \u00bc teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nHowever, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes [[deprotonate]] the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.\n\nMoisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nDifferent brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Cook's Country]]'', an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.<ref name=\"CooksCountry\">{{cite journal|last=Savoie|first=Lauren|year=2015|title=Taste Test: Baking Powder|journal=[[Cook's Country]]|issue=66|page=31|issn=1552-1990|ref=https://archive.org/details/Cooks_Country_January_2015/page/n31}}<!--=2015-11-21 --></ref>\n\n== Substituting in recipes ==\n\n===Substitute acids===\nAs described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders.

The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as [[cornstarch]]. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing [[carbon dioxide]] gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus [[leavening agent|leavening]] the mixture.  The first single-acting baking powder was  developed by a Birmingham based food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in England in 1843.

Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called [[quick bread]]s.  The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n==Formulation and mechanism==\nBaking powder is made up of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], an [[acid]], and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\"/> \nMost commercially available baking powders are made up of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, also known as [[baking soda]] or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more [[acid salt]]s.<ref name=\"KO\"/>\n\n===Acid-base reactions===\nWhen combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous [[carbon dioxide]]. \nWhether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same.

Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or \"emptins\" in their baking.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n  \nThe effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste.  Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and [[pound cake]]s. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts.  Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening.  Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\n===Pearlash===\nThe third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of [[potash]].  It was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make  [[lye]], and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain \"salts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nThe active ingredient in pearlash was [[potassium carbonate]] ([[potassium|K<sub>2</sub>]][[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like [[sour milk]] or [[lemon juice]] resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"FPF\">{{cite web |title=The History Dish: Pearlash, The First Chemical Leavening |url=http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/the-history-dish-pearlash-the-first-chemical-leavening/ |website=Four Pounds Flour |accessdate=11 January 2019|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\nOnce prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks' worth of bread at one time.  ''American Cookery'' was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last.

[[Smelling salts]], [[hartshorn]], and [[sal volatile]] were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of [[ammonium carbonate]].  The term \"saleratus\" was  applied confusingly to both [[potassium bicarbonate]] and to [[sodium bicarbonate]] ([[sodium|Na]][[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], what we now call baking soda).<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}} Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|39}} [[Cream of tartar]], also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nIn 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher's cookbook ''Domestic Recipe Book'' (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar.  \nSeveral recipes in the compilation cookbook ''Practical American Cookery'' (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough.

In 1856, he was awarded a patent for \"pulverulent phosphoric acid,\" a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, [[monocalcium phosphate|monocalcium pyrophosphate]] provided a double-acting form of leavening.  Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced  dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nIn 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of [[Count Rumford]]. In 1861, Horsford published ''The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment'', describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or \"Bread preparation\" in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nHorsford's research was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using [[cornstarch]] as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford's leavening products were marketed originally as \"Horsford's Yeast Powder\" and later as \"Rumford Baking Powder\". They were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/> In 2006 the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, Rhode Island were designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in recognition of baking powder's impact in making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.<ref name=\"Landmark\">{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder: National Historic Chemical Landmark|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder.html |website=ACS Chemistry for Life|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, Horsford shared his formula for baking powder with his former teacher, Justus von Liebig, who in turn shared it with [[Ludwig Clamor Marquart]] and Carl Zimmer in Germany. Baking powders based on Horsford's formula were sold in England as \"Horsford-Liebig Baking Powder\". They were also sold by several companies in Germany, beginning with Marquart and with Zimmer. However, baking powder was not successful in Germany at that time. Much of German baking occurred in guild-based bakeries, rather than in private homes, and the guilds were not interested in replacing centuries-old craft skills with a new technology.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|33\u201344}}<ref name=\"Jones\"/> Nonetheless, Liebig clearly saw the importance of Horsford's work, stating:\n\n{{quote|The preparation of baking powder by Professor Horsford in Cambridge in North America, I consider one of the most important and beneficial discoveries that has been made in the last decade.|[[Justus von Liebig]]<ref name=\"Jones\"/>{{rp|73}}}}\n\n====Dr. Oetker's Baking Powder====\n[[Image:X014.jpg|thumb|right|German advertisement for Dr.&nbsp;Oetker's baking powder in 1903.]]\nIn the 1890s, the German pharmacist [[August Oetker]] began to market a baking powder directly to housewives.

Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect.  As a result alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder's cream of tartar-based products.  William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminum-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in [[Missouri]] briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminum compounds from use in baking powders.  At the same time, he changed his own \"Dr. Price\" baking powder to an aluminum-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|97\u2013113}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=The Great Uprising: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-uprising-how-powder-revolutionized-baking-180963772/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that aluminum in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler's attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support.

High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[citrus]], or [[honey]]. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only \u00bd teaspoon of baking powder\u2014the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with \u00bc teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nHowever, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes [[deprotonate]] the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.\n\nMoisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nDifferent brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Cook's Country]]'', an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.<ref name=\"CooksCountry\">{{cite journal|last=Savoie|first=Lauren|year=2015|title=Taste Test: Baking Powder|journal=[[Cook's Country]]|issue=66|page=31|issn=1552-1990|ref=https://archive.org/details/Cooks_Country_January_2015/page/n31}}<!--=2015-11-21 --></ref>\n\n== Substituting in recipes ==\n\n===Substitute acids===\nAs described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders. [[Vinegar]] (dilute acetic acid), especially white vinegar, is also a common acidifier in baking; for example, many heirloom chocolate cake recipes call for a tablespoon or two of vinegar.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Chocolate Cake with Vinegar \u2013 Antique Recipe Still Very Good | date= | publisher= | url=http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,176,151187-238193,00.html | work =Cooks.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-06-12 }}</ref> Where a recipe already uses [[buttermilk]] or [[yogurt]], baking soda can be used without cream of tartar (or with less). Alternatively, lemon juice can be substituted for some of the liquid in the recipe, to provide the required acidity to activate the baking soda. The main variable with the use of these kitchen acids is the rate of leavening.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bakewell Cream]]\n* [[Calumet Baking Powder Company]]\n* [[Clabber Girl]]\n* [[Dr. Oetker]]\n* [[Irish soda bread]]\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Linda Civitello, ''Baking Powder Wars: The Cutthroat Food Fight that Revolutionized Cooking.''
