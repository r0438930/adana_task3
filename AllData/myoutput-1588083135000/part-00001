Trade'''), formerly the '''United States Customs Court''', and before that the '''Board of General Appraisers''', is an [[Article III court]], with full powers in law and [[Equity (law)|equity]]. The Customs Court Act of 1980 replaced the old United States Customs Court with the United States Court of International Trade. The court has nine sitting judges, as well as senior judges. The court sits in New York City, although it is authorized to sit elsewhere, including in foreign nations.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1890, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation creating the Board of General Appraisers, a quasi-judicial administrative unit within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. The Board had nine members appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and empowered to review decisions of United States Customs officials concerning the amount of duties to be paid on importations.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/AboutTheCourt.html#history History of the United States Court of International Trade].</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Congress responded to the increasing number and complexity of customs cases by replacing the Board of General Appraisers with the United States Customs Court, an independent [[Article I tribunal]], retaining the jurisdiction and powers of the Board of General Appraisers. In 1928, the United States Customs Court became the first federal tribunal in the United States to have a woman judge,<ref>Jo Freeman, ''A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics'', 2002: Rowman and Littlefield, p. 216 ({{ISBN|084769805X}})</ref> when President [[Calvin Coolidge]] nominated [[Genevieve R. Cline]] to the court.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,787204,00.html \"The Coolidge Week\", ''Time'', May 14, 1928]</ref> Although many members of the [[United States Senate]] objected to Cline's appointment, both because of her sex, and because they believed she was self-taught and had no judicial experience, her supporters advocated strongly for her, including Katherine Pike, president of the National Association of Women Lawyers and a number of club-women. Cline won U.S. Senate confirmation on May 25, 1928, received her commission on May 26, 1928, and took her oath of office in the Cleveland Federal Building on June 5, 1928.<ref>William Ganson Rose, ''Cleveland: the Making of a City'', 1990: Kent State Univ. Press, p. 854 ({{ISBN|0873384288}})</ref>\n\nOn July 14, 1956, Congress made the United States Customs Court an [[Article III tribunal]], again without changing its jurisdiction, powers, or procedures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/courts/u.s.-customs-court-legislative-history|title=U.S. Customs Court: Legislative History \u2013 Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}</ref> After making some procedural changes in the Customs Courts Act of 1970, Congress addressed substantive issues concerning the court's jurisdiction and remedial powers in the Customs Courts Act of 1980, which broadened the power of the court and renamed it the United States Court of International Trade.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n==Courthouse== <!--this header anchored from James L. Watson Court of International Trade Building redirect -->\n[[File:United States Court of International Trade (48126614652).jpg|thumb|right|The James L. Watson Court of International Trade Building on Foley Square]]\nThe '''James L. Watson Court of International Trade Building''', located on [[Foley Square]] in [[lower Manhattan]] in New York City, houses the court.  Also known as 1 Federal Plaza, it was built in 1968 adjacent to the [[Jacob K. Javits Federal Building]].<ref>Casey Nelson Blake, \"Tilted Arc, and the Crisis of Public Art\" in ''The Power of Culture: Critical Essays in American History'' (eds. Richard Wightman Fox & T. J. Jackson Lears), pp. 260\u201361, 278.</ref> In 2003, the building was named in honor of [[James Lopez Watson|James L. Watson]], a judge of the United States Customs Court from 1964 to 1980, and of the Court of International Trade from 1980 to 2001.<ref>[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ70/html/PLAW-108publ70.htm Public Law 108-70], [[108th United States Congress]].</ref>\n\n== Jurisdiction ==\n\nThe court possesses limited [[subject matter jurisdiction]], meaning that it may hear only cases involving particular [[international trade]] and customs law questions. For example, the court hears disputes such as those involving protests filed with [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], decisions regarding [[Trade Adjustment Assistance]] by the [[United States Department of Labor]] or [[United States Department of Agriculture]], customs broker licensing, and disputes relating to determinations made by the [[United States International Trade Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]'s [[International Trade Administration]] regarding [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]] and [[countervailing duties]].\n\nThere is one notable exception to the court's jurisdiction. In cases involving antidumping and countervailing duties imposed on Canadian or Mexican merchandise, an interested party can request that the case be heard before a special ''ad hoc'' binational panel organized under Chapter 19 of the 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].\n\n== Procedure ==\n\nMost cases are heard by a single judge. If a case challenges the constitutionality of a U.S. law or has important implications regarding the administration or interpretation of the customs laws, then it may be heard by a three-judge panel. Many Judges of the Court of International Trade also regularly sit [[by designation]] on three-judge panels of the [[United States courts of appeals]].\n\nAlthough the Court maintains its own rules of procedure, they are patterned for the most part on the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. The court has held that decisions interpreting the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are \"instructive\" in interpreting its own rules.\n\n== Current composition of the court ==\n{{As of|2019|12|18|df=US}}:\n{{start U.S. judgeship Current}}\n{{U.S. judgeship row Current\n| index        = 22\n| title        = Chief Judge\n| name         = [[Timothy C.

Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the court judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. A vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position.\n\nUnder the Board of General Appraisers, the position of Chief Judge was entitled \"President\". When the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire on what has since 1958 been known as senior status or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old. The current rules have been in operation since October 1, 1982.\n\n== Succession of seats ==\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{start U.S. judge succession\n| seat title = Seat 1\n}}\n{{U.S. judge succession note\n| text = Seat established on June 10, 1890 by 26&nbsp;Stat.&nbsp;131, 136\n}}\n{{U.S. judge succession row\n| name = [[Charles H.

Trade'''), formerly the '''United States Customs Court''', and before that the '''Board of General Appraisers''', is an [[Article III court]], with full powers in law and [[Equity (law)|equity]]. The Customs Court Act of 1980 replaced the old United States Customs Court with the United States Court of International Trade. The court has nine sitting judges, as well as senior judges. The court sits in New York City, although it is authorized to sit elsewhere, including in foreign nations.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1890, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation creating the Board of General Appraisers, a quasi-judicial administrative unit within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. The Board had nine members appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and empowered to review decisions of United States Customs officials concerning the amount of duties to be paid on importations.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/AboutTheCourt.html#history History of the United States Court of International Trade].</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Congress responded to the increasing number and complexity of customs cases by replacing the Board of General Appraisers with the United States Customs Court, an independent [[Article I tribunal]], retaining the jurisdiction and powers of the Board of General Appraisers. In 1928, the United States Customs Court became the first federal tribunal in the United States to have a woman judge,<ref>Jo Freeman, ''A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics'', 2002: Rowman and Littlefield, p. 216 ({{ISBN|084769805X}})</ref> when President [[Calvin Coolidge]] nominated [[Genevieve R. Cline]] to the court.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,787204,00.html \"The Coolidge Week\", ''Time'', May 14, 1928]</ref> Although many members of the [[United States Senate]] objected to Cline's appointment, both because of her sex, and because they believed she was self-taught and had no judicial experience, her supporters advocated strongly for her, including Katherine Pike, president of the National Association of Women Lawyers and a number of club-women. Cline won U.S. Senate confirmation on May 25, 1928, received her commission on May 26, 1928, and took her oath of office in the Cleveland Federal Building on June 5, 1928.<ref>William Ganson Rose, ''Cleveland: the Making of a City'', 1990: Kent State Univ. Press, p. 854 ({{ISBN|0873384288}})</ref>\n\nOn July 14, 1956, Congress made the United States Customs Court an [[Article III tribunal]], again without changing its jurisdiction, powers, or procedures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/courts/u.s.-customs-court-legislative-history|title=U.S. Customs Court: Legislative History \u2013 Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}</ref> After making some procedural changes in the Customs Courts Act of 1970, Congress addressed substantive issues concerning the court's jurisdiction and remedial powers in the Customs Courts Act of 1980, which broadened the power of the court and renamed it the United States Court of International Trade.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n==Courthouse== <!--this header anchored from James L. Watson Court of International Trade Building redirect -->\n[[File:United States Court of International Trade (48126614652).jpg|thumb|right|The James L. Watson Court of International Trade Building on Foley Square]]\nThe '''James L. Watson Court of International Trade Building''', located on [[Foley Square]] in [[lower Manhattan]] in New York City, houses the court.  Also known as 1 Federal Plaza, it was built in 1968 adjacent to the [[Jacob K. Javits Federal Building]].<ref>Casey Nelson Blake, \"Tilted Arc, and the Crisis of Public Art\" in ''The Power of Culture: Critical Essays in American History'' (eds. Richard Wightman Fox & T. J. Jackson Lears), pp. 260\u201361, 278.</ref> In 2003, the building was named in honor of [[James Lopez Watson|James L. Watson]], a judge of the United States Customs Court from 1964 to 1980, and of the Court of International Trade from 1980 to 2001.<ref>[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ70/html/PLAW-108publ70.htm Public Law 108-70], [[108th United States Congress]].</ref>\n\n== Jurisdiction ==\n\nThe court possesses limited [[subject matter jurisdiction]], meaning that it may hear only cases involving particular [[international trade]] and customs law questions. For example, the court hears disputes such as those involving protests filed with [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], decisions regarding [[Trade Adjustment Assistance]] by the [[United States Department of Labor]] or [[United States Department of Agriculture]], customs broker licensing, and disputes relating to determinations made by the [[United States International Trade Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]'s [[International Trade Administration]] regarding [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]] and [[countervailing duties]].\n\nThere is one notable exception to the court's jurisdiction. In cases involving antidumping and countervailing duties imposed on Canadian or Mexican merchandise, an interested party can request that the case be heard before a special ''ad hoc'' binational panel organized under Chapter 19 of the 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].\n\n== Procedure ==\n\nMost cases are heard by a single judge. If a case challenges the constitutionality of a U.S. law or has important implications regarding the administration or interpretation of the customs laws, then it may be heard by a three-judge panel. Many Judges of the Court of International Trade also regularly sit [[by designation]] on three-judge panels of the [[United States courts of appeals]].\n\nAlthough the Court maintains its own rules of procedure, they are patterned for the most part on the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. The court has held that decisions interpreting the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are \"instructive\" in interpreting its own rules.\n\n== Current composition of the court ==\n{{As of|2019|12|18|df=US}}:\n{{start U.S. judgeship Current}}\n{{U.S. judgeship row Current\n| index        = 22\n| title        = Chief Judge\n| name         = [[Timothy C.

Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the court judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. A vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position.\n\nUnder the Board of General Appraisers, the position of Chief Judge was entitled \"President\". When the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire on what has since 1958 been known as senior status or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old. The current rules have been in operation since October 1, 1982.\n\n== Succession of seats ==\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{start U.S. judge succession\n| seat title = Seat 1\n}}\n{{U.S. judge succession note\n| text = Seat established on June 10, 1890 by 26&nbsp;Stat.&nbsp;131, 136\n}}\n{{U.S. judge succession row\n| name = [[Charles H.
