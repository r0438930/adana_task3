There is no defined line between spiritual dolls and toys. In some cultures dolls that had been used in rituals were given to children. They were also used in children's education and as carriers of cultural heritage. In other cultures dolls were considered too laden with magical powers to allow children to play with them.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1973|pp=4\u20137 }}</ref>\n\n[[African dolls]] are used to teach and entertain; they are supernatural intermediaries, and they are manipulated for ritual purposes. Their shape and costume vary according to region and custom. Dolls are frequently handed down from mother to daughter. ''[[Akuaba]]'' are wooden ritual [[fertility]] dolls from [[Ghana]] and nearby areas. The best known ''akuaba'' are those of the [[Ashanti people]], whose ''akuaba'' have large, disc-like heads. Other tribes in the region have their own distinctive style of ''akuaba''.\n[[File:Hinadolls.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese traditional dolls|Japanese]] hina dolls, displayed during the [[Hinamatsuri]] festival]]\nThere is a rich history of [[Japanese dolls]] dating back to the [[Dog\u016b]] figures (8000\u2013200&nbsp;BCE). and [[Haniwa]] funerary figures (300\u2013600 AD). By the eleventh century, dolls were used as playthings as well as for protection and in religious ceremonies. During [[Hinamatsuri]], the doll festival, hina dolls are displayed. These are made of straw and wood, painted, and dressed in elaborate, many-layered textiles. [[Daruma doll]]s are spherical dolls with red bodies and white faces without pupils. They represent [[Bodhidharma]], the East Indian who founded [[Zen]], and are used as good luck charms. Wooden [[Kokeshi]] dolls have no arms or legs, but a large head and cylindrical body, representing little girls.\n\nThe use of an [[effigy]] to perform a spell on someone is documented in African, Native American, and European cultures. Examples of such magical devices include the European [[poppet]] and the ''[[nkisi]]'' or ''bocio'' of West and Central Africa. In European [[folk religion|folk]] [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]], poppet dolls are used to represent a person for casting spells on that person. The intention is that whatever actions are performed upon the effigy will be transferred to the subject through [[sympathetic magic]]. The practice of sticking pins in ''[[voodoo doll]]s'' have been associated with [[African-American]] [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] folk magic. Voodoo dolls are not a feature of [[Haitian Vodou]] religion, but have been portrayed as such in popular culture, and stereotypical voodoo dolls are sold to tourists in Haiti. Likely the voodoo doll concept in popular culture is influenced by the European poppet.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Divination|episodelink= List_of_QI_episodes_%28D_series%29#Episode_10_.22Divination.22|series= QI|serieslink= QI|credits= [[Stephen Fry]] (presenter), [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] (creator), [[Ian Lorimer]] (director)|network= [[BBC]]|season= [[List of QI episodes (D series)|D]]|number= 10}}</ref> A [[kitchen witch]] is a poppet originating in Northern Europe.

[[Inuit doll]]s are made out of [[soapstone]] and [[bone]], materials common to the [[Inuit]] people. Many are clothed with animal [[fur]] or skin.

There is no defined line between spiritual dolls and toys. In some cultures dolls that had been used in rituals were given to children. They were also used in children's education and as carriers of cultural heritage. In other cultures dolls were considered too laden with magical powers to allow children to play with them.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1973|pp=4\u20137 }}</ref>\n\n[[African dolls]] are used to teach and entertain; they are supernatural intermediaries, and they are manipulated for ritual purposes. Their shape and costume vary according to region and custom. Dolls are frequently handed down from mother to daughter. ''[[Akuaba]]'' are wooden ritual [[fertility]] dolls from [[Ghana]] and nearby areas. The best known ''akuaba'' are those of the [[Ashanti people]], whose ''akuaba'' have large, disc-like heads. Other tribes in the region have their own distinctive style of ''akuaba''.\n[[File:Hinadolls.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese traditional dolls|Japanese]] hina dolls, displayed during the [[Hinamatsuri]] festival]]\nThere is a rich history of [[Japanese dolls]] dating back to the [[Dog\u016b]] figures (8000\u2013200&nbsp;BCE). and [[Haniwa]] funerary figures (300\u2013600 AD). By the eleventh century, dolls were used as playthings as well as for protection and in religious ceremonies. During [[Hinamatsuri]], the doll festival, hina dolls are displayed. These are made of straw and wood, painted, and dressed in elaborate, many-layered textiles. [[Daruma doll]]s are spherical dolls with red bodies and white faces without pupils. They represent [[Bodhidharma]], the East Indian who founded [[Zen]], and are used as good luck charms. Wooden [[Kokeshi]] dolls have no arms or legs, but a large head and cylindrical body, representing little girls.\n\nThe use of an [[effigy]] to perform a spell on someone is documented in African, Native American, and European cultures. Examples of such magical devices include the European [[poppet]] and the ''[[nkisi]]'' or ''bocio'' of West and Central Africa. In European [[folk religion|folk]] [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]], poppet dolls are used to represent a person for casting spells on that person. The intention is that whatever actions are performed upon the effigy will be transferred to the subject through [[sympathetic magic]].
