[[Jimmy Sangster]] adapted the screenplay from the play ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]], which had been [[The Man in Half Moon Street|previously filmed in 1945]]. ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was produced by [[Michael Carreras]] and [[Anthony Nelson Keys]] for [[Hammer Film Productions]]. It was released in the US on 19 August 1959 and in the UK on 30 November 1959.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nParis, 1890. Dr Georges Bonnet (Diffring), MD and sculptor, harbours an unusual secret. Although he appears to be in his mid-30s, he is actually 104-years-old, and has kept his youth and vitality through [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] gland transplants every 10 years. But things are going wrong. Prof Ludwig Weiss ([[Arnold Marl\u00e9]]) of Vienna, co-discoverer of the anti-ageing process, is three weeks late in arriving at Georges' home to perform the latest transplant. As such, Georges must drink a steaming green liquid to stay young. When Georges' latest model, Margo Philippe ([[Delphi Lawrence]]), comes across Georges swilling the fluid, he strikes her down. \n\nGeorges has invited a number of people to a reception at which he will unveil his bust of Margo, including Janine Dubois (Court), his former lover, and Dr Pierre Girard (Lee), Janine's current companion. When the 89-year-old Ludwig later arrives, it is quite apparent he will be unable to operate on Georges because a stroke has incapacitated his right hand. Ludwig tells Georges they must find another surgeon.\n\nGeorges and Ludwig invite Janine and Pierre to dinner. In private, Ludwig convinces Pierre to perform the transplant. However, Janine is still in love with Georges, and when he mysteriously says he must soon leave Paris so he can 'lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond', Janine asks to accompany him. As the dinner party ends, [[National Police (France)|Sur\u00e9t\u00e9]] Inspector LeGris ([[Francis de Wolff|Francis De Wolff]]) arrives. He is investigating Margo's disappearance. Georges denies knowing her whereabouts and, when LeGris asks to see the bust of Margo, he tells him that he accidentally destroyed it. LeGris leaves and Georges admits to his startled guests that he lied but says the police would probably damage the bust if he turned it over to them.\n\nAfter Janine and Pierre have left, Ludwig tells Georges that Pierre will operate. But Ludwig has grown suspicious of Georges and says it is strange that Georges' models have gone missing right after Georges' transplants. Ludwig also tells him that after examining the newest parathyroid gland, he can tell Georges has harvested it from a living person, instead of it being 'revitalised' from a corpse. When Ludwig tells him that his actions are unjustified, Georges says sadly that he's done what he's done because he has been left 'utterly alone - again and again' and is tired of having to start a new life every decade. Georges horrifies Ludwig by saying he wants to end his loneliness by having Janine with him forever. The men argue violently, and Georges strangles Ludwig to death.\n\nPierre arrives the following morning to perform the operation, but Georges tells him that Ludwig was unexpectedly called back to Vienna. Pierre refuses to carry on and suggests that Georges find another surgeon. But Georges can find no one who is willing or able,\n\nLeGris tells Pierre of the disappearances of three young women at 10 year intervals - in London, San Francisco and Bern, Switzerland - and that each modelled for a sculptor who was an MD and who went missing at the same time. With Margo also missing, LeGris believes Georges is responsible for all the disappearances.\n\nGeorges takes Janine to a storeroom which holds his sculptures. He proudly shows her the first figurine he made as a boy. The figurine is dated 1798.  Janine laughingly says the date must be incorrect because if it weren't, Georges would be 104. Georges abruptly leaves, locking Janine in the storeroom.\n\nGeorges tells Pierre that he and Ludwig discovered the secret of 'perpetual life' decades earlier. But he can't reveal the secret to the world because if everyone could live forever, paradoxically, everyone would die as there would be no supply of parathyroid glands to keep them alive. Pierre again refuses to perform the transplant, calling it 'an offence against nature [and] and offence against God'. But he relents when Georges threatens Janine's life.\n\nJanine finds a now-mad Margo imprisoned in the storeroom. Meanwhile, Pierre fakes the operation - making the incision at Georges' waist but not transplanting the gland. Georges rushes to the storeroom, and as Pierre and LeGris follow, Georges tells Janine that the same operation will allow her to live forever, always young and beautiful and in love. She refuses.\n\nSuddenly, Georges begins ageing rapidly and realises that Pierre didn't actually perform the operation. As he exclaims he's dying, Margo, laughing dementedly, throws an oil lamp on him, setting him and the storeroom afire. Pierre and LeGris rescue Janine. Georges and Margo die in the flames. \n\n== Cast ==\n''Credited:''\n\n* [[Anton Diffring]] as Dr. Georges Bonnet\n* [[Hazel Court]] as Janine Dubois\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Dr. Pierre Gerard\n* [[Arnold Marl\u00e9]] as Prof. Ludwig Weiss\n* [[Delphi Lawrence]] as Margo Phillipe\n\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] as Insp.

Film scholar Chris Fellner quotes several: the 20 June 1959 issue of ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' says that the movie's 'chief drawback' is 'that it is given more to talk than to movement'; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<nowiki/>'s issue of 24 June 1959 calls it 'well acted and intelligently conceived. But invention and embellishment in this field appear to have been exhausted'; and the ''[[Motion Picture Exhibitor]]'' issue of 1 July 1959 describes ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' as suffering from 'relying mainly on talk'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe film is referred to by journalist Howard Maxford as a 'commercial and artistic disaster' and a 'bog standard surgical thriller' that is 'by no means a Hammer classic'. He calls Terence Fisher's direction 'curiously unambitious', characterised by 'many scenes filmed in lengthy, static takes, almost as if from the stalls of a theatre'. Maxford also dislikes the 'Bright, bland lighting' and 'garish Technicolor film stock' which together 'make for some visually tedious and unattractive images'.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn the other hand, film scholar Phil Hardy writes that visually the film 'looks like one of Hammer's more lavish productions', although it is a 'minor item' in Fisher's work. He describes the movie as having a 'perfunctory script', which makes it a 'rather awkward variation on the [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]] motif'.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Hardy, ed.|first=Phil|title=The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies|publisher=Harper & Row, Publishers|year=1986|isbn=0060550503|location=NY|pages=115}}</ref>\n\nIn the 'Hazel Court' chapter of ''Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors'', author Calvin Thomas Beck praises the performances of the three main actors. He writes that Diffring shows 'unique and excellent villainy' and is a 'magnificent heavy who has been shamefully neglected by filmmakers'. Court, he writes, is a 'fine, striking actress at all times' who 'screams and cringes properly' during the movie. He calls ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' one of her 'finest British thrillers'. Beck also notes that Lee 'unexpectedly reversed his monster-villain image' in the film.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Calvin Thomas|title=Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc.|year=1978|isbn=0025081705|location=NY|pages=280-281}}</ref>\n\nAuthor 'Bobb' Carter agrees with Beck's view of Court's performance. Carter calls it 'on the whole (...) a solid, impassioned performance that makes it a shame that this was her last role for Hammer', even though her character, Janine, has the 'distressing trait of not being able to smell something fishy even if there was a whale in the room'.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOther critics disagree about the quality of the acting in the film. Maxford calls Diffring's performance 'cold-eyed' and suggests that 'audiences were more used to seeing [him] playing ruthless Nazis',<ref name=\":0\" /> while Hardy says that 'Lee simply walks through his part'.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Novelisation ==\nThe screenplay of ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was rewritten as an inexpensive paperback novel in 1959. It was published in the US by [[Avon Books]] and sold for 35\u00a2, with the authors named as 'Barre' Lyndon and Jimmy Sangster. In the UK, where the book sold for 2/6, [[Ace Books]] listed the author as John Sansom, the pen name of Sangster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Man-Who-Could-Cheat-Death-Lyndon-Barre/10079019346/bd#&grid=1&pid=1|title=The Man Who Could Cheat Death|last=|first=|date=|website=Abe Books|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book |last=Hallenbeck |first=Bruce G. |title=British Cult Cinema: Hammer Fantasy and Sci-Fi |publisher=Hemlock Books |year=2011 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Hearn |first1=Marcus |last2=Barnes |first2=Alan |title=The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films |chapter=The Man Who Could Cheat Death |publisher=Titan Books |date=September 2007 |edition=limited |ref=harv |isbn=1 84576 185 5}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0053041}}\n* {{tcmdb title|82724}}\n\n{{Terence Fisher}}\n{{Jimmy Sangster}}\n{{HammerHorror}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Man Who Could Cheat Death, The}}\n[[Category:1959 films]]\n[[Category:1959 horror films]]\n[[Category:1950s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Terence Fisher]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1890s]]\n[[Category:British remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:Hammer Film Productions horror films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jimmy Sangster]]\n\n{{1950s-UK-film-stub}}\n{{1950s-horror-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2014}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Man Who Could Cheat Death\n| image          = ManWhoCouldCheatDeathPoster.jpg\n| alt            =\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Terence Fisher]]\n| producer       = [[Michael Carreras]]<br>[[Anthony Nelson Keys|Anthony Nelson-Keys]]\n| screenplay     = [[Jimmy Sangster]]\n| based on       = ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]]\n| starring       = [[Anton Diffring]]<br>[[Hazel Court]]<br>[[Christopher Lee]]\n| music          = [[Richard Rodney Bennett|Richard Bennett]]\n| cinematography = [[Jack Asher]]\n| editing        = John Dunsford\n| studio         = [[Hammer Film Productions]]\n| distributor    = Paramount British Pictures <small>(UK)</small><br>[[Paramount Pictures]] <small>(US)</small>\n| released       = {{fim date|df=y|1959|11|30}}\n| runtime        = 83 min.\n| country        = England\n| language       = English\n| budget         = [[Pound sterling|GBP]] \u00a384,000\n}}\n\n'''''The Man Who Could Cheat Death''''' is a 1959 British [[horror film|horror]] film, directed by [[Terence Fisher]] and starring [[Anton Diffring]], [[Hazel Court]] and [[Christopher Lee]].

The X-cert meant that the film could only be exhibited to people age 16 or older.

It went into general release in the UK on 30 November 1959 as the first film on a double bill with ''[[The Evil That is Eve]]'' (1957). However, the movie was in general release earlier in the US, where it opened on 19 August 1959.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe film was still being shown in US movie theatres into the 1960s. For example, it was the second film in a triple feature - between ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1958) and ''Maracaibo'' (1959) - at the Mt Lebanon Drive-In in Lebanon PA on 19 July 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oberver-reporter.com/blogs/driveintimemachine/witches-werewolves-and-a-weasel-at-local-drive-ins-in-the-past/article_0f171790-8aa9-11e8-b0a5-7357ac34e9fc.html|title=Witches, werewolves and a weasel at local drive-ins in the past|last=Channell|first=Justin|date=23 July 2018|website=The Washington PA Observer-Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref> Two years later, the movie continued to be at the bottom of a double bill. On 7 May 1965, it ran as the second film to [[Dr. Terror's House of Horrors|''Dr. Terror's House of Horrors'']] (1965) at three theatres in San Francisco - the New Mission Theatre, the El Rancho Drive-In and the Esquire Theatre - as well as at theatres in the surrounding [[East Bay]] communities of Oakland, Fremont, Hayward and San Leandro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32934619/dr-terrors-house-of-horrosthe/|title=The San Francisco Examiner advertisement|last=Clipped by|first=rivamarsh|date=16 June 2019|website=Newspapers.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor home viewing in the UK, the video was given a 12 certificate by the BBFC on 28 August 2015 for 'limited' but 'moderate injury detail', which includes scarred faces, rapid ageing, strangulation and death by fire.<ref name=\":2\" /> The first US release of a video of the film was on 21 October 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/82724/Man-Who-Could-Cheat-Death-The/misc-notes.html|title=Man Who Could Cheat Death, The (1959)|last=|first=|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies Data Base|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n''The'' ''Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films'' calls the film an \"odd mish-mash of mad scientist sci-fi flick and gothic flannel\" that \"suffers from an excess of dialogue and a lack of action.\"{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=41}} \n\nThis assessment is reflected in other contemporary reviews. Film scholar Chris Fellner quotes several: the 20 June 1959 issue of ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' says that the movie's 'chief drawback' is 'that it is given more to talk than to movement'; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<nowiki/>'s issue of 24 June 1959 calls it 'well acted and intelligently conceived. But invention and embellishment in this field appear to have been exhausted'; and the ''[[Motion Picture Exhibitor]]'' issue of 1 July 1959 describes ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' as suffering from 'relying mainly on talk'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe film is referred to by journalist Howard Maxford as a 'commercial and artistic disaster' and a 'bog standard surgical thriller' that is 'by no means a Hammer classic'. He calls Terence Fisher's direction 'curiously unambitious', characterised by 'many scenes filmed in lengthy, static takes, almost as if from the stalls of a theatre'. Maxford also dislikes the 'Bright, bland lighting' and 'garish Technicolor film stock' which together 'make for some visually tedious and unattractive images'.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn the other hand, film scholar Phil Hardy writes that visually the film 'looks like one of Hammer's more lavish productions', although it is a 'minor item' in Fisher's work. He describes the movie as having a 'perfunctory script', which makes it a 'rather awkward variation on the [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]] motif'.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Hardy, ed.|first=Phil|title=The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies|publisher=Harper & Row, Publishers|year=1986|isbn=0060550503|location=NY|pages=115}}</ref>\n\nIn the 'Hazel Court' chapter of ''Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors'', author Calvin Thomas Beck praises the performances of the three main actors. He writes that Diffring shows 'unique and excellent villainy' and is a 'magnificent heavy who has been shamefully neglected by filmmakers'. Court, he writes, is a 'fine, striking actress at all times' who 'screams and cringes properly' during the movie. He calls ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' one of her 'finest British thrillers'. Beck also notes that Lee 'unexpectedly reversed his monster-villain image' in the film.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Calvin Thomas|title=Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc.|year=1978|isbn=0025081705|location=NY|pages=280-281}}</ref>\n\nAuthor 'Bobb' Carter agrees with Beck's view of Court's performance. Carter calls it 'on the whole (...) a solid, impassioned performance that makes it a shame that this was her last role for Hammer', even though her character, Janine, has the 'distressing trait of not being able to smell something fishy even if there was a whale in the room'.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOther critics disagree about the quality of the acting in the film. Maxford calls Diffring's performance 'cold-eyed' and suggests that 'audiences were more used to seeing [him] playing ruthless Nazis',<ref name=\":0\" /> while Hardy says that 'Lee simply walks through his part'.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Novelisation ==\nThe screenplay of ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was rewritten as an inexpensive paperback novel in 1959. It was published in the US by [[Avon Books]] and sold for 35\u00a2, with the authors named as 'Barre' Lyndon and Jimmy Sangster. In the UK, where the book sold for 2/6, [[Ace Books]] listed the author as John Sansom, the pen name of Sangster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Man-Who-Could-Cheat-Death-Lyndon-Barre/10079019346/bd#&grid=1&pid=1|title=The Man Who Could Cheat Death|last=|first=|date=|website=Abe Books|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book |last=Hallenbeck |first=Bruce G. |title=British Cult Cinema: Hammer Fantasy and Sci-Fi |publisher=Hemlock Books |year=2011 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Hearn |first1=Marcus |last2=Barnes |first2=Alan |title=The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films |chapter=The Man Who Could Cheat Death |publisher=Titan Books |date=September 2007 |edition=limited |ref=harv |isbn=1 84576 185 5}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0053041}}\n* {{tcmdb title|82724}}\n\n{{Terence Fisher}}\n{{Jimmy Sangster}}\n{{HammerHorror}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Man Who Could Cheat Death, The}}\n[[Category:1959 films]]\n[[Category:1959 horror films]]\n[[Category:1950s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Terence Fisher]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1890s]]\n[[Category:British remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:Hammer Film Productions horror films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jimmy Sangster]]\n\n{{1950s-UK-film-stub}}\n{{1950s-horror-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Mister.bingham", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProduction:Noted Michael Ripper scene being cut.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Could_Cheat_Death"}
