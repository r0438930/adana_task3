{"title_page": "1913 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1913 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the 5th season of the Auckland Rugby league. It followed the [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season]].\n\nThe first grade competition began on 3 May with the same 6 teams that had competed in the 1912 season, however [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] pulled out of the competition midway through the season as they struggled to put a full team on the field. The Eden Ramblers also pulled out at the same time. [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned champions for the first time.\n\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]] now known as the Northcote Tigers, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie Wanderers]], who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n\n===Charles Savory Controversy===\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, [[Charles Savory]] was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an [[Auckland Rugby League]] official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]] chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and [[Morgan Hayward]] chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Football Resentment/League Selector Replaced/\"Savory Shall Not Play\"\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=199\n| date = 1913-08-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130821.2.87\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Death of a Player===\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was killed. The death occurred at Ellerslie. He was said to have collided with an opposing player and the two of them fell to the ground with a third player falling on top of them. The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie. He was unable to be revived and died at 8.30am the following morning.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Footballers Death/Spinal Cord Fractured/Accident at Ellerslie\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=124\n| date = 1913-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130526.2.59\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref> After the incident the deceased father said he witnessed the incident and was satisfied that it was an accident. Martin Ellis, the player involved in the tackle said that he was running down the field and Bust was waiting to tackle him and had dived and caught Ellis by the legs but his neck struck him on the hip and they both fell to the ground. The coroner returned the verdict that nobody was to blame for the death.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Killed at Football\n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=125\n| date = 1913-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130527.2.86\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=5th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=\t1913}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1914 Auckland Rugby League season|1914]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Myers Cup (First Grade Competition)==\nEighteen regular season matches were played before [[North Shore Albions]] were awarded the title.\n\n===Final Standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions]]\n|7||5||1||1||80||55||'''11'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|7||4||0||3||117||53||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|7||3||2||2||60||46||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby RFC|Ponsonby United]]\n|7||4||0||3||103||65||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Eden Ramblers]]\n|5||1||0||4||18||124||'''2'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]]\n|5||0||1||4||21||56||'''1'''\n|-\n|}\n\n===Myers Cup Fixtures===\n======Round 1======\n[[Karl Ifwersen]] had switched codes and made his debut appearance for North Shore.

"text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1913 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the 5th season of the Auckland Rugby league. It followed the [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season]].\n\nThe first grade competition began on 3 May with the same 6 teams that had competed in the 1912 season, however [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] pulled out of the competition midway through the season as they struggled to put a full team on the field. The Eden Ramblers also pulled out at the same time. [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned champions for the first time.\n\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]] now known as the Northcote Tigers, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie Wanderers]], who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n\n===Charles Savory Controversy===\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, [[Charles Savory]] was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an [[Auckland Rugby League]] official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]] chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and [[Morgan Hayward]] chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Football Resentment/League Selector Replaced/\"Savory Shall Not Play\"\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=199\n| date = 1913-08-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130821.2.87\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Death of a Player===\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was killed. The death occurred at Ellerslie. He was said to have collided with an opposing player and the two of them fell to the ground with a third player falling on top of them. The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie. He was unable to be revived and died at 8.30am the following morning.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Footballers Death/Spinal Cord Fractured/Accident at Ellerslie\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=124\n| date = 1913-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130526.2.59\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref> After the incident the deceased father said he witnessed the incident and was satisfied that it was an accident. Martin Ellis, the player involved in the tackle said that he was running down the field and Bust was waiting to tackle him and had dived and caught Ellis by the legs but his neck struck him on the hip and they both fell to the ground.
