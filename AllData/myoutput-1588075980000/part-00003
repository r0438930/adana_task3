The operation commenced after large numbers of [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]], and [[French Army|French]] troops were cut off and surrounded by [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German troops]] during the six-week [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this \"a colossal military disaster\", saying \"the whole root and core and brain of the British Army\" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his \"[[we shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}\n\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.\n\nLate on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].\n\nOn the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, 4 [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least 3 [[French Navy]] destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Battle of France}}\nIn September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] declared to be \"impenetrable\" as long as \"special provisions\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, [[Maurice Gamelin]], also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it \"never favoured large operations\".{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=32}} With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}\n\nThe initial plan for the German [[battle of France|invasion of France]] called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=140}} [[Erich von Manstein]], then Chief of Staff of the German [[Army Group A]], prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the [[OKH]] (German High Command) via his superior, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].{{sfn|Lemay|2010|pp=98\u2013102}}{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}} Manstein's plan suggested that panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish [[bridgehead]]s on the [[Meuse River]] and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] in Belgium. This part of the plan later became known as the ''Sichelschnitt'' (\"sickle cut\").{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}}{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=145}} [[Adolf Hitler]] approved a modified version of Manstein's ideas, today known as the [[Manstein Plan]], after meeting with him on 17 February.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=132}}\n\n[[File:16May-21May Battle of Belgium.PNG|thumb|Situation on 21 May 1940; German forces occupy the area shaded in pink]]\n\nOn 10 May, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] and [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=713}} [[Army Group B]], under ''Generaloberst'' [[Fedor von Bock]], attacked into Belgium, while the three panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung around to the south and drove for the Channel.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=37}} The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the [[River Dyle]] within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|loc=Map, p. 33}} They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the [[Scheldt River]] on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=74\u201375}} During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=47}} On 19 May, Gort met with French General [[Gaston Billotte]], commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=64\u201365}} Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} On 20 May, on Churchill's suggestion, the Admiralty began arranging for all available small vessels to be made ready to proceed to France.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58\u201359}} After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]] to cut through the German spearhead,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=98}} the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 61}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:Gort and Blount at Arras WWII IWM O 177.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Gort]] (gesturing, at centre) was commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. ]]\nWithout informing the French, the British began planning on 20 May for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58\u201359}} This planning was headed by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay]] at the naval headquarters below [[Dover Castle]], from which he briefed Churchill as it was under way.{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=43\u201344}} Ships began gathering at Dover for the evacuation.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=100}} On 20 May, the BEF sent Brigadier Gerald Whitfield to Dunkirk to start evacuating unnecessary personnel. Overwhelmed by what he later described as \"a somewhat alarming movement towards Dunkirk by both officers and men\", due to a shortage of food and water, he had to send many along without thoroughly checking their credentials. Even officers ordered to stay behind to aid the evacuation disappeared onto the boats.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=124}}\n\nOn 22 May, Churchill ordered the BEF to attack southward in coordination with the French First Army under General [[Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard|Georges Blanchard]] to reconnect with the remainder of the French forces.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=65}} This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General [[Maxime Weygand]], appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=57}} On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces, behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at [[Gravelines]].{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=84}} Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n===Battle of Dunkirk===\n{{Main|Battle of Dunkirk}}\n[[File:Dunkirksoldier1.JPG|left|thumb|Soldiers were [[strafe]]d and bombed by German aircraft while awaiting transport.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}]]\nBy 24 May, the Germans had captured the port of [[Boulogne]] and surrounded [[Calais]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}} The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Rudolf Veiel]] built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=152}} On 23 May, at the suggestion of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] commander ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks and the question of supply to his forward troops.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=167}}{{sfn|Army Group A War Diary}}{{sfn|OKW Jodl Diary}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28\u201335}} He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30\u201350 per cent).{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230\u201331}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=120}} Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230\u201331}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28\u201335}}\n\nAir Marshal [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] urged Hitler to let the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (aided by Army Group B{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=150}}) finish off the British, to the consternation of General [[Franz Halder]], who noted in his diary that the ''Luftwaffe'' was dependent upon the weather and aircrews were worn out after two weeks of battle.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|pp=167\u201368}} Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent uncoded. It was picked up by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Y service]] intelligence network at 12:42: \"By order of the Fuhrer&nbsp;... attack north-west of Arras is to be limited to the general line Lens\u2013Bethune\u2013Aire\u2013St Omer\u2013Gravelines.

A special service attended by [[King George VI]] was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 26 May, which was declared a national day of prayer.{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=83}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=122}} The [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishop of Canterbury]] led prayers \"for our soldiers in dire peril in France\". Similar prayers were offered in synagogues and churches throughout the UK that day, confirming to the public their suspicion of the desperate plight of the troops.{{sfn|Gelb|1990|p=82}} Just before 19:00 on 26 May, Churchill ordered Dynamo to begin, by which time 28,000 men had already departed.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} Initial plans called for the recovery of 45,000 men from the BEF within two days, at which time German troops were expected to block further evacuation.

An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically taking part in the effort.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nThe same day, the ''Luftwaffe'' heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations.

On the German side, ''[[Kampfgeschwader 2]]'' (KG 2) and [[KG 3]] suffered the heaviest casualties. German losses amounted to 23 [[Dornier Do 17]]s. [[KG 1]] and [[KG 4]] bombed the beach and harbour and [[KG 54]] sank the 8,000-ton steamer ''Aden''. [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers sank the troopship ''Cote d' Azur''. The ''Luftwaffe'' engaged with 300 bombers which were protected by 550 fighter sorties and attacked Dunkirk in twelve raids. They dropped 15,000 [[high explosive]] and 30,000 [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], destroying the oil tanks and wrecking the harbour.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|pp=116\u2013117}} [[No. 11 Group RAF]] flew 22 patrols with 287 aircraft this day, in formations of up to 20 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}}\n\nAltogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} The RAF continued to inflict a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and [[strafe]]d while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}\n\nOn 25 and 26 May, the ''Luftwaffe'' focused their attention on Allied pockets holding out at Calais, [[Lille]], and [[Amiens]], and did not attack Dunkirk.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=119}} Remnants of the French First Army, [[Siege of Lille (1940)|surrounded at Lille]], fought off seven German divisions, several of them armoured, until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender after running out of food and ammunition.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=144}} The Germans accorded the [[honours of war]] to the defenders of Lille in recognition of their bravery.{{sfn|Fermer|2013|p=208}}\n\n===28 May \u2013 4 June===\n[[File:21May-4June1940-Fall Gelb.jpg|thumb|Situation on 4 June 1940; the remaining French rearguard held a sliver of land around Dunkirk]]\n[[File:East Mole Dunkirk.jpg|thumb|East mole (2009)]]\nThe Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=729}} leaving a large gap to the east of Dunkirk.

According to Churchill, French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nThe evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory.

The operation commenced after large numbers of [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]], and [[French Army|French]] troops were cut off and surrounded by [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German troops]] during the six-week [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this \"a colossal military disaster\", saying \"the whole root and core and brain of the British Army\" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his \"[[we shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}\n\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.\n\nLate on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].\n\nOn the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, 4 [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least 3 [[French Navy]] destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Battle of France}}\nIn September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] declared to be \"impenetrable\" as long as \"special provisions\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed.

Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=198}}\n\nThe first of the \"little ships\" arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=229}} The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get anywhere near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from the waterline and wait for the soldiers to wade out.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=225}} In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=199}} In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=167\u201368}} In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at [[De Panne]] and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=214\u201315}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" align=right style=\"text-align: right; margin-left: 2px;\"\n|+ Troops landed from Dunkirk<br>27 May \u2013 4 June{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Beaches\n! scope=\"col\" | Harbour\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 27 May\n| \u2014\n| 7,669\n| 7,669\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 28 May\n| 5,930\n| 11,874\n| 17,804\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 29 May\n| 13,752\n| 33,558\n| 47,310\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 30 May\n| 29,512\n| 24,311\n| 53,823\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 31 May\n| 22,942\n| 45,072\n| 68,014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 June\n| 17,348\n| 47,081\n| 64,429\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 June\n| 6,695\n| 19,561\n| 26,256\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 June\n| 1,870\n| 24,876\n| 26,746\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 June\n| 622\n| 25,553\n| 26,175\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''Totals'''\n| '''98,671'''\n| '''239,555'''\n| '''338,226'''\n|}\n{{See also|Battle of Abbeville|Operation Cycle|Operation Ariel}}\nBefore the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 28 May to expect \"hard and heavy tidings\".{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=99}} Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a miracle, and the British press presented the evacuation as a \"disaster turned to triumph\" so successfully that Churchill had to remind the country in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] comments that the confusion over the Dunkirk evacuation is illustrated by two of the best books on it being called ''Strange Defeat'' and ''Strange Victory''.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=37}} \n\nThree British divisions and a host of logistic and labour troops were cut off to the south of the Somme by the German \"race to the sea\". At the end of May, a further two divisions began moving to France with the hope of establishing a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]]. The majority of the [[51st (Highland) Division]] was forced to surrender on 12 June, but almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15\u201325 June under the codename [[Operation Ariel]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=296\u2013305}} The Germans marched into [[Paris]] on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=232\u201334}}\n\nThe more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated.{{sfn|Looseley|2005|p=}} British ships ferried French troops to [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], and other ports in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]], although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France.{{sfn|Mordal|1968|p=496}} Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free French]] army in Britain.{{sfn|Nadeau|Barlow|2003|p=89}}\n\nIn France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nThe evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated \"Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of materiel have been captured.
