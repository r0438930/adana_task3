The Italian attack failed, with only one merchant ship being slightly damaged. The destroyer {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}} sank the Italian destroyer ''[[Sauro-class destroyer|Francesco Nullo]]''. ''Kimberley'' was hit, disabled by Italian [[shore batteries]] at [[Harmil|Harmil Island]] and towed to safety by the cruiser {{HMS|Leander||6}}.\n\nThe Italian ships had carried out their plan but lost one destroyer for no result; separating increased the chance of intercepting the convoy but sacrificed the benefits of concentration against the escorts. The British command at Aden criticised the escorts (excepting ''Kimberley'') for a lack of aggression but leaving the convoy to chase ships at night and in misty weather was risky. The Italians made another fruitless sortie on 3 December, cancelled one in January 1941 after [[Italian destroyer Daniele Manin|''Daniele Manin'']] was damaged by a bomb and on 24 January sortied again with no result.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Red Sea===\n\n{{see also|Red Sea}}\n\n[[File:Red Sea topographic map-en.jpg|thumb|{{center|Topographic map of the Red Sea}}]]\nThe Red Sea is an area of high temperatures and humidity, its coasts vary from desert to high mountain ranges and navigation is fraught with danger from offshore reefs and false horizons caused by [[atmospheric refraction]].{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=133, 199}} From May to June 1939, French and British military officials met at Aden to devise a common strategy to retain control of the waters around Italian East Africa if Italy declared war. It was expected that Italy could close the Mediterranean to Allied traffic and that supplies to the Middle East would have to be transported via the Red Sea. Control of the [[Gulf of Aden]], the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Suez]] at the northern terminus and the maintenance of the bases at [[Aden]] and [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) was equally important but a withdrawal from French and [[British Somaliland]] had also be contemplated.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=133}}\n\nThe British-controlled [[Port Sudan]], lay on the west coast of the Red Sea, about half way [{{cvt|600|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}}] between Suez and the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] Strait ({{lang|ar| \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062f\u0628}}, Gate of Tears). The Italian port of Massawa in Eritrea was about {{cvt|350|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north and Aden about {{cvt|100|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east of the Bab-el-Mandeb.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=133}} The ports along the coast of [[Italian Somaliland]] and the entrance to the Red Sea were to be blockaded ([[Operation Begum]]) to prevent the Italians from receiving supplies and reinforcements. Allied merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea were to proceed in escorted convoys. Naval ships were to sweep mines, patrol the Gulf of Aden and the Bab-el-Mandeb to isolate the Italian Red Sea Flotilla and protect Aden from sorties by Italian ships; the Italian naval bases in [[Eritrea]] were to be attacked.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=134, 201}}\n\n===Red Sea Force===\n\nIn April 1940 the Royal Navy established the [[Red Sea Force]] with the light cruisers {{HMS|Liverpool|C11|6}} and {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} (Senior Naval Officer Red Sea, Rear-Admiral Murray); {{HMS|Leander|75|2}} ([[New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy|New Zealand Division]]) replaced ''Liverpool'' on 26 May. By September the Force comprised the cruisers ''Hobart'', ''Leander'', {{HMS|Caledon|D53|2}} and the anti-aircraft cruiser {{HMS|Carlisle|D67|2}}; the destroyers {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}}, {{HMS|Kingston|F64|2}} and {{HMS|Kandahar|F28|2}}; the sloops {{HMS|Flamingo|L18|6}}, {{HMS|Auckland|L61|2}}, {{HMS|Shoreham|L32|2}} and {{HMS|Grimsby|U16|2}}; {{HMIS|Clive|L79|6}}, {{HMIS|Indus|U67|2}} and {{HMIS|Hindustan||2}}; and {{HMAS|Parramatta|U44|6}}. Aden was the base for two minesweepers, two small Armed Merchant Cruisers and two armed trawlers. Ships attached temporarily included the light cruisers {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and {{HMS|Colombo|D89|2}}, the 8-inch cruisers {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} and {{HMS|Shropshire||2}}.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=134, 201}}\n\n===Red Sea Flotilla===\n\n{{main|Red Sea Flotilla}}\n\n[[File:GulfofAden map 2.png|thumb|{{centre|Gulf of Aden}}]]\nThe Italian naval and air bases in East Africa were convenient for attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Massawa]], home port of the [[Red Sea Flotilla]] ([[Rear-Admiral]] [{{lang|it|Contrammiraglio}}] [[Mario Bonetti]], December 1940 \u2013 April 1941). Massawa had been fortified and lay behind numerous islands and reefs with mined approaches; there was a smaller base at [[Assab]].{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=134, 201}} The [[scout cruiser]]s ({{lang|it|esploratori}}, also [[Leone-class destroyer]]s) [[Italian destroyer Pantera|''Pantera'']] and [[Italian destroyer Leone|''Leone'']] (Commander Paolo Aloisi) had an unusually powerful armament of eight [[120 mm Italian naval gun#45-calibre Schneider-Canet-Armstrong 1918/19|{{cvt|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns]], in four turrets on the centre line. Only two turrets could aim fore and aft but the eight-gun [[broadside]] was unique for destroyers. The class also carried two {{nowrap|40 mm}} pom-pom anti-aircraft guns, four {{nowrap|20 mm}} machine-guns,  four {{cvt|533|mm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes and {{nowrap|60 mines.}} The [[Sauro-class destroyer]]s had an armament of four [[120 mm Italian naval gun#45-calibre Vickers Terni 1924|{{cvt|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns]], two {{nowrap|40 mm}} pom-poms, two {{nowrap|13.2 mm}} machine-guns, six {{cvt|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s and {{nowrap|52 mines.}}{{sfn|Campbell|1985|pp=335\u2013338}} Once war was declared, the fuel stored for the Italian ships based at Massawa could only diminish under a British blockade.{{sfn|Bragadin|1957|p=41}} The accumulation of mechanical faults, fuel depletion and the enervating effect of the climate, hampered operations of the Red Sea Flotilla.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=102}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===Red Sea convoys===\n\nIn June four of the eight Italian submarines based at Massawa were lost. The {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (Italian Royal Air Force) commenced operations over the Red Sea and on 11 June a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] flew a reconnaissance sortie.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=17}} On 16 June, the Italian submarine [[Italian submarine Galileo Galilei|''Galileo Galilei'']] sank the Norwegian tanker ''James Stove'' (8,215 [[Gross register tonnage]] (GRT), sailing independently about {{cvt|12|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of Aden.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=101}} On 19 June, ''Hobart'' sent its [[Supermarine Walrus]] amphibian to bomb an Italian wireless station on Centre Peak Island between Massawa and the Arabian coast.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=201}} On 2 July, Convoy BN 1, comprising six tankers and three freighters, assembled in the Gulf of Aden.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=101}} On 8 July, an SM.81 of 10\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}} flew a long range reconnaissance sortie over southern Sudan and the Red Sea and was attacked by a [[Vickers Wellesley]]. The SM.81 was damaged hit an island trying to force land, bounced into the air and flew on at wave top height, with the Wellesley flying above and to one side for its gunners to keep firing. After ten minutes the Italian aircraft hit the sea and shed its wings.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=33}}{{efn|Three survivors got into a life raft and the observer {{lang|it|Sottotenente}} (Sub-Lieutenant) Goffredo Franchini in command of the sortie climbed onto one of the wings. Franchini realised that if he joined the others, the life raft would be swamped and ordered the crew to make for the island nearby without him. The men in the raft decided to make for Dahlak Island and collected birds' eggs before setting off. The three men arrived after two weeks, were rescued by local civilians and collected by a destroyer, reaching Massawa three weeks after being shot down.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=33}}}}\n\nItalian sorties against the BN\u2013BS convoys were dispiriting failures; from 26 to 31 July, ''Guglielmotti'' failed to find two Greek merchantmen and a sortie by the torpedo boats [[Italian destroyer Cesare Battisti|''Cesare Battisti'']] and [[Italian destroyer Francesco Nullo (1925)|''Francesco Nullo'']] came to nothing. ''Guglielmotti'' sortied from 21 to 25 August, ''Galileo Ferraris'' (25\u201331 August), ''Francesco Nullo'' and ''Nazario Sauro'' from 24 to 25 August and the destroyers ''Pantera'' and [[Italian destroyer Tigre|''Tigre'']] (28\u201329 August) failing to find  ships, despite agent reports and sightings by air reconnaissance.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|pp=29, 32}} On 4 September, Italian bombers attacked SS ''Velko'' and inflicted serious damage and on the next day, five SM.79s attacked Convoy BS 3A. A Blenheim IVF convoy escort attacked the bombers but was damaged. On 6 September the convoy was attacked again by a SM.79.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=58, 73}} On the night of 5/6 September, ''Cesare Battisti'', ''Daniele Manin'' and ''Nazario Sauro'' sailed, followed on 6/7 September by the destroyers ''Leone'' and ''Tigre'' to attack Convoy BN 4 which had been reported by air reconnaissance but found nothing. Further to the north, ''Galileo Ferraris'' and ''Guglielmotti'' also failed to find BN 4 but ''Guglielmotti'' torpedoed the Greek tanker ''Atlas'' (4,008 GRT) straggling behind the convoy south of the [[Farasan Islands]]. Air reconnaissance also found Convoy BN 5 of 23 ships but ''Leone'', ''Pantera'', ''Cesare Battisti'' and ''Daniele Manin'' with the submarines ''Archimede'' and ''Gugliemotti'' failed to find the convoy. MV ''Bhima'' (5,280 GRT) was damaged by bombs, one man was killed and the ship was towed to Aden and beached for repairs.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|pp=33, 35}}\n\n===Convoy BN 7===\n[[File:HMAS Yarra (AWM 016263).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Australian sloop HMAS ''Yarra''}}]]\nConvoy BN 7 was northbound through the Red Sea and consisted of {{nowrap|32 British,}} Norwegian, French, Greek and Turkish merchant ships.

Richardson), the [[Egret-class sloop]] ''Auckland'', the [[Grimsby-class sloop]]s {{HMAS|Yarra|U77|6}} and ''Indus'' and the [[Hunt-class minesweeper (1916)|Hunt-class minesweepers]] {{HMS|Derby|J90|6}} and {{HMS|Huntley||2}}.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=102}}{{efn|After joining the Red Sea Force, ''Yarra'' had escorted convoys in the Red Sea and intercepted blockade-running [[dhow]]s.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=227}}}} Convoy BN 7 was nearing Perim, a [[volcanic island]] off the south-west coast of [[Yemen]] in the Bab-el-Mandeb, on the afternoon of 19 October, when an aircraft dropped four bombs close astern of one of the merchantmen. ''Leander'' and ''Auckland'' opened fire on the aircraft as it flew off to the west; shortly before dark, an undercarriage wheel of an Italian aircraft was picked up {{cvt|15|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of the island. Next morning, Italian aircraft dropped four bombs, two of which fell ahead of the convoy and two bombs harmlessly astern of the French liner {{lang|fr|[[List of ships of the Free French Naval Forces|Felix Roussel]]}}, carrying New Zealand troops to Suez. At dusk ''Leander'' took station on the port beam of the convoy between it and the Italian base at Massawa, which flanked the line of advance; the convoy zig-zagged through the night.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=89}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Italian sortie===\n\n[[File:Destroyer Pantera.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Italian destroyer ''Pantera''}}]]\nThe Italian flotilla sailed on 20 October, the destroyers operating in pairs, Section I, comprised the faster [[Italian destroyer Nazario Sauro|''Nazario Sauro'']] (Commander Moretti degli Adimari) and ''Francesco Nullo'' (Lieutenant Commander [[Costantino Borsini]]). Section II, the slower, more heavily armed ''Pantera'' and ''Leone'' were to divert the convoy escort and would then attack the convoy with torpedoes. At 21:15 the two sections separated and at 23:21, ''Pantera'' sighted smoke from the convoy.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} ''Pantera'' signalled ''Sauro'' and moved ahead of the convoy to intercept, with ''Leone'' following {{cvt|875|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} The convoy was about {{cvt|35|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north-north-west of [[Jabal al-Tair Island]] at 02:19 on 21 October, when ''Leander'' sighted two patches of smoke bearing north.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}}\n\n''Auckland'' reported two destroyers {{cvt|4|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} off and ''Leander'' altered course to intercept, the captain assuming that they would run for home through the South Massawa Channel. After a challenge from ''Auckland'', ''Pantera'' fired over ''Yarra'' at the convoy, inflicting some splinter damage to a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] on the convoy commodore's ship. ''Auckland'' opened fire and the ships separated and turned away at full speed, west-south-west, towards Massawa, firing their aft guns. The destroyers were broad on the port bow of HMAS ''Yarra'' when ''Pantera'' fired two torpedoes at 23:31 and another pair at 23:34.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} ''Yarra'' avoided two torpedoes by turning towards them and \"combing\" their tracks.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=89}} Observers in ''Yarra'' thought that the leading enemy vessel was hit by their fourth or fifth salvo.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n''Sauro'' and ''Nullo'' had been manoeuvring to a more favourable position after receiving the sighting report from ''Pantera'', turned towards the convoy and spotted ''Leander'' at 01:48 (21 October). ''Sauro'' fired a torpedo at ''Leander'' which missed and ''Leander'' opened fire but lost sight of ''Sauro'' after two minutes. ''Sauro'' made another torpedo attack at 02:07 and turned away towards Massawa. (''Nullo'' was not able to attack after its rudder jammed for several minutes and it went round in circles, losing contact with ''Sauro''.){{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} Borsini ordered ''Nullo'' towards the Italian batteries on Harmil Island. When the gunfire ceased, ''Leander'' altered course to north-west, to intercept the ships at the South Massawa Channel (the Harmil Island Passage) and at 02:45, opened fire with {{nowrap|6-inch}} and star shells, on a ship that was firing red and green tracer. The range was increasing and the ship was lost to sight after the first salvoes.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=90}}\n\n''Leander'' altered course westwards to bring all guns to bear if the ships were making for the South Massawa Channel. At 02:20 ''Leander'' spotted ''Nullo'' by searchlight and exchanged fire for about ten minutes at about {{cvt|4600|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}}, ''Leander'' scoring several hits which damaged ''Nullo''{{'}}s [[gyrocompass]] and gunnery director. At 02:51, ''Leander'' lost contact in the haze and ceased fire (having fired a hundred and twenty-nine 6-inch rounds).{{sfn|Waters|1956|pp=89\u201390}} ''Nullo'' headed toward Harmil Island with ''Leander'' in pursuit and at 03:00, ''Leander'' challenged a destroyer which turned out to be ''Kimberley'', also in pursuit. After five minutes, the cruiser altered course east to rejoin the convoy, since the Italian ship was drawing away at the rate of {{cvt|7|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and the convoy would be vulnerable to attack during a pursuit.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=90}}{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}}\n\n===Battle of Harmil Island===\n\n[[File:Bab el Mandeb NASA with description.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Perim Island in the Bab el Mandeb (NASA)}}]]\n''Kimberley'' continued at maximum speed and at 03:50, sighted smoke ahead, apparently from two ships retiring at high speed. At 05:40 (21 October), off Harmil Island, lookouts on ''Kimberley'' and ''Nullo'' spotted each other at {{cvt|7|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}}. Borsini assumed that the ship was ''Sauro'' and then ''Kimberley'' opened fire at 05:53, taking ''Nullo'' by surprise, ''Nullo'' not returning fire for four minutes.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=104}} ''Kimberley'' closed the range to {{cvt|5000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} and at 06:20, ''Nullo'' scraped a reef, which damaged a propeller and sprung a leak. As ''Nullo'' rounded the island at about 06:25, it was hit once in the forward engine room and once in aft engine room.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=104}}\n\n''Nullo'' lost all power; Borsini gave the order to abandon ship and steered towards Harmil Island. The upper works were hit by shell splinters and the crew abandoned the ship, while Borsini tried to run the ship aground on the island.

While adrift {{cvt|10000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} from the shore battery, ''Kimberley'' silenced two of the guns and wounding four gunners with 45 HE shells from No. 3 mount.{{sfnm|1a1=Waters|1y=1956|1p=90|2a1=O'Hara|2y=2009|2p=105}}\n\n[[File:HMS Kimberley.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|HMS ''Kimberley'' (photographed in 1942)}}]]\n''Kimberley'' managed to get under way, its speed reduced to {{cvt|15|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and the shore battery ceased fire when ''Kimberley'' was {{cvt|19000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} away. ''Kimberley'' had fired 596 rounds of [[Armor-piercing shell|Semi-Armour Piercing]] and 97 [[High Explosive]] shells. ''Leander'' left the convoy and at 06:54 increased speed to {{cvt|26|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. By 07:34, ''Leander'' was making {{cvt|28.7|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and soon after, ''Kimberley'' reported that it was steaming east at {{cvt|15|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} on one engine.{{sfnm|1a1=Waters|1y=1956|1p=90|2a1=O'Hara|2y=2009|2p=105}} At 08:25, ''Leander'' was {{cvt|16|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east by north of the Harmil South beacon and slowed to {{cvt|10|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Leander'' circled near ''Kimberley'' to keep freedom of manoeuvre, in case Italian bombers appeared. ''Kimberley'' had lost water in its boilers and ''Leander'' sent a boat with three shipwrights and an engine-room artificer; a wounded rating was transferred to the cruiser for medical attention. At about 10:00, ''Leander'' took ''Kimberley'' in tow.{{sfn|Waters|1956|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nIn August the British had run four BN convoys and four BS convoys, five in September and seven in October, the BN convoys comprising 86 ships and the BS (southbound) convoys 72 ships. Despite agent reports and sightings by the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}}, Italian submarines and ships had frequently failed to make contact with the convoys and only six air attacks was achieved in October and none after 4 November.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=248}} During the Attack on Convoy BN 7, the British found that they were at a disadvantage in night fighting as they were temporarily blinded by the flash of their guns, while the Italian ships used flashless cordite and had good tracer ammunition.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=227\u2013228}} The convoy escorts were blamed by the headquarters at Aden for a lack of aggression, except for ''Kimberley'', despite the danger of abandoning the convoy at night and in poor visibility. The Italians had managed to make two torpedo attacks as planned but the division of the destroyers into two sections, after previous sorties had failed to find any ships, meant that neither section had the firepower to face the British escorts.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=105}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOf the {{nowrap|120 crew}} of ''Nullo'', Borsini declined to abandon ship and when his assistant Seaman Ciaravolo realised, jumped from his lifeboat to accompany his captain and both were drowned.

No damage was done and ''Leander'' and ''Kimberley'' re-joined Convoy BN 7 just after noon. (As they passed ''Felix Roussel'' they were cheered by hundreds of New Zealand soldiers.) In the afternoon, ''Leander'' transferred the tow to ''Kingston'' which left the convoy with ''Kimberley'' next morning, for Port Sudan. The southbound convoy BS 7 with {{nowrap|20 ships,}} was met by the convoy escorts in the afternoon of 23 October and after an uneventful passage, dispersed east of Aden on 28 October.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=91}} Later on 21 October, three [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] bombers of [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45 Squadron]] found and bombed the wreck of ''Francesco Nullo''.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=248}} The Italians made another fruitless sortie on 3 December, cancelled one in January 1941 after ''Daniele Manin'' was damaged by a bomb and on 24 January, sortied again with no result.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=105}}\n\n===Attack on Convoy BN 14===\nOn the night of {{nowrap|2/3 February}} 1941, the Italian destroyers ''Pantera'', ''Tigre'' and ''Nazario Sauro'' sailed from Massawa, to intercept a convoy known to be in the area. BN 14 consisted of 39 merchant ships escorted by the cruiser ''Caledon'', the destroyer ''Kingston'' and the sloops ''Indus'' and ''Shoreham''. ''Sauro'' sighted the convoy and fired three torpedoes, then fired again at a ship seen in a cloud of smoke, before turning away at high speed. The two other ships did not receive the sighting report from ''Sauro'' but ten minutes later ''Pantera'' saw the ships and fired torpedoes, hearing explosions and claiming probables on two merchantmen; ''Tigre'' failed to find the convoy. Close to the Massawa in the South Channel, ''Nazario Sauro'' ran into ''Kingston'' but had run out of torpedoes. Fearful that the British were trying to spring ambush, the other Italian ships converged on ''Nazario Sauro'' and called by wireless for air cover at dawn, reaching port unharmed.

The Italian attack failed, with only one merchant ship being slightly damaged. The destroyer {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}} sank the Italian destroyer ''[[Sauro-class destroyer|Francesco Nullo]]''. ''Kimberley'' was hit, disabled by Italian [[shore batteries]] at [[Harmil|Harmil Island]] and towed to safety by the cruiser {{HMS|Leander||6}}.\n\nThe Italian ships had carried out their plan but lost one destroyer for no result; separating increased the chance of intercepting the convoy but sacrificed the benefits of concentration against the escorts. The British command at Aden criticised the escorts (excepting ''Kimberley'') for a lack of aggression but leaving the convoy to chase ships at night and in misty weather was risky. The Italians made another fruitless sortie on 3 December, cancelled one in January 1941 after [[Italian destroyer Daniele Manin|''Daniele Manin'']] was damaged by a bomb and on 24 January sortied again with no result.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Red Sea===\n\n{{see also|Red Sea}}\n\n[[File:Red Sea topographic map-en.jpg|thumb|{{center|Topographic map of the Red Sea}}]]\nThe Red Sea is an area of high temperatures and humidity, its coasts vary from desert to high mountain ranges and navigation is fraught with danger from offshore reefs and false horizons caused by [[atmospheric refraction]].{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=133, 199}} From May to June 1939, French and British military officials met at Aden to devise a common strategy to retain control of the waters around Italian East Africa if Italy declared war. It was expected that Italy could close the Mediterranean to Allied traffic and that supplies to the Middle East would have to be transported via the Red Sea. Control of the [[Gulf of Aden]], the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Suez]] at the northern terminus and the maintenance of the bases at [[Aden]] and [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) was equally important but a withdrawal from French and [[British Somaliland]] had also be contemplated.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=133}}\n\nThe British-controlled [[Port Sudan]], lay on the west coast of the Red Sea, about half way [{{cvt|600|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}}] between Suez and the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] Strait ({{lang|ar| \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062f\u0628}}, Gate of Tears). The Italian port of Massawa in Eritrea was about {{cvt|350|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north and Aden about {{cvt|100|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east of the Bab-el-Mandeb.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=133}} The ports along the coast of [[Italian Somaliland]] and the entrance to the Red Sea were to be blockaded ([[Operation Begum]]) to prevent the Italians from receiving supplies and reinforcements. Allied merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea were to proceed in escorted convoys. Naval ships were to sweep mines, patrol the Gulf of Aden and the Bab-el-Mandeb to isolate the Italian Red Sea Flotilla and protect Aden from sorties by Italian ships; the Italian naval bases in [[Eritrea]] were to be attacked.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=134, 201}}\n\n===Red Sea Force===\n\nIn April 1940 the Royal Navy established the [[Red Sea Force]] with the light cruisers {{HMS|Liverpool|C11|6}} and {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} (Senior Naval Officer Red Sea, Rear-Admiral Murray); {{HMS|Leander|75|2}} ([[New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy|New Zealand Division]]) replaced ''Liverpool'' on 26 May. By September the Force comprised the cruisers ''Hobart'', ''Leander'', {{HMS|Caledon|D53|2}} and the anti-aircraft cruiser {{HMS|Carlisle|D67|2}}; the destroyers {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}}, {{HMS|Kingston|F64|2}} and {{HMS|Kandahar|F28|2}}; the sloops {{HMS|Flamingo|L18|6}}, {{HMS|Auckland|L61|2}}, {{HMS|Shoreham|L32|2}} and {{HMS|Grimsby|U16|2}}; {{HMIS|Clive|L79|6}}, {{HMIS|Indus|U67|2}} and {{HMIS|Hindustan||2}}; and {{HMAS|Parramatta|U44|6}}. Aden was the base for two minesweepers, two small Armed Merchant Cruisers and two armed trawlers. Ships attached temporarily included the light cruisers {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and {{HMS|Colombo|D89|2}}, the 8-inch cruisers {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} and {{HMS|Shropshire||2}}.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=134, 201}}\n\n===Red Sea Flotilla===\n\n{{main|Red Sea Flotilla}}\n\n[[File:GulfofAden map 2.png|thumb|{{centre|Gulf of Aden}}]]\nThe Italian naval and air bases in East Africa were convenient for attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Massawa]], home port of the [[Red Sea Flotilla]] ([[Rear-Admiral]] [{{lang|it|Contrammiraglio}}] [[Mario Bonetti]], December 1940 \u2013 April 1941). Massawa had been fortified and lay behind numerous islands and reefs with mined approaches; there was a smaller base at [[Assab]].{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=134, 201}} The [[scout cruiser]]s ({{lang|it|esploratori}}, also [[Leone-class destroyer]]s) [[Italian destroyer Pantera|''Pantera'']] and [[Italian destroyer Leone|''Leone'']] (Commander Paolo Aloisi) had an unusually powerful armament of eight [[120 mm Italian naval gun#45-calibre Schneider-Canet-Armstrong 1918/19|{{cvt|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns]], in four turrets on the centre line. Only two turrets could aim fore and aft but the eight-gun [[broadside]] was unique for destroyers. The class also carried two {{nowrap|40 mm}} pom-pom anti-aircraft guns, four {{nowrap|20 mm}} machine-guns,  four {{cvt|533|mm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes and {{nowrap|60 mines.}} The [[Sauro-class destroyer]]s had an armament of four [[120 mm Italian naval gun#45-calibre Vickers Terni 1924|{{cvt|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns]], two {{nowrap|40 mm}} pom-poms, two {{nowrap|13.2 mm}} machine-guns, six {{cvt|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s and {{nowrap|52 mines.}}{{sfn|Campbell|1985|pp=335\u2013338}} Once war was declared, the fuel stored for the Italian ships based at Massawa could only diminish under a British blockade.{{sfn|Bragadin|1957|p=41}} The accumulation of mechanical faults, fuel depletion and the enervating effect of the climate, hampered operations of the Red Sea Flotilla.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=102}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===Red Sea convoys===\n\nIn June four of the eight Italian submarines based at Massawa were lost. The {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (Italian Royal Air Force) commenced operations over the Red Sea and on 11 June a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] flew a reconnaissance sortie.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=17}} On 16 June, the Italian submarine [[Italian submarine Galileo Galilei|''Galileo Galilei'']] sank the Norwegian tanker ''James Stove'' (8,215 [[Gross register tonnage]] (GRT), sailing independently about {{cvt|12|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of Aden.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=101}} On 19 June, ''Hobart'' sent its [[Supermarine Walrus]] amphibian to bomb an Italian wireless station on Centre Peak Island between Massawa and the Arabian coast.{{sfn|Gill|1957|p=201}} On 2 July, Convoy BN 1, comprising six tankers and three freighters, assembled in the Gulf of Aden.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=101}} On 8 July, an SM.81 of 10\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}} flew a long range reconnaissance sortie over southern Sudan and the Red Sea and was attacked by a [[Vickers Wellesley]]. The SM.81 was damaged hit an island trying to force land, bounced into the air and flew on at wave top height, with the Wellesley flying above and to one side for its gunners to keep firing. After ten minutes the Italian aircraft hit the sea and shed its wings.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=33}}{{efn|Three survivors got into a life raft and the observer {{lang|it|Sottotenente}} (Sub-Lieutenant) Goffredo Franchini in command of the sortie climbed onto one of the wings. Franchini realised that if he joined the others, the life raft would be swamped and ordered the crew to make for the island nearby without him. The men in the raft decided to make for Dahlak Island and collected birds' eggs before setting off. The three men arrived after two weeks, were rescued by local civilians and collected by a destroyer, reaching Massawa three weeks after being shot down.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=33}}}}\n\nItalian sorties against the BN\u2013BS convoys were dispiriting failures; from 26 to 31 July, ''Guglielmotti'' failed to find two Greek merchantmen and a sortie by the torpedo boats [[Italian destroyer Cesare Battisti|''Cesare Battisti'']] and [[Italian destroyer Francesco Nullo (1925)|''Francesco Nullo'']] came to nothing. ''Guglielmotti'' sortied from 21 to 25 August, ''Galileo Ferraris'' (25\u201331 August), ''Francesco Nullo'' and ''Nazario Sauro'' from 24 to 25 August and the destroyers ''Pantera'' and [[Italian destroyer Tigre|''Tigre'']] (28\u201329 August) failing to find  ships, despite agent reports and sightings by air reconnaissance.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|pp=29, 32}} On 4 September, Italian bombers attacked SS ''Velko'' and inflicted serious damage and on the next day, five SM.79s attacked Convoy BS 3A. A Blenheim IVF convoy escort attacked the bombers but was damaged. On 6 September the convoy was attacked again by a SM.79.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=58, 73}} On the night of 5/6 September, ''Cesare Battisti'', ''Daniele Manin'' and ''Nazario Sauro'' sailed, followed on 6/7 September by the destroyers ''Leone'' and ''Tigre'' to attack Convoy BN 4 which had been reported by air reconnaissance but found nothing. Further to the north, ''Galileo Ferraris'' and ''Guglielmotti'' also failed to find BN 4 but ''Guglielmotti'' torpedoed the Greek tanker ''Atlas'' (4,008 GRT) straggling behind the convoy south of the [[Farasan Islands]]. Air reconnaissance also found Convoy BN 5 of 23 ships but ''Leone'', ''Pantera'', ''Cesare Battisti'' and ''Daniele Manin'' with the submarines ''Archimede'' and ''Gugliemotti'' failed to find the convoy. MV ''Bhima'' (5,280 GRT) was damaged by bombs, one man was killed and the ship was towed to Aden and beached for repairs.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|pp=33, 35}}\n\n===Convoy BN 7===\n[[File:HMAS Yarra (AWM 016263).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Australian sloop HMAS ''Yarra''}}]]\nConvoy BN 7 was northbound through the Red Sea and consisted of {{nowrap|32 British,}} Norwegian, French, Greek and Turkish merchant ships.

''Leander'' and ''Auckland'' opened fire on the aircraft as it flew off to the west; shortly before dark, an undercarriage wheel of an Italian aircraft was picked up {{cvt|15|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of the island. Next morning, Italian aircraft dropped four bombs, two of which fell ahead of the convoy and two bombs harmlessly astern of the French liner {{lang|fr|[[List of ships of the Free French Naval Forces|Felix Roussel]]}}, carrying New Zealand troops to Suez. At dusk ''Leander'' took station on the port beam of the convoy between it and the Italian base at Massawa, which flanked the line of advance; the convoy zig-zagged through the night.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=89}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Italian sortie===\n\n[[File:Destroyer Pantera.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Italian destroyer ''Pantera''}}]]\nThe Italian flotilla sailed on 20 October, the destroyers operating in pairs, Section I, comprised the faster [[Italian destroyer Nazario Sauro|''Nazario Sauro'']] (Commander Moretti degli Adimari) and ''Francesco Nullo'' (Lieutenant Commander [[Costantino Borsini]]). Section II, the slower, more heavily armed ''Pantera'' and ''Leone'' were to divert the convoy escort and would then attack the convoy with torpedoes. At 21:15 the two sections separated and at 23:21, ''Pantera'' sighted smoke from the convoy.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} ''Pantera'' signalled ''Sauro'' and moved ahead of the convoy to intercept, with ''Leone'' following {{cvt|875|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} The convoy was about {{cvt|35|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north-north-west of [[Jabal al-Tair Island]] at 02:19 on 21 October, when ''Leander'' sighted two patches of smoke bearing north.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}}\n\n''Auckland'' reported two destroyers {{cvt|4|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} off and ''Leander'' altered course to intercept, the captain assuming that they would run for home through the South Massawa Channel. After a challenge from ''Auckland'', ''Pantera'' fired over ''Yarra'' at the convoy, inflicting some splinter damage to a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] on the convoy commodore's ship. ''Auckland'' opened fire and the ships separated and turned away at full speed, west-south-west, towards Massawa, firing their aft guns. The destroyers were broad on the port bow of HMAS ''Yarra'' when ''Pantera'' fired two torpedoes at 23:31 and another pair at 23:34.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} ''Yarra'' avoided two torpedoes by turning towards them and \"combing\" their tracks.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=89}} Observers in ''Yarra'' thought that the leading enemy vessel was hit by their fourth or fifth salvo.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n''Sauro'' and ''Nullo'' had been manoeuvring to a more favourable position after receiving the sighting report from ''Pantera'', turned towards the convoy and spotted ''Leander'' at 01:48 (21 October). ''Sauro'' fired a torpedo at ''Leander'' which missed and ''Leander'' opened fire but lost sight of ''Sauro'' after two minutes. ''Sauro'' made another torpedo attack at 02:07 and turned away towards Massawa. (''Nullo'' was not able to attack after its rudder jammed for several minutes and it went round in circles, losing contact with ''Sauro''.){{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} Borsini ordered ''Nullo'' towards the Italian batteries on Harmil Island. When the gunfire ceased, ''Leander'' altered course to north-west, to intercept the ships at the South Massawa Channel (the Harmil Island Passage) and at 02:45, opened fire with {{nowrap|6-inch}} and star shells, on a ship that was firing red and green tracer. The range was increasing and the ship was lost to sight after the first salvoes.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=90}}\n\n''Leander'' altered course westwards to bring all guns to bear if the ships were making for the South Massawa Channel.

By 07:34, ''Leander'' was making {{cvt|28.7|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and soon after, ''Kimberley'' reported that it was steaming east at {{cvt|15|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} on one engine.{{sfnm|1a1=Waters|1y=1956|1p=90|2a1=O'Hara|2y=2009|2p=105}} At 08:25, ''Leander'' was {{cvt|16|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east by north of the Harmil South beacon and slowed to {{cvt|10|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Leander'' circled near ''Kimberley'' to keep freedom of manoeuvre, in case Italian bombers appeared. ''Kimberley'' had lost water in its boilers and ''Leander'' sent a boat with three shipwrights and an engine-room artificer; a wounded rating was transferred to the cruiser for medical attention. At about 10:00, ''Leander'' took ''Kimberley'' in tow.{{sfn|Waters|1956|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nIn August the British had run four BN convoys and four BS convoys, five in September and seven in October, the BN convoys comprising 86 ships and the BS (southbound) convoys 72 ships. Despite agent reports and sightings by the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}}, Italian submarines and ships had frequently failed to make contact with the convoys and only six air attacks was achieved in October and none after 4 November.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=248}} During the Attack on Convoy BN 7, the British found that they were at a disadvantage in night fighting as they were temporarily blinded by the flash of their guns, while the Italian ships used flashless cordite and had good tracer ammunition.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=227\u2013228}} The convoy escorts were blamed by the headquarters at Aden for a lack of aggression, except for ''Kimberley'', despite the danger of abandoning the convoy at night and in poor visibility. The Italians had managed to make two torpedo attacks as planned but the division of the destroyers into two sections, after previous sorties had failed to find any ships, meant that neither section had the firepower to face the British escorts.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=105}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOf the {{nowrap|120 crew}} of ''Nullo'', Borsini declined to abandon ship and when his assistant Seaman Ciaravolo realised, jumped from his lifeboat to accompany his captain and both were drowned. Of the ship's company {{nowrap|12 men}} were killed and {{nowrap|106 men}} were rescued by sailors of the Harmil Island battery.{{sfnm|1a1=Bragadin|1y=1957|1p=41|2a1=O'Hara|2y=2009|2p=103}} ''Kimberley'' was out of action until 31 October, then returned to service capable of a reduced maximum speed, until fully repaired in the spring of 1941.{{sfn|NHN|2014|nopp=y}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\nAt 10:00 on 21 October, ''Leander'' opened fire on three aircraft at {{cvt|13000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, which bombed about {{cvt|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} ahead of the ship, two more bombs turning out to be [[dud]]s. No damage was done and ''Leander'' and ''Kimberley'' re-joined Convoy BN 7 just after noon. (As they passed ''Felix Roussel'' they were cheered by hundreds of New Zealand soldiers.) In the afternoon, ''Leander'' transferred the tow to ''Kingston'' which left the convoy with ''Kimberley'' next morning, for Port Sudan. The southbound convoy BS 7 with {{nowrap|20 ships,}} was met by the convoy escorts in the afternoon of 23 October and after an uneventful passage, dispersed east of Aden on 28 October.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=91}} Later on 21 October, three [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] bombers of [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45 Squadron]] found and bombed the wreck of ''Francesco Nullo''.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=248}} The Italians made another fruitless sortie on 3 December, cancelled one in January 1941 after ''Daniele Manin'' was damaged by a bomb and on 24 January, sortied again with no result.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=105}}\n\n===Attack on Convoy BN 14===\nOn the night of {{nowrap|2/3 February}} 1941, the Italian destroyers ''Pantera'', ''Tigre'' and ''Nazario Sauro'' sailed from Massawa, to intercept a convoy known to be in the area. BN 14 consisted of 39 merchant ships escorted by the cruiser ''Caledon'', the destroyer ''Kingston'' and the sloops ''Indus'' and ''Shoreham''. ''Sauro'' sighted the convoy and fired three torpedoes, then fired again at a ship seen in a cloud of smoke, before turning away at high speed. The two other ships did not receive the sighting report from ''Sauro'' but ten minutes later ''Pantera'' saw the ships and fired torpedoes, hearing explosions and claiming probables on two merchantmen; ''Tigre'' failed to find the convoy. Close to the Massawa in the South Channel, ''Nazario Sauro'' ran into ''Kingston'' but had run out of torpedoes. Fearful that the British were trying to spring ambush, the other Italian ships converged on ''Nazario Sauro'' and called by wireless for air cover at dawn, reaching port unharmed. Local Italian press reports claimed that two ships had been hit but this report was mistaken.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Red Sea Flotilla]]\n* [[Costantino Borsini]]\n* [[Attack on Convoy AN 14]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bragadin|1957}}\n|last=Bragadin |first=Marc' Antonio |title=The Italian Navy in World War II |translator-last=Hoffman |translator-first=G. |year=1957 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis Maryland |oclc=924029600 |lccn=57-6515}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Campbell|1985}}\n|last=Campbell |first=John |authorlink= |title =Naval Weapons of World War Two |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-87021-459-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Gill|1957}}\n|last=Gill |first=G.
