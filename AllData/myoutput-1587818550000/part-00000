Like his contemporary Michael Mann, Stone is unusual in having written or co-written most of the films he has directed. In 1986, Stone directed two films back to back: the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'', shot largely in Mexico, and his long in-development Vietnam project ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', shot in the Philippines.\n\n''Platoon'' brought Stone's name to a much wider audience. It also finally kickstarted a busy directing career, which saw him making nine films over the next decade. Alongside some negative reaction, ''Platoon'' won many rave reviews ([[Roger Ebert]] later called it the ninth best film of the 1980s), large audiences, and Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. In 2007, a film industry vote ranked it at number 83 in an [[American Film Institute]] \"[[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]]\" poll of the previous century's best American movies. British TV channel [[Channel 4]] voted ''Platoon'' as the sixth greatest war film ever made.<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel 4's 100 Greatest War Movies of All Time |url=http://www.thependragon.co.uk/Channel4WarFilms.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> In 2019, ''Platoon'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Chow\">{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Andrew R. |date=December 11, 2019 |title=See the 25 New Additions to the National Film Registry, From Purple Rain to Clerks |url=https://time.com/5747503/national-film-registry-2019-additions/ |magazine=Time |location=New York, NY |access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Platoon'' was the first of three films Stone has made about the [[Vietnam War]]: the others were ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' and ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'', each dealing with different aspects of the war. ''Platoon'' is a semi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat; ''Born on the Fourth of July'' is based on the [[Born on the Fourth of July|autobiography]] of US Marine turned peace campaigner [[Ron Kovic]]; ''Heaven & Earth'' is based on the memoir ''[[When Heaven and Earth Changed Places]]'', in which [[Le Ly Hayslip]] recalls her life as a Vietnamese village girl drastically affected by the war and who finds another life in the USA.\n\nStone also directed ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', which was released in December 1987. Lead performer [[Michael Douglas]] received an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as a ruthless Wall Street corporate raider, and ''[[Talk Radio (film)|Talk Radio]]'', based on [[Eric Bogosian]]'s Pulitzer-nominated play.\n\n===1990s===\n''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', released in 1991, received criticism from former Doors keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] during a question and answer session at [[Indiana University East]] in 1997. During the discussion, Manzarek stated that he sat down with Stone about [[The Doors]] and [[Jim Morrison]] for over 12 hours. [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison]]\u2014a rock critic and author\u2014was a consultant on the movie, in which she makes a cameo appearance, but she writes in her memoir ''[[Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison]]'' (Dutton, 1992) that Stone ignored everything she told him and proceeded with his own version of events. From the moment the movie was released, she blasted it as untruthful and inaccurate.<ref>\"She Slams 'Doors' on Portrayal,\" ''[[New York Post]]'', (March 1991)</ref> The other surviving former members of the band, [[John Densmore]] and [[Robby Krieger]], also cooperated with the filming of ''Doors'', but Krieger distanced himself from the work before the film's release. However, Densmore thought highly of the film, and in fact celebrated its DVD release on a panel with Oliver Stone.\n\nDuring this same period, Stone directed one of his most ambitious, controversial and successful films: ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', that depicts the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963. In 1991, Stone showed ''JFK'' to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on [[Capitol Hill]], which helped lead to passage of the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:SJ00282:@@@D&summ2=m& |title=Bill Summary & Status \u2013 102nd Congress (1991\u20131992) \u2013 S.J.RES.282 \u2013 CRS Summary&nbsp;\u2013 THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref> of 1992.

Before it was released, the [[MPAA]] gave the film a NC-17 rating; this caused Stone to cut four minutes of film footage in order to obtain an R rating (he eventually released the unrated version on VHS and DVD in 2001). The film was the recipient of the Grand Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000681/1994/1/|title=Venice Film Festival (1994)|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> that year.\n\nStone went on to direct the 1995 [[Richard Nixon]] biopic ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', which was nominated for Oscars for script, [[John Williams]]' score, [[Joan Allen]] as Pat Nixon and [[Anthony Hopkins]]' portrait of the title role. Stone followed ''Nixon'' with the 1997 road movie/film noir, ''[[U Turn (1997 film)|U Turn]]'', and 1999's ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'', a film about power struggles within and without an [[American football]] team.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Oliver Stone and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.jpg|thumb|Stone and [[Argentina]]'s President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]], January 14, 2009]]\nAfter a period from 1986 to 1999, where he released a new film at least every 1\u20132 years, Stone slowed down in the 2000s, though still finding some success.\n\nIn 2004, Stone directed the critically savaged ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]''.

Like his contemporary Michael Mann, Stone is unusual in having written or co-written most of the films he has directed. In 1986, Stone directed two films back to back: the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'', shot largely in Mexico, and his long in-development Vietnam project ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', shot in the Philippines.\n\n''Platoon'' brought Stone's name to a much wider audience. It also finally kickstarted a busy directing career, which saw him making nine films over the next decade. Alongside some negative reaction, ''Platoon'' won many rave reviews ([[Roger Ebert]] later called it the ninth best film of the 1980s), large audiences, and Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. In 2007, a film industry vote ranked it at number 83 in an [[American Film Institute]] \"[[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]]\" poll of the previous century's best American movies. British TV channel [[Channel 4]] voted ''Platoon'' as the sixth greatest war film ever made.<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel 4's 100 Greatest War Movies of All Time |url=http://www.thependragon.co.uk/Channel4WarFilms.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> In 2019, ''Platoon'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Chow\">{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Andrew R. |date=December 11, 2019 |title=See the 25 New Additions to the National Film Registry, From Purple Rain to Clerks |url=https://time.com/5747503/national-film-registry-2019-additions/ |magazine=Time |location=New York, NY |access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Platoon'' was the first of three films Stone has made about the [[Vietnam War]]: the others were ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' and ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'', each dealing with different aspects of the war. ''Platoon'' is a semi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat; ''Born on the Fourth of July'' is based on the [[Born on the Fourth of July|autobiography]] of US Marine turned peace campaigner [[Ron Kovic]]; ''Heaven & Earth'' is based on the memoir ''[[When Heaven and Earth Changed Places]]'', in which [[Le Ly Hayslip]] recalls her life as a Vietnamese village girl drastically affected by the war and who finds another life in the USA.\n\nStone also directed ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', which was released in December 1987. Lead performer [[Michael Douglas]] received an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as a ruthless Wall Street corporate raider, and ''[[Talk Radio (film)|Talk Radio]]'', based on [[Eric Bogosian]]'s Pulitzer-nominated play.\n\n===1990s===\n''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', released in 1991, received criticism from former Doors keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] during a question and answer session at [[Indiana University East]] in 1997. During the discussion, Manzarek stated that he sat down with Stone about [[The Doors]] and [[Jim Morrison]] for over 12 hours. [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison]]\u2014a rock critic and author\u2014was a consultant on the movie, in which she makes a cameo appearance, but she writes in her memoir ''[[Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison]]'' (Dutton, 1992) that Stone ignored everything she told him and proceeded with his own version of events. From the moment the movie was released, she blasted it as untruthful and inaccurate.<ref>\"She Slams 'Doors' on Portrayal,\" ''[[New York Post]]'', (March 1991)</ref> The other surviving former members of the band, [[John Densmore]] and [[Robby Krieger]], also cooperated with the filming of ''Doors'', but Krieger distanced himself from the work before the film's release. However, Densmore thought highly of the film, and in fact celebrated its DVD release on a panel with Oliver Stone.\n\nDuring this same period, Stone directed one of his most ambitious, controversial and successful films: ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', that depicts the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963.
