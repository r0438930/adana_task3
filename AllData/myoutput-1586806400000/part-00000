The film was made during one of the most difficult periods in the history of the [[Balkans]]. Its quirky humor marked the beginning of the end for the country it celebrates and mercilessly criticises at the same time.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is set in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist-ruled Yugoslavia]] during the 1950s. Zoran is an overweight 10-year-old living in an overcrowded home that his parents share with his grandmother, aunt and uncle. In the early communist era of Yugoslavia, many homes were taken away from their owners in the Land Reform programs. His parents are artists, and do not get along with his aunt and uncle, who think that they are communists. \n\nZoran's family is opposed to [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s rule, while little Zoran sees Tito as his personal hero. He's learned in school that Tito is the greatest man ever, and he daydreams about meeting him. One day, Zoran writes a composition called \"Why I Like the President\", which is judged the best of those submitted by Belgrade's schoolchildren. He wins a week's camping trip with other children of families favored by the regime, the trip's highlight being a reception at Tito's palace. His crush, Jasna, an orphan girl, also is going on this trip. \n\nThe camping trip is led by a man named Raja, who quickly seems to be insane. The trip becomes increasingly absurd, with Raja and one of older boys Kengur (kagaroo, a nickname given his height) pretend to be ghosts to scare the kids while they are staying in a historic castle. \n\nZoran is exposed by Raja for stealing a ring to give Jasna. He is going to be sent home on a train, and as he waits, a girl who is friendly with him walks over to his side. All of the students join, leaving only Raja and Jasna opposing him. They finish the journey and arrive at Tito's childhood home, and Zoran is asked to give a speech. He corrects his poem by saying that he in fact does love his parents more than Tito, and stating that he doesn't even like Tito that much. \n\nThe film ends with a banquet where all of the kids get to meet Tito, but Zoran is disillusioned and doesn't really care to meet him.\n\n==Awards==\n*[[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|Silver Seashell]] for Best Director: Goran Markovi\u0107\n*[[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|Silver Seashell]] for juvenile acting: Dimitrije Vojnov\n\n==Cast==\n*Ilija Ba\u0161i\u0107 as first agent\n*[[Olja Be\u0107kovi\u0107]] as \u0110ura's mother\n*[[Voja Brajovi\u0107]] as [[Josip Broz Tito]]\n*Branimir Brstina as Strahinja\n*Milutin Dap\u010devi\u0107 as Kengur\n*[[Bogdan Dikli\u0107]] as uncle\n*[[Anica Dobra]] as mother\n*Ljiljana Dragutinovi\u0107 as aunt\n*Neboj\u0161a Dugali\u0107 as policeman\n*Du\u0161an Jak\u0161i\u0107 as second agent\n*[[Miki Manojlovi\u0107]] as father\n*[[Olivera Markovi\u0107]] as granny\n*[[Rade Markovi\u0107]] as grandpa\n*Jelena Mrdak as Ljilja\n*[[Dragan Nikoli\u0107]] as Gane's father\n*Uro\u0161 Nikoli\u0107 as \u0110ura\n*[[Lazar Ristovski]] as Raja\n*Goran Smigi\u0107 as Zoran's colleague\n*[[Milivoje Tomi\u0107]] as custos\n*Miodrag Tomovi\u0107 as Tito's adjutant\n*[[Vesna Trivali\u0107]] as teacher\n*[[Dimitrije Vojnov]] as Zoran\n*Milena Vukosav as Jasna\n*Jelena \u017divkovi\u0107 as Svetlana\n*Zarko Lausevic as Borko\n\n==Production==\nScenes depicting [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] were filmed on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]], in Serbia, because the [[War in Croatia]] already started when the filming took place.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.b92.net/zivot/licni_prostor.php?yyyy=2013&mm=11&dd=16&nav_id=777930 | title=Goran Markovi\u0107: Uspeh korumpira, neuspeh \u010deli\u010di | publisher=[[B92]] | date=16 November 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2014 | author=Nje\u017ei\u0107, Tatjana |trans-title=Goran Markovi\u0107: Success Corrupts, Failure Makes You Stronger}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Yugoslav films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web | url=http://www.rts.rs/page/tv/ci/story/17/%D0%A0%D0%A2%D0%A1+1/1330370/%D0%A2%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE+%D0%B8+%D1%98%D0%B0.html | title=\u0422\u0438\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0458\u0430 | publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]] | date=25 May 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2014 |trans-title=Tito and Me|language=Serbian}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0105602|title=Tito i ja}}\n\n{{Goran Markovi\u0107}}\n\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Serbian-language films]]\n[[Category:Serbian films]]\n[[Category:Serbian comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Yugoslavia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Yugoslav films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Goran Markovi\u0107]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Josip Broz Tito]]\n[[Category:Yugoslav comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about Josip Broz Tito]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n  | name = \u0422\u0438\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0458\u0430<br>Tito i ja<br>Tito and me\n  | image = Tito_i_ja.jpg\n  | director = [[Goran Markovi\u0107 (film director)|Goran Markovi\u0107]]\n  | producer = [[Goran Markovi\u0107 (film director)|Goran Markovi\u0107]]<br>[[Zoran Masirevi\u0107]]<br>[[Michel Mavros]]<br>[[Zoran Tasi\u0107]]\n  | writer = [[Goran Markovi\u0107 (film director)|Goran Markovi\u0107]]\n  | starring  = [[Dimitrije Vojnov]]<br>[[Lazar Ristovski]]<br>[[Miki Manojlovi\u0107]]<br>[[Anica Dobra]]<br>[[Voja Brajovi\u0107]]\n  | music = [[Zoran Simjanovi\u0107]]\n  | cinematography = [[Radoslav Vladi\u0107]]\n  | editing = [[Snezana Ivanovi\u0107]]\n  | distributor = [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]]\n  | released = 1992\n  | runtime =  104 min.
