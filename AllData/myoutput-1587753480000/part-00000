He is popular among the residents of Halloween Town, due to his charming personality and aim to please. Despite a lack of inhibition, he means well. He is in charge of [[Halloween]]. Having not left it within many years (as heard in the song Jack's Lament where he mentions England, Kentucky and France), he felt his inspiration for his own holiday waning. Christmas Town gave him new ideas and inspiration. He also appears in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''.<ref>Ed. H.

She is a very pretty, loving, caring, and shy [[rag doll]] who told Jack that Christmas and Halloween shouldn't be mixed. She is originally patched together by Doctor Finkelstein. Sally is the only one to have doubts about Jack's Christmas plan. Although her creator attempts to keep her constantly imprisoned, she often manages escape by slipping him deadly nightshade, causing him to fall asleep. Nightshade is a flower that grows atop the grave of a dead witch, as seen before Jack's first song which induces temporary somnolence upon consumption. This becomes essential to Sally managing to trick the Doctor and escape. Despite her makeshift appearance, Sally is a determined individual with a good feel for what is right. [[Fiona Apple]] provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on the 2006 special edition of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'', while [[Amy Lee]] provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on ''[[Nightmare Revisited]]''. She also appears in ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''.<ref>Ed. H. Leigh Davis, \"Sally,\" ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge Official Strategy Guide'' (Indianapolis: Pearson Education, 2006), 6.</ref>\n\nSally is a [[rag doll]]-type character, with detachable limbs stuffed with fall leaves. She often falls apart, requiring her to sew herself back together, and carries a set of sewing needles and thread for precisely that purpose. She was created by [[Doctor Finklestein]], Halloween Town's resident [[mad scientist]], as a companion. Their relationship is rather tense, as Finklestein insists on keeping Sally under lock and key, under the pretext of protecting her from the excitement of the outside world. However Sally is restless, and is intrigued by the wonders of the outside world.\n\nIt is this restlessness, or, more specifically, this desire for something better in her life, that draws her to [[Jack Skellington]]. In the beginning of the movie, she idolizes and admires Jack much like any of the other female members of Halloween Town; however, she quickly discovers that they are connected by the desire for something more in their lives, and her feelings for him intensify. The two refer to each other as \"friends\", though Jack seems unaware of Sally's true feelings for him, as she is too shy to make them known to him other than through her sweet actions, however this could be argued because after Boogie's defeat, Jack and Sally are left alone and Jack sees that Sally tried her best to help him. Thus prompting him to finally realize how much she cares for him and how much he loves her in return.\n\nOn the album to the film it is mentioned that years later Sandy Claws returned to Halloween Town and saw that Jack now had four or five skeleton children of his own. Many fans of the film and of the franchise assume that given the ending to the film, that Jack and Sally eventually got married and had a family of their own.\n\nBryan Theiss declares that \"Sally is one of those rare fantasy characters we can relate to on a certain level as much as we can to real-world characters on a more literal level.\"<ref>Bryan Theiss, ''The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0qiQLs-6SocC&pg=PA35&dq=Sally+%22Nightmare+Before+Christmas%22+greatest+characters#v=onepage&q=&f=false 35].</ref>\n\nSally's voice was played by [[Catherine O'Hara]] throughout the movie,<ref name=\"clute\"/><ref name=\"beck\"/> and [[Kath Soucie]] in the video game spin-offs.\n\n===Oogie Boogie===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Oogie Boogie\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Ken Page]]\n| species     = [[Bogeyman]]\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Oogie Boogie''' (voiced by [[Ken Page (actor)|Ken Page]] in all of his appearances<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\">Jerry Beck, ''The Animated Movie Guide: The Ultimate Illustrated Reference to Cartoon, Stop-motion, And Computer-generated Feature Films'' (Chicago Review Press, 2005), p. [https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/179 <!-- quote=\"Catherine O'Hara\" Sally. --> 179].</ref>) is the main [[antagonist]] of the franchise. The character resembles a large burlap sack; when Oogie Boogie is defeated, it is revealed that he is a colony of bugs wrapped in sacking.\n\nOogie Boogie did not appear in Tim Burton's original poem, but Burton later sketched a portrait of what appeared to be a potato sack man with horrible things inside.<ref name=\"NBC\">{{cite book |title=Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas |last=Thompson |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Thompson|year=1993 |publisher=Disney Enterprises |location=114 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York |isbn=0-7868-5378-6 |page=67}}</ref> The Oogie puppet was two feet high, twice the height of the other puppets.<ref name=\"NBC\"/> In his autobiography ''Burton on Burton'', Burton says that Oogie Boogie was loosely inspired by [[Cab Calloway]]'s 1932 appearance in a [[Betty Boop]] cartoon, and that he asked [[Danny Elfman]] to make Oogie's song in ''Nightmare'' slightly resemble Calloway's 1931 recording of the song \"[[Minnie the Moocher]]\". Elfman ended up referencing the [[Betty Boop]] cartoon ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'' (1933), also featuring Calloway; Santa's line \"Well, what are you going to do?\" and Oogie Boogie's response of \"I'm gonna do the best I can!\" are direct quotes from this cartoon. Another idea for Oogie's identity was for him to be Dr. Finklestein in disguise, gaining revenge on Jack and Sally, but it was not pursued past storyboards since Tim Burton scrapped the idea. This is visible on the Special Edition DVD.\n\nDespite the fact that Oogie is separated for the most part from the other inhabitants of Halloween Town, it appears they still allow him to take part in their celebration (most likely due to the Bogeyman's popular depiction of being involved with nightmares), as his shadow makes an appearance on the moon (before it dissolves into bats) in the opening musical \"[[This Is Halloween]]\" as \"the shadow on the moon at night, filling your dreams to the brim with fright.\" (In the version of \"This Is Halloween\" that was heard on ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', a different voice was heard when it came to the shadow on the moon part.) He, meanwhile, lives in an underground lair full of torture devices, each of which features a casino-like appearance, suggesting an addiction to gambling (this is enforced by his use of dice). Red skeletons \u2013 implied to be the remains of previous victims \u2013 are in several of the devices, and overhanging chains are used as perches by skeletal bats. Oogie Boogie's lair, during his theme song, is lit with [[black light]]s in the style of a cheap funhouse. Under these, Oogie himself [[Fluorescence|glows bright green]], similar to a [[glow stick]]. After the lights dim, however, the bright color is sapped from his lair, transforming its appearance into that of a dank, cellar-like dungeon. Above his lair is the clubhouse of [[#Lock, Shock and Barrel|Lock, Shock, and Barrel]], who feed him bugs regularly via a metal chute. It is at first believed that Oogie cannot be killed or die but it is later revealed he can if his brain, the lead bug, is destroyed. In the movie, Lock, Shock and Barrel kidnap [[#Santa Claus|Santa Claus]] and (against the wishes of Jack, who holds Oogie in great contempt) send him down to Oogie Boogie's lair, where he is bound to a giant [[roulette]] wheel. According to deleted song material (found in the soundtrack version), Oogie plans to add \"Sandy Claws\" to his new and \"special batch of Snake and Spider Stew\", \"to add a little Spice\". Sally, after finding out Santa's fate, attempts to rescue him but is captured herself. Oogie then tortures and tries to kill Sally and Santa Claus, but is foiled by Jack, who eventually pulls a thread loose from him, which rips off the sack covering him and causes the majority of his bugs to fall into the lava pit. The lead bug is then squashed by Santa after it falls next to the pit. The rest of the bugs scurry off after this.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King'', Oogie's origins and the birth of his rivalry with Jack were revealed. As it turns out, he once had his own holiday named Bug Day that was (most likely) forgotten by the people of the real world and thus vanished. Oogie escaped, found Halloween Town, and decided that it would be the new Bug Day. He and his army of [[insect]]s invaded the town and nearly took it over. Jack found out and he defeated the bugs and Oogie. Oogie survived the battle, learned to fear the Pumpkin King, and was imprisoned within his underground lair of which Jack warns that if Oogie ever leave his lair, it would be \"game over!\" for him (Oogie). Oogie complied, but secretly vowed revenge.\n\nIn the 2004 video game ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', Oogie is resurrected by his henchmen Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who sew him back together. He quickly deceives the residents of Halloween Town and tricks the townspeople into making traps for Jack, stating that Jack wouldn't return if they don't make an even scarier Halloween for next year. Oogie then attempts to become the Seven Holidays King, successfully kidnaps the real leaders, and tries to murder Santa Claus again. His plans are foiled by Jack. Desperate, Oogie puts up a fight in the Holiday Trash Hill (where all the holiday worlds' garbage goes) by turning into a gigantic junk-filled version of himself named \"Mega-Oogie.\" He is again destroyed when his bugs come out of him.\n\nOogie also appears with other [[Disney Villains]] at Halloween events such as the [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]] at [[Disneyland]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]], the ''[[HalloWishes]]'' and ''[[Halloween Screams]]'' fireworks shows at the [[Magic Kingdom]] and Disneyland, respectively, ''[[World of Color|World of Color: Villainous]]'' at [[Disney California Adventure]], and during the \"[[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]]\",  \"[[Mickey's Halloween Party]]\", and \"[[Mickey's Halloween Party|Oogie Boogie Bash]]\" separate-admission (\"hard ticket\") events.\n\nOogie Boogie also appears in the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' as a member of [[Maleficent]]'s team of Disney villains. He appears again in the sequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' where he attempts to turn Santa Claus into a Heartless, and in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' as an enemy based on Sora's memories of him.\n\n===Doctor Finklestein===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Doctor Finklestein\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] (film)<br/>[[Jess Harnell]] (video games)\n| species     = Humanoid\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Doctor Finklestein''' is a resident of Halloween Town. He is the [[mad scientist]] and the \"father\" of Sally. He is described as a pale-as-a-sheet mad scientist with a duckbill-like mouth and a hinged skullcap that he can open up to reveal his brain. For unknown reasons, he uses a motorized [[wheelchair]] (early drawings of Finklestein depict him standing freely and his original [[action figure]] followed this example, implying he was not always intended to be a wheelchair user). Finklestein is only referred to as the \"Evil Scientist\" in the credits. His true name is only mentioned in the movie when the Mayor calls him up to the front of the line for his Christmas assignment.\n\nDoctor Finklestein lives in a large observatory with his living rag doll creation Sally<ref>'''Doctor Finklestein :''' That's twice this month since you slipped deadly nightshade in my tea and run off.<br/>'''Sally:''' (''correcting him'') Three times.<br/>'''Doctor Finklestein :''' You're mine, you know! I made you! With my own hands...<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\"> (''The Nightmare Before Christmas'')</span></ref> and his hunchbacked assistant Igor. [[James Whale]]'s [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] is quoted in Finklestein's line \"I made you with my own hands\" which is ironic as Finklestein's body appears to be largely if not entirely artificial. Unlike Frankenstein who takes no responsibility for his creations and disowns them almost as soon as they are completed (much like the original [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]), Finklestein takes full responsibility over Sally and acts as an over-protective father and in some ways an overbearing husband (thus explaining Sally's attempts to run away) by keeping her under lock and key under the pretext of sheltering her from the world. In addition to being an overbearing and antagonistic father figure for Sally to overcome, Finklestein also has a hand in helping [[Jack Skellington]] (of whom he seems to be very fond) with his plan to take over Christmas by bringing to life several skeletal [[reindeer]] to pull Jack's [[sleigh]]. At the end of the film, Finklestein, deciding that Sally is too much of a handful, creates a wife for himself using a portion of his own brain.\n\nDr. Finklestein is featured in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''. When Jack is tired of doing the same thing at Halloween, Dr. Finklestein helps him by giving him the Soul Robber, a weapon that allows Jack to change its shape. Jack also tells Dr. Finklestein to watch over the town while he is away. After Oogie Boogie's revival, Dr. Finklestein was under Oogie's control by switching his brain to a different one and created monsters that obey Oogie Boogie's every command. When Jack confronted Dr. Finklestein and found that his brain has been switched, he started a plan to get rid of it by using the \"sleeping soup\" that Sally gave him. Jack was able to put Dr. Finklestein's original brain back in place making Dr. Finklestein break from Oogie's control. In the game spin-offs, Finklestein's name is pronounced \"steen\" instead of \"stein\". For some reason, his wife creation \"Jewel\" is not present in the game, and Sally appears to still be living with him even though in the movie she appeared to be free at the end. Sally even says \"He insists on keeping me locked up\" while next to the Hanging Tree in the Graveyard.\n\nFinklestein also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and other games in the series. When the Heartless appear in Halloween Town, Jack thinks of adding them to the Halloween celebrations and asks Dr. Finklestein for advice. Realizing that the Heartless need a heart, the two find the ingredients for one: pulse and emotion (terror, fear, hope, and despair). Their initial experiment fails, and Dr. Finklestein sends Jack off with [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Sora|Sora]] and the gang to retrieve two more ingredients, memory and surprise, thus completing the heart. However, the heart is stolen by Oogie Boogie. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', created from Sora's memories, Dr. Finklestein creates a potion that allows people to see their true memory. The only problem is that once he sniffed the potion, Heartless appeared. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' Finklestein creates an experiment aided by Lock, Shock, and Barrel. As the Experiment has no heart, it goes on a rampage to steal gifts, in an attempt to understand the emotions behind giving and gain a heart of its own. Sadly, Sora and the gang have no choice but to destroy the Experiment.\n\nDr. Finklestein was voiced by [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] in the film<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> and by [[Jess Harnell]] in the video game spin-offs. His Japanese voice is provided by [[Y\u016bji Mitsuya]].\n\n===Mayor of Halloween Town===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = The Mayor of Halloween Town\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice = [[Glenn Shadix]] (film, ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', ''Oogie's Revenge'')<br/>[[Jeff Bennett]] (''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'')\n| species     = Two-faced humanoid\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''The [[Mayor]] of Halloween Town''' is depicted as a short, fat man, who has the appearance of a giant [[candy corn]] with a cone-shaped head, wearing an impossibly tall [[top hat]], a spider [[bolo tie]], and a ribbon of office that says \"Mayor\" on it. His cone-shaped head has two faces: One face is peach-skinned, rosy-cheeked, and smiling while the other face is white-skinned, pale and frowning with pointed teeth. Depending on the Mayor's mood, his head swivels around to display the right face with a loud clicking sound. When not in use, the other face has its eyes closed and is considered dormant. This split personality is likely inspired by a literal interpretation of the phrase \"two-faced politicians\".\n\nDespite his office, the Mayor apparently has very little actual authority in the day-to-day running of the town, or has very little confidence in his leadership skills, especially in planning for [[Halloween]]. This is attested when he arrives at [[Jack Skellington]]'s house to discuss some plans with him, not knowing that Jack is not home. When Jack does not answer, the Mayor quickly gets hysterical and yells, more to himself than anyone, \"Jack, please, I'm only an ''elected'' official here! I can't make decisions by myself!\". Nonetheless, the Mayor seems to enjoy his position. He apparently owns the only automobile in town, a [[hearse]]-like car called the \"Mayor-mobile\" that is equipped with a loudspeaker for making announcements and a black cat-shaped hood ornament that sounds a siren when its tail is cranked. The Mayor supports Jack and helps him in his quest to bring his own version of [[Christmas]] to the world, despite his secret misgivings about it. When Jack is apparently killed by the [[United States Army|US Army]], the Mayor openly admits he had a bad feeling about \"this Christmas thing\" and sorrowfully goes off in his Mayor-mobile to make the announcement throughout Halloween Town and the surrounding countryside that \"the king of Halloween has been blown to smithereens\". Later, he is told by Lock, Shock, and Barrel that Jack is in over his head and alive, and comes to retrieve him and Sally after Oogie Boogie has been defeated. The Mayor of Halloween Town is among the citizens surprised (and once again uneasy) when it starts snowing in Halloween Town, but when he catches a snowflake on his tongue, his head swivels around to reveal his pleased expression.\n\nThe Mayor of Halloween Town appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. His role in both games is fairly minor. In the first game, he helps Jack and Sora find an ingredient they need for the heart Dr. Finklestein is making. In the second game, he tries to stop two Heartless outbreaks by yelling at the Heartless through his megaphone, but has no success.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', the Mayor is seen in the opening cut scene congratulating Jack on another \"horrible\" Halloween. He is later seen in the level \"Mayor's Madhouse\" where Jack rescues him from a cage hanging from the roof of his house. While Jack goes to Christmas Town, the Mayor frees the other holiday leaders.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Glenn Shadix]] in the film, ''Oogie's Revenge'', and ''Kingdom Hearts II''.<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> and by [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''Kingdom Hearts''. His Japanese voice actor is [[T\u014dru \u014chira]].\n\n===Lock, Shock and Barrel===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Lock, Shock, and Barrel\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Paul Reubens]] (Lock)<br/> [[Catherine O'Hara]] (Shock)<br/> [[Danny Elfman]] (Barrel) \n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Lock, Shock, and Barrel''' are introduced as [[#Oogie Boogie|Oogie Boogie]]'s \"little henchmen\", being 6, 7 and 5 years old respectively. The trio are not very loyal to Oogie, as they are simply making mischief both for their own fun and to stay on his good side (in other words, they serve him out of fear) and after his death they just have harmless fun, which they seem to enjoy more. However, this is contrasted by their lack of common sense as, presumably due to their lust for mischief they have shown no protest when their master was revived in the spinoffs, and once out of boredom revived him themselves in \"[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge|Oogie's Revenge]]\". They all three are [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treaters]], with masks similar to their faces (e.g. Barrel's skeleton mask is large and round to fit his face, with a huge grin on it like his near-permanent creepy smile). Their names are a play on the phrase, \"[[wiktionary:lock, stock and barrel|lock, stock, and barrel]].\" Though not totally antagonistic, they are usually the comedy relief. They appear to be Anti-heroes or merely neutral characters, as they'll work for most of those who summon them.\n\n* '''Lock''' is the leader of Oogie's Boys, but does not always think through things thoroughly and just likes to be in charge. Lock wears a red [[devil]] costume; his tail is a real devil's tail, his [[teeth]] are pointed sharply. His face is narrow and long-jawed with angular features, and his red and brown [[hair]] is formed into two [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] making him, literally, a handsome devil. He likes to think highly of himself and gets upset when others insult him or take the lead; however, he goes along with others' ideas if he fails to come up with anything himself.\n* '''Shock''' is the only female of Oogie's henchmen. She is the oldest, and the most cunning and intelligent of the three. She has some [[contempt]] for the other two and their supposed stupidity, although she often gets tired with them. Shock wears a purple witch costume with an elongated hat and she sometimes carries a broomstick. She has a high-pitched girl's voice, green skin, a pointed nose, and purple wirey hair. She often takes the lead in many plans and likes to be right.\n* '''Barrel''' - is Oogie's \"star pupil,\" presumably the youngest, and considered the stupidest of the three troublemakers, despite his protests to the contrary. He is the butt of many jokes made by his friends, but usually gets even through his own tricks which he always gets away with. Barrel wears a skeleton costume and has deformed feet and almost always carries an orange and black lolipop, otherwise resembling a small human boy, albeit one with white [[human skin|skin]], sunken [[human eye|eye]]s, and perfectly coiffed green hair. His face is round and has a perpetual grin, except when he is angry or scared. Barrel usually pilots the walking bathtub the trio use as transport. He also unintentionally bothers [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] when asking him a number of annoying questions. Often he gets left out of things because he is forever falling over his own deformed feet and he is sometimes slow to catch on.\n\nInstructing them to \"leave that no-account [[Oogie Boogie]] OUT of this!\" (they promise to do so, but cross their fingers behind their backs), [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] sends Lock, Shock, and Barrel to \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\" (the Halloween Town residents' mistaken name for [[Santa Claus]]). At first, they accidentally capture the [[Easter Bunny]], whereupon Jack tells them to apologize and sends them back. They then capture their true quarry, and Jack takes Santa's hat. The trio then take Santa Claus to Oogie's lair, where Oogie taunts and threatens Santa. Once Jack has defeated Oogie and rescued Santa Claus, a hatch above opens and Lock, Shock, and Barrel appear now protagonists, having led the [[Mayor (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Mayor]] to Oogie's lair to find them.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King'', Oogie Boogie sends Lock, Shock, and Barrel out to nab the new \"Pumpkin King.\" They come back with Sally instead, saying she looked like Jack in the dark. Throughout the game, they are behind most of the ruckus going on around town ranging from poisoning the [[acid]] pools, driving the [[leech]]es crazy, knocking down the town's [[street light|street lamps]], luring Jack into [[death]] traps, and helping Oogie in the final battle.\n\nIn ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'', Lock, Shock, and Barrel decide to revive Oogie Boogie when they learn that Jack is temporarily leaving Halloween Town. In the game, Jack encounters the three one by one. In chapter 15, the threesome try to stop Jack a final time in their mobile bathtub on top of the Mayor of Halloween Town's house. He defeats them yet they spring a trap and drop him into a [[maze]] in Oogie's lair. They do not appear again in the game afterwards.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', after hearing Jack speak of a heart that can control the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Heartless and Nobodies|Heartless]], Oogie sends the three out to steal the heart as part of his plan to take over Halloween Town. After the three are defeated by [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], they confess that Oogie made them do it. Later in the game, they comment how quiet Halloween Town has become without Oogie and consider making a ruckus just to liven things up. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', the three found a Heartless and raised it before it became too big for them to control.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Lock, Shock, and Barrel start off working as [[Doctor Finklestein]]'s (Not very obedient) lab assistants, until they encounter [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], who revives Oogie Boogie for them and gives them the \"Prison Keeper\" Heartless to hold off Sora and company. The monster keeps the children in a cage underneath its body, but swallows one of them to act as its \"pilot\", each giving the monster a different ability and appearance, ultimately swallowing all three of them attacking [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and party with its full repertoire. After its defeat, the trio run off saying it was 'fun' and unintentionally reveal Oogie's return. In the second visit, the three are accused of stealing presents after they enter Santa's workshop and are caught looking through gifts. Sora and the party have to fight these mischievous rascals by knocking them unconscious and putting them in boxes. In the end, the three claim that they did not steal the presents as they regard Christmas toys to be boring while revealing that they were actually looking for parts for Doctor Finklestein's Experiment. They also cause mischief as obstacles in the \"Making Presents\" mini game, before and after the fight with the Experiment. After the battle, they run off and are not seen again in the game.\n\nDespite having apparently reformed at the end of the film in later appearances, they have reverted to being antagonist. This suggests that they like working for Oogie Boogie more than being good.\n\nIn the movie, Lock was voiced by [[Paul Reubens]], Shock was voiced by [[Catherine O'Hara]], and Barrel was voiced by [[Danny Elfman]].<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> In the Kingdom Hearts series, Lock was voiced by [[Jess Harnell]], Shock was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]], and Barrel was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. In ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'', Paul Reubens reprised the role of Lock, Kath Soucie reprised the role of Shock from the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, and [[Dee Bradley Baker]] voiced Barrel.\n\n===Santa Claus===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Santa Claus\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Ed Ivory]] (''The Nightmare Before Christmas'')<br/>[[Corey Burton]] (video games)\n| species     = [[Human]]\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''[[Santa Claus]]''' (or '''Sandy Claws''' as Jack calls him) is the leader of Christmas Town. When Jack stumbles upon the town, he becomes mesmerized with the holiday and he tries to bring Christmas to Halloween Town. In order to do so, Jack orders Lock, Shock, and Barrel to kidnap Santa on [[Christmas Eve]] so Jack can take his place for the Christmas season. The three then take Santa to Oogie Boogie where the holiday figure's life is threatened. A last minute rescue helps save not only Santa, but the entire holiday of Christmas as well. Santa Claus manages to round up the living gifts and replace them with the right ones. Santa Claus is last seen flying over Halloween Town as snow starts to fall.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', Oogie Boogie targets Santa Claus and leaves him hanging over the tracks for his scissor-tipped Oogie Train to drop him. Santa Claus was saved by Jack Skellington. When Oogie Boogie hijacked Santa's sleigh, Jack lets him use the same sleigh he used when Jack tried to improvise Christmas.\n\nSanta Claus appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy meet Santa Claus when they follow Jack Skellington to Christmas Town. He also made a reference about how Jack Skellington tried to improvise Christmas. Maleficent revives Oogie Boogie and sends him to capture Santa Claus. When Sora defeats Oogie Boogie, Santa Claus tells Jack that he should concentrate on Halloween and Santa should concentrate on Christmas. He also tells Sora to believe that he will meet Riku again. Later on, Santa's presents get stolen by Dr. Finklestein's Experiment. He helps Jack make decoy presents to attract the Experiment. Jack and company get them back by hiding in a decoy present. After they defeat the Experiment, Santa Claus decides to give Jack a taste of what it's like to deliver Christmas presents. When Jack finishes delivering presents, Santa takes back his sleigh and brings forth beautiful snow drops as a present to those in Halloween Town.\n\nSanta Claus is voiced by [[Ed Ivory]] in the movie and by [[Corey Burton]] in the video game spin-offs.\n\n===Zero===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Zero\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = \n| species     = Ghost Dog\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Zero''' is Jack's faithful [[ghost]] [[dog]] who floats about freely and follows Jack wherever he goes. His nose, which is in the shape of a jack-o-lantern, also doubles as a bright light.\n\nIn the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, Zero is often called upon to search for someone.

She is a very pretty, loving, caring, and shy [[rag doll]] who told Jack that Christmas and Halloween shouldn't be mixed. She is originally patched together by Doctor Finkelstein. Sally is the only one to have doubts about Jack's Christmas plan. Although her creator attempts to keep her constantly imprisoned, she often manages escape by slipping him deadly nightshade, causing him to fall asleep. Nightshade is a flower that grows atop the grave of a dead witch, as seen before Jack's first song which induces temporary somnolence upon consumption. This becomes essential to Sally managing to trick the Doctor and escape. Despite her makeshift appearance, Sally is a determined individual with a good feel for what is right. [[Fiona Apple]] provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on the 2006 special edition of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'', while [[Amy Lee]] provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on ''[[Nightmare Revisited]]''. She also appears in ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''.<ref>Ed. H. Leigh Davis, \"Sally,\" ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge Official Strategy Guide'' (Indianapolis: Pearson Education, 2006), 6.</ref>\n\nSally is a [[rag doll]]-type character, with detachable limbs stuffed with fall leaves. She often falls apart, requiring her to sew herself back together, and carries a set of sewing needles and thread for precisely that purpose. She was created by [[Doctor Finklestein]], Halloween Town's resident [[mad scientist]], as a companion. Their relationship is rather tense, as Finklestein insists on keeping Sally under lock and key, under the pretext of protecting her from the excitement of the outside world. However Sally is restless, and is intrigued by the wonders of the outside world.\n\nIt is this restlessness, or, more specifically, this desire for something better in her life, that draws her to [[Jack Skellington]]. In the beginning of the movie, she idolizes and admires Jack much like any of the other female members of Halloween Town; however, she quickly discovers that they are connected by the desire for something more in their lives, and her feelings for him intensify. The two refer to each other as \"friends\", though Jack seems unaware of Sally's true feelings for him, as she is too shy to make them known to him other than through her sweet actions, however this could be argued because after Boogie's defeat, Jack and Sally are left alone and Jack sees that Sally tried her best to help him. Thus prompting him to finally realize how much she cares for him and how much he loves her in return.\n\nOn the album to the film it is mentioned that years later Sandy Claws returned to Halloween Town and saw that Jack now had four or five skeleton children of his own. Many fans of the film and of the franchise assume that given the ending to the film, that Jack and Sally eventually got married and had a family of their own.\n\nBryan Theiss declares that \"Sally is one of those rare fantasy characters we can relate to on a certain level as much as we can to real-world characters on a more literal level.\"<ref>Bryan Theiss, ''The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0qiQLs-6SocC&pg=PA35&dq=Sally+%22Nightmare+Before+Christmas%22+greatest+characters#v=onepage&q=&f=false 35].</ref>\n\nSally's voice was played by [[Catherine O'Hara]] throughout the movie,<ref name=\"clute\"/><ref name=\"beck\"/> and [[Kath Soucie]] in the video game spin-offs.\n\n===Oogie Boogie===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Oogie Boogie\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Ken Page]]\n| species     = [[Bogeyman]]\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Oogie Boogie''' (voiced by [[Ken Page (actor)|Ken Page]] in all of his appearances<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\">Jerry Beck, ''The Animated Movie Guide: The Ultimate Illustrated Reference to Cartoon, Stop-motion, And Computer-generated Feature Films'' (Chicago Review Press, 2005), p.

The character resembles a large burlap sack; when Oogie Boogie is defeated, it is revealed that he is a colony of bugs wrapped in sacking.\n\nOogie Boogie did not appear in Tim Burton's original poem, but Burton later sketched a portrait of what appeared to be a potato sack man with horrible things inside.<ref name=\"NBC\">{{cite book |title=Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas |last=Thompson |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Thompson|year=1993 |publisher=Disney Enterprises |location=114 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York |isbn=0-7868-5378-6 |page=67}}</ref> The Oogie puppet was two feet high, twice the height of the other puppets.<ref name=\"NBC\"/> In his autobiography ''Burton on Burton'', Burton says that Oogie Boogie was loosely inspired by [[Cab Calloway]]'s 1932 appearance in a [[Betty Boop]] cartoon, and that he asked [[Danny Elfman]] to make Oogie's song in ''Nightmare'' slightly resemble Calloway's 1931 recording of the song \"[[Minnie the Moocher]]\". Elfman ended up referencing the [[Betty Boop]] cartoon ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'' (1933), also featuring Calloway; Santa's line \"Well, what are you going to do?\" and Oogie Boogie's response of \"I'm gonna do the best I can!\" are direct quotes from this cartoon. Another idea for Oogie's identity was for him to be Dr. Finklestein in disguise, gaining revenge on Jack and Sally, but it was not pursued past storyboards since Tim Burton scrapped the idea. This is visible on the Special Edition DVD.\n\nDespite the fact that Oogie is separated for the most part from the other inhabitants of Halloween Town, it appears they still allow him to take part in their celebration (most likely due to the Bogeyman's popular depiction of being involved with nightmares), as his shadow makes an appearance on the moon (before it dissolves into bats) in the opening musical \"[[This Is Halloween]]\" as \"the shadow on the moon at night, filling your dreams to the brim with fright.\" (In the version of \"This Is Halloween\" that was heard on ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', a different voice was heard when it came to the shadow on the moon part.) He, meanwhile, lives in an underground lair full of torture devices, each of which features a casino-like appearance, suggesting an addiction to gambling (this is enforced by his use of dice). Red skeletons \u2013 implied to be the remains of previous victims \u2013 are in several of the devices, and overhanging chains are used as perches by skeletal bats. Oogie Boogie's lair, during his theme song, is lit with [[black light]]s in the style of a cheap funhouse. Under these, Oogie himself [[Fluorescence|glows bright green]], similar to a [[glow stick]]. After the lights dim, however, the bright color is sapped from his lair, transforming its appearance into that of a dank, cellar-like dungeon. Above his lair is the clubhouse of [[#Lock, Shock and Barrel|Lock, Shock, and Barrel]], who feed him bugs regularly via a metal chute. It is at first believed that Oogie cannot be killed or die but it is later revealed he can if his brain, the lead bug, is destroyed. In the movie, Lock, Shock and Barrel kidnap [[#Santa Claus|Santa Claus]] and (against the wishes of Jack, who holds Oogie in great contempt) send him down to Oogie Boogie's lair, where he is bound to a giant [[roulette]] wheel. According to deleted song material (found in the soundtrack version), Oogie plans to add \"Sandy Claws\" to his new and \"special batch of Snake and Spider Stew\", \"to add a little Spice\". Sally, after finding out Santa's fate, attempts to rescue him but is captured herself. Oogie then tortures and tries to kill Sally and Santa Claus, but is foiled by Jack, who eventually pulls a thread loose from him, which rips off the sack covering him and causes the majority of his bugs to fall into the lava pit. The lead bug is then squashed by Santa after it falls next to the pit. The rest of the bugs scurry off after this.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King'', Oogie's origins and the birth of his rivalry with Jack were revealed. As it turns out, he once had his own holiday named Bug Day that was (most likely) forgotten by the people of the real world and thus vanished. Oogie escaped, found Halloween Town, and decided that it would be the new Bug Day. He and his army of [[insect]]s invaded the town and nearly took it over. Jack found out and he defeated the bugs and Oogie. Oogie survived the battle, learned to fear the Pumpkin King, and was imprisoned within his underground lair of which Jack warns that if Oogie ever leave his lair, it would be \"game over!\" for him (Oogie). Oogie complied, but secretly vowed revenge.\n\nIn the 2004 video game ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', Oogie is resurrected by his henchmen Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who sew him back together. He quickly deceives the residents of Halloween Town and tricks the townspeople into making traps for Jack, stating that Jack wouldn't return if they don't make an even scarier Halloween for next year. Oogie then attempts to become the Seven Holidays King, successfully kidnaps the real leaders, and tries to murder Santa Claus again. His plans are foiled by Jack. Desperate, Oogie puts up a fight in the Holiday Trash Hill (where all the holiday worlds' garbage goes) by turning into a gigantic junk-filled version of himself named \"Mega-Oogie.\" He is again destroyed when his bugs come out of him.\n\nOogie also appears with other [[Disney Villains]] at Halloween events such as the [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]] at [[Disneyland]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]], the ''[[HalloWishes]]'' and ''[[Halloween Screams]]'' fireworks shows at the [[Magic Kingdom]] and Disneyland, respectively, ''[[World of Color|World of Color: Villainous]]'' at [[Disney California Adventure]], and during the \"[[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]]\",  \"[[Mickey's Halloween Party]]\", and \"[[Mickey's Halloween Party|Oogie Boogie Bash]]\" separate-admission (\"hard ticket\") events.\n\nOogie Boogie also appears in the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' as a member of [[Maleficent]]'s team of Disney villains. He appears again in the sequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' where he attempts to turn Santa Claus into a Heartless, and in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' as an enemy based on Sora's memories of him.\n\n===Doctor Finklestein===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Doctor Finklestein\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] (film)<br/>[[Jess Harnell]] (video games)\n| species     = Humanoid\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Doctor Finklestein''' is a resident of Halloween Town. He is the [[mad scientist]] and the \"father\" of Sally. He is described as a pale-as-a-sheet mad scientist with a duckbill-like mouth and a hinged skullcap that he can open up to reveal his brain. For unknown reasons, he uses a motorized [[wheelchair]] (early drawings of Finklestein depict him standing freely and his original [[action figure]] followed this example, implying he was not always intended to be a wheelchair user). Finklestein is only referred to as the \"Evil Scientist\" in the credits. His true name is only mentioned in the movie when the Mayor calls him up to the front of the line for his Christmas assignment.\n\nDoctor Finklestein lives in a large observatory with his living rag doll creation Sally<ref>'''Doctor Finklestein :''' That's twice this month since you slipped deadly nightshade in my tea and run off.<br/>'''Sally:''' (''correcting him'') Three times.<br/>'''Doctor Finklestein :''' You're mine, you know! I made you! With my own hands...<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\"> (''The Nightmare Before Christmas'')</span></ref> and his hunchbacked assistant Igor. [[James Whale]]'s [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] is quoted in Finklestein's line \"I made you with my own hands\" which is ironic as Finklestein's body appears to be largely if not entirely artificial. Unlike Frankenstein who takes no responsibility for his creations and disowns them almost as soon as they are completed (much like the original [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]), Finklestein takes full responsibility over Sally and acts as an over-protective father and in some ways an overbearing husband (thus explaining Sally's attempts to run away) by keeping her under lock and key under the pretext of sheltering her from the world. In addition to being an overbearing and antagonistic father figure for Sally to overcome, Finklestein also has a hand in helping [[Jack Skellington]] (of whom he seems to be very fond) with his plan to take over Christmas by bringing to life several skeletal [[reindeer]] to pull Jack's [[sleigh]]. At the end of the film, Finklestein, deciding that Sally is too much of a handful, creates a wife for himself using a portion of his own brain.\n\nDr. Finklestein is featured in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''. When Jack is tired of doing the same thing at Halloween, Dr. Finklestein helps him by giving him the Soul Robber, a weapon that allows Jack to change its shape. Jack also tells Dr. Finklestein to watch over the town while he is away. After Oogie Boogie's revival, Dr. Finklestein was under Oogie's control by switching his brain to a different one and created monsters that obey Oogie Boogie's every command. When Jack confronted Dr. Finklestein and found that his brain has been switched, he started a plan to get rid of it by using the \"sleeping soup\" that Sally gave him. Jack was able to put Dr. Finklestein's original brain back in place making Dr. Finklestein break from Oogie's control. In the game spin-offs, Finklestein's name is pronounced \"steen\" instead of \"stein\". For some reason, his wife creation \"Jewel\" is not present in the game, and Sally appears to still be living with him even though in the movie she appeared to be free at the end. Sally even says \"He insists on keeping me locked up\" while next to the Hanging Tree in the Graveyard.\n\nFinklestein also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and other games in the series. When the Heartless appear in Halloween Town, Jack thinks of adding them to the Halloween celebrations and asks Dr. Finklestein for advice. Realizing that the Heartless need a heart, the two find the ingredients for one: pulse and emotion (terror, fear, hope, and despair). Their initial experiment fails, and Dr. Finklestein sends Jack off with [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Sora|Sora]] and the gang to retrieve two more ingredients, memory and surprise, thus completing the heart. However, the heart is stolen by Oogie Boogie. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', created from Sora's memories, Dr. Finklestein creates a potion that allows people to see their true memory. The only problem is that once he sniffed the potion, Heartless appeared. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' Finklestein creates an experiment aided by Lock, Shock, and Barrel. As the Experiment has no heart, it goes on a rampage to steal gifts, in an attempt to understand the emotions behind giving and gain a heart of its own. Sadly, Sora and the gang have no choice but to destroy the Experiment.\n\nDr. Finklestein was voiced by [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] in the film<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> and by [[Jess Harnell]] in the video game spin-offs. His Japanese voice is provided by [[Y\u016bji Mitsuya]].\n\n===Mayor of Halloween Town===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = The Mayor of Halloween Town\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice = [[Glenn Shadix]] (film, ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', ''Oogie's Revenge'')<br/>[[Jeff Bennett]] (''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'')\n| species     = Two-faced humanoid\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''The [[Mayor]] of Halloween Town''' is depicted as a short, fat man, who has the appearance of a giant [[candy corn]] with a cone-shaped head, wearing an impossibly tall [[top hat]], a spider [[bolo tie]], and a ribbon of office that says \"Mayor\" on it. His cone-shaped head has two faces: One face is peach-skinned, rosy-cheeked, and smiling while the other face is white-skinned, pale and frowning with pointed teeth. Depending on the Mayor's mood, his head swivels around to display the right face with a loud clicking sound. When not in use, the other face has its eyes closed and is considered dormant. This split personality is likely inspired by a literal interpretation of the phrase \"two-faced politicians\".\n\nDespite his office, the Mayor apparently has very little actual authority in the day-to-day running of the town, or has very little confidence in his leadership skills, especially in planning for [[Halloween]]. This is attested when he arrives at [[Jack Skellington]]'s house to discuss some plans with him, not knowing that Jack is not home. When Jack does not answer, the Mayor quickly gets hysterical and yells, more to himself than anyone, \"Jack, please, I'm only an ''elected'' official here! I can't make decisions by myself!\". Nonetheless, the Mayor seems to enjoy his position. He apparently owns the only automobile in town, a [[hearse]]-like car called the \"Mayor-mobile\" that is equipped with a loudspeaker for making announcements and a black cat-shaped hood ornament that sounds a siren when its tail is cranked. The Mayor supports Jack and helps him in his quest to bring his own version of [[Christmas]] to the world, despite his secret misgivings about it. When Jack is apparently killed by the [[United States Army|US Army]], the Mayor openly admits he had a bad feeling about \"this Christmas thing\" and sorrowfully goes off in his Mayor-mobile to make the announcement throughout Halloween Town and the surrounding countryside that \"the king of Halloween has been blown to smithereens\". Later, he is told by Lock, Shock, and Barrel that Jack is in over his head and alive, and comes to retrieve him and Sally after Oogie Boogie has been defeated. The Mayor of Halloween Town is among the citizens surprised (and once again uneasy) when it starts snowing in Halloween Town, but when he catches a snowflake on his tongue, his head swivels around to reveal his pleased expression.\n\nThe Mayor of Halloween Town appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. His role in both games is fairly minor. In the first game, he helps Jack and Sora find an ingredient they need for the heart Dr. Finklestein is making. In the second game, he tries to stop two Heartless outbreaks by yelling at the Heartless through his megaphone, but has no success.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', the Mayor is seen in the opening cut scene congratulating Jack on another \"horrible\" Halloween. He is later seen in the level \"Mayor's Madhouse\" where Jack rescues him from a cage hanging from the roof of his house. While Jack goes to Christmas Town, the Mayor frees the other holiday leaders.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Glenn Shadix]] in the film, ''Oogie's Revenge'', and ''Kingdom Hearts II''.<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> and by [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''Kingdom Hearts''. His Japanese voice actor is [[T\u014dru \u014chira]].\n\n===Lock, Shock and Barrel===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Lock, Shock, and Barrel\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Paul Reubens]] (Lock)<br/> [[Catherine O'Hara]] (Shock)<br/> [[Danny Elfman]] (Barrel) \n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Lock, Shock, and Barrel''' are introduced as [[#Oogie Boogie|Oogie Boogie]]'s \"little henchmen\", being 6, 7 and 5 years old respectively. The trio are not very loyal to Oogie, as they are simply making mischief both for their own fun and to stay on his good side (in other words, they serve him out of fear) and after his death they just have harmless fun, which they seem to enjoy more. However, this is contrasted by their lack of common sense as, presumably due to their lust for mischief they have shown no protest when their master was revived in the spinoffs, and once out of boredom revived him themselves in \"[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge|Oogie's Revenge]]\". They all three are [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treaters]], with masks similar to their faces (e.g. Barrel's skeleton mask is large and round to fit his face, with a huge grin on it like his near-permanent creepy smile). Their names are a play on the phrase, \"[[wiktionary:lock, stock and barrel|lock, stock, and barrel]].\" Though not totally antagonistic, they are usually the comedy relief. They appear to be Anti-heroes or merely neutral characters, as they'll work for most of those who summon them.\n\n* '''Lock''' is the leader of Oogie's Boys, but does not always think through things thoroughly and just likes to be in charge. Lock wears a red [[devil]] costume; his tail is a real devil's tail, his [[teeth]] are pointed sharply. His face is narrow and long-jawed with angular features, and his red and brown [[hair]] is formed into two [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] making him, literally, a handsome devil. He likes to think highly of himself and gets upset when others insult him or take the lead; however, he goes along with others' ideas if he fails to come up with anything himself.\n* '''Shock''' is the only female of Oogie's henchmen. She is the oldest, and the most cunning and intelligent of the three. She has some [[contempt]] for the other two and their supposed stupidity, although she often gets tired with them. Shock wears a purple witch costume with an elongated hat and she sometimes carries a broomstick. She has a high-pitched girl's voice, green skin, a pointed nose, and purple wirey hair. She often takes the lead in many plans and likes to be right.\n* '''Barrel''' - is Oogie's \"star pupil,\" presumably the youngest, and considered the stupidest of the three troublemakers, despite his protests to the contrary. He is the butt of many jokes made by his friends, but usually gets even through his own tricks which he always gets away with. Barrel wears a skeleton costume and has deformed feet and almost always carries an orange and black lolipop, otherwise resembling a small human boy, albeit one with white [[human skin|skin]], sunken [[human eye|eye]]s, and perfectly coiffed green hair. His face is round and has a perpetual grin, except when he is angry or scared. Barrel usually pilots the walking bathtub the trio use as transport. He also unintentionally bothers [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] when asking him a number of annoying questions. Often he gets left out of things because he is forever falling over his own deformed feet and he is sometimes slow to catch on.\n\nInstructing them to \"leave that no-account [[Oogie Boogie]] OUT of this!\" (they promise to do so, but cross their fingers behind their backs), [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] sends Lock, Shock, and Barrel to \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\" (the Halloween Town residents' mistaken name for [[Santa Claus]]). At first, they accidentally capture the [[Easter Bunny]], whereupon Jack tells them to apologize and sends them back. They then capture their true quarry, and Jack takes Santa's hat. The trio then take Santa Claus to Oogie's lair, where Oogie taunts and threatens Santa. Once Jack has defeated Oogie and rescued Santa Claus, a hatch above opens and Lock, Shock, and Barrel appear now protagonists, having led the [[Mayor (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Mayor]] to Oogie's lair to find them.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King'', Oogie Boogie sends Lock, Shock, and Barrel out to nab the new \"Pumpkin King.\" They come back with Sally instead, saying she looked like Jack in the dark. Throughout the game, they are behind most of the ruckus going on around town ranging from poisoning the [[acid]] pools, driving the [[leech]]es crazy, knocking down the town's [[street light|street lamps]], luring Jack into [[death]] traps, and helping Oogie in the final battle.\n\nIn ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'', Lock, Shock, and Barrel decide to revive Oogie Boogie when they learn that Jack is temporarily leaving Halloween Town. In the game, Jack encounters the three one by one. In chapter 15, the threesome try to stop Jack a final time in their mobile bathtub on top of the Mayor of Halloween Town's house. He defeats them yet they spring a trap and drop him into a [[maze]] in Oogie's lair. They do not appear again in the game afterwards.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', after hearing Jack speak of a heart that can control the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Heartless and Nobodies|Heartless]], Oogie sends the three out to steal the heart as part of his plan to take over Halloween Town. After the three are defeated by [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], they confess that Oogie made them do it. Later in the game, they comment how quiet Halloween Town has become without Oogie and consider making a ruckus just to liven things up. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', the three found a Heartless and raised it before it became too big for them to control.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Lock, Shock, and Barrel start off working as [[Doctor Finklestein]]'s (Not very obedient) lab assistants, until they encounter [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], who revives Oogie Boogie for them and gives them the \"Prison Keeper\" Heartless to hold off Sora and company. The monster keeps the children in a cage underneath its body, but swallows one of them to act as its \"pilot\", each giving the monster a different ability and appearance, ultimately swallowing all three of them attacking [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and party with its full repertoire. After its defeat, the trio run off saying it was 'fun' and unintentionally reveal Oogie's return. In the second visit, the three are accused of stealing presents after they enter Santa's workshop and are caught looking through gifts. Sora and the party have to fight these mischievous rascals by knocking them unconscious and putting them in boxes. In the end, the three claim that they did not steal the presents as they regard Christmas toys to be boring while revealing that they were actually looking for parts for Doctor Finklestein's Experiment. They also cause mischief as obstacles in the \"Making Presents\" mini game, before and after the fight with the Experiment. After the battle, they run off and are not seen again in the game.\n\nDespite having apparently reformed at the end of the film in later appearances, they have reverted to being antagonist. This suggests that they like working for Oogie Boogie more than being good.\n\nIn the movie, Lock was voiced by [[Paul Reubens]], Shock was voiced by [[Catherine O'Hara]], and Barrel was voiced by [[Danny Elfman]].<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> In the Kingdom Hearts series, Lock was voiced by [[Jess Harnell]], Shock was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]], and Barrel was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. In ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'', Paul Reubens reprised the role of Lock, Kath Soucie reprised the role of Shock from the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, and [[Dee Bradley Baker]] voiced Barrel.\n\n===Santa Claus===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Santa Claus\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Ed Ivory]] (''The Nightmare Before Christmas'')<br/>[[Corey Burton]] (video games)\n| species     = [[Human]]\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''[[Santa Claus]]''' (or '''Sandy Claws''' as Jack calls him) is the leader of Christmas Town. When Jack stumbles upon the town, he becomes mesmerized with the holiday and he tries to bring Christmas to Halloween Town. In order to do so, Jack orders Lock, Shock, and Barrel to kidnap Santa on [[Christmas Eve]] so Jack can take his place for the Christmas season. The three then take Santa to Oogie Boogie where the holiday figure's life is threatened. A last minute rescue helps save not only Santa, but the entire holiday of Christmas as well. Santa Claus manages to round up the living gifts and replace them with the right ones. Santa Claus is last seen flying over Halloween Town as snow starts to fall.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', Oogie Boogie targets Santa Claus and leaves him hanging over the tracks for his scissor-tipped Oogie Train to drop him. Santa Claus was saved by Jack Skellington. When Oogie Boogie hijacked Santa's sleigh, Jack lets him use the same sleigh he used when Jack tried to improvise Christmas.\n\nSanta Claus appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy meet Santa Claus when they follow Jack Skellington to Christmas Town. He also made a reference about how Jack Skellington tried to improvise Christmas. Maleficent revives Oogie Boogie and sends him to capture Santa Claus. When Sora defeats Oogie Boogie, Santa Claus tells Jack that he should concentrate on Halloween and Santa should concentrate on Christmas. He also tells Sora to believe that he will meet Riku again. Later on, Santa's presents get stolen by Dr. Finklestein's Experiment. He helps Jack make decoy presents to attract the Experiment. Jack and company get them back by hiding in a decoy present. After they defeat the Experiment, Santa Claus decides to give Jack a taste of what it's like to deliver Christmas presents. When Jack finishes delivering presents, Santa takes back his sleigh and brings forth beautiful snow drops as a present to those in Halloween Town.\n\nSanta Claus is voiced by [[Ed Ivory]] in the movie and by [[Corey Burton]] in the video game spin-offs.\n\n===Zero===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Zero\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = \n| species     = Ghost Dog\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Zero''' is Jack's faithful [[ghost]] [[dog]] who floats about freely and follows Jack wherever he goes. His nose, which is in the shape of a jack-o-lantern, also doubles as a bright light.\n\nIn the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, Zero is often called upon to search for someone. In ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', he will disappear and reappear depending on whether the player has completed the Halloween Town story.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Halloween Town residents===\n* '''[[Bat]]s''' - There are bats seen all over throughout Halloween Town.

It later chased after some kids until Santa Claus returns and takes it away.\n\n===Christmas Town residents===\n* '''[[Christmas elf|Christmas Elves]]''' - Santa Claus's helpers who are responsible for preparing the gifts and decorations for Christmas.\n* '''[[Mrs. Claus]]''' - Santa Claus's wife, she is seen in the background as he checks the naughty-nice list.\n* '''[[Penguin]]s''' - Several penguins can be seen in Christmas Town.\n* '''[[Santa Claus' reindeer]]''' - Santa Claus' reindeer fly with magic and pull Santa's sleigh.\n\n===Enemies===\n* '''Colossal [[Moth]]''' - A huge moth that has super acidic saliva and exhales poisonous fumes. Featured in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''.\n* '''Fire [[Monarch|King]] [[Skeleton (undead)|Skeleton]] and Ice King Skeleton''' - Two bosses from ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]''. Fought in \"Fire and Ice Frenzy,\" these two big skeletons appear to fight Jack after he replaced the Oogie-Doors with the real Holiday Doors. Use the Santa Jack costume to fight the Fire King Skeleton and the Pumpkin King costume to fight the Ice King Skeleton.\n* '''Giant Snake''' - An artificial bug-filled snake who is a boss in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''.\n* '''Halloween Ghosts''' - The Halloween Ghosts appear in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'' having been created by Dr. Finklestein at the time when Oogie Boogie tricked the citizens of Halloween Town. The Halloween Ghosts are much different from the ghosts that appear in the movie as they are very fast and great at dodging. Tricking them to come near Jack and sending them into the ground is an easy way to defeat them. They are seen in \"Jack's Return\" in the Oogie Boogie Shadow battle.\n** '''King Ghosts''' - They are stronger than the Halloween Ghosts, but require the same tactics to defeat them.\n* '''Mega Spider''' - A Mega Spider is fought three times in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]''. It will shoot cobwebs at Jack and even charge. Its weak spot is the pumpkin shape on its abdomen. If successfully attacked there, it will go underground and launch Baby Spiders at Jack. Another type of Mega Spider appears in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]'' as the mutated pet of Lock, Shock, and Barrel.\n* '''Mother Locust''' - A locust with an abdomen filled with swollen eggs who is a boss in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''.\n* '''Oogie Cycle''' - A colossal beetle that serves as Oogie's ride and the final boss in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''.

Fought in \"Saving Sandy,\" Jack had to always change the train tracks to keep this scissor-tipped train from going on the track leading to the rope that is holding Santa Claus up. Keep attacking the Oogie-Train while evading skeletons disguised as snowmen.\n* '''Roly Poly''' - A large but somewhat weak [[Armadillidiidae|pillbug]] who is a boss in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''.\n** '''Enormous Poly''' - A large offspring of Rolly Polly. Featured in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''.\n* '''[[Skeleton (undead)|Skeleton]]s''' - In ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'', Oogie Boogie had a bunch of skeletons that served him which were brought to life by Dr. Finklestein at the time when Oogie Boogie tricked the citizens of Halloween Town. They resemble the Skeletons in Oogie Boogie's lair.\n** '''Blue Skeletons''' - The Blue Skeletons are the easiest to defeat. They are slow and have short reaches unless they are mad and spinning.\n** '''Heat Skeletons''' - The Heat Skeletons are the most annoying of the enemies Jack fights. They have short reaches, but they can throw boomerangs.\n** '''[[Orc]] Skeletons''' - They are like the Blue Skeletons except the mad ones wield clubs. Just like the Blue Skeletons, they are slow and have short reaches unless they are mad and spinning.\n** '''[[Troll]] Skeletons''' - The Troll Skeletons are big and wield big clubs. They can only be grabbed when the Soul Robber is Level 3. If they drop their clubs, use the Soul Robber to throw the clubs at them.\n** '''King Skeletons''' - The King Skeletons are also big and wield big axes. The attack on the King Skeletons are the same as Troll Skeletons, with two exceptions. They cannot be grabbed at all, only turned around. They can be only hit while they are growling, or from behind.\n* '''Zombie [[Centipede]]''' - A huge centipede with wings that was brought back from the dead by Oogie. Featured ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''.\n\n==Marketing==\nThe owners of the franchise have undertaken an extensive marketing campaign of these characters across many media.

The movie's lead character, Jack Skellington, the chief marketing officer (CMO) for a successful company decides that his success is boring and he wants the company to have a different business plan. Some have wondered which real-life company failure the movie is based on: Sergio Zyman's New Coke or Merck's launch and subsequent withdrawal of Vioxx.\"<ref>Jim Edwards, \"Jack Skellington, Brand Manager,\" ''Brandweek'' 47.40 (10/30/2006): 21.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nWhile Yvonne Tasker notes \"the complex characterization seen in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'',\"<ref>Yvonne Tasker, ''Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers'' (Routledge, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v0SITBLPJEAC&pg=PA76&dq=%22Nightmare+Before+Christmas%22+%22character+development%22&ei=56cbSY38KJSmM8Pv7fkO 76].</ref> Michael A.

[[Danny Elfman]] was worried the characterization of Oogie Boogie would be considered [[racism|racist]] by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).<ref>{{cite book | author= Ken Hanke | title = Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | year =1999 | pages =137\u2013148 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Burtonland}}</ref> As Delgado and Stefancic's book reveals, Elfman's predictions became true. Nevertheless, director Henry Selick stated the character was inspired from the [[Betty Boop]] cartoon ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]''. \"[[Cab Calloway]] would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing \"[[Minnie the Moocher]]\" or \"Old Man of the Mountain\", and they would [[rotoscoping|rotoscope]] him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus,\" Selick continued. \"I think those are some of the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain.
