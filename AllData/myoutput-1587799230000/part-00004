{"title_page": "Official versions of Doom", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Official versions of ''Doom''}}\n''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' is one of the most widely [[Porting|ported]] [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]]s. Starting with the original [[MS-DOS]] [[Personal computer|PC]] version (released as [[shareware]] on December 10, 1993), it has been released officially for a number of [[operating system]]s, [[video game console]]s, [[handheld game console]]s, and other devices. Some of the ports are replications of the MS-DOS version, while others differ considerably, including modifications to the level designs and monsters, with some ports offering content not included in the original MS-DOS version.\n\nAfter ''Doom''{{'}}s [[source code]] was released to the public on December 23, 1997, several [[List of Doom source ports|source ports]] were created by fans to allow the original PC version to run on modern operating systems.\n\n==Personal computers==\n\n===MS-DOS===\n\n====Original version====\n''Doom''{{'}}s initial release on December 10, 1993 was for MS-DOS and had 320x200 pixel resolution. The releases include:\n\n* 1.0 (December 10, 1993) - Initial release. The internal program number reads v0.99.\n* 1.1 (December 16, 1993) - Fixed some bugs in the 1.0 release.\n* 1.2 (February 17, 1994) - Added support for modem play and new difficulty level called ''Nightmare''.\n* 1.4 (June 28, 1994), 1.5 (July 8, 1994), and 1.6 (August 3, 1994) were minor updates, and only available to testers.\n* 1.666 (September 1, 1994) - Contained improved network code and a new version of deathmatch called ''Deathmatch 2.0''. In addition, the [[swastika]] pattern in episode 1, map 4 was altered.<ref>[http://rome.ro/lee_killough/memorabilia/swastika.shtml Photos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720230535/http://www.rome.ro/lee_killough/memorabilia/swastika.shtml |date=2008-07-20 }} at John Romero's website.</ref>\n* 1.7 (October 11, 1994) - Contained IWAD changes and lacked the ''DeathManager!'' front end multiplayer game launcher.\n* 1.7a (November 8, 1994) - Contained sound code changes and included version 1.1 of the ''DeathManager!'' front end multiplayer game launcher.\n* 1.8 (January 23, 1995) - Updated the ''Doom'' FAQ.\n* 1.9 (February 1, 1995) - Final release.\n\n====''The Ultimate Doom''====\nOn April 30, 1995, an upgraded version of the game, ''The Ultimate Doom'', was released, which contained an additional fourth episode, entitled \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", in addition to the original three episodes, which are \"Knee Deep In The Dead\", \"The Shores Of Hell\", and \"Inferno\".\n\n===NeXTSTEP===\nThis was the version that the MS-DOS product emerged from, since, at the time, [[id Software]] was using a [[NeXTcube]] for its graphic-engine development. This version is sluggish on anything below an 040 NeXTstation/cube (though it runs smoother with a higher amount of memory), and is missing sound, which was added on the PC side. With NeXT-Step based on i486 architecture, it ran smoothly under all conditions up to screen sizes of 400% with newer hardware. The version running on NeXT is 1.2, programmed by John Carmack, John Romero, and Dave Taylor.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===OS/2===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[OS/2]] by an independent contractor, Jim Thomas, who was hired by [[IBM]] to port it and ''SimCity''.<ref>http://stuff.mit.edu/activities/os2/diverepo.html</ref> A successful version was demoed in 1994 running in an OS/2 [[Presentation Manager|PM]] window, and the last version, 2.19 beta, was released in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-viewer.php?dir=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Fgames%2Faction%2Fdoom&file=dmos219s.zip |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185953/http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-viewer.php?dir=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Fgames%2Faction%2Fdoom&file=dmos219s.zip |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===IRIX===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[IRIX]] during the summer of 1994 by [[Dave D. Taylor]]. It was designed to run on IRIX 5.2 and later. IRIX ''Doom'' was originally based on the unreleased MS-DOS version 1.5, though later updates were based on versions 1.6 and 1.8. No effort was made to take advantage of [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]'s advanced graphics hardware, and like many other ports the game was rendered entirely in [[software rendering]] mode.\n\n===Solaris===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] in late 1994, and was designed to run with game files from ''Doom'' 1.8. In the readme, the port is credited to \"Dave Taylor and the rest of the folks at id Software\".  It runs on Solaris 2.4 and later. The distribution contained two versions: one for regular X11, and another for Sun DGA.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Mac OS===\n''Doom'' for Mac was released on November 4, 1994. ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'' were ported by Lion Entertainment and released by GT Interactive using a Mac OS launcher application to run original PC WADs. The Mac version runs on [[System 7]] through [[Mac OS 9]] and requires a [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[PowerPC]] processor. Although it can run in [[Classic Environment|Classic]] under [[OS X|Mac OS X]] on [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]; [[Mac OS X Panther|Panther]] and [[Mac OS X Tiger|Tiger]] cause graphic artifacts due to the later version of Classic having a double-buffered screen. In addition to an adjustable viewport, it supports rendering at low or high resolutions, and allows network play over [[AppleTalk]] as well as IPX.\n\n===Linux===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[Linux]] by [[id Software]] programmer Dave Taylor in 1994. The last Linux ''Doom'' binaries were provided by id Software on October 13, 1996 through the company's ftp-server.\n\nThe source code to the Linux version of ''Doom'' was released by [[id Software]] on December 23, 1997 under a non-profit [[End user license agreement]]; it was re-released on October 3, 1999 under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. The source code to the [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions of the game was not released. This was due to copyright issues concerning the sound library used by original MS-DOS version and id Software having no access to the source code of the Microsoft Windows port.<ref>John Carmack.

It was compatible with [[Windows 95]] and up, and was able to use WADs from the MS-DOS versions. It also allowed users to set up multiplayer games much easier than in DOS. It was included with ''[[Final Doom]]''. The port was project-led by [[Gabe Newell]] and other later founders of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]].<ref>[http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/167253-gabe-newell-made-windows-a-viable-gaming-platform-and-linux-is-next Gabe Newell made Windows a viable gaming platform, and Linux is next - Extreme Tech, September 24, 2013 (article by Sebastian Anthony)]</ref>\n\nOn September 26, 2001, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom Collector's Edition]]'' was released, containing ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth|Doom II]]'', and ''[[Final Doom]]''. It was re-released on January 1, 2004<ref>[http://pc.ign.com/objects/691/691517.html IGN: Doom (Collector's Edition)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with added preview content for ''[[Doom 3]]''. Some early versions of ''Doom 3'' included the Collector's Edition and a small demon figurine as a bonus. The ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition|BFG Edition]]'' of ''Doom 3'', released on October 15, 2012, includes ''The Ultimate Doom'' as well as ''Doom II''.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'' were released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. This release runs the original MS-DOS versions of the game using [[DOSBox]], an MS-DOS emulator.\n\n===Acorn RISC OS===\n''Doom'' was released for the [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[Risc PC]] by R-Comp Interactive in 1998. Within a few months, a significantly enhanced version was delivered as an update called ''Doom+''. That version runs on the older [[Acorn Archimedes]] computers and, apart from speed improvements, adds several features not present in the original DOS release.<ref>[http://gerph.org/riscos/ramble/doomplus.html Justin Fletcher, author of Doom+. December 20, 2012]</ref> It was made available including ''Doom'', ''Doom II'', ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Master Levels for Doom II'', and approximately 3000 user levels released into the [[Public Domain]].\n\n==Consoles==\n\n===Sega 32X===\nThe [[32X]] version of ''Doom'' was developed and published by [[Sega]] and was released on November 21, 1994.<ref>{{cite web | title=Sega unleashes arcade power for the home; Genesis 32X delivers 40 times the power of 16-bit systems | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1994_Nov_21/ai_15891848/ |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=November 21, 1994 |accessdate=2011-05-13}}</ref> It features 17 of the 18 levels from the first two episodes, but none from episode three. This version lacks multiplayer support, does not play in a full screen, and only has the front sprites for the monsters. 10 levels are missing from the original version (twice as many missing levels as any other version of the game). A [[COMMAND.COM|DOS prompt]] shows up after the credits roll if the player finishes the game either using cheats or starting from any level other than the first level, locking up the game.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Buyers Beware|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=82|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1995|page=112}}</ref> Similarly, the secret level cannot be accessed in these scenarios. Due to the lack of the third episode, the [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]] can only be obtained through the use of cheats. Due to poor use of the Mega Drive/Genesis [[YM2612]] sound chip, this version's soundtrack is considered inferior to that of other versions, and many of the sound effects are missing. As with most mid-90s console ports, the levels come from the Atari Jaguar version. This version does not feature the Cyberdemon, the Spider Mastermind, or the Spectre. There is a level select option that allows the player to start on any of the first fifteen levels, although there is no way to save the game or settings.\n\nIn 1995, the 32X version of the game was given a score of 30 out of 40 by ''[[Famicom Ts\u016bshin]]''.<ref>\u304a\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1!! \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8 \u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0!!: DOOM ~\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30e0~.

It features 22 of the PC version's 27 levels, though many of them are simplified, and two levels (\"Tower of Babel\" and \"Hell Keep\") are entirely different from the PC levels of the same names.<ref>[http://classicdoom.com/doomcomp.htm Doom Comparison Guide], ClassicDOOM.com. Refer to \"PC Doom/Ultimate Doom and Atari Jaguar Doom map level comparison\".</ref> Unlike the 32X, SNES, and 3DO versions, this version of the game display occupies the full screen, albeit with an opaque status bar at the bottom. The game runs at a fairly constant and fluid frame-rate. The levels use more complex lighting effects, but have less variation in floor depth and ceiling height. It lacks the Cyberdemon, the Spider Mastermind, and the Spectre. It is compatible with the JagLink 2-console networking device for two players to play deathmatch.<ref name=\"EGM65\">{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Doom|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|page=348}}</ref> The Jaguar version does not have any music during gameplay, but plays the title theme and intermission music with new instruments. Game settings and progress through the levels are saved automatically, and the player can start a new game anywhere up to the last level reached. Instead of having to cycle through the selection of weapons, the player can select a weapon by pressing its corresponding button on the controller's number pad.<ref name=\"EGM65\"/>\n\n''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' gave it four out of five stars and called it \"Definitely the best Jaguar title we've seen so far.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=January 1995|page=92}}</ref>\n\n===Super NES===\nThe Super NES version of ''Doom'' was published by Williams Entertainment and developed by [[Sculptured Software]] and released on September 1, 1995. Randy Linden, the head programmer, created a new game engine called the Reality engine for the port. The game makes use of the [[Super FX]] powered GSU-2 chip (often referred to as the Super FX 2 chip), and was one of the few SNES games to feature a colored cartridge: ''Doom'' came in a red cartridge in the United States; a black or standard gray cartridge in Europe; and a red, black, or gray cartridge in Australia.\n\nThe SNES version of ''Doom'' features all five of the PC version levels that were missing from the Atari Jaguar version, but is missing a different set of five levels instead, and, like the Sega 32X version, does not have any console exclusive levels. The levels included resemble the PC levels more so than other ports. This was also the only home console port of ''Doom'' released in the 1990s to feature all three of the original secret levels and boss levels from the PC version. Like the Sega 32X version, the player's [[heads-up display]] does not utilize the whole screen, and enemies are only animated from the front, which means that they always face the player. This renders [[monster infighting]] impossible, although it is possible for monsters of the same type to damage each other with projectiles. The floors and ceilings are not texture mapped, and this version of the game also lacks both battery back-up saves and a password system, meaning that each episode must be finished from the beginning. Multiplayer was only available if an [[XBAND]] modem was used, which included support for two player deathmatch. This version lacks the Spectre enemy (replaced with regular Demon monsters), though it does feature the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind boss monsters that the Atari Jaguar, Sega 32X, and 3DO versions lack. In the North American and PAL versions, episode two cannot be played on the \"I'm Too Young to Die\" and \"Hey, Not Too Rough\" difficulties, and episode three can only be played on \"Ultra-Violence\" and \"Nightmare\" difficulties if one is selected from the game's episode select menu, though it is possible to play episode three on the \"Hurt Me Plenty\" difficulty if the player beats episode two on that difficulty setting. In the Japanese version, however, all three episodes can be played on any difficulty level.\n\nThe automap display takes advantage of the rotating and scaling abilities of the Super FX 2 chip, with the entire map spinning around the player's position rather than the player being portrayed with an arrow. Due to hardware limitations, no particles such as blood impacts, smoke, or bullet sparks are present. The chaingun is capable of single fire (although emptying one bullet still produces a doubled sound effect). Moreover, the shotgun does not fire seven individual shots as it does in the PC version, but rather functions like a hunting rifle. This allows the player to shoot (and be shot) from a distance using the shotgun with no decrease in power. This version of ''Doom'' features support for the [[SNES Mouse]] peripheral.\n\nReviews for the Super NES version were mostly negative. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave this version a score of 5.375 out of 10. Two of their reviewers said that it was \"decent\" but clearly inferior to other versions of ''Doom'', while the other two felt it to be a poor game even without comparing it to other versions. They particularly criticized that enemies at a distance are too pixelated to be seen, making it \"seem like you are getting hit for no reason at all\". They cited the \"outstanding\" music as the one strong point.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Doom|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=74|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 1995|page=34}}</ref> A critic for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' similarly complained that enemies are so pixelated at mid-distance or farther that they blend in with the backgrounds. He also criticized the graphics in general as requiring \"constant squinting\" to discern what is going on and called the controls \"poor and sluggish.\" While acknowledging that creating a port of Doom for a last generation console at all was an impressive technical accomplishment, he concluded the port to be not worthwhile and gave it two out of five stars.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Doom|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|pages=126, 128}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s The Axe Grinder instead stated that distant objects appear sharp and clear, and that it is objects which are close up which appear extremely pixelated. He gave the Super NES version a generally negative assessment, saying that the game is almost unplayable due to the unresponsive controls.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Doom|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=85|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=October 1995|page=66}}</ref>\n\n===PlayStation===\nThe [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version of ''Doom'' was published and developed by [[Midway Games|Williams Entertainment]] and released on November 16, 1995. This version spent six months in development.<ref name=\"Max2\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Doom: The Ultimate Version of the Greatest Gore Blast Ever!|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=2 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=November 1995|pages=56\u201360}}</ref> It is one of the best selling versions of the game after the original PC version. It was re-released several times, first on the \"[[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]]\" range in the U.S., which requires that games have sold at least 150,000 copies there, and on the \"[[Platinum Range]]\" in [[PAL region]]s, which indicates that it sold over 600,000 copies in those territories.\n\nChanges from the PC original include the removal of the \"Nightmare\" difficulty level, and the fact that progress is saved via passwords (given at the end of each level). The passwords also save ammo and health stats, but the numbers for them are rounded. This version features 59 levels in total; 23 levels from the PC version of ''Doom'' (edited much like the Jaguar and 32X versions), both of the levels designed for the Jaguar version, six new levels designed by the Midway team, five levels from ''The Ultimate Doom''{{'}}s fourth episode, and 23 levels from ''Doom II''. Unlike the other 1990s ''Doom'' ports, all of the enemies from the PC version of ''Doom'' are included. However, the Arch-vile monster from ''Doom II'' is not present; according to one of the game's designers, Harry Teasley, this was because he had twice as many frames as any other monster, and the team felt that they \"just couldn't do him justice\" on the PlayStation.<ref>http://5years.doomworld.com/interviews/harryteasley/page3.shtml Harry Teasley interview</ref> There is, however, one new monster, the Nightmare Spectre. According to Teasley, this was included to add variety, and to take advantage of the PlayStation's capabilities. Two player [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] and co-operative multiplayer modes are available on the PlayStation if two consoles are linked using the original Serial I/O port, and each console has its own controller and ''Doom'' disc inserted.\n\nMany textures were reduced in size due to technical limitations. As a result, the mug shot appears to be different from the one in the PC version; in fact, it is the same animated sprite, but squashed in from the sides. A small selection of new graphics and visual effects were introduced. These include sector-based coloured lighting, an animated, flame-filled sky, and a new animation for the player's mug shot, which shows the [[Doomguy]]'s head exploding if the player character is [[gib (video gaming)|gib]]bed.<ref name=\"Max2\"/> For the first time, translucent Spectres are drawn without the cascade effect (including the darker-shaded Nightmare Spectres). The original music by Bobby Prince was replaced by a new score by [[Aubrey Hodges]]. The sound effects and voice-overs were also completely redone by Hodges, and, in parts of certain levels, echo effects were added. All of the story text is cut, save for the ending and second intermission from ''Doom II'', the latter of which appears at the end of ''Ultimate Doom'' instead. A bonus level presented a level 'club doom' - with a nightclub filled with health potions and demons attacking on a dance floor and dance-cages.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNpho45LnhE</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1996, a port containing levels from ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth#Master Levels for Doom II|Master Levels for Doom II]]'' and ''[[Final Doom]]'' was released for the PlayStation under the name ''Final Doom''. The PlayStation version of ''Final Doom'' has thirteen levels from ''Master Levels for Doom II'', eleven levels from ''TNT: Evilution'', and six levels from ''The Plutonia Experiment''. Like the PlayStation version of ''Doom'', ''Final Doom'' uses passwords. Unlike the PlayStation version of ''Doom'', support for the [[PlayStation Mouse]] peripheral is available for ''Final Doom''.\n\nThe PlayStation version was met with critical acclaim, with critics concurring it to be by far the best console version of the game to date. Major Mike of ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a perfect score in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), noting that it was not just a straight conversion but a drastically reworked and comprehensive edition with \"enough new twists and turns to surprise even the most battle-weary ''Doom'' player\". He applauded the inclusion of ''Doom II'', the added levels, the much smoother graphics when compared to previous console ports, the clear sound effects, the \"chilling\" music, and the precise controls.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Doom: Special PlayStation Edition|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=87 |publisher=[[IDG]]|date=December 1995|pages=58\u201359}}</ref> A reviewer for ''Maximum'' found the port's most worthwhile aspects to be the huge number of levels, the use of the shoulder buttons for strafing, and the \"vastly improved\" audio.

He complained that the walls are \"sticky\" and that he was feeling burnt out on reviewing ports of ''Doom'', and gave it four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Doom|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=78}}</ref> ''Next Generation''{{'}}s 1996 overview of PlayStation games raised the score to a perfect five stars.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Every PlayStation Game Played, Reviewed, and Rated|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=57}}</ref> [[IGN]] gave it a 7 out of 10, citing the high frame rate, impressive lighting effects, use of the PlayStation Link Cable, and inclusion of ''Doom II'' content.

This version runs in a small screen at a low frame rate, though it includes the option to shrink the screen size further, which allows the game to run faster and smoother. It lacks some effects found in other versions but has an updated soundtrack that features remixed and original music. The Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind are missing, though the Spectre (which is absent from the Jaguar, SNES, and 32X versions) is included. The 3DO version was originally a more ambitious project, intended to surpass the PC version, but after it was mired in [[development hell]] for two years, the programmer was contracted to create a basic port in ten weeks.<ref>{{cite news | last = Matthews | first= Will | date = December 2013 | title = Ahead of its Time: A 3DO Retrospective | work = [[Retro Gamer]] | issue = 122 | pages = 26\u201329 | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref> In December 2014, the source code for the 3DO version was released to the public.<ref name=\"3do-sourcecode\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/doom3do|title=The complete archive for DOOM for the 3DO|last=Heineman|first=Rebecca Ann|date=December 2014|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Maximum'' thoroughly panned this version for its lack of [[PAL]] optimization, large borders, choppy frame rate even on the smallest possible screen size, bland color palette, music which is lacking in atmosphere, and load times. They added that the frame rate and slowdown make the game too easy: \"When large amounts of monsters arrive to beat the crap out of you, the game slows down to such an extent that you have ages to line up your shots and fire\".

The lead programmer on this port, Jim Bagley, later explained that he originally programmed a hardware-accelerated engine that would have performed on par with high-end PCs of the time, but id Software disallowed usage of the engine due to texture distortion caused by the rendering process, resulting in the final version using an entirely software-based renderer.\n\nThis version is compatible with the Saturn analog controller<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Preview: Doom|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=15|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=January 1997|pages=28\u201329}}</ref> and the Saturn [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]. However, the mouse cannot be used to strafe, access the automap, or manually change weapons (though as in all versions of ''Doom'', the player character automatically equips a weapon when it is first acquired and switches to a different weapon if the current one is depleted of ammunition).\n\nThe packaging for the U.S. release contains a few errors, such as the game screen shots on the back actually being from the PC version of ''Final Doom'', and it claims to be \"deathmatch ready\", when it is in fact only one player (the deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer modes are only in the Japanese and PAL releases, despite the fact that the Saturn link cable needed to play these modes had not been released in PAL regions<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Q&A |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=18 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=April 1997|pages=32}}</ref>).\n\nThe Japanese release of the game has a slightly smoother frame rate compared to the North American and European versions, though still considerably lower than that of the PlayStation version.\n\nThe Saturn port was met with a generally negative reception, with most reviewers considering it far below the quality of the PlayStation version. The most common criticisms were the low frame rate<ref name=SSM16/><ref name=GSSat/><ref name=GPro103/> and lack of certain graphical elements seen in the PlayStation version.<ref name=SSM16/><ref name=GPro103/> Reviewer fatigue with ''Doom'' ports also continued to play a role; [[Jeff Gerstmann]], rating it a 3.1 out of 10 in ''[[GameSpot]]'', commented that \"If I see one more Doom game released on any platform, I'm going to hunt down the people responsible and kill them slowly.\"<ref name=GSSat>{{cite web |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann |title=Doom Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-review/1900-2532876/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=29 July 2018 |date=April 22, 1997}}</ref> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' awarded the port a score of 56%, with the reviewer describing it as a \"breath-takingly bad conversion of a classic game\", judging the game's poor performance to be inexcusable considering the Saturn's 2D rendering capabilities, and feeling that even the earlier 32X and Jaguar versions played much better, despite being released on less powerful systems.<ref name=SSM16>{{cite magazine|last=Leadbetter |first=Rich |title=Review: Doom|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=16 |publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=February 1997|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]'' was less outraged, judging that while the Saturn port is clearly inferior to the PC and PlayStation versions, it is enjoyable in absolute terms and \"successfully mimics the PlayStation version in most categories - with the crucial exception of speed.\"<ref name=GPro103>{{cite magazine |title=Saturn ProReview: Doom|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=103 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=April 1997|page=87}}</ref>\n\n===Game Boy Advance===\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version of ''Doom'' was developed by David A.

These were the first ports of ''Doom'' on a [[handheld game console|handheld device]]. Both ''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' received a much larger amount of censoring than other ports (monsters bleed green instead of red, and monster corpses disappear a few seconds after initial death; in both secret levels for ''Doom II'', swastika flags and walls were replaced by stylized double-headed eagles reminiscent of ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s picture art was replaced by Wilhelm Strasse's picture art; no bleeding of the status bar face), and, because of this, received a [[Teen]] rating by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].\n\n===Xbox===\nThe Limited Collector's Edition of ''Doom 3'', released in 2005, features ports of ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II'', including two new levels, \"Sewers\" and \"Betray\". They feature the same multiplayer as the PC version, however not through [[Xbox Live]]. All the PC levels for both games are included; however, the eight console-only levels which appeared on the Jaguar, PlayStation, 3DO, and Saturn versions are omitted. This port was programmed by [[Vicarious Visions]]. The expansion pack \"Resurrection of Evil\" also contained ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II'', as well as ''Master Levels for Doom II''.\n\n===Xbox 360===\nOn September 27, 2006, ''Doom'' was released for download on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game has all 4 episodes from ''The Ultimate Doom'' plus online cooperative and deathmatch modes through [[Xbox Live]]. Like the Xbox version, it does not include any of the console-only levels which appeared in earlier ports. Supports 11 screen sizes, and has higher graphics resolution than any earlier console port. Due to a bug, the music plays at a slower speed. This port, programmed by [[Nerve Software]], also credits [[Vicarious Visions]] and likely shares code with the Xbox version. There are no cheats in this version of the game.\n\nIn 2010, the game was pulled from the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] because [[Activision]], the game's publisher, no longer has the rights to maintain the game on the Marketplace, but as of January 20, 2012, it has been republished by [[Bethesda Softworks]],<ref>[http://www.platformnation.com/2012/01/18/doom-available-on-xbla-again/ Doom Relisted on XBLA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120184640/http://www.platformnation.com/2012/01/18/doom-available-on-xbla-again/ |date=2012-01-20 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/10/doom_mysteriously_removed_from.php |title=Doom Removed From Xbox Live Arcade, Back Up Soon - Joystick Division<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724091905/http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/10/doom_mysteriously_removed_from.php |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the same company that published the Xbox Live Arcade version of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''.\n\nBoth games are backwards-compatible with the [[Xbox One]] and can be purchased from the Xbox Store. They are also downloaded if the disc for ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition]]'' is inserted into the console in lieu of the pack-in versions of the games included with that title, though the disc is required to play. They were also offered as a preorder incentive for [[Doom (2016 video game)|the 2016 reboot]].\n\n===PlayStation 3===\n''Doom 3 BFG Edition'' contains ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II: Hell on Earth''. Later, ''Doom Classic Complete'' was released on the [[PlayStation Network]] which includes ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II: Hell on Earth'', ''Master Levels for Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'', the last two appearing for the first time in their entirety on a console.\n\n===25th anniversary release===\n''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' were released for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] on July 26, 2019 during [[QuakeCon]], in honor of the franchise's 25th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/doom-doom-ii-and-doom-3-out-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one-and-smartphones/|title=Doom, Doom II and Doom 3 out for Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One and smartphones|last=Gonzalez|first=Oscar|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\nBethesda received criticism for allegations that it included additional [[digital rights management]] in this version, as the initial releases required that users sign into a Bethesda.net account in order to play.

This version includes all 32 levels from the original PC version, along with all the original enemies, music, weapons, etc. It also retains the option of switching between nine different screen sizes, including one which expands the first person view to fill the entire screen, and is the first console version of ''Doom'' to include respawning monsters in \"Nightmare\" difficulty mode.<ref>[http://classicdoom.com/doomcomp.htm Doom Comparison Guide], ClassicDOOM.com.

Starting with the original [[MS-DOS]] [[Personal computer|PC]] version (released as [[shareware]] on December 10, 1993), it has been released officially for a number of [[operating system]]s, [[video game console]]s, [[handheld game console]]s, and other devices. Some of the ports are replications of the MS-DOS version, while others differ considerably, including modifications to the level designs and monsters, with some ports offering content not included in the original MS-DOS version.\n\nAfter ''Doom''{{'}}s [[source code]] was released to the public on December 23, 1997, several [[List of Doom source ports|source ports]] were created by fans to allow the original PC version to run on modern operating systems.\n\n==Personal computers==\n\n===MS-DOS===\n\n====Original version====\n''Doom''{{'}}s initial release on December 10, 1993 was for MS-DOS and had 320x200 pixel resolution.

The internal program number reads v0.99.\n* 1.1 (December 16, 1993) - Fixed some bugs in the 1.0 release.\n* 1.2 (February 17, 1994) - Added support for modem play and new difficulty level called ''Nightmare''.\n* 1.4 (June 28, 1994), 1.5 (July 8, 1994), and 1.6 (August 3, 1994) were minor updates, and only available to testers.\n* 1.666 (September 1, 1994) - Contained improved network code and a new version of deathmatch called ''Deathmatch 2.0''. In addition, the [[swastika]] pattern in episode 1, map 4 was altered.<ref>[http://rome.ro/lee_killough/memorabilia/swastika.shtml Photos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720230535/http://www.rome.ro/lee_killough/memorabilia/swastika.shtml |date=2008-07-20 }} at John Romero's website.</ref>\n* 1.7 (October 11, 1994) - Contained IWAD changes and lacked the ''DeathManager!'' front end multiplayer game launcher.\n* 1.7a (November 8, 1994) - Contained sound code changes and included version 1.1 of the ''DeathManager!'' front end multiplayer game launcher.\n* 1.8 (January 23, 1995) - Updated the ''Doom'' FAQ.\n* 1.9 (February 1, 1995) - Final release.\n\n====''The Ultimate Doom''====\nOn April 30, 1995, an upgraded version of the game, ''The Ultimate Doom'', was released, which contained an additional fourth episode, entitled \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", in addition to the original three episodes, which are \"Knee Deep In The Dead\", \"The Shores Of Hell\", and \"Inferno\".\n\n===NeXTSTEP===\nThis was the version that the MS-DOS product emerged from, since, at the time, [[id Software]] was using a [[NeXTcube]] for its graphic-engine development. This version is sluggish on anything below an 040 NeXTstation/cube (though it runs smoother with a higher amount of memory), and is missing sound, which was added on the PC side. With NeXT-Step based on i486 architecture, it ran smoothly under all conditions up to screen sizes of 400% with newer hardware. The version running on NeXT is 1.2, programmed by John Carmack, John Romero, and Dave Taylor.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===OS/2===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[OS/2]] by an independent contractor, Jim Thomas, who was hired by [[IBM]] to port it and ''SimCity''.<ref>http://stuff.mit.edu/activities/os2/diverepo.html</ref> A successful version was demoed in 1994 running in an OS/2 [[Presentation Manager|PM]] window, and the last version, 2.19 beta, was released in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-viewer.php?dir=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Fgames%2Faction%2Fdoom&file=dmos219s.zip |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185953/http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-viewer.php?dir=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Fgames%2Faction%2Fdoom&file=dmos219s.zip |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===IRIX===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[IRIX]] during the summer of 1994 by [[Dave D. Taylor]]. It was designed to run on IRIX 5.2 and later. IRIX ''Doom'' was originally based on the unreleased MS-DOS version 1.5, though later updates were based on versions 1.6 and 1.8. No effort was made to take advantage of [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]'s advanced graphics hardware, and like many other ports the game was rendered entirely in [[software rendering]] mode.\n\n===Solaris===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] in late 1994, and was designed to run with game files from ''Doom'' 1.8. In the readme, the port is credited to \"Dave Taylor and the rest of the folks at id Software\".  It runs on Solaris 2.4 and later. The distribution contained two versions: one for regular X11, and another for Sun DGA.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Mac OS===\n''Doom'' for Mac was released on November 4, 1994. ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'' were ported by Lion Entertainment and released by GT Interactive using a Mac OS launcher application to run original PC WADs. The Mac version runs on [[System 7]] through [[Mac OS 9]] and requires a [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[PowerPC]] processor. Although it can run in [[Classic Environment|Classic]] under [[OS X|Mac OS X]] on [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]; [[Mac OS X Panther|Panther]] and [[Mac OS X Tiger|Tiger]] cause graphic artifacts due to the later version of Classic having a double-buffered screen. In addition to an adjustable viewport, it supports rendering at low or high resolutions, and allows network play over [[AppleTalk]] as well as IPX.\n\n===Linux===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[Linux]] by [[id Software]] programmer Dave Taylor in 1994. The last Linux ''Doom'' binaries were provided by id Software on October 13, 1996 through the company's ftp-server.\n\nThe source code to the Linux version of ''Doom'' was released by [[id Software]] on December 23, 1997 under a non-profit [[End user license agreement]]; it was re-released on October 3, 1999 under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. The source code to the [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions of the game was not released. This was due to copyright issues concerning the sound library used by original MS-DOS version and id Software having no access to the source code of the Microsoft Windows port.<ref>John Carmack.

It was compatible with [[Windows 95]] and up, and was able to use WADs from the MS-DOS versions. It also allowed users to set up multiplayer games much easier than in DOS. It was included with ''[[Final Doom]]''. The port was project-led by [[Gabe Newell]] and other later founders of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]].<ref>[http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/167253-gabe-newell-made-windows-a-viable-gaming-platform-and-linux-is-next Gabe Newell made Windows a viable gaming platform, and Linux is next - Extreme Tech, September 24, 2013 (article by Sebastian Anthony)]</ref>\n\nOn September 26, 2001, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom Collector's Edition]]'' was released, containing ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth|Doom II]]'', and ''[[Final Doom]]''.

The ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition|BFG Edition]]'' of ''Doom 3'', released on October 15, 2012, includes ''The Ultimate Doom'' as well as ''Doom II''.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'' were released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. This release runs the original MS-DOS versions of the game using [[DOSBox]], an MS-DOS emulator.\n\n===Acorn RISC OS===\n''Doom'' was released for the [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[Risc PC]] by R-Comp Interactive in 1998. Within a few months, a significantly enhanced version was delivered as an update called ''Doom+''. That version runs on the older [[Acorn Archimedes]] computers and, apart from speed improvements, adds several features not present in the original DOS release.<ref>[http://gerph.org/riscos/ramble/doomplus.html Justin Fletcher, author of Doom+.

This version lacks multiplayer support, does not play in a full screen, and only has the front sprites for the monsters. 10 levels are missing from the original version (twice as many missing levels as any other version of the game). A [[COMMAND.COM|DOS prompt]] shows up after the credits roll if the player finishes the game either using cheats or starting from any level other than the first level, locking up the game.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Buyers Beware|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=82|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1995|page=112}}</ref> Similarly, the secret level cannot be accessed in these scenarios. Due to the lack of the third episode, the [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]] can only be obtained through the use of cheats. Due to poor use of the Mega Drive/Genesis [[YM2612]] sound chip, this version's soundtrack is considered inferior to that of other versions, and many of the sound effects are missing. As with most mid-90s console ports, the levels come from the Atari Jaguar version. This version does not feature the Cyberdemon, the Spider Mastermind, or the Spectre. There is a level select option that allows the player to start on any of the first fifteen levels, although there is no way to save the game or settings.\n\nIn 1995, the 32X version of the game was given a score of 30 out of 40 by ''[[Famicom Ts\u016bshin]]''.<ref>\u304a\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1!! \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8 \u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0!!: DOOM ~\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30e0~.

Randy Linden, the head programmer, created a new game engine called the Reality engine for the port. The game makes use of the [[Super FX]] powered GSU-2 chip (often referred to as the Super FX 2 chip), and was one of the few SNES games to feature a colored cartridge: ''Doom'' came in a red cartridge in the United States; a black or standard gray cartridge in Europe; and a red, black, or gray cartridge in Australia.\n\nThe SNES version of ''Doom'' features all five of the PC version levels that were missing from the Atari Jaguar version, but is missing a different set of five levels instead, and, like the Sega 32X version, does not have any console exclusive levels. The levels included resemble the PC levels more so than other ports. This was also the only home console port of ''Doom'' released in the 1990s to feature all three of the original secret levels and boss levels from the PC version. Like the Sega 32X version, the player's [[heads-up display]] does not utilize the whole screen, and enemies are only animated from the front, which means that they always face the player. This renders [[monster infighting]] impossible, although it is possible for monsters of the same type to damage each other with projectiles. The floors and ceilings are not texture mapped, and this version of the game also lacks both battery back-up saves and a password system, meaning that each episode must be finished from the beginning. Multiplayer was only available if an [[XBAND]] modem was used, which included support for two player deathmatch. This version lacks the Spectre enemy (replaced with regular Demon monsters), though it does feature the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind boss monsters that the Atari Jaguar, Sega 32X, and 3DO versions lack. In the North American and PAL versions, episode two cannot be played on the \"I'm Too Young to Die\" and \"Hey, Not Too Rough\" difficulties, and episode three can only be played on \"Ultra-Violence\" and \"Nightmare\" difficulties if one is selected from the game's episode select menu, though it is possible to play episode three on the \"Hurt Me Plenty\" difficulty if the player beats episode two on that difficulty setting. In the Japanese version, however, all three episodes can be played on any difficulty level.\n\nThe automap display takes advantage of the rotating and scaling abilities of the Super FX 2 chip, with the entire map spinning around the player's position rather than the player being portrayed with an arrow. Due to hardware limitations, no particles such as blood impacts, smoke, or bullet sparks are present. The chaingun is capable of single fire (although emptying one bullet still produces a doubled sound effect). Moreover, the shotgun does not fire seven individual shots as it does in the PC version, but rather functions like a hunting rifle. This allows the player to shoot (and be shot) from a distance using the shotgun with no decrease in power. This version of ''Doom'' features support for the [[SNES Mouse]] peripheral.\n\nReviews for the Super NES version were mostly negative. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave this version a score of 5.375 out of 10. Two of their reviewers said that it was \"decent\" but clearly inferior to other versions of ''Doom'', while the other two felt it to be a poor game even without comparing it to other versions. They particularly criticized that enemies at a distance are too pixelated to be seen, making it \"seem like you are getting hit for no reason at all\". They cited the \"outstanding\" music as the one strong point.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Doom|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=74|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 1995|page=34}}</ref> A critic for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' similarly complained that enemies are so pixelated at mid-distance or farther that they blend in with the backgrounds. He also criticized the graphics in general as requiring \"constant squinting\" to discern what is going on and called the controls \"poor and sluggish.\" While acknowledging that creating a port of Doom for a last generation console at all was an impressive technical accomplishment, he concluded the port to be not worthwhile and gave it two out of five stars.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Doom|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|pages=126, 128}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s The Axe Grinder instead stated that distant objects appear sharp and clear, and that it is objects which are close up which appear extremely pixelated. He gave the Super NES version a generally negative assessment, saying that the game is almost unplayable due to the unresponsive controls.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Doom|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=85|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=October 1995|page=66}}</ref>\n\n===PlayStation===\nThe [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version of ''Doom'' was published and developed by [[Midway Games|Williams Entertainment]] and released on November 16, 1995. This version spent six months in development.<ref name=\"Max2\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Doom: The Ultimate Version of the Greatest Gore Blast Ever!|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=2 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=November 1995|pages=56\u201360}}</ref> It is one of the best selling versions of the game after the original PC version. It was re-released several times, first on the \"[[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]]\" range in the U.S., which requires that games have sold at least 150,000 copies there, and on the \"[[Platinum Range]]\" in [[PAL region]]s, which indicates that it sold over 600,000 copies in those territories.\n\nChanges from the PC original include the removal of the \"Nightmare\" difficulty level, and the fact that progress is saved via passwords (given at the end of each level). The passwords also save ammo and health stats, but the numbers for them are rounded. This version features 59 levels in total; 23 levels from the PC version of ''Doom'' (edited much like the Jaguar and 32X versions), both of the levels designed for the Jaguar version, six new levels designed by the Midway team, five levels from ''The Ultimate Doom''{{'}}s fourth episode, and 23 levels from ''Doom II''. Unlike the other 1990s ''Doom'' ports, all of the enemies from the PC version of ''Doom'' are included. However, the Arch-vile monster from ''Doom II'' is not present; according to one of the game's designers, Harry Teasley, this was because he had twice as many frames as any other monster, and the team felt that they \"just couldn't do him justice\" on the PlayStation.<ref>http://5years.doomworld.com/interviews/harryteasley/page3.shtml Harry Teasley interview</ref> There is, however, one new monster, the Nightmare Spectre. According to Teasley, this was included to add variety, and to take advantage of the PlayStation's capabilities. Two player [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] and co-operative multiplayer modes are available on the PlayStation if two consoles are linked using the original Serial I/O port, and each console has its own controller and ''Doom'' disc inserted.\n\nMany textures were reduced in size due to technical limitations. As a result, the mug shot appears to be different from the one in the PC version; in fact, it is the same animated sprite, but squashed in from the sides. A small selection of new graphics and visual effects were introduced. These include sector-based coloured lighting, an animated, flame-filled sky, and a new animation for the player's mug shot, which shows the [[Doomguy]]'s head exploding if the player character is [[gib (video gaming)|gib]]bed.<ref name=\"Max2\"/> For the first time, translucent Spectres are drawn without the cascade effect (including the darker-shaded Nightmare Spectres). The original music by Bobby Prince was replaced by a new score by [[Aubrey Hodges]]. The sound effects and voice-overs were also completely redone by Hodges, and, in parts of certain levels, echo effects were added. All of the story text is cut, save for the ending and second intermission from ''Doom II'', the latter of which appears at the end of ''Ultimate Doom'' instead. A bonus level presented a level 'club doom' - with a nightclub filled with health potions and demons attacking on a dance floor and dance-cages.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNpho45LnhE</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1996, a port containing levels from ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth#Master Levels for Doom II|Master Levels for Doom II]]'' and ''[[Final Doom]]'' was released for the PlayStation under the name ''Final Doom''. The PlayStation version of ''Final Doom'' has thirteen levels from ''Master Levels for Doom II'', eleven levels from ''TNT: Evilution'', and six levels from ''The Plutonia Experiment''. Like the PlayStation version of ''Doom'', ''Final Doom'' uses passwords. Unlike the PlayStation version of ''Doom'', support for the [[PlayStation Mouse]] peripheral is available for ''Final Doom''.\n\nThe PlayStation version was met with critical acclaim, with critics concurring it to be by far the best console version of the game to date. Major Mike of ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a perfect score in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), noting that it was not just a straight conversion but a drastically reworked and comprehensive edition with \"enough new twists and turns to surprise even the most battle-weary ''Doom'' player\". He applauded the inclusion of ''Doom II'', the added levels, the much smoother graphics when compared to previous console ports, the clear sound effects, the \"chilling\" music, and the precise controls.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Doom: Special PlayStation Edition|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=87 |publisher=[[IDG]]|date=December 1995|pages=58\u201359}}</ref> A reviewer for ''Maximum'' found the port's most worthwhile aspects to be the huge number of levels, the use of the shoulder buttons for strafing, and the \"vastly improved\" audio.

He complained that the walls are \"sticky\" and that he was feeling burnt out on reviewing ports of ''Doom'', and gave it four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Doom|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=78}}</ref> ''Next Generation''{{'}}s 1996 overview of PlayStation games raised the score to a perfect five stars.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Every PlayStation Game Played, Reviewed, and Rated|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=57}}</ref> [[IGN]] gave it a 7 out of 10, citing the high frame rate, impressive lighting effects, use of the PlayStation Link Cable, and inclusion of ''Doom II'' content.

This version runs in a small screen at a low frame rate, though it includes the option to shrink the screen size further, which allows the game to run faster and smoother. It lacks some effects found in other versions but has an updated soundtrack that features remixed and original music. The Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind are missing, though the Spectre (which is absent from the Jaguar, SNES, and 32X versions) is included. The 3DO version was originally a more ambitious project, intended to surpass the PC version, but after it was mired in [[development hell]] for two years, the programmer was contracted to create a basic port in ten weeks.<ref>{{cite news | last = Matthews | first= Will | date = December 2013 | title = Ahead of its Time: A 3DO Retrospective | work = [[Retro Gamer]] | issue = 122 | pages = 26\u201329 | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref> In December 2014, the source code for the 3DO version was released to the public.<ref name=\"3do-sourcecode\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/doom3do|title=The complete archive for DOOM for the 3DO|last=Heineman|first=Rebecca Ann|date=December 2014|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Maximum'' thoroughly panned this version for its lack of [[PAL]] optimization, large borders, choppy frame rate even on the smallest possible screen size, bland color palette, music which is lacking in atmosphere, and load times. They added that the frame rate and slowdown make the game too easy: \"When large amounts of monsters arrive to beat the crap out of you, the game slows down to such an extent that you have ages to line up your shots and fire\". With their only praise being for the intuitive and effective control configuration, they gave it one out of five stars.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Maximum Reviews: Doom|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=4 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1996|pages=160\u20131}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]'' called it \"the worst console version of ''Doom'' so far\", chiefly due to the choppy frame rate.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Quick Hits: Doom|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=92|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1996|page=72}}</ref>\n\n===Sega Saturn===\nBased on the PlayStation version, ''Doom'' was ported to the Sega Saturn by [[Rage Software]] and published by [[GT Interactive]] in 1997.<ref name=SSM16/> Though containing the same levels, enemies, structures, and most of the sounds effects and music from the PlayStation version, this port suffers a number of differences and setbacks; the frame rate is significantly lower, the animation is slower, the echoed sound effects and sector-based lighting are missing, the Spectre and Nightmare Spectre monsters do not have the translucent textures and instead are drawn in see-through sprites of regular Demon enemies, and the animated fiery skyline in certain levels is gone, usually replaced with ''Doom II''{{'}}s city skyline. The lead programmer on this port, Jim Bagley, later explained that he originally programmed a hardware-accelerated engine that would have performed on par with high-end PCs of the time, but id Software disallowed usage of the engine due to texture distortion caused by the rendering process, resulting in the final version using an entirely software-based renderer.\n\nThis version is compatible with the Saturn analog controller<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Preview: Doom|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=15|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=January 1997|pages=28\u201329}}</ref> and the Saturn [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]. However, the mouse cannot be used to strafe, access the automap, or manually change weapons (though as in all versions of ''Doom'', the player character automatically equips a weapon when it is first acquired and switches to a different weapon if the current one is depleted of ammunition).\n\nThe packaging for the U.S. release contains a few errors, such as the game screen shots on the back actually being from the PC version of ''Final Doom'', and it claims to be \"deathmatch ready\", when it is in fact only one player (the deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer modes are only in the Japanese and PAL releases, despite the fact that the Saturn link cable needed to play these modes had not been released in PAL regions<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Q&A |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=18 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=April 1997|pages=32}}</ref>).\n\nThe Japanese release of the game has a slightly smoother frame rate compared to the North American and European versions, though still considerably lower than that of the PlayStation version.\n\nThe Saturn port was met with a generally negative reception, with most reviewers considering it far below the quality of the PlayStation version.

These were the first ports of ''Doom'' on a [[handheld game console|handheld device]]. Both ''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' received a much larger amount of censoring than other ports (monsters bleed green instead of red, and monster corpses disappear a few seconds after initial death; in both secret levels for ''Doom II'', swastika flags and walls were replaced by stylized double-headed eagles reminiscent of ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s picture art was replaced by Wilhelm Strasse's picture art; no bleeding of the status bar face), and, because of this, received a [[Teen]] rating by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].\n\n===Xbox===\nThe Limited Collector's Edition of ''Doom 3'', released in 2005, features ports of ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II'', including two new levels, \"Sewers\" and \"Betray\". They feature the same multiplayer as the PC version, however not through [[Xbox Live]]. All the PC levels for both games are included; however, the eight console-only levels which appeared on the Jaguar, PlayStation, 3DO, and Saturn versions are omitted. This port was programmed by [[Vicarious Visions]]. The expansion pack \"Resurrection of Evil\" also contained ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II'', as well as ''Master Levels for Doom II''.\n\n===Xbox 360===\nOn September 27, 2006, ''Doom'' was released for download on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game has all 4 episodes from ''The Ultimate Doom'' plus online cooperative and deathmatch modes through [[Xbox Live]]. Like the Xbox version, it does not include any of the console-only levels which appeared in earlier ports. Supports 11 screen sizes, and has higher graphics resolution than any earlier console port. Due to a bug, the music plays at a slower speed. This port, programmed by [[Nerve Software]], also credits [[Vicarious Visions]] and likely shares code with the Xbox version. There are no cheats in this version of the game.\n\nIn 2010, the game was pulled from the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] because [[Activision]], the game's publisher, no longer has the rights to maintain the game on the Marketplace, but as of January 20, 2012, it has been republished by [[Bethesda Softworks]],<ref>[http://www.platformnation.com/2012/01/18/doom-available-on-xbla-again/ Doom Relisted on XBLA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120184640/http://www.platformnation.com/2012/01/18/doom-available-on-xbla-again/ |date=2012-01-20 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/10/doom_mysteriously_removed_from.php |title=Doom Removed From Xbox Live Arcade, Back Up Soon - Joystick Division<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724091905/http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/10/doom_mysteriously_removed_from.php |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the same company that published the Xbox Live Arcade version of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''.\n\nBoth games are backwards-compatible with the [[Xbox One]] and can be purchased from the Xbox Store.
