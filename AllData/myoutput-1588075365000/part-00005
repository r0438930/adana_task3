The building faces [[Catherine Street]] (earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street) and backs onto [[Drury Lane]]. The building is the most recent in a line of four theatres which were built at the same location, the earliest of which dated back to 1663, making it the oldest theatre site in London still in use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html |title=Information from |publisher=Victorian Web |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415043316/http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html |archivedate=15 April 2012}}</ref> According to the author Peter Thomson, for its first two centuries, Drury Lane could \"reasonably have claimed to be London's leading theatre\".<ref>{{harvnb|Thomson|1995|p=309}}</ref> For most of that time, it was one of a handful of [[patent theatre]]s, granted monopoly rights to the production of [[Legitimate theater|\"legitimate\" drama]]  [[English drama|in London]] (meaning spoken plays, rather than opera, dance, concerts, or plays with music).\n\nThe first theatre on the site was built at the behest of [[Thomas Killigrew]] in the early 1660s, when theatres were allowed to reopen during the [[The Restoration|English Restoration]]. Initially known as \"Theatre Royal in Bridges Street\", the theatre's proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at the theatre on a regular basis, including [[Nell Gwyn]] and [[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]]. In 1672, the theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot, renamed the \"Theatre Royal in Drury Lane\"; it opened in 1674. This building lasted nearly 120 years, under the leaderships of [[Colley Cibber]], [[David Garrick]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], the last of whom employed [[Joseph Grimaldi]] as the theatre's resident Clown.\n\nIn 1791, under Sheridan's management, the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794. This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809. The building that stands today opened in 1812. It has been the residency of well known actors including; [[Edmund Kean]], comedian [[Dan Leno]], and the musical composer and performer [[Ivor Novello]]. From the [[Second world war|Second World War]], the theatre has primarily hosted long runs of musicals, including ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1947\u20131953), ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1958\u20131963), ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'' (1984\u20131989, 2017\u20132019) and ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' (1989\u20131999), the theatre's longest-running show.<ref name=DLHistory /> The theatre is owned by the composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]].\n\n== First theatre: Theatre Royal, Bridges Street (1663) ==\n[[File:Thomas killigrew 1650.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Killigrew]] as he appeared in 1650]]\n\nAfter the eleven-year-long [[English Interregnum|Puritan Interregnum]], which had seen the banning of pastimes regarded as frivolous, such as theatre, the English monarchy was [[The Restoration|restored]] to the throne with the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660. Soon after, Charles issued [[letters patent|Letters Patent]] to two parties licensing the formation of new acting companies. One of these went to [[Thomas Killigrew]], whose company became known as the [[King's Company]], and who built a new theatre in Drury Lane. The Letters Patent also granted the two companies a shared monopoly on the public performance of legitimate drama in London; this monopoly was challenged in the 18th century by new venues and by a certain slipperiness in the definition of \"legitimate drama,\" but remained legally in place until 1843.<ref>{{harvnb|Milhous|1979|pp=4\u20137}}</ref> The new playhouse, architect unknown, opened on 7 May 1663 and was known from the placement of the entrance as the \"Theatre Royal in Bridges Street.\"{{efn|The single roadway now named Catherine Street was for most of its history named Catherine Street in its southern portion and Bridges (or Brydges) street in its northern.}} It went by other names as well, including the \"King's Playhouse.\" The building was a three-tiered wooden structure, {{convert|112|ft|m}} long and {{convert|59|ft|m}} wide; it could hold an audience of 700.<ref name=Beauclerk>{{harvnb|Beauclerk|2005|pp=59\u201360}}</ref> Set well back from the broader streets, the theatre was accessed by narrow passages between surrounding buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartnoll|1983}}.

This jumble of rooms often made communication among various departments difficult, a problem that Garrick corrected during his tenure as manager. The entire complex occupied {{convert|13134|sqft|m2|0}} bounded by Drury Lane (east), Brydges Street (west), [[Great Russell Street]] (north) and Little Russell Street (south).<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|Kahrl|1979|p=80}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1674, theatregoers accessed the Drury Lane via a long ten foot wide passageway from Bridges Street. The passageway opened onto a yard (previously a \"Riding Yard\"<ref>''The Survey of London'', Volume 35, London: Athlone Press, University of London (1970), p. 30</ref>) in which the theatre stood. It's likely that the yard remained open to the sky at this date, on three sides of the Theatre Royal walls. Henri Misson, a visitor from France, offers a description of the theatre in 1698: his use of the word \"amphitheatre\" supports the view that Drury Lane had a circular line of boxes surrounding its pit:\n\n{{quote|The Pit is an Amphitheatre, fill'd with Benches without Backboards, and adorn'd and cover'd with green Cloth. Men of Quality, particularly the younger Sort, some Ladies of Reputation and Virtue, and abundance of Damsels that haunt for Prey, sit all together in this Place, Higgledy-piggledy, chatter, toy, play, hear, hear not. Farther up, against the Wall, under the first Gallery and just opposite to the Stage, rises another Amphitheatre, which is taken by persons of the best Quality, among whom are generally very few Men. The Galleries, whereof there are only two Rows, are fill'd with none but ordinary People, particularly the Upper one.<ref>{{harvnb|Nagler|1959|p=208}}</ref>}}\n\nAs Misson points out, the seating was divided by [[Social structure of Britain|class]], and tickets were priced accordingly. Box seats, used by the nobility and wealthy gentry, cost 5 [[shilling]]s; the benches in the pit where some gentry sat, but also critics and scholars, cost 3 shillings; tradesmen and professionals occupied the first gallery with seats costing 2 shillings, while servants and other \"ordinary people\", as Misson refers to them, occupied the 1 shilling seats of the upper gallery. Seats were not numbered and were offered on a \"first come, first served\" basis, leading many members of the gentry to send servants to reserve seats well ahead of performances.<ref name=\"Stone\" /> The stage was {{convert|45|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|ft|m}} deep with a [[Rake (theatre)|raked floor]] from the footlights to the backdrop. The angle of the rake rose one inch for every {{convert|24|in|mm}} of horizontal stage. The stage floor included grooves for wings and flats in addition to trap doors in the floor. The proscenium arch covered the stage equipment above the stage that included a pair of girondels \u2013 large wheels holding many candles used to counteract the light from the footlights. Towards the latter part of the 18th century, doors were placed on either side of the stage, and a series of small spikes traced the edge of the stage apron to prevent audiences from climbing onto the stage. At the very back of the stage, a wide door opened to reveal Drury Lane.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|Kahrl|1979|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAn added difficulty for Killigrew and his sons Thomas and Charles was the political unrest of 1678\u20131684 with the [[Popish Plot]] and the [[Exclusion Bill]] crisis distracting potential audiences from things theatrical. This affected both the King's and the Duke's companies, but most of all the King's which had no profit margin to carry them through the lean years. In 1682, the companies merged, or rather, the King's was absorbed by the Duke's. Led at the time by [[Thomas Betterton]], the United Company, as it was now called, chose Drury Lane as their production house, leaving the Duke's Company's theatre in [[Dorset Garden Theatre|Dorset Garden]] closed for a time. In 1688, Betterton was removed from managerial control by [[Alexander Davenant]], son of [[William Davenant]], the original patent holder for the Duke's Company. Davenant's management (with Charles Killigrew) proved brief and disastrous, and by 1693 he was fleeing to the [[Canary Islands]] in the wake of embezzlement charges. The Theatre Royal found itself in the hands of lawyer [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]] for the next 16 years.<ref>Spiers, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030910003852/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_se/murray/Restoration/Companies/ThComp.html Companies].</ref>\n\nNeither Davenant's nor Killigrew's sons were much better than crooks,<ref>{{harvnb|Milhous|1979|pp=37\u201340, 56\u201357}}</ref> and Rich attempted to recoup their depredations of the company's resources by cost-cutting tyranny, pitting actor against actor and slashing salaries. By 1695, the actors, including day-to-day manager and acting legend Thomas Betterton, were alienated and humiliated enough to walk out and set up a cooperative company of their own. Nine men and six women departed, all of them established professional performers, including such draws as tragedian [[Elizabeth Barry]] and comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]], leaving the United Company \u2013 henceforth known as the \"Patent Company\" \u2013 in \"a very despicable condition,\" according to an anonymous contemporary pamphlet:\n\n{{quote|The disproportion was so great at parting, that it was almost impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a sufficient number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience.

It is likely that the sale was at a vastly inflated price and that Colley's goal was simply to get out of debts and make a profit (see Robert Lowe in his edition of Cibber's ''Apology''). Members of the troupe at the time were most displeased; an actor's revolt was organised and executed; [[Charles Fleetwood (theatre manager)|Charles Fleetwood]] came to control the theatre. Fleetwood's tenure was tumultuous; his abolition of the practice of allowing [[footman|footmen]] free access to the upper gallery led to riots in 1737, and Fleetwood's gambling problems entangled the theatre in his own financial difficulties.<ref name=\"Hartnoll\">{{harvnb|Hartnoll|1983}}</ref> It was during this period that actor [[Charles Macklin]] (a native of [[Inishowen]] in [[County Donegal]] in [[Ulster]]) rose to fame, propelled by a singular performance as [[Shylock]] in an early 1741 production of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', in which he introduced a realistic, naturalistic style of acting, abandoning the artificial bombast typical to dramatic roles prior.<ref name=\"Hartnoll\" />\n\n[[File:Drury lane facade 1775.png|left|thumb|The facade on Bridges Street.

A third theatre was designed by [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]] and opened on 12 March 1794.

This was a cavernous theatre, accommodating more than 3,600 spectators.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomson|1995|p=310}} specifies 3611.</ref> The motivation behind building on such a large scale? In the words of one owner:\n\n{{quote|I was aware of the very popular notion that our theatres ought to be very small; but it appeared to me that if that very popular notion should be suffered to proceed too far it would in every way deteriorate our dramatic performances depriving the proprietors of that revenue which is indispensable to defray the heavy expenses of such a concern.<ref name=\"Mackintosh-34\">{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1993|p=34}}</ref>}}\n\nNew technology facilitated the expansion: iron columns replaced bulky wood, supporting five tiers of galleries. The stage was large, too: {{convert|83|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|92|ft|m}} deep. Holland, the architect, said it was \"on a larger scale than any other theatre in Europe.\" Except for churches, it was the tallest building in London.<ref name=\"Mackintosh-34\" />\n\nThe \"very popular notion that our theatres ought to be very small\" proved hard to overcome. Various accounts from the period bemoan the mammoth size of the new theatre, longing for the \"warm close observant seats of Old Drury,\" as one May 1794 theatre-goer put it.{{efn|John Byng, later Viscount Torrington.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1993|p=35}}</ref>}} Actress [[Sarah Siddons]], then part of the Drury Lane company, called it \"a wilderness of a place\" (and left Drury Lane along with her brother [[John Philip Kemble]] in 1803). Not only was any sense of intimacy and connection to the company on stage lost, but the very size of the theatre put a great deal of the audience at such a distance from the stage so as to make hearing a player's voice quite difficult. To compensate, the productions mounted in the new theatre tended more toward spectacle than the spoken word.<ref name=\"Mackintosh-34\" /> An example of such a spectacle is a 1794 production that featured real water flowing down a rocky stream into a lake large enough on which to row a boat. This water issued from tanks in the attics above the house, which were installed \u2013 along with a much-touted iron [[safety curtain]] \u2013 as proof against fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradby|James|Sharratt|1981|p=92}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Burning of Drury Lane Theatre from Westminster Bridge.jpg|left|thumb|After standing only 15 years, the third Drury Lane theatre building burned down on 24 February 1809.

He had grown in stature as a statesman during this time, but troubled finances were to be his undoing. The 1794 rebuilding had cost double the original estimate of \u00a380,000, and Sheridan bore the entirety of the debt.

The building faces [[Catherine Street]] (earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street) and backs onto [[Drury Lane]]. The building is the most recent in a line of four theatres which were built at the same location, the earliest of which dated back to 1663, making it the oldest theatre site in London still in use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html |title=Information from |publisher=Victorian Web |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415043316/http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html |archivedate=15 April 2012}}</ref> According to the author Peter Thomson, for its first two centuries, Drury Lane could \"reasonably have claimed to be London's leading theatre\".<ref>{{harvnb|Thomson|1995|p=309}}</ref> For most of that time, it was one of a handful of [[patent theatre]]s, granted monopoly rights to the production of [[Legitimate theater|\"legitimate\" drama]]  [[English drama|in London]] (meaning spoken plays, rather than opera, dance, concerts, or plays with music).\n\nThe first theatre on the site was built at the behest of [[Thomas Killigrew]] in the early 1660s, when theatres were allowed to reopen during the [[The Restoration|English Restoration]]. Initially known as \"Theatre Royal in Bridges Street\", the theatre's proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at the theatre on a regular basis, including [[Nell Gwyn]] and [[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]]. In 1672, the theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot, renamed the \"Theatre Royal in Drury Lane\"; it opened in 1674. This building lasted nearly 120 years, under the leaderships of [[Colley Cibber]], [[David Garrick]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], the last of whom employed [[Joseph Grimaldi]] as the theatre's resident Clown.\n\nIn 1791, under Sheridan's management, the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794. This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809. The building that stands today opened in 1812. It has been the residency of well known actors including; [[Edmund Kean]], comedian [[Dan Leno]], and the musical composer and performer [[Ivor Novello]]. From the [[Second world war|Second World War]], the theatre has primarily hosted long runs of musicals, including ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1947\u20131953), ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1958\u20131963), ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'' (1984\u20131989, 2017\u20132019) and ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' (1989\u20131999), the theatre's longest-running show.<ref name=DLHistory /> The theatre is owned by the composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]].\n\n== First theatre: Theatre Royal, Bridges Street (1663) ==\n[[File:Thomas killigrew 1650.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Killigrew]] as he appeared in 1650]]\n\nAfter the eleven-year-long [[English Interregnum|Puritan Interregnum]], which had seen the banning of pastimes regarded as frivolous, such as theatre, the English monarchy was [[The Restoration|restored]] to the throne with the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660. Soon after, Charles issued [[letters patent|Letters Patent]] to two parties licensing the formation of new acting companies. One of these went to [[Thomas Killigrew]], whose company became known as the [[King's Company]], and who built a new theatre in Drury Lane. The Letters Patent also granted the two companies a shared monopoly on the public performance of legitimate drama in London; this monopoly was challenged in the 18th century by new venues and by a certain slipperiness in the definition of \"legitimate drama,\" but remained legally in place until 1843.<ref>{{harvnb|Milhous|1979|pp=4\u20137}}</ref> The new playhouse, architect unknown, opened on 7 May 1663 and was known from the placement of the entrance as the \"Theatre Royal in Bridges Street.\"{{efn|The single roadway now named Catherine Street was for most of its history named Catherine Street in its southern portion and Bridges (or Brydges) street in its northern.}} It went by other names as well, including the \"King's Playhouse.\" The building was a three-tiered wooden structure, {{convert|112|ft|m}} long and {{convert|59|ft|m}} wide; it could hold an audience of 700.<ref name=Beauclerk>{{harvnb|Beauclerk|2005|pp=59\u201360}}</ref> Set well back from the broader streets, the theatre was accessed by narrow passages between surrounding buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartnoll|1983}}.

He has this to say in his diary:\n\n{{quote|The house is made with extraordinary good contrivance, and yet hath some faults, as the narrowness of the passages in and out of the Pitt, and the distance from the stage to the boxes, which I am confident cannot hear; but for all other things it is well, only, above all, the musique being below, and most of it sounding under the very stage, there is no hearing of the bases at all, nor very well of the trebles, which sure must be mended.<ref>[http://www.pepys.info/1663/1663may.html Pepys diary for May 1663] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104213709/http://www.pepys.info/1663/1663may.html |date=4 January 2014 }}.

Of course Killigrew would have had trouble getting Mohun's troupe to accept the kind of absolute control Davenant was able to impose upon his fledglings.

This applies especially to the new form [[Restoration comedy]], dominated in the 1660s by [[William Wycherley]] and the Theatre Royal's house dramatist [[John Dryden]].

The cost of constructing the new theatre, replacing their costumes and scenery lost in the fire and competitive pressure from the rival Duke's Company contributed to its decline.

This jumble of rooms often made communication among various departments difficult, a problem that Garrick corrected during his tenure as manager. The entire complex occupied {{convert|13134|sqft|m2|0}} bounded by Drury Lane (east), Brydges Street (west), Great Russell Street (north) and Little Russell Street (south).<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|Kahrl|1979|p=80}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1674, theatregoers accessed the Drury Lane via a long ten foot wide passageway from Bridges Street. The passageway opened onto a yard (previously a \"Riding Yard\"<ref>''The Survey of London'', Volume 35, London: Athlone Press, University of London (1970), p. 30</ref>) in which the theatre stood. It's likely that the yard remained open to the sky at this date, on three sides of the Theatre Royal walls. Henri Misson, a visitor from France, offers a description of the theatre in 1698: his use of the word \"amphitheatre\" supports the view that Drury Lane had a circular line of boxes surrounding its pit:\n\n{{quote|The Pit is an Amphitheatre, fill'd with Benches without Backboards, and adorn'd and cover'd with green Cloth. Men of Quality, particularly the younger Sort, some Ladies of Reputation and Virtue, and abundance of Damsels that haunt for Prey, sit all together in this Place, Higgledy-piggledy, chatter, toy, play, hear, hear not. Farther up, against the Wall, under the first Gallery and just opposite to the Stage, rises another Amphitheatre, which is taken by persons of the best Quality, among whom are generally very few Men. The Galleries, whereof there are only two Rows, are fill'd with none but ordinary People, particularly the Upper one.<ref>{{harvnb|Nagler|1959|p=208}}</ref>}}\n\nAs Misson points out, the seating was divided by [[Social structure of Britain|class]], and tickets were priced accordingly. Box seats, used by the nobility and wealthy gentry, cost 5 [[shilling]]s; the benches in the pit where some gentry sat, but also critics and scholars, cost 3 shillings; tradesmen and professionals occupied the first gallery with seats costing 2 shillings, while servants and other \"ordinary people\", as Misson refers to them, occupied the 1 shilling seats of the upper gallery. Seats were not numbered and were offered on a \"first come, first served\" basis, leading many members of the gentry to send servants to reserve seats well ahead of performances.<ref name=\"Stone\" /> The stage was {{convert|45|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|ft|m}} deep with a [[Rake (theatre)|raked floor]] from the footlights to the backdrop. The angle of the rake rose one inch for every {{convert|24|in|mm}} of horizontal stage. The stage floor included grooves for wings and flats in addition to trap doors in the floor. The proscenium arch covered the stage equipment above the stage that included a pair of girondels \u2013 large wheels holding many candles used to counteract the light from the footlights. Towards the latter part of the 18th century, doors were placed on either side of the stage, and a series of small spikes traced the edge of the stage apron to prevent audiences from climbing onto the stage. At the very back of the stage, a wide door opened to reveal Drury Lane.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|Kahrl|1979|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAn added difficulty for Killigrew and his sons Thomas and Charles was the political unrest of 1678\u20131684 with the [[Popish Plot]] and the [[Exclusion Bill]] crisis distracting potential audiences from things theatrical. This affected both the King's and the Duke's companies, but most of all the King's which had no profit margin to carry them through the lean years. In 1682, the companies merged, or rather, the King's was absorbed by the Duke's. Led at the time by [[Thomas Betterton]], the United Company, as it was now called, chose Drury Lane as their production house, leaving the Duke's Company's theatre in [[Dorset Garden Theatre|Dorset Garden]] closed for a time. In 1688, Betterton was removed from managerial control by [[Alexander Davenant]], son of [[William Davenant]], the original patent holder for the Duke's Company. Davenant's management (with Charles Killigrew) proved brief and disastrous, and by 1693 he was fleeing to the [[Canary Islands]] in the wake of embezzlement charges. The Theatre Royal found itself in the hands of lawyer [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]] for the next 16 years.<ref>Spiers, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030910003852/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_se/murray/Restoration/Companies/ThComp.html Companies].</ref>\n\nNeither Davenant's nor Killigrew's sons were much better than crooks,<ref>{{harvnb|Milhous|1979|pp=37\u201340, 56\u201357}}</ref> and Rich attempted to recoup their depredations of the company's resources by cost-cutting tyranny, pitting actor against actor and slashing salaries. By 1695, the actors, including day-to-day manager and acting legend Thomas Betterton, were alienated and humiliated enough to walk out and set up a cooperative company of their own. Nine men and six women departed, all of them established professional performers, including such draws as tragedian [[Elizabeth Barry]] and comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]], leaving the United Company \u2013 henceforth known as the \"Patent Company\" \u2013 in \"a very despicable condition,\" according to an anonymous contemporary pamphlet:\n\n{{quote|The disproportion was so great at parting, that it was almost impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a sufficient number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience.

A lawyer named William Collier was briefly given the right to mount productions in Drury Lane, but by 1710 the troupe was in the hands of the actors [[Colley Cibber]], [[Robert Wilks]], and [[Thomas Doggett]] \u2013 a triumvirate that eventually found themselves sharply satirised in [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Dunciad|Dunciad]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Theatre Royal Drury Lane |url=http://britishtheatre.com/venue/theatre-royal-drury-lane/ |publisher=britishtheatre.com |accessdate=9 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213095955/http://britishtheatre.com/venue/theatre-royal-drury-lane/ |archivedate=13 December 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1713, [[Barton Booth]] replaced Doggett.<ref>{{harvnb|Dobbs|1972|pp=62, 74, 79\u201385}}</ref> On 2 March 1717 was the premiere of the ballet [[The Loves of Mars and Venus]] choreographed by [[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]], and was the first ballet to be performed in England.\n\nCibber was the ''de facto'' leader of the triumvirate, and he led the theatre through a controversial but generally successful period until 1733, when he sold his controlling interest to [[John Highmore]]. It is likely that the sale was at a vastly inflated price and that Colley's goal was simply to get out of debts and make a profit (see Robert Lowe in his edition of Cibber's ''Apology''). Members of the troupe at the time were most displeased; an actor's revolt was organised and executed; [[Charles Fleetwood (theatre manager)|Charles Fleetwood]] came to control the theatre. Fleetwood's tenure was tumultuous; his abolition of the practice of allowing [[footman|footmen]] free access to the upper gallery led to riots in 1737, and Fleetwood's gambling problems entangled the theatre in his own financial difficulties.<ref name=\"Hartnoll\">{{harvnb|Hartnoll|1983}}</ref> It was during this period that actor [[Charles Macklin]] (a native of [[Inishowen]] in [[County Donegal]] in [[Ulster]]) rose to fame, propelled by a singular performance as [[Shylock]] in an early 1741 production of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', in which he introduced a realistic, naturalistic style of acting, abandoning the artificial bombast typical to dramatic roles prior.<ref name=\"Hartnoll\" />\n\n[[File:Drury lane facade 1775.png|left|thumb|The facade on Bridges Street.

Garrick shared the stage with company including [[Margaret Woffington|Peg Woffington]], [[Susannah Cibber]], [[Hannah Pritchard]], [[Kitty Clive]], [[Spranger Barry]], [[Richard Yates (actor)|Richard Yates]] and [[Ned Shuter]].

Their additions included an ornate ceiling and a [[stucco]] facade facing Bridges Street. This facade was the first time any structure that might be considered part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had been built in the centre of the block, hemmed in by other structures.

A third theatre was designed by [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]] and opened on 12 March 1794.

This was a cavernous theatre, accommodating more than 3,600 spectators.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomson|1995|p=310}} specifies 3611.</ref> The motivation behind building on such a large scale? In the words of one owner:\n\n{{quote|I was aware of the very popular notion that our theatres ought to be very small; but it appeared to me that if that very popular notion should be suffered to proceed too far it would in every way deteriorate our dramatic performances depriving the proprietors of that revenue which is indispensable to defray the heavy expenses of such a concern.<ref name=\"Mackintosh-34\">{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1993|p=34}}</ref>}}\n\nNew technology facilitated the expansion: iron columns replaced bulky wood, supporting five tiers of galleries. The stage was large, too: {{convert|83|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|92|ft|m}} deep. Holland, the architect, said it was \"on a larger scale than any other theatre in Europe.\" Except for churches, it was the tallest building in London.<ref name=\"Mackintosh-34\" />\n\nThe \"very popular notion that our theatres ought to be very small\" proved hard to overcome. Various accounts from the period bemoan the mammoth size of the new theatre, longing for the \"warm close observant seats of Old Drury,\" as one May 1794 theatre-goer put it.{{efn|John Byng, later Viscount Torrington.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1993|p=35}}</ref>}} Actress [[Sarah Siddons]], then part of the Drury Lane company, called it \"a wilderness of a place\" (and left Drury Lane along with her brother [[John Philip Kemble]] in 1803). Not only was any sense of intimacy and connection to the company on stage lost, but the very size of the theatre put a great deal of the audience at such a distance from the stage so as to make hearing a player's voice quite difficult. To compensate, the productions mounted in the new theatre tended more toward spectacle than the spoken word.<ref name=\"Mackintosh-34\" /> An example of such a spectacle is a 1794 production that featured real water flowing down a rocky stream into a lake large enough on which to row a boat. This water issued from tanks in the attics above the house, which were installed \u2013 along with a much-touted iron [[safety curtain]] \u2013 as proof against fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradby|James|Sharratt|1981|p=92}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Burning of Drury Lane Theatre from Westminster Bridge.jpg|left|thumb|After standing only 15 years, the third Drury Lane theatre building burned down on 24 February 1809.

He had grown in stature as a statesman during this time, but troubled finances were to be his undoing. The 1794 rebuilding had cost double the original estimate of \u00a380,000, and Sheridan bore the entirety of the debt.

On the other hand, other theatres, used to presenting musical entertainments, continued to do so, and Drury Lane continued as one of the most accepted venues for legitimate theatre. The 19th-century run of financial and artistic failures at Drury Lane was interrupted by four plays produced over a twenty-five-year period by the actor-playwright [[Dion Boucicault]]: ''The Queen of Spades'' (1851), ''Eugenie'' (1855), ''Formosa'' (1869), and ''[[The Shaughraun]]'' (1875). But this period of general decline culminated with [[F. B.

In the 1880s and 1890s, the theatre hosted many of the productions of the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]]. Harris focused increased resources on the theatre's annual [[pantomime]], beginning at Christmas 1888, adding a well-known comedian, [[Dan Leno]]. These spectacular Christmas shows were a major success, often playing into March. They were choreographed by the theatre's dance master, [[John D'Auban]].
