At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical dramas increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, as travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions organized by local communities became more common in the later Middle Ages.\n\nThe ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'' is the best known early form of the dramas, a dramatised liturgical dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his body.<ref name=bellinger/> These primitive forms were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Eventually the dramas moved from church to the exterior - the churchyard and the public marketplace. These early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks. Religious drama flourished from about the ninth century to the sixteenth.\n\nIn 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a [[Papal bull|papal edict]] forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play|Secunda Pastorum]]'' of the [[Wakefield Cycle]]. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.\n\nThese vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as [[York]], performed and produced by [[guild]]s, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin ''ministerium''<!-- with 'i', misterium means mystery --> meaning \"occupation\" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned, following the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the establishment of the [[Church of England]] in 1534.\n\nAn example of a mystery play was the Easter Trope performed in the 10th Century. It was also called Quem Quaeritis? (Whom do you seek?)\n\nThe mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play as well as provided actors with a dressing room as well as a stage<ref>\"Mystery Play | Dramatic Genre.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 6 February 2015.</ref> The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as ''Corpus Christi cycles''. These cycles were often performed during the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]] and their overall design drew attention to Christ's life and his redemption for all of mankind.<ref>Windeatt, Barry. \"Medieval Imaginations: Literature & Visual Culture in the Middle Ages.\" Medieval Imaginations: Literature & Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015.</ref>\n\nThe plays were performed by a combination of professionals and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by the extravagance of the sets and 'special effects', but could also be stark and intimate. The variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays, could be remarkable.\n\nMystery Plays origin comes from the Latin word \"mysterium\" which translates craft or handicraft\n\n==English mystery plays==\n[[File:04b266 adamandeve.jpg|thumb|Actors portraying [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from paradise in a performance by the Players of St Peter]]\nThere are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays;<ref>Windeatt, Barry. \"Medieval Imaginations: Literature & Visual Culture in the Middle Ages.\" Medieval Imaginations: Literature & Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110111182223/http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/medieval/mystery_plays.php ]</ref> although these collections are sometimes referred to as \"cycles,\" it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the ''[[York Mystery Plays|York cycle]]'' of forty-eight pageants; there are also the ''[[Wakefield Cycle|Towneley plays]]'' of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays acted at [[Wakefield]]; the [[N-Town Plays|Ludus Coventriae]], now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the ''[[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester cycle]]'' of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament [[Coventry Mystery Plays|cycle acted at Coventry]] and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of [[Mary Magdalene]], ''[[The Brome Abraham and Isaac]]'' and a sixteenth-century play of the ''Conversion of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'' exist, all hailing from [[East Anglia]]. Besides the [[Middle English]] drama, there are three surviving plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]], and several cyclical plays survive from continental Europe.\n\nThese biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the ''Fall of Lucifer'', the ''Creation and Fall of Man'', ''Cain and Abel'', ''Noah and the Flood'', ''Abraham and Isaac'', the ''Nativity'', the ''Raising of Lazarus'', the ''Passion'', and the ''Resurrection''. Other pageants included the story of ''Moses'', the ''Procession of the Prophets'', ''Christ's Baptism'', the ''Temptation in the Wilderness'', and the ''Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin''. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval [[craft guild]]s. The York [[mercery|mercers]], for example, sponsored the ''Doomsday'' pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] from the carpenters' guild; the [[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and fishes]] miracle from the bakers; and the [[visit of the Magi]], with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oxenford|first=Lyn|title=Playing Period Plays |year=1958|publisher=Coach House Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=0853435499|page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mikics|first=David |title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms |url=https://archive.org/details/newhandbookoflit0000miki|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300106367|page=[https://archive.org/details/newhandbookoflit0000miki/page/194 194]}}</ref> The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on [[pageant wagon]]s. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the ''Second Shepherds' Play'' to [[Horbury|Horbery]] Shrogys <ref>http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?id=AnoTown&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&tag=public&part=13&division=div (line 454) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830231810/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?data=%2Flv1%2FArchive%2Fmideng-parsed&division=div&id=AnoTown&images=images%2Fmodeng&part=13&tag=public |date=30 August 2002 }}</ref> is strongly suggestive. In \"The London Burial Grounds\" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to [[St Katherine Cree]] on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. [[Edmund Bonner]], Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londoncemeteries.co.uk/?page=holmes |title=The London Burial Grounds: Notes on their History from the Earliest Times to the Present Day -Mrs. Basil Holmes (St Katherine Cree) |publisher=Londoncemeteries.co.uk |accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous plays of the Towneley collection are attributed to the Wakefield Master, an anonymous playwright who wrote in the fifteenth century. The epithet \"Wakefield Master\" was first applied to this individual by the literary historian Gayley. The Wakefield Master gets his name from the geographic location where he lived, the market-town of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He may have been a highly educated cleric there, or possibly a friar from a nearby monastery at Woodkirk, four miles north of Wakefield. It was once thought that this anonymous author wrote a series of 32 plays (each averaging about 384 lines) called the Towneley Cycle. The Master's contributions to this collection are still much debated, and some scholars believe he may have written fewer than ten of them. These works appear in a single manuscript, currently found in the Huntington Library of California. It shows signs of Protestant editing &mdash; references to the Pope and the sacraments are crossed out, for instance. Likewise, twelve manuscript leaves were ripped out between the two final plays because of Catholic references. This evidence strongly suggests the play was still being read and performed as late as 1520, perhaps as late in Renaissance as the final years of King Henry VIII's reign.\n\nThe best known pageant in the Towneley manuscript is ''The Second Shepherds' Pageant'', a burlesque of the Nativity featuring Mak the sheep stealer and his wife Gill, which more or less explicitly compares a stolen lamb to the Saviour of mankind. The ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'', derived from the apocryphal ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', was a popular part of the York and Wakefield cycles.\n\nThe dramas of the [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods were developed out of mystery plays.\n\n==Spanish mystery plays==\n\nThe [[Misteri d'Elx]] (in English, the [[Elx Mystery Play]] or [[Mystery Play of Elx]]) is a liturgical drama dating from the Middle Ages which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa Mar\u00eda in the city of [[Elx]] (also known as [[Elche]]). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the [[Council of Trent]] eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 [[Pope Urban VIII]] issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThe oldest liturgical drama (12th century) written already in old Spanish language was a [[codex]] found in the library of the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. The Auto de los Reyes Magos belongs to the Christmas cycle. It is a play about the [[Biblical Magi]], three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in [[Bethlehem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/liturgical-drama |title=Liturgical drama: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref> It is believed to have been based on an earlier liturgical Latin play written in France.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spanish Language and Literature}}</ref>\n\n==Miracle play==\nMiracle plays, or ''Saint's plays,'' are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the [[saint]]s, particularly [[St. Nicholas]] or [[St. Mary]], into the lives of ordinary people, rather than biblical events;<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|chapter=mystery play}}</ref> however both of these terms are more commonly used by modern scholars than they were by medieval people, who used a wide variety of terminology to refer to their dramatic performances.

Web. 7 February 2015.</ref>\n\nThe plays were performed by a combination of professionals and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by the extravagance of the sets and 'special effects', but could also be stark and intimate. The variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays, could be remarkable.\n\nMystery Plays origin comes from the Latin word \"mysterium\" which translates craft or handicraft\n\n==English mystery plays==\n[[File:04b266 adamandeve.jpg|thumb|Actors portraying [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from paradise in a performance by the Players of St Peter]]\nThere are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays;<ref>Windeatt, Barry. \"Medieval Imaginations: Literature & Visual Culture in the Middle Ages.\" Medieval Imaginations: Literature & Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110111182223/http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/medieval/mystery_plays.php ]</ref> although these collections are sometimes referred to as \"cycles,\" it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the ''[[York Mystery Plays|York cycle]]'' of forty-eight pageants; there are also the ''[[Wakefield Cycle|Towneley plays]]'' of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays acted at [[Wakefield]]; the [[N-Town Plays|Ludus Coventriae]], now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the ''[[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester cycle]]'' of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament [[Coventry Mystery Plays|cycle acted at Coventry]] and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of [[Mary Magdalene]], ''[[The Brome Abraham and Isaac]]'' and a sixteenth-century play of the ''Conversion of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'' exist, all hailing from [[East Anglia]]. Besides the [[Middle English]] drama, there are three surviving plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]], and several cyclical plays survive from continental Europe.\n\nThese biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the ''Fall of Lucifer'', the ''Creation and Fall of Man'', ''Cain and Abel'', ''Noah and the Flood'', ''Abraham and Isaac'', the ''Nativity'', the ''Raising of Lazarus'', the ''Passion'', and the ''Resurrection''. Other pageants included the story of ''Moses'', the ''Procession of the Prophets'', ''Christ's Baptism'', the ''Temptation in the Wilderness'', and the ''Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin''. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval [[craft guild]]s. The York [[mercery|mercers]], for example, sponsored the ''Doomsday'' pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] from the carpenters' guild; the [[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and fishes]] miracle from the bakers; and the [[visit of the Magi]], with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oxenford|first=Lyn|title=Playing Period Plays |year=1958|publisher=Coach House Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=0853435499|page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mikics|first=David |title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms |url=https://archive.org/details/newhandbookoflit0000miki|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300106367|page=[https://archive.org/details/newhandbookoflit0000miki/page/194 194]}}</ref> The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on [[pageant wagon]]s. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the ''Second Shepherds' Play'' to [[Horbury|Horbery]] Shrogys <ref>http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?id=AnoTown&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&tag=public&part=13&division=div (line 454) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830231810/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?data=%2Flv1%2FArchive%2Fmideng-parsed&division=div&id=AnoTown&images=images%2Fmodeng&part=13&tag=public |date=30 August 2002 }}</ref> is strongly suggestive. In \"The London Burial Grounds\" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to [[St Katherine Cree]] on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. [[Edmund Bonner]], Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londoncemeteries.co.uk/?page=holmes |title=The London Burial Grounds: Notes on their History from the Earliest Times to the Present Day -Mrs. Basil Holmes (St Katherine Cree) |publisher=Londoncemeteries.co.uk |accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous plays of the Towneley collection are attributed to the Wakefield Master, an anonymous playwright who wrote in the fifteenth century. The epithet \"Wakefield Master\" was first applied to this individual by the literary historian Gayley. The Wakefield Master gets his name from the geographic location where he lived, the market-town of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He may have been a highly educated cleric there, or possibly a friar from a nearby monastery at Woodkirk, four miles north of Wakefield. It was once thought that this anonymous author wrote a series of 32 plays (each averaging about 384 lines) called the Towneley Cycle. The Master's contributions to this collection are still much debated, and some scholars believe he may have written fewer than ten of them. These works appear in a single manuscript, currently found in the Huntington Library of California. It shows signs of Protestant editing &mdash; references to the Pope and the sacraments are crossed out, for instance. Likewise, twelve manuscript leaves were ripped out between the two final plays because of Catholic references. This evidence strongly suggests the play was still being read and performed as late as 1520, perhaps as late in Renaissance as the final years of King Henry VIII's reign.\n\nThe best known pageant in the Towneley manuscript is ''The Second Shepherds' Pageant'', a burlesque of the Nativity featuring Mak the sheep stealer and his wife Gill, which more or less explicitly compares a stolen lamb to the Saviour of mankind. The ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'', derived from the apocryphal ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', was a popular part of the York and Wakefield cycles.\n\nThe dramas of the [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods were developed out of mystery plays.\n\n==Spanish mystery plays==\n\nThe [[Misteri d'Elx]] (in English, the [[Elx Mystery Play]] or [[Mystery Play of Elx]]) is a liturgical drama dating from the Middle Ages which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa Mar\u00eda in the city of [[Elx]] (also known as [[Elche]]). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the [[Council of Trent]] eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 [[Pope Urban VIII]] issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThe oldest liturgical drama (12th century) written already in old Spanish language was a [[codex]] found in the library of the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. The Auto de los Reyes Magos belongs to the Christmas cycle. It is a play about the [[Biblical Magi]], three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in [[Bethlehem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/liturgical-drama |title=Liturgical drama: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref> It is believed to have been based on an earlier liturgical Latin play written in France.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spanish Language and Literature}}</ref>\n\n==Miracle play==\nMiracle plays, or ''Saint's plays,'' are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the [[saint]]s, particularly [[St. Nicholas]] or [[St. Mary]], into the lives of ordinary people, rather than biblical events;<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|chapter=mystery play}}</ref> however both of these terms are more commonly used by modern scholars than they were by medieval people, who used a wide variety of terminology to refer to their dramatic performances.
