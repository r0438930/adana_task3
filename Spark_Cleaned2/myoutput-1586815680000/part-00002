Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid24107968\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1731-13.2013 |pmid=24107968 |pmc=3792469 |title=Parceling Human Accumbens into Putative Core and Shell Dissociates Encoding of Values for Reward and Pain |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=33 |issue=41 |pages=16383\u201393 |year=2013 |last1=Baliki |first1=M.
