Its philosophical basis is primarily that of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Bhagavata Purana]].\n\nThe focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (''[[bhakti]]'') of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]], and their many divine [[incarnations]] as the supreme forms of [[God]], ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]''. Most popularly, this worship takes the form of singing Radha and Krishna's [[holy]] names, such as \"[[Hari|Hare]]\", \"Krishna\" and \"[[Rama (disambiguation)|Rama]]\", most commonly in the form of the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)]], also known as [[kirtan]]. It sees the many forms of Vishnu or Krishna as expansions or incarnations of the one Supreme God, ''[[adipurusha]]''.\n\nAfter its decline in the 18-19th century, it was revived in the beginning of the 20th century due to the efforts of [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]]. His son Srila [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]] founded sixty-four Gaudiya Matha monasteries in India, Burma and Europe.<ref>Edwin Bryant, Maria Ekstrand, The Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious Transplant (2004) - 448 pages\nPage 130</ref> Thakura's disciple [[Srila Prabhupada]] went to the west and spread Gaudiya Vaishnavism by the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON).\n\n====Varkari-tradition and Vithoba-worship====\n{{Main|Vithoba|Varkari}}\n\nThe Varkari-tradition is a non-[[Brahmanism|Brahamanical]]<ref>Zelliot (1988) p. xviii \"Varkari cult is rural and non-Brahman in character\"</ref><ref>Sand (1990) p. 34 \"the more or less anti-ritualistic and anti-brahmanical attitudes of Varkari sampradaya.\"</ref> tradition which worships [[Vithoba]], also known as Vitthal, who is regarded as a form of Vishnu or Krishna. Vithoba is often depicted as a dark young boy, standing arms akimbo on a brick, sometimes accompanied by his main consort [[Rukmini|Rakhumai]]. The Varkari-tradition is geographically associated with the Indian states of [[Maharashtra]] and northern [[Karnataka]].\n\nThe Varkari movement includes a duty-based approach towards life, emphasizing moral behavior and strict avoidance of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], the adoption of a strict [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet and fasting on ''[[Ekadashi]]'' day (twice a month), self-restraint (''[[brahmacharya]]'') during [[student]] life, equality and humanity for all rejecting discrimination based on the [[caste system in India|caste system]] or wealth, the reading of [[Hindu texts]], the recitation of the ''[[Haripath]]'' every day and the regular practice of ''[[bhajan]]'' and ''[[kirtan]]''. The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on the eleventh (''ekadashi'') day of the lunar months\" [[Shayani Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Ashadha]], and [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]].\n\nThe Varkari poet-saints are known for their devotional lyrics, the [[abhang]], dedicated to Vithoba and composed in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. Other devotional literature includes the Kannada hymns of the Haridasa, and Marathi versions of the generic [[aarti]] songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity. Notable saints and [[guru]]s of the Varkaris include [[J\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvar]], [[Namdev]], [[Chokhamela]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]], all of whom are accorded the title of [[Sant (religion)|Sant]].\n\nThough the origins of both his cult and his main temple are debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.

Its philosophical basis is primarily that of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Bhagavata Purana]].\n\nThe focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (''[[bhakti]]'') of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]], and their many divine [[incarnations]] as the supreme forms of [[God]], ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]''. Most popularly, this worship takes the form of singing Radha and Krishna's [[holy]] names, such as \"[[Hari|Hare]]\", \"Krishna\" and \"[[Rama (disambiguation)|Rama]]\", most commonly in the form of the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)]], also known as [[kirtan]]. It sees the many forms of Vishnu or Krishna as expansions or incarnations of the one Supreme God, ''[[adipurusha]]''.\n\nAfter its decline in the 18-19th century, it was revived in the beginning of the 20th century due to the efforts of [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]]. His son Srila [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]] founded sixty-four Gaudiya Matha monasteries in India, Burma and Europe.<ref>Edwin Bryant, Maria Ekstrand, The Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious Transplant (2004) - 448 pages\nPage 130</ref> Thakura's disciple [[Srila Prabhupada]] went to the west and spread Gaudiya Vaishnavism by the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON).\n\n====Varkari-tradition and Vithoba-worship====\n{{Main|Vithoba|Varkari}}\n\nThe Varkari-tradition is a non-[[Brahmanism|Brahamanical]]<ref>Zelliot (1988) p. xviii \"Varkari cult is rural and non-Brahman in character\"</ref><ref>Sand (1990) p. 34 \"the more or less anti-ritualistic and anti-brahmanical attitudes of Varkari sampradaya.\"</ref> tradition which worships [[Vithoba]], also known as Vitthal, who is regarded as a form of Vishnu or Krishna. Vithoba is often depicted as a dark young boy, standing arms akimbo on a brick, sometimes accompanied by his main consort [[Rukmini|Rakhumai]]. The Varkari-tradition is geographically associated with the Indian states of [[Maharashtra]] and northern [[Karnataka]].\n\nThe Varkari movement includes a duty-based approach towards life, emphasizing moral behavior and strict avoidance of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], the adoption of a strict [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet and fasting on ''[[Ekadashi]]'' day (twice a month), self-restraint (''[[brahmacharya]]'') during [[student]] life, equality and humanity for all rejecting discrimination based on the [[caste system in India|caste system]] or wealth, the reading of [[Hindu texts]], the recitation of the ''[[Haripath]]'' every day and the regular practice of ''[[bhajan]]'' and ''[[kirtan]]''. The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on the eleventh (''ekadashi'') day of the lunar months\" [[Shayani Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Ashadha]], and [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]].\n\nThe Varkari poet-saints are known for their devotional lyrics, the [[abhang]], dedicated to Vithoba and composed in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. Other devotional literature includes the Kannada hymns of the Haridasa, and Marathi versions of the generic [[aarti]] songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity. Notable saints and [[guru]]s of the Varkaris include [[J\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvar]], [[Namdev]], [[Chokhamela]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]], all of whom are accorded the title of [[Sant (religion)|Sant]].\n\nThough the origins of both his cult and his main temple are debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.
