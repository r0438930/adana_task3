At noon on Sunday the camp was quiet, and the SS guards were at their posts in the towers when the cry \"Americans!\" went up. A prisoner rushed toward the gate, and a guard shot him. Outside, a single American soldier stood looking casually at the towers while the guards eyed him and others who were two or three hundred yards way. When the Americans opened fire, the guards in the gate tower came down, hands in the air. One held a pistol behind his back, and the first American shot him.

The area was partially enclosed by an L-shaped masonry wall about {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and next to a hospital. The German POWs were watched over by a machine gun team from Company I. He left those men behind to head towards the center of the camp where there were SS who had not yet surrendered; he had only gone a short distance when he heard a soldier yell, \"They're trying to get away!\" and then machine-gun fire coming from the area he had just left.

He noted that some of the wounded soldiers were still moving, but he did not examine any of them.

Joseph Whitaker, the Seventh Army's Assistant Inspector General, was subsequently ordered to investigate after witnesses came forward testifying about the killings. He issued a report on June 8, 1945, called the \"Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau\" and also known as \"the I.G. Report\". In 1991, an archived copy was found in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C. and was made public.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nWhitaker reported that close to the back entrance to the camp Lt. William P. Walsh, commander of Company \"I\", 157th Infantry, shot four German soldiers in a [[box car]] who had surrendered to him. Pvt. Albert C. Pruitt then climbed into the box car and performed a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' on the wounded men.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nAfter he had entered the camp, Walsh, along with Lt. Jack Bushyhead, the executive officer of Company \"I\", organized the segregation of POWs into those who were members of the Wehrmacht and those who were in the SS. The SS were marched into a separate enclosure and were shot by members of \"I\" Company with several different types of weapons.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nThe investigation resulted in the U.S. military considering [[court-martial|courts-martial]] against those involved, including the battalion commander [[Felix L.

Charles L. Decker, an acting deputy judge advocate, concluded in late 1945 that, while there had probably been a violation of international law, \"in the light of the conditions which greeted the eyes of the first combat troops, it is not believed that justice or equity demand that the difficult and perhaps impossible task of fixing individual responsibility now be undertaken\".<ref>The Liberator: One World War II Soldier's 500-Day Odyssey from the Beaches of Sicily to the Gates of Dachau.

At noon on Sunday the camp was quiet, and the SS guards were at their posts in the towers when the cry \"Americans!\" went up. A prisoner rushed toward the gate, and a guard shot him. Outside, a single American soldier stood looking casually at the towers while the guards eyed him and others who were two or three hundred yards way. When the Americans opened fire, the guards in the gate tower came down, hands in the air. One held a pistol behind his back, and the first American shot him.

Joseph Whitaker, the Seventh Army's Assistant Inspector General, was subsequently ordered to investigate after witnesses came forward testifying about the killings. He issued a report on June 8, 1945, called the \"Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau\" and also known as \"the I.G. Report\". In 1991, an archived copy was found in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C. and was made public.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nWhitaker reported that close to the back entrance to the camp Lt. William P. Walsh, commander of Company \"I\", 157th Infantry, shot four German soldiers in a [[box car]] who had surrendered to him. Pvt. Albert C. Pruitt then climbed into the box car and performed a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' on the wounded men.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nAfter he had entered the camp, Walsh, along with Lt. Jack Bushyhead, the executive officer of Company \"I\", organized the segregation of POWs into those who were members of the Wehrmacht and those who were in the SS. The SS were marched into a separate enclosure and were shot by members of \"I\" Company with several different types of weapons.<ref name=Humanitas/>\n\nThe investigation resulted in the U.S. military considering [[court-martial|courts-martial]] against those involved, including the battalion commander [[Felix L.

Charles L. Decker, an acting deputy judge advocate, concluded in late 1945 that, while there had probably been a violation of international law, \"in the light of the conditions which greeted the eyes of the first combat troops, it is not believed that justice or equity demand that the difficult and perhaps impossible task of fixing individual responsibility now be undertaken\".<ref>The Liberator: One World War II Soldier's 500-Day Odyssey from the Beaches of Sicily to the Gates of Dachau.
