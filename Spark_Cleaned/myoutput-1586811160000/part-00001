Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a major force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]].

Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]].

By this period, the Labour Party were also the dominant party in Scotland, in terms of electoral support and representation.

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a major force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional divisions and infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussion of party policy by party members.\n\nThe party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Economic policies ===\n[[File:Revenue Scotland logo.png|left|thumb|The [[First Sturgeon government|Sturgeon Government]] created [[Revenue Scotland]] in 2015.]]\nWith the SNP's policy base being mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition, the party is committed to polices such as [[progressive tax|progressive personal taxation]].
