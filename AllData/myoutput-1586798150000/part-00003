Since 2013, he has toured as a duo with [[Jeffrey Foucault]]. In recent years, he has also backed [[Chris Smither]]. A stripped-down approach has characterized his bands, equipment, and playing.\n\n== Background ==\n\nConway is a native of [[Owatonna, Minnesota]], south of [[Minneapolis]]. In the 1970s, he went to [[Yale University]], where he became friends and bandmates with harmonica player [[Jim Fitting]], who would also become part of Treat Her Right. Conway earned a degree in psychology.<ref name=\"Graff\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99821981/ |author=Graff, Gary |title=Treat Her Right shows you can be a Yale grad and still sing the blues |work=Detroit Free Press |date=May 9, 1988}}</ref> A member of the Class of 1979, he was also captain of Yale's [[ice hockey]] team as a senior in the 1978-79 season. He was invited to try out for the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, which performed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", but could not after tearing a knee ligament.<ref name=\"Fleschner\">{{cite book | title=Bulldogs on Ice: Yale University Men's Ice Hockey | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=Fleschner, Daniel K. | year=2003 | pages=81 | isbn=9780738513287}}</ref>\n\n== Treat Her Right ==\n\nAfter graduation, Conway and Fitting both moved to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where Conway taught at a school for emotionally disturbed adolescents. In 1985, they were introduced to the other two principals in Treat Her Right, [[Mark Sandman]] and [[David Champagne (musician)|David Champagne]].<ref name=\"Graff\" />\n\nOne of the notable features of Treat Her Right was the [[cocktail drum]] that Conway used. This band was noted for its spare, spacious sound, and the cocktail drum was an integral part of that.\n\n== Morphine ==\n\nWhen Mark Sandman formed Morphine, the original drummer was [[Jerome Deupree]], but Conway served in the band for much of its existence.

Conway and Sargent are long-term partners.  \n\nConway worked with Jeffrey Foucault and poet [[Lisa Olstein]] on the eponymous first album by Cold Satellite (2011) and the follow-up ''Cavalcade'' (2013). Previously, he had performed on albums by [[Kris Delmhorst]], who became Foucault's wife. \n\nAnother part of this circle of artists is [[Caitlin Canty]], whose 2015 album ''Reckless Skyline'' was produced by Foucault and employed Conway as drummer.\n\nFoucault has cited a shared desire to give weight to space and silence, which is a constant in Conway's career.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/jeffrey-foucaults-blood-brothers-is-the-album-we-need/ |author=Cholset, Rachel |title=Album Premiere: Jeffrey Foucault's 'Blood Brothers' Is the Album We Need |work=Wide Open Country |date=June 2018}}</ref> For their live gigs as a duo, they play only what they can carry into a club alone in one trip.
