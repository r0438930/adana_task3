Unfortunately, after Johns Hopkins's death in December 1873 at his city townhouse on West Saratoga Street, now site of a parking garage, between future Cathedral Street and North Charles Street, north of future [[Charles Center]] redevelopment project of 1958-1970, adjacent to old [[St. Paul's Church Rectory|St. Paul's Church (Episcopal) Rectory]] of 1789-1790, next door further to the east. The powerful crucial B&O Railroad fell into mismanagement and financial distress by the [[1890s]] with increasing cutthroat competition with the dominant [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] regional line, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] from the heavy expenses of boring a deep long north-south [[Baltimore Belt Line|underground tunnel]] beneath Howard Street, (finally bypassing after a half-century of waterfront rail lines placed on east-west Pratt Street) on the westside of [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown Baltimore]]. The problems of the biggest transport and industrial part of the economy.of [[Maryland]] since its founding in 1827, with its eventual financial collapse and bankruptcy was hastened by the [[Panic of 1893|Financial Panic and Recession of 1893]] and the stock's value declined drastically. Later ownership was reorganized under weaker conditions for the rest of the [[20th century]]. \n\nThe original campus of the university was established by first President [[Daniel Coit Gilman]] (1831-1908, served 1875-1901), [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown Baltimore]] along [[Howard Street (Baltimore)|North Howard Street]], between West Centre, Little Ross, and West Monument and North Eutaw Streets, on the west side of the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere]] neighborhood, where buildings were already available, plus additional impressive stone and brick [[19th century]] style buildings were added facing the streets/sidewalks during the 1880s and 1890s. However, this urban location did not permit room for growth and soon the board of trustees began to look for a place to move. Unfortunately the former Hopkins summer \"Clifton\" estate had been languishing for two decades,was finally sold to the city as future [[Clifton Park (Baltimore)|Clifton Park]] in 1894. \n\nThe university relocated several miles north to the former estate, [[Homewood Museum|Homewood]], of Charles Carroll, Jr. Carroll was the son of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], 1737-1832) - a conservative colonial revolutionary and  last surviving signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Carroll Jr. built Homewood during 1801-1803 for his family under the inspiration of the new, Federal Style architecture.\n\nSeveral decades later at Homewood, the Wyman Villa of JHU Board member William Wyman was built in the 1880s in an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style architecture facing North Charles Street Extended. \n\nAs a part of the Wyman donation, the University was required to dedicate part of the land to art.  As a result, the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] founded 1914, (which has ties to but is not a part of the university), moved from its first location in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, a few blocks west of the [[Washington_Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]], at southwest corner of West Monument and Cathedral Streets in the old former Mary Garrett townhouse. The new building was designed by American architect [[John Russell Pope]]. \n\nFurther on North Charles Street, the university owns [[Evergreen House]], the former home  of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B.& O. Railroad]]'s [[John Work Garrett|Garrett]]. Evergreen House now serves as one of the two house museums operated by the university, as well as the home of the John Work Garrett Library.\n\nThe majority of buildings directly east of the Homewood Campus have been acquired by and are now owned and operated by the university\n\n==Architecture==\nThe architectural style of the campus follows the earlier [[18th century]] style of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] architecture, followed by the similar [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] of the late 18th and early [[19th century]] period expressed in the design of [[Homewood Museum|Homewood House]], built 1801-1803, by. Most newer buildings resemble this style, being built of red brick with white marble trim. Homewood House (also occasionally known as Homewood Mansion), and  was later used for decades in the 20th century for University administrative offices and also housed the first few years of the private/independent Country School for Boys, later renamed the [[Gilman School|The Gilman School]], founded 1897 at the former Homewood Mansion (built 1801-1803), and now bearing the title of Hopkins' first president.\nBut in the late 1900s and into the current new [[21st century]] now is one of two estates/historic mansions with equisite anique decorative /furniture collections preserved as a historical/artistic house museum by The JHU as valuable cultural resource for the city/county/state and regional treasure, exhibiting period interior decor and furniture of the [[19th century|1800s]]. \n\nThe geographic open spaces of the Homewood campus is organized in several campus rectangular [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quads]], crntered around Gilman Hall, the first of two early academic structures completed on the relocated new North Baltimore spacious future campus property donated by William Wyman in 1902, prior to the [[World War I|First World War]] era, in 1914-1915.\n\nIn 1997, two miles to the east along the East 33rd Street boulevard, the university purchased the closed and vacant {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} former building of the old elite all-girls public secondary [[Eastern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Eastern High School]] (one of a set of twins with its sister school, [[Western_High_School_(Baltimore,_Maryland)|Western High]] still in existence - both founded [[1844]] as the oldest female public high schools in the nation, with this its fourth occupied structure, constructed 1936-1938, as a twin matching design to the also former WHS building of 1925-1927 on Gwynns Falls Parkway in the northwest city). Old EHS is a three-story 'H'-shaped building of red brick and limestone trim in [[Tudor Revival architecture|English Tudor Revival]] \n/ [[Jacobethan architecture|Jacobethan]] styled architectures, at the 1101 block of East 33rd Street, (between Loch Raven Boulevard and Ellerslie Avenue), two miles (1.6&nbsp;km) east of the main JHU \"Homewood\" campus and further east of the adjacent [[Waverly,_Baltimore|Waverly]] community. Old Eastern /JHMI annex campus is immediately across the street from the former famous sports site of the old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] and previous Municipal / Baltimore Stadium of 1922-1953 /renovated and expanded 1949-1954, where the [[Major League Baseball]] franchise / team of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] later played here in the [[American League]] during 1954 to 1991 (and earlier \"Triple AAA\" [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] level of the longtime [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] franchise of the [[International League]], since 1903 playing here for a last \"swan song\" decade, 1944-1953, before the \"big leagues\" returned). Also Municipal / Memorial Stadiums here hosted the following former [[NFL]] pro football's [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] who first played here, 1947-1949 in the old [[All America Football Conference]], then following one season in the NFL of \nleagues merger for 1950;  then returning to the city for it's third and most famous incarnation in 1953-1984 on 33rd. Many Baltimoreans today cannot drive past 33rd Street and not think, reminincsing about the great sports events, opposite old Eastern High and adjacent [[Baltimore City College]]'s also landmark stone Gothic \"Castle on the Hill\" with tall bell tower and immense hilltop campus and grassy lawns with huge ancient shading oaks.\n\nThe former Eastern High building closed in 1986, after 142 years of History, with 48 of those years spent on 33rd Street in it's fourth location. With its antique interior features restored of leaded glass, terrazzo floors, arched ceilings, wood paneling and woodwork, and glazed tile brick wainscoting in the corridors, Old Eastern was reopened in 2001, largely renovated, reconstructed with upgraded infrastructure and utilities during the two previous years.

Asphalt, vehicle-accessible roads throughout the campus were removed, being replaced with architecturally compatible brick-paved walkways with the Georgian/Federal styles. The traffic circle located in front of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library building of the [[1960s]] era, facing North Charles, which for many years had existed as a half circle that connected to campus roads, was completed, in line with the original laid out Master Plan for the university from the early [[20th century]]. Traffic was redirected to the periphery of the campus and  architects' design and vision. Additional greenery, shrubs, flower beds and more shade trees were added throughout the campus, with the goal of making the core areas of Homewood oriented more towards people rather than vehicles, more safer, more pedestrian-friendly and more attractive and peaceful in atmosphere and appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jhu.edu/gx/background/|title=GX Project Background|date=May 13, 2002 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University}}</ref> A number of new buildings, including Clark Hall (home to the Biomedical Engineering department), Hodson Hall (a multi-use classroom building), the Mattin Center (student arts and activities center), the Ralph S. O'Connor Recreation Center, and the New Chemistry Building, were also constructed in the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] (decade) as the Homewood campus approached it's centennial in 2014-2015.\n\nA second campus expansion, called \"Charles Commons\", was completed in September 2006. Expanding JHU's presence eastward across North Charles Street from Homewood, along East 33rd Street's north and south sides, between Charles and St. Paul Streets. It expanded the small previous one-block commercial district for the adjacent residential neighborhood of [[Charles_Village,_Baltimore|Charles Village]], along the 3200 block south.of 33rd Street to eventually grow up to a three block length, north to south of commercial redevelopment. But the project required the razing of several blocks of 1910s-1920s \"Daylight style\" of typical Baltimore  rowhouses with front porches and smalll grassy postage stamp-sized lawns. The approximately {{convert|350000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} development includes housing for an additional approximately 618 students, with supporting amenity spaces; a central dining facility and specialty dining area with [[seating capacity]] of approximately 330; and an approximately {{convert|29000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} book store run by [[Barnes and Noble]]'s College Division.\n\nThe newly named Decker Quadrangle development constituted the last large building site on the contiguous Homewood Campus. Its first phase included a visitors and admissions center (Mason Hall), a computational sciences building (Willard Hackerman Hall),<ref>{{cite web |title=Computational Science and Engineering Building (CSEB) |url=http://engineering.jhu.edu/~cse-building/ |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |accessdate=2007-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024195515/http://engineering.jhu.edu/~cse-building/ |archivedate=2007-10-24 }}</ref>  and an underground parking structure, which together created a new academic quadrangle, further south of modern style brick Garland Hall, named in honor of Alonso G. and Virginia G. Decker of the famous [[Black and Decker]] power tools manufacturer (founded in Baltimore). Construction was completed and the new buildings and quadrangle were dedicated in [[2008]]. Importantly, the project established a new public entrance for the campus on the south side and recognizes the potential for future growth of campus activities sited across Wyman Park Drive to the west side of JHU.\n\n[[File:Gilman Hall.jpg|right|300px|thumb|<center>Gilman Hall</center>]]\nIn [[2007]], the University announced a $73 million dollarsrenovation of now landmark Gilman Hall (then approaching its 93rd year, named for the university's first and most influential president, [[Daniel Coit Gilman]], 1831-1908, served 1875-1901), the academic and architectural centerpiece of the entire Homewood Campus, sitting the style for all the subsequent construction in the rest of the 20th century. unfortunately over the nine decades, the building had grown labyrinthine and complicated, over the years, with former library stacks areas being used as offices / cubicles and only half the building's stairwells reaching all of its floors. The renovation included updates to all classrooms in the building, as well as a full replacement of the building's infrastructure utilities. The renovation involved removal of the bookstore, bank and credit union, creating more space for academic departments. The center impressive and inspiring Hutzler Undergraduate Reading Room was also renovated, and a dedicated film screening room was added. The centerpiece of the renovation was a large glass-roofed atrium, connecting the building's entrance and the Hutzler Reading Room, that now houses the University's premier archaeological artifacts collection. The building was formally rededicated on October 23, 2010 as the new home of the University's humanities departments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins to Renovate Gilman Hall|url=http://www.jhu.edu/news/home07/apr07/gilman.html |publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>\n\nEarlier, in December 2008, the Trustees proposed the construction of a new Eisenhower Library addition, with the Brody Learning Commons, costing $30 million dollars.

Eisenhower Library===\n[[File:JHU Eisenhower Library.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Milton S. Eisenhower Library]]\nThe Milton S. Eisenhower Library (called \"MSE\" by \"Blue Jay\" students), is [[Johns Hopkins University|The Johns Hopkins University]] principal research library and the largest in a network of libraries at Johns Hopkins. This network, now known as 'The Sheridan Libraries', encompasses the earlier 1960s era Milton S. Eisenhower Library and its collections at the Albert D. Hutzler Reading Room in Gilman Hall (the former Hopkins library site before Eisenhower was constructed, and informally called \"The Hut\" by students), the [[John Work Garrett|John Work Garrett Library]] at [[Evergreen House]] (on North Charles Street above East Cold Spring Lane), and further south above [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown Baltimore]], the [[Peabody Institute]] and adjacent public historic [[George Peabody Library]] in the east wing annex of 1878, on East Mount Vernon Place / East Monument Street, across from the iconic landmark [[Washington Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]], in the [[Mount Vernon,_Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere]] cultural / historic residential neighborhood. \n\nOpened in 1964, the Eisenhower Library was named for the University's eighth president, Fr. [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], brother of former American 34th President, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1890-1969, served 1953-1961), whose vision brought together the University's rich collection of books, journals and other scholarly resources.\n\nhe Eisenhower Library collection houses over 3.8 million volumes, 121,000 academic journals and magazine subscriptions<ref name=Sheridans>{{Cite web|url =http://www.library.jhu.edu/about.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120923195237/http://www.library.jhu.edu/about.html|url-status = dead|archive-date = September 23, 2012|title = About the Sheridan Libraries|accessdate = February 25, 2015|website = The Sheridan Libraries|publisher = The Sheridan Libraries}}</ref> and thirty miles of shelf space.<ref name=Sheridan/> Strengths in the humanities include German and Romance Languages, Philosophy and the Ancient Near East. In science and engineering, collection strengths include biomedical engineering, chemistry, and environmental engineering. The MSE Library also offers an extensive array of electronic resources, including full-text books and journals, specialized databases, and statistical and cartographic data. Only two of the Eisenhower Library's six stories are above ground, the rest are buried beneath. However, the architects designed the building so that every level has windows and natural light. The design is in accordance with a campus myth that no structure on campus can be taller than Gilman Hall, the oldest academic building from 1914, and the more modern brick with white trim is compatible with historic and /architectural early 19th century landmark adjacent to the north of the Homewood House overlooking the same grassy oval lawn.\n\n==== The Brody Learning Commons ====\nThe Brody Learning Commons, an appendage to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library, opened in August 2012 and is the most recent of the Johns Hopkins' <span>libraries </span>(known as Sheridan Libraries) to open. Primarily a study space, it houses a variety of different areas for study including group study rooms, a quiet reading room and a cafe.

However, from 1971 to 1996, three presidents declined to occupy it, so it was temporarily used to house university guests and as administrative offices. Noteworthy is that the new free [[Russian Federation]]'s first President [[Boris Yeltsin]] stayed there briefly as a guest, and the house was also used as a location during the filming of the political drama feature film, ''[[The Seduction of Joe Tynan]]'' (1979), starring [[Alan Alda]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/1196web/editnote.html|work=Johns Hopkins Magazine|date=November 1996|title=Rolling Out the Welcome Mat|first=Sue |last=De Pasquale|accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref> In 1996, [[William R.

As a result, the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] founded 1914, (which has ties to but is not a part of the university), moved from its first location in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, a few blocks west of the [[Washington_Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]], at southwest corner of West Monument and Cathedral Streets in the old former Mary Garrett townhouse. The new building was designed by American architect [[John Russell Pope]]. \n\nFurther on North Charles Street, the university owns [[Evergreen House]], the former home  of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B.& O. Railroad]]'s [[John Work Garrett|Garrett]]. Evergreen House now serves as one of the two house museums operated by the university, as well as the home of the John Work Garrett Library.\n\nThe majority of buildings directly east of the Homewood Campus have been acquired by and are now owned and operated by the university\n\n==Architecture==\nThe architectural style of the campus follows the earlier [[18th century]] style of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] architecture, followed by the similar [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] of the late 18th and early [[19th century]] period expressed in the design of [[Homewood Museum|Homewood House]], built 1801-1803, by. Most newer buildings resemble this style, being built of red brick with white marble trim. Homewood House (also occasionally known as Homewood Mansion), and  was later used for decades in the 20th century for University administrative offices and also housed the first few years of the private/independent Country School for Boys, later renamed the [[Gilman School|The Gilman School]], founded 1897 at the former Homewood Mansion (built 1801-1803), and now bearing the title of Hopkins' first president.\nBut in the late 1900s and into the current new [[21st century]] now is one of two estates/historic mansions with equisite anique decorative /furniture collections preserved as a historical/artistic house museum by The JHU as valuable cultural resource for the city/county/state and regional treasure, exhibiting period interior decor and furniture of the [[1800s]]. \n\nThe geographic open spaces of the Homewood campus is organized in several campus rectangular [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quads]], crntered around Gilman Hall, the first of two early academic structures completed on the relocated new North Baltimore spacious future campus property donated by William Wyman in 1902, prior to the [[World War I|First World War]] era, in 1914-1915.\n\nIn 1997, two miles to the east along the East 33rd Street boulevard, the university purchased the closed and vacant {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} former building of the old elite all-girls public secondary [[Eastern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Eastern High School]] (one of a set of twins with its sister school, [[Western_High_School_(Baltimore,_Maryland)|Western High]] still in existence - both founded [[1844]] as the oldest female public high schools in the nation, with this its fourth occupied structure, constructed 1936-1938, as a twin matching design to the also former WHS building of 1925-1927 on Gwynns Falls Parkway in the northwest city). Old EHS is a three-story 'H'-shaped building of red brick and limestone trim in [[Tudor Revival architecture|English Tudor Revival]] \n/ [[Jacobethan architecture|Jacobethan]] styled architectures, at the 1101 block of East 33rd Street, (between Loch Raven Boulevard and Ellerslie Avenue), two miles (1.6&nbsp;km) east of the main JHU \"Homewood\" campus and further east of the adjacent [[Waverly,_Baltimore|Waverly]] community. Old Eastern /JHMI annex campus is immediately across the street from the former famous sports site of the old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] and previous Municipal / Baltimore Stadium of 1922-1953 /renovated and expanded 1949-1954, where the [[Major League Baseball]] franchise / team of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] later played here in the [[American League]] during 1954 to 1991 (and earlier \"Triple AAA\" [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] level of the longtime [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] franchise of the [[International League]], since 1903 playing here for a last \"swan song\" decade, 1944-1953, before the \"big leagues\" returned). Also Municipal / Memorial Stadiums here hosted the following former [[NFL]] pro football's [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] who first played here, 1947-1949 in the old [[All America Football Conference]], then following one season in the NFL of \nleagues merger for 1950;  then returning to the city for it's third and most famous incarnation in 1953-1984 on 33rd. Many Baltimoreans today cannot drive past 33rd Street and not think, reminincsing about the great sports events, opposite old Eastern High and adjacent [[Baltimore City College]]'s also landmark stone Gothic \"Castle on the Hill\" with tall bell tower and immense hilltop campus and grassy lawns with huge ancient shading oaks.\n\nThe former Eastern High building closed in 1986, after 142 years of History, with 48 of those years spent on 33rd Street in it's fourth location. With its antique interior features restored of leaded glass, terrazzo floors, arched ceilings, wood paneling and woodwork, and glazed tile brick wainscoting in the corridors, Old Eastern was reopened in 2001, largely renovated, reconstructed with upgraded infrastructure and utilities during the two previous years.

Asphalt, vehicle-accessible roads throughout the campus were removed, being replaced with architecturally compatible brick-paved walkways with the Georgian/Federal styles. The traffic circle located in front of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library building of the [[1960s]] era, facing North Charles, which for many years had existed as a half circle that connected to campus roads, was completed, in line with the original laid out Master Plan for the university from the early [[20th century]]. Traffic was redirected to the periphery of the campus and  architects' design and vision. Additional greenery, shrubs, flower beds and more shade trees were added throughout the campus, with the goal of making the core areas of Homewood oriented more towards people rather than vehicles, more safer, more pedestrian-friendly and more attractive and peaceful in atmosphere and appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jhu.edu/gx/background/|title=GX Project Background|date=May 13, 2002 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University}}</ref> A number of new buildings, including Clark Hall (home to the Biomedical Engineering department), Hodson Hall (a multi-use classroom building), the Mattin Center (student arts and activities center), the Ralph S. O'Connor Recreation Center, and the New Chemistry Building, were also constructed in the early [[2000s]] (decade) as the Homewood campus approached it's centennial in 2014-2015.\n\nA second campus expansion, called \"Charles Commons\", was completed in September 2006. Expanding JHU's presence eastward across North Charles Street from Homewood, along East 33rd Street's north and south sides, between Charles and St. Paul Streets. It expanded the small previous one-block commercial district for the adjacent residential neighborhood of [[Charles_Village,_Baltimore|Charles Village]], along the 3200 block south.of 33rd Street to eventually grow up to a three block length, north to south of commercial redevelopment. But the project required the razing of several blocks of 1910s-1920s \"Daylight style\" of typical Baltimore  rowhouses with front porches and smalll grassy postage stamp-sized lawns. The approximately {{convert|350000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} development includes housing for an additional approximately 618 students, with supporting amenity spaces; a central dining facility and specialty dining area with [[seating capacity]] of approximately 330; and an approximately {{convert|29000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} book store run by [[Barnes and Noble]]'s College Division.\n\nThe newly named Decker Quadrangle development constituted the last large building site on the contiguous Homewood Campus. Its first phase included a visitors and admissions center (Mason Hall), a computational sciences building (Willard Hackerman Hall),<ref>{{cite web |title=Computational Science and Engineering Building (CSEB) |url=http://engineering.jhu.edu/~cse-building/ |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |accessdate=2007-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024195515/http://engineering.jhu.edu/~cse-building/ |archivedate=2007-10-24 }}</ref>  and an underground parking structure, which together created a new academic quadrangle, further south of modern style brick Garland Hall, named in honor of Alonso G. and Virginia G. Decker of the famous [[Black and Decker]] power tools manufacturer (founded in Baltimore). Construction was completed and the new buildings and quadrangle were dedicated in [[2008]]. Importantly, the project established a new public entrance for the campus on the south side and recognizes the potential for future growth of campus activities sited across Wyman Park Drive to the west side of JHU.\n\n[[File:Gilman Hall.jpg|right|300px|thumb|<center>Gilman Hall</center>]]\nIn [[2007]], the University announced a $73 million dollarsrenovation of now landmark Gilman Hall (then approaching its 93rd year, named for the university's first and most influential president, [[Daniel Coit Gilman]], 1831-1908, served 1875-1901), the academic and architectural centerpiece of the entire Homewood Campus, sitting the style for all the subsequent construction in the rest of the 20th century. unfortunately over the nine decades, the building had grown labyrinthine and complicated, over the years, with former library stacks areas being used as offices / cubicles and only half the building's stairwells reaching all of its floors. The renovation included updates to all classrooms in the building, as well as a full replacement of the building's infrastructure utilities. The renovation involved removal of the bookstore, bank and credit union, creating more space for academic departments. The center impressive and inspiring Hutzler Undergraduate Reading Room was also renovated, and a dedicated film screening room was added. The centerpiece of the renovation was a large glass-roofed atrium, connecting the building's entrance and the Hutzler Reading Room, that now houses the University's premier archaeological artifacts collection. The building was formally rededicated on October 23, 2010 as the new home of the University's humanities departments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins to Renovate Gilman Hall|url=http://www.jhu.edu/news/home07/apr07/gilman.html |publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>\n\nEarlier, in December 2008, the Trustees proposed the construction of a new Eisenhower Library addition, with the Brody Learning Commons, costing $30 million dollars. The building annex features a quiet reading room, 15 new group study rooms, a new atrium and a caf\u00e9.

Eisenhower Library===\n[[File:JHU Eisenhower Library.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Milton S. Eisenhower Library]]\nThe Milton S. Eisenhower Library (called \"MSE\" by \"Blue Jay\" students), is [[Johns Hopkins University|The Johns Hopkins University]] principal research library and the largest in a network of libraries at Johns Hopkins. This network, now known as 'The Sheridan Libraries', encompasses the earlier 1960s era Milton S. Eisenhower Library and its collections at the Albert D. Hutzler Reading Room in Gilman Hall (the former Hopkins library site before Eisenhower was constructed, and informally called \"The Hut\" by students), the [[John Work Garrett|John Work Garrett Library]] at [[Evergreen House]] (on North Charles Street above East Cold Spring Lane), and further south above [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown Baltimore]], the [[Peabody Institute]] and adjacent public historic [[George Peabody Library]] in the east wing annex of 1878, on East Mount Vernon Place / East Monument Street, across from the iconic landmark [[Washington Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]], in the [[Mount Vernon,_Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere]] cultural / historic residential neighborhood. \n\nOpened in 1964, the Eisenhower Library was named for the University's eighth president, Fr. [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], brother of former American 34th President, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1890-1969, served 1953-1961), whose vision brought together the University's rich collection of books, journals and other scholarly resources.\n\nhe Eisenhower Library collection houses over 3.8 million volumes, 121,000 academic journals and magazine subscriptions<ref name=Sheridans>{{Cite web|url =http://www.library.jhu.edu/about.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120923195237/http://www.library.jhu.edu/about.html|url-status = dead|archive-date = September 23, 2012|title = About the Sheridan Libraries|accessdate = February 25, 2015|website = The Sheridan Libraries|publisher = The Sheridan Libraries}}</ref> and thirty miles of shelf space.<ref name=Sheridan/> Strengths in the humanities include German and Romance Languages, Philosophy and the Ancient Near East. In science and engineering, collection strengths include biomedical engineering, chemistry, and environmental engineering. The MSE Library also offers an extensive array of electronic resources, including full-text books and journals, specialized databases, and statistical and cartographic data. Only two of the Eisenhower Library's six stories are above ground, the rest are buried beneath. However, the architects designed the building so that every level has windows and natural light. The design is in accordance with a campus myth that no structure on campus can be taller than Gilman Hall, the oldest academic building from 1914, and the more modern brick with white trim is compatible with historic and /architectural early 19th century landmark adjacent to the north of the Homewood House overlooking the same grassy oval lawn.\n\n==== The Brody Learning Commons ====\nThe Brody Learning Commons, an appendage to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library, opened in August 2012 and is the most recent of the Johns Hopkins' <span>libraries </span>(known as Sheridan Libraries) to open. Primarily a study space, it houses a variety of different areas for study including group study rooms, a quiet reading room and a cafe.

The House, which itself is Georgian inspired, Palladian and Federal architecturally in its style, is used to display objects, furniture, art and sculpture that represent the decor that the influential [[Carroll family (Maryland)|Carroll family]] used to furnish the house while they resided there in the early 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.museums.jhu.edu/homewood.php?section=main|title = Homewood|date = |accessdate = February 25, 2015|website = JHU Museums|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n===Nichols House===\nThe Nichols House is also known as the President's House because, when designed, it was intended to become the residence of the university's president.\n[[File:Nichols House JohnsHopkins.JPG|thumb|right|Nichols House]]\n\nThe house has a two-story [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] structure and it was built in 1958. It was built to attract [[Milton S. Eisenhower]] to come to JHU.  Eisenhower was its first resident a year later in 1959, and it continues to house Hopkins presidents. However, from 1971 to 1996, three presidents declined to occupy it, so it was temporarily used to house university guests and as administrative offices. Noteworthy is that the new free [[Russian Federation]]'s first President [[Boris Yeltsin]] stayed there briefly as a guest, and the house was also used as a location during the filming of the political drama feature film, ''[[The Seduction of Joe Tynan]]'' (1979), starring [[Alan Alda]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/1196web/editnote.html|work=Johns Hopkins Magazine|date=November 1996|title=Rolling Out the Welcome Mat|first=Sue |last=De Pasquale|accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref> In 1996, [[William R.
