The property also stood witness to events in the Civil War. A \"drill field\" or muster ground is said to have existed at Walnut Hill during the war, located on the low ground along Flat Creek at the southeast end of the property.  \n\n=== Historical and Architectural Significance ===\nWalnut Hill is surrounded by fields and meadows and is near Flat Creek. The property is somewhat hidden to passersby as it is surrounded by woods. The one and on half-story dwelling was built in several sections starting in 1802. The oldest section is a log dwelling with an internal gable-end stone chimney and is now the south wing. Before 1820, a two-room-plan frame addition was built onto the north end of the log dwelling; this became the main or front section of the house. The building reflects many evolutionary changes throughout its existence. These modifications are evident by the changing roof lines throughout these divisions. Smaller wings and porches that had been added on were later removed in a restoration/rehabilitation effort lasting from 1948 to 1950.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWalnut Hill displays Georgian style interior finishes. It contains substantial architectural features dating from 1802 to the 1900s. Early sections of the house display standard wooden floorboards, plaster over split lath walls, and ceilings attached with cut nails (some reinforcing wire nails). Both the exposed stonework, fireplace, and the arch are painted white and framed by a Georgian architrave mantel. Most of the woodwork was redone in the 20th century. Also on the property are a contributing smokehouse, chicken house, kitchen chimney, and family cemetery.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Funerary Significance ===\nTwenty-three family members are buried in the Moorman-Leftwich Cemetery which is located on the property. The rectangular cemetery is surrounded by a rough stone wall and sits on a steep-sided ridge above the house. Many of the headstones are also accompanied a footstone. The style of the 18th-century headstones seems more like what is found in North Carolina cemeteries than those of similar date in Virginia. The cemetery is notable for its cantilever style and for the artistry of the monuments it contains. These appear to be done by a competent professional, but the stonemason is unknown.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n[[File:015-5012 WalnutHill VLR online.jpg|thumb|Outside image of the house on Walnut Hill.
