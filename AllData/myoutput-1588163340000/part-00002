He is an occasional right-arm medium pace bowler and a slip fielder. He is also noted for his sharp reflexes and often fields in close catching positions. He has scored twenty-two [[Test cricket|Test]] centuries and four [[One Day International]] (ODI) 100s. In 2015, he became the second player since [[Ian Botham]] to be involved in five [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series wins.\n\nIn the [[2006 New Year Honours|2006 New Year Honours List]], Bell was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for his role in the successful [[The Ashes|Ashes]] campaign of 2005. In November 2006, he was awarded the [[ICC Awards|Emerging Player of the Year]] award by the [[International Cricket Council]]. During 2008 and 2009, he was a more infrequent member of the England teams&nbsp;\u2013 however he reclaimed his Test place during the [[2009 Ashes series|2009 Ashes]], which England won, and featured in several ODIs the following year. During 2010, he captained Warwickshire to victory in the [[2010 Clydesdale Bank 40|CB40 final]] before scoring his first Ashes century the following winter as he helped England [[2010-11 Ashes series|retain the Ashes down-under]].

His first century, a score of 130 against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford UCCE]], made him the county's youngest ever centurion at 19 years and 56 days. He also became the county's youngest capped player ever when Warwickshire awarded him a county cap on the final day of the season.\n\nBell was named in the first intake of the [[ECB National Academy]] who spent the 2001/02 winter in Australia.<ref>[http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/england/england-performance-programme/england-performance-programme-intakes,496,BP.html England Performance Programme intakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521200432/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/england/england-performance-programme/england-performance-programme-intakes,496,BP.html |date=21 May 2011 }} ECB; Retrieved 9 October 2008</ref> The day after he returned home from Adelaide he was brought into the full [[English cricket team|England Test squad]] to cover for the injured [[Mark Butcher]] on the New Zealand tour.\n\nIn 2002 Bell's four-day form fell away as he scored 658 at an [[batting average (cricket)|average]] of 24.37 however he was instrumental in the county's [[Benson & Hedges Cup]] success. He top-scored in the Quarter-final (scoring 85 not out), Semi-final (46) and Final (65 not out), the latter performance winning him the Gold Award in the last ever Benson & Hedges Cup final.\n\nBell's best form in 2003 once again came in the one-day format, he scored 779 runs at 28.85 in the [[County Championship]] compared to 560 runs at 43.07 in the [[Pro40|National League]], his best performance came at Chelmsford where he scored his maiden one-day century, 125 off 113 deliveries, as well as taking 5/41, his best one-day bowling figures.

One of the six was a career-best 262 not out against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]; the innings lasting ten minutes short of ten hours made him the county's youngest ever double-centurion. In late July he began an impressive sequence of four centuries in five first-class innings, the other being a score of 96 not out.

There was speculation in the press that he would not be included in the Test team, but when [[Michael Vaughan]] was injured before the first Test, Bell got another opportunity. He took it, scoring a century and two half-centuries in the three-match series, and becoming England's top scorer in the series with 313 runs at an average of 52.16. He also took his first Test wicket with his part-time bowling when he caught and bowled [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4453774.stm\n|title=England hit by Pakistan run spree\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=20 November 2005 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThis form on the subcontinent continued on 18 February 2006 in [[English cricket team|England]]'s first warm-up game prior to the Test series against [[Indian cricket team|India]] when Bell top-scored with 78 at [[Brabourne Stadium|Mumbai]]. He could not maintain this form into the Test series where, in 6 innings, he only scored 131 runs at an average of just under 22.\n\n=== 2006: Sri Lanka and Pakistan ===\nAfter returning from India, Bell had an average start to the season with Warwickshire. He was named in the squad of 13 for the first home Test of the summer, against [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]], but with the return of [[Marcus Trescothick]], coupled with the good form of [[Paul Collingwood]] and the emergence of [[Alastair Cook]], Bell was dropped from the starting 11. Bell was selected in the squad for the 5 match ODI series against Sri Lanka, and was one of only a couple of players to come through the series with any credit.\n\nAs a result of this, and the injury to [[Andrew Flintoff]], Bell was recalled to the Test team for the first Test against [[Pakistani Cricket Team|Pakistan]]. After spending most of his career batting in the top four, he was asked to bat at number six. He scored a century in each of the first three Tests, becoming the first Englishman since [[Graham Gooch]] to score a century in three successive Test matches, but missed his chance to make it four in a row after scoring only 9 in the first innings and being 9 not out when the fourth Test unexpectedly finished a day early after the Pakistan ball tampering row. He finished the series with an average of 93.75, but surprisingly was not awarded the man-of-the-series award for England, with the honour going to [[Andrew Strauss]] who averaged 63.42. This run of form (100*, 28, 106*, 119, 4, 9, 9*) gave him an overall Test average of almost 48. Given his average against Australia was only 17, his average against all other sides was around 68. He also played in the ODI series against Pakistan, achieving his two highest scores at the time: 88 at [[SWALEC Stadium|Sophia Gardens]] and 86* at [[Trent Bridge]], the latter earning him the man-of-the-match award following England's victory.\n\n=== 2006: Champions Trophy ===\nIn September 2006 Bell was named in the squad for the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] in India and also in the squad to tour Australia to attempt to retain the Ashes. In the absence of [[Marcus Trescothick]] he was promoted to open the batting for the one-day side. In England's three matches he scored 97 runs, at an average of 32.33. England lost their first two games (to India and Australia) and crashed out of the tournament despite a final group-stage win over eventual runners-up, West Indies.\n\n=== 2006/07: The Ashes ===\n\n{{Main|English cricket team in Australia in 2006-07}}\n\nComing into [[the Ashes]] series, with [[Andrew Flintoff]] named as captain for the tour and reclaiming his place at number six in the batting order, Bell was viewed as competing with [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Paul Collingwood]] for two places in the starting eleven. However, because [[Marcus Trescothick]] returned to England prior to the first Test, Bell, Cook and Collingwood played in the team throughout the series. Scoring a total of 331 runs, including four half centuries, Bell averaged 33.10 for the series. He failed to convert good starts into big scores, and England suffered a 0 \u2013 5 Test series whitewash. This poor run of results continued into the one-day series: England lost the [[Twenty20 International|Twenty20]] game and the first of the ODI's. However, England squeaked through into the final of the Commonwealth Bank Series, and dispatched Australia in the finals in two straight games, with Bell scoring 65 in the first of them.\n\n=== World Cup 2007 ===\n{{Main|2007 Cricket World Cup}}\n\nBell was selected as part of England's 15-man squad for the world cup in the West Indies. England had a largely disappointing tournament and Bell's performances were typical of the team as a whole. At the start of the tournament he was selected to bat at number three, as England lost to [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and stuttered to wins over [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]], [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] and [[Irish cricket team|Ireland]]. Bell suffered an average run of form in these matches, scoring 5, 28, 16 and 31. After defeat to eventual runners up, [[Sri Lankan Cricket Team|Sri Lanka]], a game in which Bell scored 47, England dropped [[Ed Joyce]] from the top of the order and Bell was promoted to open with captain [[Michael Vaughan]]. The change in position initially worked well as Bell scored 77 as England lost to Australia, but in the next two games, against [[Bangladeshi Cricket Team|Bangladesh]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], he only managed scores of 0 and 7, and was dropped for England's final match against the West Indies, a game which England won. England finished fifth in the Super 8 stage of the tournament and failed to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\n=== 2007: West Indies and India ===\nIan Bell scored the fourth of England's hundreds against the West Indies in the first Test at [[Lord's]] in May. Along with [[Alastair Cook]], [[Paul Collingwood]] and [[Matt Prior]], they became the first four batsmen for England since 1938 to each score a century in the same Test match.{{fact|date=August 2019}} Bell's innings came at number 6 in the batting order and after England declared he had the impressive record at that position of 484 runs at 121.00.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 21 August 2007, Bell scored his maiden [[One Day International|ODI]] century in the first of seven one-day matches against [[India national cricket team|India]], scoring 126 runs off 118 balls (a strike rate of 106.8). Bell went on to score two more fifties in the next two games, including a player-of-the-match 79 at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] as England took a 2\u20131 lead in the series.

Bell did not make a half century again in the series as England tour began to fall apart after losing the Ashes. He made 27 runs in the fourth Test, which included a duck, before making just 18 runs in the final Test as Australia won the series 5\u20130. Senior batsmen such as Bell, Cook and Pietersen were criticised in the English media for their lack of runs, with Bell himself making just two half centuries and failing to score a hundred in the series. Bell showed good form in the opening two ODIs, making a score of 41 in the first match before being run out for 68 in the second. Despite this, England went on to lose both matches. In the third ODI Bell made 29 before being run out for the second consecutive match. England won their only game of the tour in the fourth ODI, with Bell making 55. He made 14 in the final match as Australia won the series 4-1.\n\n=== 2014: Sri Lanka and India ===\nBell was named in the ODI squad for their series against Sri Lanka. He made 50 in the first match of the series as England won by 81 runs on the DL Method. He made 12 in the following match, before hitting an unbeaten 41 in the third match of the series to help England to a ten wicket victory. England lost the final two matches of the series, with Bell making scores of seven and 37 in the next too matches. The two defeats meant that England lost the series 3\u20132. In the First test, Bell made scores of 56 and 9 as the match ended in a draw. The second and final Test of the series was Bell's 100 Test match. He made 64 in the first innings to help England into a strong position, before making just eight in England's second innings as they collapsed to lose the match.\n\nIn the first Test against India Bell made 25 as the match finished in a draw due to a pitch that gave the bowlers little. He was poor in the second Test, making scores of 16 and 1 as England lost the match to go 1\u20130 down in the series. Seniors players such as Bell and Alistair Cook came under scrutiny, although retained their places in the squad for the next Test. On 28 July in the third test against [[India national cricket team|India]] at [[The Rose Bowl, Southampton]], Bell scored a century in the first innings by hitting a six against [[Ravindra Jadeja]] when he was at 94 not out. In that over 21 runs of six balls came with Bell scoring 20 with two sixes and two fours. It was Bell's 21st century and first after the previous Ashes series. He went on to score 167, falling to a ball from Bhuvneshwar Kumar. England eventually went on to win the match by 266 runs and level the series. Bell continued his good form, making 58 in the next match to help England take a 2\u20131 lead in the series. Bell only made seven in the final match of the series, but due to poor batting from India England clinched the series 3\u20131. After the first ODI was rained off, Bell opened in the second match of the series, although he made just one as England lost the game. Bell made 28 in the next match as England suffered another defeat. A foot injury suffered in training ruled bell out for the rest of the series.\n\nBell was selected for the tour of Sri Lanka at the back end of 2014. However, he only played in the first two matches, making scores of 35 and 11. England lost both games.\n\n=== 2015: Tri Series ===\nFollowing the removal of Alistair Cook as ODI captain, Bell returned to the top of the order for the tournament against Australia and India. He was out for a duck in the first match against Australia as England lost the opening match. He hit 88 not out in the following match against India to help England win the match. In the following game, he hit 141 against Australia, but it was not enough to prevent another England defeat. In the next game against India he made ten as England qualified for the final. Bell was unable to make an impact in the final, being dismissed for eight as England again lost to Australia.\n\n=== 2015: West Indies and New Zealand ===\nBell was selected in the England squad that toured the West Indies. He made 143 in the first innings of the first Test, but was dismissed for 11 in the second innings after being run out. The match ended in a draw. Bell could only make 1 in England's first innings of the second Test. However, England went on to win the game to take a 1\u20130 lead in the series. Bell had a poor game in the final match of the series after being dismissed for a duck in both innings. England went on to lose the game by five wickets as the West Indies fought back to level the series at 1\u20131.\n\nBell enjoyed a disappointing time in the series against New Zealand. He made just one in the first innings and then followed this up with 29 in the second innings. Despite this, England went on to win the match by 124 runs. Bell's poor form continued in the next Test as he made scores of 12 and one as England lost the game to draw the series 1\u20131. Bell also dropped several catches in the second Test.\n\n=== 2015: The Ashes ===\nIn the first Ashes Test Bell could only make 1 in the first innings, although he then made 60 in the second innings as England won the match convincingly. In the second Test Bell struggled and made just 12 runs in the match as England lost by 405 runs. Following the defeat, Bell was moved up the order to three and responded well in the Third Test, scoring 53 in the first innings and an unbeaten 65 in the second innings as England won by eight wickets. Bell made just 1 in the fourth Test as England won by an innings and 78 runs to win the series. In the final Test, he made ten in the first innings and 13 in the second as England lost by an innings and 48 runs, but won the series 3\u20132.\n\nIan Bell officially declared his retirement from ODI Cricket and said he will focus on Test Cricket, he said to BBC radio<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzingfeed.com/index.php/2015/08/30/ian-bell-retires-from-odis-and-says-he-will-focus-on-test-cricket//|title=Ian Bell Retires From ODI's and Says He Will Focus On Test Cricket|work=Buzzing Feed|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830100119/http://buzzingfeed.com/index.php/2015/08/30/ian-bell-retires-from-odis-and-says-he-will-focus-on-test-cricket//|archivedate=30 August 2015|df=dmy-all|date=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== 2015: Pakistan ===\nDespite coming under pressure, Bell kept his place for the tour of Pakistan. He scored 63 in England's first innings of the first Test, as they posted 598/9. He made an unbeaten five in the second innings but England were unable to force a victory. He was out for four in the first innings of the second Test, but improved in the second innings, scoring 46. Despite this, England suffered a defeat by a margin of 78 runs.

In 2015, he became the second player since [[Ian Botham]] to be involved in five [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series wins.\n\nIn the [[2006 New Year Honours|2006 New Year Honours List]], Bell was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for his role in the successful [[The Ashes|Ashes]] campaign of 2005. In November 2006, he was awarded the [[ICC Awards|Emerging Player of the Year]] award by the [[International Cricket Council]].

His first century, a score of 130 against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford UCCE]], made him the county's youngest ever centurion at 19 years and 56 days. He also became the county's youngest capped player ever when Warwickshire awarded him a county cap on the final day of the season.\n\nBell was named in the first intake of the [[ECB National Academy]] who spent the 2001/02 winter in Australia.<ref>[http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/england/england-performance-programme/england-performance-programme-intakes,496,BP.html England Performance Programme intakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521200432/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/england/england-performance-programme/england-performance-programme-intakes,496,BP.html |date=21 May 2011 }} ECB; Retrieved 9 October 2008</ref> The day after he returned home from Adelaide he was brought into the full [[English cricket team|England Test squad]] to cover for the injured [[Mark Butcher]] on the New Zealand tour.\n\nIn 2002 Bell's four-day form fell away as he scored 658 at an [[batting average (cricket)|average]] of 24.37 however he was instrumental in the county's [[Benson & Hedges Cup]] success. He top-scored in the Quarter-final (scoring 85 not out), Semi-final (46) and Final (65 not out), the latter performance winning him the Gold Award in the last ever Benson & Hedges Cup final.\n\nBell's best form in 2003 once again came in the one-day format, he scored 779 runs at 28.85 in the [[County Championship]] compared to 560 runs at 43.07 in the [[Pro40|National League]], his best performance came at Chelmsford where he scored his maiden one-day century, 125 off 113 deliveries, as well as taking 5/41, his best one-day bowling figures.

There was speculation in the press that he would not be included in the Test team, but when [[Michael Vaughan]] was injured before the first Test, Bell got another opportunity. He took it, scoring a century and two half-centuries in the three-match series, and becoming England's top scorer in the series with 313 runs at an average of 52.16. He also took his first Test wicket with his part-time bowling when he caught and bowled [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4453774.stm\n|title=England hit by Pakistan run spree\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=20 November 2005 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThis form on the subcontinent continued on 18 February 2006 in [[English cricket team|England]]'s first warm-up game prior to the Test series against [[Indian cricket team|India]] when Bell top-scored with 78 at [[Brabourne Stadium|Mumbai]]. He could not maintain this form into the Test series where, in 6 innings, he only scored 131 runs at an average of just under 22.\n\n=== 2006: Sri Lanka and Pakistan ===\nAfter returning from India, Bell had an average start to the season with Warwickshire. He was named in the squad of 13 for the first home Test of the summer, against [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]], but with the return of [[Marcus Trescothick]], coupled with the good form of [[Paul Collingwood]] and the emergence of [[Alastair Cook]], Bell was dropped from the starting 11. Bell was selected in the squad for the 5 match ODI series against Sri Lanka, and was one of only a couple of players to come through the series with any credit.\n\nAs a result of this, and the injury to [[Andrew Flintoff]], Bell was recalled to the Test team for the first Test against [[Pakistani Cricket Team|Pakistan]]. After spending most of his career batting in the top four, he was asked to bat at number six. He scored a century in each of the first three Tests, becoming the first Englishman since [[Graham Gooch]] to score a century in three successive Test matches, but missed his chance to make it four in a row after scoring only 9 in the first innings and being 9 not out when the fourth Test unexpectedly finished a day early after the Pakistan ball tampering row. He finished the series with an average of 93.75, but surprisingly was not awarded the man-of-the-series award for England, with the honour going to [[Andrew Strauss]] who averaged 63.42. This run of form (100*, 28, 106*, 119, 4, 9, 9*) gave him an overall Test average of almost 48. Given his average against Australia was only 17, his average against all other sides was around 68. He also played in the ODI series against Pakistan, achieving his two highest scores at the time: 88 at [[SWALEC Stadium|Sophia Gardens]] and 86* at [[Trent Bridge]], the latter earning him the man-of-the-match award following England's victory.\n\n=== 2006: Champions Trophy ===\nIn September 2006 Bell was named in the squad for the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] in India and also in the squad to tour Australia to attempt to retain the Ashes. In the absence of [[Marcus Trescothick]] he was promoted to open the batting for the one-day side. In England's three matches he scored 97 runs, at an average of 32.33. England lost their first two games (to India and Australia) and crashed out of the tournament despite a final group-stage win over eventual runners-up, West Indies.\n\n=== 2006/07: The Ashes ===\n\n{{Main|English cricket team in Australia in 2006-07}}\n\nComing into [[the Ashes]] series, with [[Andrew Flintoff]] named as captain for the tour and reclaiming his place at number six in the batting order, Bell was viewed as competing with [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Paul Collingwood]] for two places in the starting eleven. However, because [[Marcus Trescothick]] returned to England prior to the first Test, Bell, Cook and Collingwood played in the team throughout the series. Scoring a total of 331 runs, including four half centuries, Bell averaged 33.10 for the series. He failed to convert good starts into big scores, and England suffered a 0 \u2013 5 Test series whitewash. This poor run of results continued into the one-day series: England lost the [[Twenty20 International|Twenty20]] game and the first of the ODI's. However, England squeaked through into the final of the Commonwealth Bank Series, and dispatched Australia in the finals in two straight games, with Bell scoring 65 in the first of them.\n\n=== World Cup 2007 ===\n{{Main|2007 Cricket World Cup}}\n\nBell was selected as part of England's 15-man squad for the world cup in the West Indies. England had a largely disappointing tournament and Bell's performances were typical of the team as a whole. At the start of the tournament he was selected to bat at number three, as England lost to [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and stuttered to wins over [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]], [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] and [[Irish cricket team|Ireland]]. Bell suffered an average run of form in these matches, scoring 5, 28, 16 and 31. After defeat to eventual runners up, [[Sri Lankan Cricket Team|Sri Lanka]], a game in which Bell scored 47, England dropped [[Ed Joyce]] from the top of the order and Bell was promoted to open with captain [[Michael Vaughan]]. The change in position initially worked well as Bell scored 77 as England lost to Australia, but in the next two games, against [[Bangladeshi Cricket Team|Bangladesh]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], he only managed scores of 0 and 7, and was dropped for England's final match against the West Indies, a game which England won. England finished fifth in the Super 8 stage of the tournament and failed to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\n=== 2007: West Indies and India ===\nIan Bell scored the fourth of England's hundreds against the West Indies in the first Test at [[Lord's]] in May.

He made 64 in the first innings to help England into a strong position, before making just eight in England's second innings as they collapsed to lose the match.\n\nIn the first Test against India Bell made 25 as the match finished in a draw due to a pitch that gave the bowlers little. He was poor in the second Test, making scores of 16 and 1 as England lost the match to go 1\u20130 down in the series. Seniors players such as Bell and Alistair Cook came under scrutiny, although retained their places in the squad for the next Test. On 28 July in the third test against [[India national cricket team|India]] at [[The Rose Bowl, Southampton]], Bell scored a century in the first innings by hitting a six against [[Ravindra Jadeja]] when he was at 94 not out. In that over 21 runs of six balls came with Bell scoring 20 with two sixes and two fours. It was Bell's 21st century and first after the previous Ashes series. He went on to score 167, falling to a ball from Bhuvneshwar Kumar. England eventually went on to win the match by 266 runs and level the series. Bell continued his good form, making 58 in the next match to help England take a 2\u20131 lead in the series. Bell only made seven in the final match of the series, but due to poor batting from India England clinched the series 3\u20131. After the first ODI was rained off, Bell opened in the second match of the series, although he made just one as England lost the game. Bell made 28 in the next match as England suffered another defeat. A foot injury suffered in training ruled bell out for the rest of the series.\n\nBell was selected for the tour of Sri Lanka at the back end of 2014. However, he only played in the first two matches, making scores of 35 and 11. England lost both games.\n\n=== 2015: Tri Series ===\nFollowing the removal of Alistair Cook as ODI captain, Bell returned to the top of the order for the tournament against Australia and India. He was out for a duck in the first match against Australia as England lost the opening match. He hit 88 not out in the following match against India to help England win the match. In the following game, he hit 141 against Australia, but it was not enough to prevent another England defeat. In the next game against India he made ten as England qualified for the final. Bell was unable to make an impact in the final, being dismissed for eight as England again lost to Australia.\n\n=== 2015: West Indies and New Zealand ===\nBell was selected in the England squad that toured the West Indies. He made 143 in the first innings of the first Test, but was dismissed for 11 in the second innings after being run out. The match ended in a draw. Bell could only make 1 in England's first innings of the second Test. However, England went on to win the game to take a 1\u20130 lead in the series. Bell had a poor game in the final match of the series after being dismissed for a duck in both innings. England went on to lose the game by five wickets as the West Indies fought back to level the series at 1\u20131.\n\nBell enjoyed a disappointing time in the series against New Zealand. He made just one in the first innings and then followed this up with 29 in the second innings. Despite this, England went on to win the match by 124 runs. Bell's poor form continued in the next Test as he made scores of 12 and one as England lost the game to draw the series 1\u20131. Bell also dropped several catches in the second Test.\n\n=== 2015: The Ashes ===\nIn the first Ashes Test Bell could only make 1 in the first innings, although he then made 60 in the second innings as England won the match convincingly. In the second Test Bell struggled and made just 12 runs in the match as England lost by 405 runs. Following the defeat, Bell was moved up the order to three and responded well in the Third Test, scoring 53 in the first innings and an unbeaten 65 in the second innings as England won by eight wickets. Bell made just 1 in the fourth Test as England won by an innings and 78 runs to win the series. In the final Test, he made ten in the first innings and 13 in the second as England lost by an innings and 48 runs, but won the series 3\u20132.\n\nIan Bell officially declared his retirement from ODI Cricket and said he will focus on Test Cricket, he said to BBC radio<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzingfeed.com/index.php/2015/08/30/ian-bell-retires-from-odis-and-says-he-will-focus-on-test-cricket//|title=Ian Bell Retires From ODI's and Says He Will Focus On Test Cricket|work=Buzzing Feed|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830100119/http://buzzingfeed.com/index.php/2015/08/30/ian-bell-retires-from-odis-and-says-he-will-focus-on-test-cricket//|archivedate=30 August 2015|df=dmy-all|date=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== 2015: Pakistan ===\nDespite coming under pressure, Bell kept his place for the tour of Pakistan.
