He later became a pundit and commentator for [[BT Sport]], regularly working on their coverage of Scottish football. He is now also a pundit and occasional match co-commentator on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].\n\nHe played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1991 to 2007 for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the [[Premier League|English]] and [[Scottish Premier League]]s. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] once by [[England national football team|England]].\n\nSutton played principally in midfield or attack, although usually in the latter role as a striker. A very physical player, Sutton was a fairly prolific goalscorer throughout his career and was joint top goalscorer (with [[Dion Dublin]] and [[Michael Owen]]) in the [[FA Premier League 1997\u201398]] season. He was also known as being one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header. He scored many goals with this technique which made him particularly effective from set-pieces.\n\nIn September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], but he resigned due to personal reasons twelve months later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/9043871.stm |title=Manager Chris Sutton leaves Lincoln City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2012, he came out of retirement briefly and featured for non-league [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/276490/Former-England-striker-Chris-Sutton-comes-out-of-retirement|title=Former England striker Chris Sutton comes out of retirement|date=11 October 2012|work=Dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Norwich City (1991\u20131994)===\nHe started his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager [[Dave Stringer]].

Late in the game with the \"Gunners\" leading by a single goal, the ball was kicked out of play by Arsenal to allow an injured teammate to receive treatment. Under the unwritten sportsmanship rule, Arsenal would expect the ball to be returned to them unhindered. However, Sutton chased the ball instead of allowing it to be thrown back to Arsenal and won a corner from his efforts. Blackburn scored from this corner and as a result Arsenal missed out on a lucrative place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on [[goal difference]].

He later became a pundit and commentator for [[BT Sport]], regularly working on their coverage of Scottish football. He in now also a pundit and occasional match co-commentator on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].\n\nHe played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1991 to 2007 for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the [[Premier League|English]] and [[Scottish Premier League]]s. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] once by [[England national football team|England]].\n\nSutton played principally in midfield or attack, although usually in the latter role as a striker. A very physical player, Sutton was a fairly prolific goalscorer throughout his career and was joint top goalscorer (with [[Dion Dublin]] and [[Michael Owen]]) in the [[FA Premier League 1997\u201398]] season. He was also known as being one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header.
