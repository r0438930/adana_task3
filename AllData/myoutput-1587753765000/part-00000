Its main differences were support for more I/O devices (floppy disk drives, [[IEEE-488]], [[RS232]], ...) and a [[character set]] (EBCDIC) which was compatible with other [[IBM]] machines. These improvements made it partially incompatible with the IBM 5100.\n\n==Variations==\nThree variations of the IBM 5110 were built:\n* IBM 5110 Model 1 (with a built-in [[Quarter-inch cartridge|QIC]] DC300 tape drive of 204 kB).\n* IBM 5110 Model 2 (without the QIC tape drive).\n* IBM 5110 Model 3 - also designated as the [[IBM 5120]] (with two built-in 8 inch 1.2 [[Megabyte|MB]] [[floppy disk]] drives).\n\n==Description==\nThe 5110 featured the same housing as the 5100 (although the colors were different), which contained an [[IBM PALM processor]], a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and a 1,024-character [[Computer display|display screen]]. Main memory held 16, 32, 48 or 64 [[KiB]] of [[data]], depending on the unit. Offering either [[magnetic tape]] or [[Floppy disk|diskette]] storage, the Model 1 could store as much as 204,000 bytes of information per [[Quarter-inch cartridge|tape cartridge]] or 1.2 million bytes on a single diskette; the Model 2 allowed only diskette storage. Up to two IBM 5114 diskette units, each housing a maximum of two diskette drives, could be attached to the 5110 for a total online diskette capacity of 4.8 million bytes. The IBM 5110 Model 3 allowed only one external IBM 5114 diskette unit.  IBM did not offer a [[local area network|LAN]] or [[hard disk drive]] for these systems. However, in 1981 [[Hal Prewitt]], founder of [[Core International, Inc]] invented and marketing the world's first and only  hard disk subsystems and \"CoreNet\", a LAN used to share programs and data for the IBM 5110 and 5120 systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coreinternational.info/1981_5110_Disk_Brochure.pdf|title=''Save IBM 5110/20 from junk yards of the world''|publisher=Core|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coreinternational.info/1982_Sept_CORE_Newsletter.pdf|title=''1982 CORE Newsletter''|publisher=Core|accessdate=18 Nov 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn IBM 5103 printer and an external IBM 5106 auxiliary tape unit (Model 1 only) were available as options from IBM.\n\nCiting the easy use of his new system, Jeff Grube, vice president of [[Punxsutawney]] Electric Repair (who received the first IBM 5110 on February 2, 1978), said: \"If you can type and use a hand-held calculator, you have all the skills necessary to operate a 5110.\"\n\n==Programming languages==\nThe 5110 was available with either [[APL programming language|APL]] or [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]\u2014or both\u2014programming languages. Machines that supported both languages provided a toggle switch on the front panel to select the language. \n\nIn 1984, [[Core International, Inc]] introduced PC51, software that allowed 5100 Series computer programs written in BASIC to run unmodified on the [[IBM PC]] and [[IBM PC compatible|compatibles]] under [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] and share programs and data on CoreNet, the LAN for all these models.\n\n==5110 Software==\nThe 5110, designed by the Global Software Development team at [[IBM Rochester]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]],<ref>Cf. IBM 5110 Computing System, IBM Archives website</ref> was aimed at GSD's traditional commercial market. The machine was brought in only 90 days from conception to production.
