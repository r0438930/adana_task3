Its stock is owned by the Albanian state. The company is headquartered in [[Patos, Albania|Patos]] and has a representative office in [[Tirana]]. The CEO of Albpetrol is '''Mr. Genti Gazheli'''. Albpetrol is managing 1350 oil wells in the existing settlements of Patos, Ballsh, Karbunar\u00eb, Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb, Gorisht-Kocul, Cakran-Mollaj and Amonic\u00eb.\n\nAlbpetrol the eleventh-largest company in Albania measured by 2016 revenues (and the third largest state owned company ). Albpetrol profit for the fiscal year 2016 were US$13 million. The company is operating in 7 oilfields in Albania with a production of 110.000 Ton crude oil. During the last years Albpetrol has managed to have a sustainable position in the Albanian market.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1918, Italian geologist Leo Madalena drilled the first Albanian oil well near Drashovica ([[Vlor\u00eb]]). The well reached a depth of 200 meters and, despite the small amount of oil produced, received positive results. The results attracted the attention of major oil companies, such as Anglo-Persian [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|APOC Oil Company]] and American [[Standard Oil]].\n\nSince 1918, more than 5,650 oil and gas wells have been drilled in Albania. 500 natural gas wells have been drilled, with 255 producing natural gas, and five oil fields have 4,728 oil wells.\n\nAlbania currently has 12 known oil deposits and 5 natural gas deposits. [[Patos-Marinza Oil Field|Patos-Marin\u00ebz]], an area of 44 thousand hectares, is the largest oil-bearing zone in continental Europe. It is estimated to contain 5.4 billion barrels of crude oil.\n\nAlbpetrol JSC operates according to the norms and rules of the market economy, with the object: Research and production of the hydrocarbons which included a full cycle of seismic works, geological, engineering, geophysics, research, extraction, processing and petroleum products marketing.\n\nIn 1974, Albpetrol achieved their maximum oil production, at 250,000 tons of oil/year (or 6,165 tons of oil/day equivalent to 38,408 barrels/day). Albpetrol's highest gas production was in 1982, at 940,000,000 Nm3 gas/year (or 2,575,342 Nm3 gas/day).\nIn the 1970s and 80s, the oil industry was made of 34 enterprises who employed almost 25,000 employees, of which 2,800 where medium or senior specialists.\nIn the latter part of 2013, several oil and gas fields were discovered and put in operation, including three oil and four natural gas fields in sandy layers and nine oil and one gas condensing oil field in limestone.\n\nBefore 1990, Albpetrol JSC was one of the largest subsidiaries of the Albanian State and one of the largest producers of revenue in the state budget. The transition from communism brought setbacks and reductions of society activity for Albpetrol. In the mid-1990s, a number of international oil companies came to Albania and took, by concession, the oil fields administered by Albpetrol. This changed the role of the company, which today not only produces oil, but serves as a regulatory entity and a controller of related hydrocarbon agreements between the Albanian state and foreign companies. The oil and gas industry will continue to have an important role in the Albanian economy, not only because it employs a significant number of workers, but also for the supplemental revenue the industry supplies the state.<ref>[https://rtsh.al/lajme/koncensioni-i-amonices-perplas-albpetrol-me-akbn Kon\u00e7esioni i Amonic\u00ebs p\u00ebrplas Albpetrol me AKBN]</ref>\n\n==Geological reserves==\nThe initial geological oil reserves, in total, according to the calculations made by the most qualified specialists until the years 1985 - 1990, are estimated 437.645.143 tons of oil, out of which 81.025.885 tons of oil reserves are considered extractable reserves. Until 01.01.2014 are produced a total of about 55.498.458,31 tons of oil, which means 68.49% of the extractable reserves or 12.68% of geological reserves.\nThe geological reserves of gas, are estimated in a total of 18.163.700.000 Nm3 gas, and until 01.01.2013 is extracted a total of 12.503.725.787 Nm3. It remains to be extracted even 5.659.974.2013 Nm3 of gas.\nThe value of extractable reserves of 81.025.885 tons of oil, in terms of a qualitative improvement of the technology of exploitation of wells and oilfields, particularly the last 20 years, is reassessed \"a priori\" and the highest is thought to be 50-60 %, which means that the extractable reserves may be 110 to 120 million tons in total. A total of 277.615.000 Nm3 gas or 56.54% is extracted from the gas field.
