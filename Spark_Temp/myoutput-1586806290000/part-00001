These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay.

Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world.

Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R. Hoey]] noted in a report, \"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\",<ref>Edsall, p. 277.</ref> and said all of the government's intelligence agencies \"are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks\".<ref>David K.

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession.<ref>Edsall, p. 247.</ref> In 1956, however, the psychologist [[Evelyn Hooker]] performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference.<ref>Edsall, p. 310.</ref> Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians,<ref>Marcus, pp. 58\u201359.</ref> but homosexuality remained in the ''DSM'' until 1974.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=drBejRLWkHkC&pg=PA76 |chapter=The Transformation of Mental Disorders in the 1980s: The DSM-III, Managed Care, and \"Cosmetic Psychopharmacology\" |page=76 |title=Medicating Children: ADHD and Pediatric Mental Health |first1=Rick |last1=Mayes |first2=Catherine |last2=Bagwell |first3=Jennifer L. |last3=Erkulwater |publisher=Harvard University Press |date= 2009 |accessdate=April 7, 2019 |isbn=978-0-674-03163-0 }}</ref>\n\n===Homophile activism===\n{{main|Homophile}}\nIn response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide social opportunities where they could socialize without fear of being arrested. [[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles.<ref>Adam, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.<ref>Adam, pp. 63\u201364.</ref><ref>Marcus, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.<ref>Marcus, p. 21.</ref> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<ref>Gallo, pp. 1\u20135, 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]\u2014both Greenwich Village residents\u2014also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.<ref>Adam, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the [[Alcohol laws of New York|New York State Liquor Authority]] (SLA).

In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008).

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"carter142\"/> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing.\"<ref>Carter, p. 148.</ref> Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.\n\nA scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as \"a typical New York butch\" and \"a dyke\u2013stone butch\", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]] for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.<ref>Duberman, p. 196.</ref> Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown ([[Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie]] has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary<ref name=Chu>{{cite web|last=Chu |first=Grace |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/77167-an-interview-with-lesbian-stonewall-veteran-storm-delarverie|title=An interview with lesbian Stonewall veteran Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie |publisher=AfterEllen.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600&nbsp;people, grabbed several people, including folk singer and mentor of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]]\u2014who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in...

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away.

Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police.

[[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.<ref>Carter, p. 252.</ref>\n\n===Gay Pride===\n{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in U.S. history.<ref>Duberman, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref><ref>De la Croix, Sukie (2007).

The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.<ref>Clendinen, pp. 62\u201364.</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&nbsp;city blocks.<ref name=\"fosburgh\">Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual [[Gay Pride]] events around the world.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\n[[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] (officially Stonewall Equality Limited) is an [[LGBT rights]] charity in the United Kingdom, founded in 1989, and named after the [[Stonewall Inn]] because of the Stonewall riots.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay. At the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].<ref name=\"duberman183\"/><ref>Carter, pp. 79\u201383.</ref><ref name=\"AmExpMafia\">{{cite web |title=Stonewall Uprising: The Year That Changed America - Why Did the Mafia Own the Bar? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/stonewall-why-did-mafia-own-bar/ |website=American Experience |publisher=PBS |accessdate=June 5, 2019 |date=April 2011}}</ref> It catered to an assortment of patrons and was known to be popular among the poorest and most marginalized people in the gay community: [[Butch and femme|butch lesbians]], [[effeminate]] young men, [[drag queen]]s, [[male prostitution|male prostitutes]], [[transgender]] people, and [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless youth]]. Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world. On June 28, 1970, the first [[Pride parade|gay pride marches]] took place in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |title=Heritage &#124; 1970 Christopher Street Liberation Day Gay-In, San Francisco |publisher=SF Pride |date=June 28, 1970 |accessdate=June 28, 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022032242/http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}</ref> and the anniversary of the riots was commemorated in Chicago.

Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R. Hoey]] noted in a report, \"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\",<ref>Edsall, p. 277.</ref> and said all of the government's intelligence agencies \"are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks\".<ref>David K.

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships.

[[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles.<ref>Adam, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.<ref>Adam, pp. 63\u201364.</ref><ref>Marcus, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.<ref>Marcus, p. 21.</ref> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<ref>Gallo, pp. 1\u20135, 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]\u2014both Greenwich Village residents\u2014also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.<ref>Adam, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City.

In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008).

The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called \"Lily Law\", \"Alice Blue Gown\", or \"Betty Badge\"<ref name=\"duberman187\">Duberman, p. 187.</ref>), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private \"bottle club\", but rarely signed their real names.<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or [[black light]]s.

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"carter142\"/> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as \"a typical New York butch\" and \"a dyke\u2013stone butch\", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]] for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.<ref>Duberman, p. 196.</ref> Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown ([[Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie]] has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary<ref name=Chu>{{cite web|last=Chu |first=Grace |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/77167-an-interview-with-lesbian-stonewall-veteran-storm-delarverie|title=An interview with lesbian Stonewall veteran Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie |publisher=AfterEllen.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in...

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away.

Members of the mob stopped cars, overturning one of them to block Christopher Street. [[Jack Nichols (activist)|Jack Nichols]] and [[Lige Clarke]], in their column printed in ''[[Screw (magazine)|Screw]]'', declared that \"massive crowds of angry protesters chased [the police] for blocks screaming, 'Catch them!'&nbsp;\"<ref name=\"teal6\"/>\n\nBy 4:00&nbsp;a.m., the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or gathered nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be \"electricity in the air\".<ref>Carter, p. 180.</ref> One commented: \"There was a certain beauty in the aftermath of the riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street.\"<ref>Carter, p. 181.</ref> Thirteen people had been arrested.

All three papers covered the riots; the ''Daily News'' placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\".<ref name=\"teal4\"/> All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. [[Graffiti]] appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \"Drag power\", \"They invaded our rights\", \"Support gay power\", and \"Legalize gay bars\", along with accusations of police looting, and\u2014regarding the status of the bar\u2014\"We are open.\"<ref name=\"teal4\">Teal, p. 4.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EFDB1E3AEE34BC4850DFB0668382679EDE |title=Police Again Rout Village Youths: Outbreak by 400 Follows a Near-Riot Over Raid |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 30, 1969 |page=22}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants remember differently which night was more frantic or violent.

More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth [[Organization of the New York City Police Department#Police precincts|Precinct]]s, but after 2:00&nbsp;a.m. the TPF arrived again.

After he learned of the riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, \"Gay power! Isn't that great!... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves\", and visited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, \"You know, the guys there were so beautiful\u2014they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10&nbsp;years ago.\"<ref>Teal, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence===\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. [[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.<ref>Carter, p. 252.</ref>\n\n===Gay Pride===\n{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in U.S. history.<ref>Duberman, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref><ref>De la Croix, Sukie (2007).

The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.<ref>Clendinen, pp. 62\u201364.</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&nbsp;city blocks.<ref name=\"fosburgh\">Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.
