In this cartoon short, Mickey has a ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''-type dream that he travels through his mirror and enters a topsy-turvy world where everything is alive. While there, he engages in a [[Fred Astaire]] dance number with a pair of gloves and a pack of cards, until the cards chase him out of the bizarre world. The title is written as ''Thru the Mirror'' on the title card, but the alternative spelling '''''Through the Mirror''''' is used on the poster for the film. In addition, the short film is a parody of the book, ''Through the Looking Glass'', by Lewis Carroll.\n\n==Synopsis==\nMickey falls asleep after reading ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]]. An astral projection of himself (presumably Mickey in his dream state) leaves his body and passes through his mirror into an alternate version of his house. His furniture and possessions have come to life and are complete with faces and personalities, but most of them remain motionless. He jumps on a rocking chair that throws him off in annoyance while a nearby coat rack watches in surprise, and lands on the footrest that behaves like a puppy while Mickey rides on it like a horse until it jumps into the rocking chair. While the chair tries to calm down the footrest, Mickey tries to comfort them, only to end up angering them instead. He bumps into an umbrella, who scolds him until it suddenly drops open and re-closes itself in embarrassment before returning to where it originally was.\nMickey then comes across a nut cracker breaking open a walnut and offers it to him while it eats the shells. After eating the walnut, Mickey's lower body commences to wildly spin around, and it hits his face. While his lower body crazily spins, he suddenly becomes gigantic and then shrinks. The telephone suddenly rings and it throws its receiver down to Mickey, who uses it to climb up to the table. He attempts to answer the call, only to get responses from the phone itself and then proceeds to jump rope with the telephone, who uses its receiver and wire as a jump rope while the radio begins playing music.\nMickey begins to dance his way through his house, tap dancing on a [[top hat]] (wearing a tiny one with a match for a cane) with some gloves (eventually he gets his butt kicked twice by the gloves), [[playing cards]] (some of them hit Mickey's butt during the dance), and eventually the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] card (who resembles [[Greta Garbo]]). The [[joker (playing card)|joker]] on his bicycle notices and alerts the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]] who uses the joker's bike to get down there and pulls the queen aside before proceeding to fight for his lady in a sword duel with Mickey, who uses both a [[sewing needle]] and a [[Button (clothing)|button]] as a makeshift sword after the King of Hearts pushes him and gets his butt stabbed by the needle. \nMickey defeats the king by pushing him into an inkwell, where a stamp takes him out and cleans him. Considering this as the last straw, the king then orders for the cards to be called out to get rid of Mickey for good and the radio acts as an alarm to summon the cards like police cars - \"Calling all cards! Calling all cards!\" in which some come out from the king's throne and some come out from a drawer. Chaos ensues as Mickey runs from the cards. He picks up a fountain pen, hides in a basket of yarn, and uses the pen like a machine gun to fire ink at the cards while wearing a thimble-like a helmet. The pen eventually runs out of ink, allowing the cards to pig-pile on Mickey, who then escapes in a torn sock. After being spotted, the cards give chase again and throw their pictures at him. Mickey then turns on an electric fan to blow the cards back while the telephone calls the police in panic as Mickey swings from a lamp rope and runs on a globe until he trips and falls into the globe's [[Bay of Bengal]] and is thrown out by a figure, who appears to be a small version of Neptune, by impaling Mickey's butt. He then grows back to his normal size and escapes back to the real world through the mirror where he reenters his body. Eventually, he is awakened by his alarm clock and it has all been a dream and goes back to sleep after throwing his alarm clock into a drawer.\n\n==Releases==\n* 1936 &ndash; theatrical release\n* 1956 &ndash; ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]]'', episode #3.8: \"[[The Plausible Impossible]]\" (TV)\n* c. 1972 &ndash; ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'', episode #27: \"Mickey Mouse\" (TV)\n* 1981 &ndash; \"[[Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Cartoon Collections]] Volume One\" (VHS)\n* c. 1983 &ndash; ''[[Good Morning, Mickey!]]'', episode #4 (TV)\n* c. 1988 &ndash; ''[[Mickey's Magical World]]'', (VHS)\n* c. 1992 &ndash; ''[[Mickey's Mouse Tracks]]'', episode #52 (TV)\n* 1997 &ndash; ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (TV series)|The Ink and Paint Club]]'', episode #1.50: \"Storyteller Mickey\" (TV)\n* 1998 &ndash; \"[[The Spirit of Mickey]]\" (VHS)\n* 2001 &ndash; \"[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave One#Mickey Mouse in Living Color|Mickey Mouse in Living Color]]\" (DVD)\n* 2004/2011 &ndash; Bonus on DVD release of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (DVD)\n* 2009 &ndash; Walt Disney Animation Collection: ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'' (DVD)\n* 2011 &ndash; ''[[Have a Laugh!]]'', episode #23 (TV)\n* 2012 &ndash; ''[[Have a Laugh!]]'': Volume 5 (DVD)\n* 2018 &ndash; ''Celebrating Mickey'' (Blu-ray/DVD/Digital)\n\n==Trivia==\n* This cartoon was featured, and referenced, in the 2002 video game ''[[Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse]]''.\n* Some elements from the cartoon like the cards and the opening were used in ''[[Epic Mickey]]''.\n* The song during the magic gloves dance scene was used for the ''[[Walt Disney Mini Classics]]'' promos during their movie's end.\n* The melody during Mickey\u2019s marching with the cards in the middle of the film is a jazzed-up version of the music used in another 1932 cartoon classic, ''Santa\u2019s Workshop''.
