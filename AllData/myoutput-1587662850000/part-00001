In 1696, Samuel M\u00f6rt, a bookkeeper of the [[Kengis]] works, wrote on rumours about the presence of iron in the two hills.<ref name=Kummu96>Kummu 1997, p. 96.</ref> The ore became better known after it was reported by Mangi, a Sami man, in 1736 to Swedish authorities that had gathered in [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi|Jukkasj\u00e4rvi Church]].<ref name=Kummu96/> Soon after the reported finding Swedish senior enforcement officer and cartographer and mapper [[Anders Hackzell]] mapped the Kiruna area in 1736 and gave the mountains of the area their Swedish language names ''Fredriks berg'' (original Finnish name still in use as well: Kiirunavaara) and ''Berget Ulrika Eleonora'' (original Finnish name still in use as well: Luossavaara), after the King of Sweden [[Frederick I of Sweden|Fredrik I]] and his wife [[Ulrika Eleonora]].<ref name=Kummu96/>\n\nDespite the findings of large amounts of ore, no mining was initiated because of the remote location and the harsh climate. Some ore was extracted in the 19th century. It was extracted in summer and transported in winter, using sleds drawn by [[reindeer]] and [[horse]]s. However, the costs were high and the quality of the [[phosphorus]] ore poor, until, in 1878, the [[Gilchrist-Thomas process]], invented by [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] and [[Percy Gilchrist]], allowed for the separation of phosphorus from the ore.<ref name=\"kirunakommun\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kommun.kiruna.se/Om-kommunen/Allmant-om-kommunen/Historia/|title=Historia \u2013 Kiruna kommun|accessdate=2009-02-09|language=Swedish |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030922/http://www.kommun.kiruna.se/Om-kommunen/Allmant-om-kommunen/Historia/ |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"lkab\">{{cite web|url=http://lkab.com/?openform&id=77DE|title=Press room/History/1696\u20131919@lkab.com|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:IORE Vassijaure.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Iore]]-hauled train passing Vassijaure]]\n\nIn 1884, a concession for a railway from [[Lule\u00e5]] to [[Narvik]] was granted to ''The Northern of Europe Railway Company''. The provisional railway between Lule\u00e5 and [[Malmberget]] was finished in 1888 and the first train left Malmberget in March. Around the same time, the English company went bankrupt and had to sell the line to the Swedish state for 8 million [[Swedish crown]]s, around half the amount initially invested. After a significant rebuild, the railway to G\u00e4llivare could be used again and iron ore was extracted at [[Malmberget]] by Aktiebolaget Gellivare Malmf\u00e4lt (AGM).<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Gruvstaden \u2013 Gruvorna |last=Barck |first=\u00c5ke |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=60\u201374 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAt the initiative of Robert Schoug, the [[LKAB|Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag]] (LKAB) was founded in 1890. In 1893, Gustaf Broms became CEO of both LKAB and AGM. LKAB pressed for continuing [[Malmbanan]] via Luossavaara and Kiirunavaara to the ice-free coast of Norway. The continuation of the railway line to [[Narvik]] was controversial, because opponents feared the influence of [[Russia]] (then controlling [[Finland]] and already connected to Sweden at [[Haparanda]]\u2013[[Tornio]]) on an international railway line.\n[[File:Kiruna stadshus 1.JPG|thumb|right|Kiruna City Hall in summer]]\n\nThe decision to build was finally taken in 1898. The railway came to Kiruna 15 October 1899 and the Swedish and Norwegian sections were joined 15 November 1902. For LKAB, the great expense almost led to bankruptcy in 1901, just after the ore mining at Kiirunavaara had started. [[King Oscar II]] only opened the railway line 14 July 1903, preferring summer over winter to travel north.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100komm\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Komunikationer \u2013 Fr\u00e5n h\u00e4stskuts till e-post |last=Theander |first=Agge |last2=Aidenp\u00e4\u00e4 |first2=Elis |last3=Bergstr\u00f6m  |first3=Rolf  |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=132\u2013147 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nThe architects Per Olof Hallman and Gustaf Wickman were appointed to design the city, to be built at Haukivaara, near both iron ore mines, with then-revolutionary consideration of geographical and climatological circumstances; being built on a hill, winter temperatures are much milder than in other towns, and due to the street plan and the positioning, wind is limited. On 27 April 1900, Hallman's plan was officially accepted.\n\nGustaf Broms proposed to name the settlements ''Kiruna'', a short and practical name that could also be pronounced by Swedish speaking inhabitants. The name means [[rock ptarmigan]] in Lappish and Finnish. LKAB appointed [[Hjalmar Lundbohm]], who had finished neither high school nor his geology studies, as local manager in Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100early\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Kiruna \u2013 Fr\u00e5n \u00f6demark till stad |last=Persson |first=Curt |author2=Jan-Erik Johansson  |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=27&ndash;43 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name=\"kiruna100hl\">{{cite book|title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Kiruna \u2013 Hjalmar Lundbohm |last=Persson |first=Curt |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=50&ndash;57 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name=\"wintercity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wintercities.kiruna.se/nytt/technicaltours.htm|title=Kiruna \u2013 technical visits|accessdate=2009-02-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220084615/http://www.wintercities.kiruna.se/nytt/technicaltours.htm|archivedate=2012-02-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Kiruna befolkningsutveckling 1900\u20132000.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Population development in Kiruna town]]\n[[File:Aurora 3 in Kiruna.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Aurora taken from the suburb of Kiruna]]\n\nBefore the design for the settlement had been accepted, houses were built in a disorganized manner with illegal [[slum]]s similar to those in the other mining town, [[Malmberget]], {{convert|80|km}} south of Kiruna. Also, provisional buildings served as a church, a school, a hospital, a hotel and a police station. However, official residences were built at a high pace, and when the king opened the railway in 1903, all illegal residences and most other provisional buildings had been demolished and replaced. The very first building, ''B:1'', is preserved and can be seen at ''Hjalmar Lundbohmsg\u00e5rden''. In 1899, 18 people were registered as living in soon-to-be Kiruna.\nThis increased to 222 in 1900, 7,438 in 1910 and 12,884 in 1930.\n\nThe residences did not fully keep up with this rapid growth; by 1910, there were 1,877 official rooms and some unrecognised residences, which meant that an average of three to four people lived in a single room; this density decreased steadily during the decades to follow. Kiruna became a municipalsamh\u00e4lle (a community within a municipality) in 1908. This caused unhappiness in local organisations, such as ''Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Arbetaref\u00f6rening'', that had hoped for status as [[k\u00f6ping]], which would have kept more of the mining income inside the locality. In return, the mining company LKAB paid for a hospital, fire station, sewage, roads, a church (opened 1912) and the priest's home.<ref name=\"kirunakommun\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100early\" />\n\n[[File:Church of Kiruna 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kiruna Church]]]]\nIn April 1907, a [[tram]] began operation in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners would no longer have to walk several kilometres through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb a hundred meters up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: ''bergbanan'' ([[funicular]]), ''stadssp\u00e5rv\u00e4gen'' (city tramway) and ''gruvsp\u00e5rv\u00e4gen'' (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of {{convert|8|km}} and was unique due to the [[narrow gauge|1-meter gauge]], double windows and heated wagons. It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the mine, with wagons bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nThe iron ore industry was good in the early 20th century. Before the start of the work, Hjalmar Lundbohm worried whether the Kiruna winter would allow for working outside at all, but despite early research into underground mining, [[mountaintop removal mining]] was the primary method in the early years. Mechanisation was attempted early using [[steam power]]ed excavators, but the cold climate led to considerable difficulties and only when electrical machinery became available in the 1910s, significant mechanisation was achieved. The peak of [[Kiirunavaara]], ''Statsr\u00e5det'', was {{convert|247.7|m}} above [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] until it was spectacularly blown off in 1910.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nA general strike hit Sweden in 1909 and Kiruna was no exception. Hoping for a better future, thousands of people left Kiruna, including a group of 500 inhabitants emigrating to Brazil. Most of them returned, disappointed that life in [[Latin America]] was not what they had hoped it to be, Hjalmar Lundbohm personally lent money for the trip home to some of the emigrants.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], iron ore production dropped to the lowest level in LKAB's history, and when exports increased again, a successful three-month strike in 1920 led to a 20% increase in salaries for the miners. Production dropped to a minimum in 1922 and a three-day work week was introduced, but during the ''fabulous twenties'', it increased to a record nine million tonnes in 1927.<ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nIn 1921, mining started at Kiruna's other hill, [[Luossavaara]]. However, the total amount of ore that could be mined in [[open pit mining]] here was small compared to Kiirunavaara, and LKAB preferred to concentrate resources in one place. Nevertheless, mining here continued until 1974 and later it became a research mine.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /> While 19th-century mining in Kiruna had focused on Loussavaara the large-scale operation of LKAB focused on the Kiruna ore proper because it was both larger and not subject to legal restrictions that mandate Loussavaara ore to be refined in Sweden.<ref name=Hansson2015-212>Hansson 2015, p. 212.</ref>\n\nDuring the first decades of Kiruna's existence, no road connected it to the outside world. The only connection was by railway or, as in the time before the railway, by boat (in summer) via the [[Torne river|Torne]] and [[Kalix river|Kalix]] rivers to [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]] and H\u00e5moj\u00e5kk and then proceed by foot. A road from Kiruna was built to Tuolluvaara in 1901, Poikkij\u00e4rvi in 1909, Alttaj\u00e4rvi in 1913 and connected to [[Svappavaara]] in 1926, from where roads already connected via [[Vittangi]] to [[Pajala]] and via Lappesuando to [[G\u00e4llivare]] and further south.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] led to a 70% drop in ore production, a drop that would turn into a dramatic increase on the eve of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nAlthough some tourists had already started coming to the area in the 19th century, the completion of the railway line truly made tourism possible. Tourists came for the rivers and the mountains, but also geologists and entire classes of students came to see the mine. Additionally, a yearly winter sports festival was started, which attracted people from a wide area. The Sami population was already a tourist attraction in the early days of Kiruna's existence.<ref name=\"kiruna100turism\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Turismen |last=Barck |first=\u00c5ke |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=60\u201374 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{See also|Swedish iron ore during World War II}}\n\nThe municipality of Kiruna shares borders with Norway and Finland and Kiruna is located relatively close to both countries. This led to many soldiers being transported to the area whenever mobilisation was requested; first in September 1939 after the German [[invasion of Poland]], then in November 1939 after the [[Winter War|Russian invasion of Finland]], but in both cases, Swedish soldiers did not engage in any fighting. In March 1940, Churchill requested permission to transport soldiers from Narvik in Norway to Finland via Kiruna and Haparanda in ''[[Operation Catherine]]''. Out of fear that the presence of British soldiers near the Kiruna ore mine would provoke a German attack on Sweden, the request was declined.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=I skuggan av krigen|last=Theander |first=Agge|last2=Roth |first2=Thomas |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=234\u2013250 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]], at least ten soldiers were stationed along every bridge along [[Malmbanan]], to blow up the bridges should the German army invade Sweden. Additionally, foreigners were banned from visiting Kiruna or the iron ore line, and only the [[Sami people|Sami]], military personnel, locals and people working for the government were permitted to travel between Kiruna and Riksgr\u00e4nsen.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nAfter [[Battles of Narvik|the battle]] at [[Bj\u00f8rnfjell, Nordland|Bj\u00f8rnfjell]], 15 April 1940, wounded and fallen Norwegian soldiers were transported to Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nDespite the conditions for [[Sweden during World War II|Swedish neutrality]], rail cars with food, skis and helmets were transported from Kiruna to the Norwegian soldiers in Bj\u00f8rnfjell.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nSwedish iron ore from Kiruna was of major importance to the German war machine. A group of people working at LKAB organised in the Wollweberliga, planning to sabotage transports to Germany. In late November 1941, Edvard Nyberg, [[Ernst Wollweber]] and others produced a mine to be attached to the ore cars. Nyberg was caught, was fired from LKAB and spent 3\u00bd years in prison. Upon his release, he founded ''Nybergs Mekaniska Verkstad'' which is still one of Kiruna's biggest companies.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybergsmek.se/|title=Start - NMV Group|website=NMV Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=4386753|language=Swedish|title=De fick prestigefyllt pris |first=Hans |last=Sternlund|work=Norrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraterna|accessdate=22 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nGermany requested that Sweden provide use of the railway network to transport military equipment, but the Swedish government agreed only to ''transitering av human karakt\u00e4r, men ej underh\u00e5ll till stridande trupp'' (transit of humanitarian character, but no supply of fighting soldiers). Germany argued that, now that Norway was occupied, the German soldiers there were no longer fighting, and thus transported a large amount of military equipment, ammunition and, secretly, troops from southern to northern Norway, via Malmbanan and Kiruna. Troops were often transported in transports declared as material transports. Despite being strictly against the rules, there was considerable interaction between the German soldiers and the Swedish locals, including trading and football matches.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nDuring the war, up to 2000 refugees from 20 countries were kept in Kiruna. German prisoners of war, for example, from crashed airplanes, were kept in Kiruna before being transported south. However, small-scale sabotage, such as sand in the engines, was common and loose weapons often ended up at the bottom of the Luossaj\u00e4rvi lake, next to the railway stop.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nNorth of Tornetr\u00e4sk, at Kaivare, a radio base ''Kari'' was built in secrecy and used by the Norwegian resistance. It was also used for the smuggling of arms to Norway and refugees from Norway.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.internationalen.se/print.php?news.3067|work=Internationalen|title=Sverige, USA, FRA och signalspaning|last=Svensson|first=Anders|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=22 February 2009|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-war ===\n[[File:Kiruna-sentrum.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An old mansion near Kiruna centrum]]\n\nIn 1948, Kiruna gained city rights and started to receive large amounts of money from the mine. The city centre was renovated starting in 1953; most buildings built before 1920 were demolished and replaced, and many of the current buildings were built in the following period. The town grew and new neighborhoods were built, as well as new apartment buildings and villas in existing neighborhoods. The area is currently known as ''Lombolo'' was built in the 1960s.<ref name=\"kiruna100early\" />\n\nAfter World War II, the economy of Kiruna started to diversify. Initially, the mechanisation of the mining industry led to more mechanical workshops developing machinery for the mine, still dependent on the mining, but individual companies with spinoffs that could be sold to other areas than the Kiruna mine alone. In the 1950s, a fund, ''Norrlandsfonden'' was established, in which profits from LKAB would be invested in order to diversify the local economy. The municipality started to lend money to starting companies against very beneficial rates, a scheme that lasted until 1959 because the banks, that insisted this was false competition, had established more relaxed rules for lending out money. The industrial area east of the city was built in the 1950s to separate industry from neighborhoods.<ref name=\"kiruna100aktillit\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Fr\u00e5n AK till IT|last=Nilsson|first=Kjell|date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |page=86&ndash;90 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 November 1960, [[Kiruna Airport]] opened to separate civilian air traffic from the military airplanes that had landed at Kalixfors airport and at [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] since World War I. A road to [[Nikkaluokta]] was opened in 1971 and to [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]] and [[Narvik]] in 1984. The latter had been debated heavily, for alternative plans existed to build the road to Norway on the northern side of [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]], via Laimo, Kattuvuoma, [[Salmi (rural locality)|Salmi]] to Innset and [[Bardu]] in Norway. This road was never built, but a 25&nbsp;km long track between Laimo and Salmi was built at the initiatives of the locals and finished in 1962; however, this track, called Talmav\u00e4gen, is not connected to any other road.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nIncreased communications were also beneficial for tourism. [[Swedish Railways]] had already run special trains before World War II, but started a special Dollar train in the summer months between [[Gothenburg]] and Kiruna, connecting to cruise ships from the [[United States]]. The canoe club Kiruna L\u00e5ngf\u00e4rdspaddlare was founded in 1972 and rafting for tourists restarted after it had been discontinued for 20 years due to the drowning of Valfrid Johansson. Until the 1980s, tourism had been mainly a summer business, but touristic exploitation of dog sledging was started in 1983 in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi. In 1990, the first [[Icehotel]] was built in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi and advertised as the world's largest igloo. It had been built using techniques from the building of [[Malmbanan]] 90 years before and was also inspired by the Snow Festival, that had started in 1986 to celebrate the Swedish [[Viking (satellite)|Viking]] satellite. Since 1998, a special tourist area exists in the mine and since 1999, tourists can visit the various areas of research going on in Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100turism\" />\n\nIn 1957, the ''Kiruna Geophysical Observatory'' (KGO) (now the [[Swedish Institute of Space Physics]]) was founded and established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. [[Esrange]] Space Centre is established in 1966. Here, rocket operations and ground-based observations are carried out since 1966, balloon operations since 1974, satellite operations since 1978 and testing operations since 2000 (with the [[Swedish Defence Material Administration]]). ESA has operated a satellite station at Salmaj\u00e4rvi, near Esrange, since 1989. In 1987, [[Ume\u00e5 University]] started a space engineering program in Kiruna, and [[GIS]] education was started by [[Lule\u00e5 University of Technology]] in 1991. In 1993, The Ume\u00e5 space engineers moved to the same building housing IRF and a year later another Lule\u00e5 University programme, civil engineering with specialisation in space technology, started at the same location. Since 2006, the ''Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Space Science and Technology'' has started with at least one semester spent at LTU. In 2007, education along IRV was split and only the Department of Space Science, belonging to Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, remained, while the Ume\u00e5 University programme in Space Engineering quit.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"irf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irf.se/Overview/?dbfile=About_Kiruna&dbsec=Administration&chosen=overview|title=Overview \u2013 Swedish Institute of Space Physics|accessdate=2009-02-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220183342/http://www.irf.se/Overview/?dbfile=About_Kiruna&dbsec=Administration&chosen=overview|archivedate=2008-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"esrange\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.se/?id=5998|title=Esrange space centre \u2013 history|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref><ref name=\"kiruna100rymd\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Rymd, milj\u00f6 och gruva|last=Theander|first=Agge|date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |page=116&ndash;129 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Icehotel-se-04.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|ice hotel in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]]]]\n\nThe Kiruna [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|Icehotel]] has been built in [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]] each winter since 1990 and is a major tourist attraction.<ref name=\"icehotel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icehotel.com/|title=ICEHOTEL|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Moving the town ===\nThe re-development of Kiruna is a reconstruction project, as the Kirunavaara mine, run by [[LKAB]], undermines the current town center.

The city centre is built on the Haukavaara hill at an altitude of 530 m, high above the [[Torne river]] to the north and the [[Kalix river]] to the south. Other parts of the town are Lombolo and Tuolluvaara. Near Kiruna are the mountains [[Kiirunavaara]] and [[Luossavaara]]. Kiirunavaara is an iron ore mine that is the town's primary economic resource. Luossavaara is a former mine and now used as a skiing slope.\n\nThe city is built near the lake [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] with outflow to the Luossajoki that flows in the [[Torne river]] at Laxforsen. The area around Kiruna is very sparsely populated. The northwest, west and southwest of Kiruna are dominated by the [[Scandinavian mountains]], visible from the city centre. Sweden's highest mountain, [[Kebnekaise]], is {{convert|75|km|mi}} from the city centre and can be seen from it as well. To the west is [[Nikkaluokta]] and to the northwest are [[Abisko]], Bj\u00f6rkliden, [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]] and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] town of [[Narvik]], {{convert|180|km}} via the road. {{convert|12|km|mi|0}} north of Kiruna is [[Kurravaara]], on the edge of the [[Torne River]]. The land north of Kurravaara is roadless, uninhabited, partly barren and partly birch forest, up to the Norwegian and [[Finland|Finnish]] borders at [[Treriksr\u00f6set]]. The lower-lying east is dominated by boreal forest, stretching hundreds (if not thousands) of kilometers into Finland and [[Russia]]. Around 15&nbsp;km east of Kiruna is a group of villages at the Torne River, most notably [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]], where an [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|ice hotel]] is built in winter, attracting tourists from all over the world. The twin cities [[G\u00e4llivare]] and [[Malmberget]] are some 120&nbsp;km south of Kiruna.\n\nKiruna became a [[Stad (Sweden)|Swedish city]] on January 1, 1948, and was at one time listed as the largest city in the world by area,<ref>{{Cite web| title=Historien om v\u00e4rldens st\u00f6rsta stad| url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleID=3597686| language=Swedish| publisher=[[Norrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraten]]| accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> even if most of its territory was non-urban. After the Swedish [[municipalities of Sweden|municipality reform]] in the 1970s, the term \"city\" has been legally discontinued. Today only the built-up area is considered a ''[[de facto]]'' city.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeing located 145&nbsp;km (90 miles) north of the [[Arctic Circle]], Kiruna has a [[subarctic climate|subarctic]]  (''Dfc'') climate with short, cool summers and long, cold winters, although the city itself can be considerably milder than the surrounding forest. Snow cover generally lasts from late September to mid-May, but snowfall can occur year-round. The [[midnight sun|sun does not set]] between 28 May and 16 July (50 days), and white nights lasts from early May to early August. [[polar night|The period that the sun does not rise]] lasts from 11 December to 1 January (22 days), the exact boundaries depending on local topography. Even though Kiruna's winters are very cold by Swedish standards, they are still much less severe than winters on similar latitudes in [[North America]] and [[Siberia]], and even more southerly areas in other parts of the world due to some maritime influence. Similar winter temperatures go as far south as below the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] in the [[Russian Far East]]. Kiruna however, has cooler summers than such areas, but still warm enough to stay above polar climate and below the northern [[tree line]]. Winter temperatures however are significantly colder than areas immediately affected by the [[Gulf Stream]] such, where in fact the regular lows of Kiruna during January and February are colder than or similar to [[Troms\u00f8]]'s [[Troms\u00f8#Climate|all-time record low]].\n\nThe coldest confirmed temperature ever in Kiruna was recorded at the nearby weather station with {{convert|-43.3|C|F}} recorded in January 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?91867|title=Temperature and Wind for January 2015 - All Time Records section|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|accessdate=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016183657/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?91867|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The weather station recorded {{convert|31.6|C|F}} in July 1945, which is the all-time record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul14.pdf?715|title=Temperature and Wind for July 2014 - All Time Records section|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|accessdate=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016183657/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul14.pdf?715|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The warmest month on record at the weather station was July 2018, with average high temperatures of {{convert|24.3|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul18.pdf?66120|title=July 2018 Temperature & Wind|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref> Kiruna has a gloomy climate, affected by Atlantic low-pressure systems.

A short road connects to Kurravaara at the Torne river and ends there. Another road connects Kiruna with [[Nikkaluokta]] close to [[Kebnekaise]] and is used by tourists to get to the mountains. It passes by or nearby several villages in the Kalix river valley.\n\nBuses connect Kiruna with major towns in [[Norrbotten]] province and villages nearby and in the wider region. The [[Malmbanan|railway]] connects Lule\u00e5 with G\u00e4llivare, Kiruna and Narvik. Although built to serve the mine, [[SJ AB|Swedish Rail]] runs daily passenger traffic on the line: a night train from Narvik to [[Stockholm]], a day train from Narvik to Lule\u00e5 (connecting with a second night train to Stockholm and [[Gothenburg]]), and trains to Lule\u00e5 and Narvik that start and finish in Kiruna. The latter is known as ''Karven'' and popular for day trips to the mountains near Abisko, Bj\u00f6rkliden and [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]], particularly in winter. Additional long-distance trains are run by [[Transdev]] in summer.\nIn 2013, the railway station was moved 2&nbsp;km away from the city centre, so walking is possible but not recommended. There is a free shuttlebus for every departure and arrival which starts from Kiruna bustation in the city centre.\n\n[[Kiruna Airport]] is southeast of the city, 8&nbsp;km by road. A few daily flights connect Kiruna with Stockholm, either directly or via Lule\u00e5 or [[Ume\u00e5]].

In 1696, Samuel M\u00f6rt, a bookkeeper of the [[Kengis]] works, wrote on rumours about the presence of iron in the two hills.<ref name=Kummu96>Kummu 1997, p. 96.</ref> The ore became better known after it was reported by Mangi, a Sami man, in 1736 to Swedish authorities that had gathered in [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi|Jukkasj\u00e4rvi Church]].<ref name=Kummu96/> Soon after the reported finding Swedish senior enforcement officer and cartographer and mapper [[Anders Hackzell]] mapped the Kiruna area in 1736 and gave the mountains of the area their Swedish language names ''Fredriks berg'' (original Finnish name still in use as well: Kiirunavaara) and ''Berget Ulrika Eleonora'' (original Finnish name still in use as well: Luossavaara), after the King of Sweden [[Frederick I of Sweden|Fredrik I]] and his wife [[Ulrika Eleonora]].<ref name=Kummu96/>\n\nDespite the findings of large amounts of ore, no mining was initiated because of the remote location and the harsh climate. Some ore was extracted in the 19th century. It was extracted in summer and transported in winter, using sleds drawn by [[reindeer]] and [[horse]]s. However, the costs were high and the quality of the [[phosphorus]] ore poor, until, in 1878, the [[Gilchrist-Thomas process]], invented by [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] and [[Percy Gilchrist]], allowed for the separation of phosphorus from the ore.<ref name=\"kirunakommun\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kommun.kiruna.se/Om-kommunen/Allmant-om-kommunen/Historia/|title=Historia \u2013 Kiruna kommun|accessdate=2009-02-09|language=Swedish |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030922/http://www.kommun.kiruna.se/Om-kommunen/Allmant-om-kommunen/Historia/ |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"lkab\">{{cite web|url=http://lkab.com/?openform&id=77DE|title=Press room/History/1696\u20131919@lkab.com|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:IORE Vassijaure.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Iore]]-hauled train passing Vassijaure]]\n\nIn 1884, a concession for a railway from [[Lule\u00e5]] to [[Narvik]] was granted to ''The Northern of Europe Railway Company''. The provisional railway between Lule\u00e5 and [[Malmberget]] was finished in 1888 and the first train left Malmberget in March. Around the same time, the English company went bankrupt and had to sell the line to the Swedish state for 8 million [[Swedish crown]]s, around half the amount initially invested. After a significant rebuild, the railway to G\u00e4llivare could be used again and iron ore was extracted at [[Malmberget]] by Aktiebolaget Gellivare Malmf\u00e4lt (AGM).<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Gruvstaden \u2013 Gruvorna |last=Barck |first=\u00c5ke |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=60\u201374 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAt the initiative of Robert Schoug, the [[LKAB|Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag]] (LKAB) was founded in 1890. In 1893, Gustaf Broms became CEO of both LKAB and AGM. LKAB pressed for continuing [[Malmbanan]] via Luossavaara and Kiirunavaara to the ice-free coast of Norway. The continuation of the railway line to [[Narvik]] was controversial, because opponents feared the influence of [[Russia]] (then controlling [[Finland]] and already connected to Sweden at [[Haparanda]]\u2013[[Tornio]]) on an international railway line.\n[[File:Kiruna stadshus 1.JPG|thumb|right|Kiruna City Hall in summer]]\n\nThe decision to build was finally taken in 1898. The railway came to Kiruna 15 October 1899 and the Swedish and Norwegian sections were joined 15 November 1902. For LKAB, the great expense almost led to bankruptcy in 1901, just after the ore mining at Kiirunavaara had started. [[King Oscar II]] only opened the railway line 14 July 1903, preferring summer over winter to travel north.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100komm\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Komunikationer \u2013 Fr\u00e5n h\u00e4stskuts till e-post |last=Theander |first=Agge |last2=Aidenp\u00e4\u00e4 |first2=Elis |last3=Bergstr\u00f6m  |first3=Rolf  |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=132\u2013147 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nThe architects Per Olof Hallman and Gustaf Wickman were appointed to design the city, to be built at Haukivaara, near both iron ore mines, with then-revolutionary consideration of geographical and climatological circumstances; being built on a hill, winter temperatures are much milder than in other towns, and due to the street plan and the positioning, wind is limited. On 27 April 1900, Hallman's plan was officially accepted.\n\nGustaf Broms proposed to name the settlements ''Kiruna'', a short and practical name that could also be pronounced by Swedish speaking inhabitants. The name means [[rock ptarmigan]] in Lappish and Finnish. LKAB appointed [[Hjalmar Lundbohm]], who had finished neither high school nor his geology studies, as local manager in Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100early\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Kiruna \u2013 Fr\u00e5n \u00f6demark till stad |last=Persson |first=Curt |author2=Jan-Erik Johansson  |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=27&ndash;43 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name=\"kiruna100hl\">{{cite book|title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Kiruna \u2013 Hjalmar Lundbohm |last=Persson |first=Curt |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=50&ndash;57 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name=\"wintercity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wintercities.kiruna.se/nytt/technicaltours.htm|title=Kiruna \u2013 technical visits|accessdate=2009-02-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220084615/http://www.wintercities.kiruna.se/nytt/technicaltours.htm|archivedate=2012-02-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Kiruna befolkningsutveckling 1900\u20132000.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Population development in Kiruna town]]\n[[File:Aurora 3 in Kiruna.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Aurora taken from the suburb of Kiruna]]\n\nBefore the design for the settlement had been accepted, houses were built in a disorganized manner with illegal [[slum]]s similar to those in the other mining town, [[Malmberget]], {{convert|80|km}} south of Kiruna. Also, provisional buildings served as a church, a school, a hospital, a hotel and a police station. However, official residences were built at a high pace, and when the king opened the railway in 1903, all illegal residences and most other provisional buildings had been demolished and replaced. The very first building, ''B:1'', is preserved and can be seen at ''Hjalmar Lundbohmsg\u00e5rden''. In 1899, 18 people were registered as living in soon-to-be Kiruna.\nThis increased to 222 in 1900, 7,438 in 1910 and 12,884 in 1930.\n\nThe residences did not fully keep up with this rapid growth; by 1910, there were 1,877 official rooms and some unrecognised residences, which meant that an average of three to four people lived in a single room; this density decreased steadily during the decades to follow. Kiruna became a municipalsamh\u00e4lle (a community within a municipality) in 1908. This caused unhappiness in local organisations, such as ''Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Arbetaref\u00f6rening'', that had hoped for status as [[k\u00f6ping]], which would have kept more of the mining income inside the locality. In return, the mining company LKAB paid for a hospital, fire station, sewage, roads, a church (opened 1912) and the priest's home.<ref name=\"kirunakommun\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100early\" />\n\n[[File:Church of Kiruna 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kiruna Church]]]]\nIn April 1907, a [[tram]] began operation in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners would no longer have to walk several kilometres through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb a hundred meters up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: ''bergbanan'' ([[funicular]]), ''stadssp\u00e5rv\u00e4gen'' (city tramway) and ''gruvsp\u00e5rv\u00e4gen'' (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of {{convert|8|km}} and was unique due to the [[narrow gauge|1-meter gauge]], double windows and heated wagons. It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the mine, with wagons bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nThe iron ore industry was good in the early 20th century. Before the start of the work, Hjalmar Lundbohm worried whether the Kiruna winter would allow for working outside at all, but despite early research into underground mining, [[mountaintop removal mining]] was the primary method in the early years. Mechanisation was attempted early using [[steam power]]ed excavators, but the cold climate led to considerable difficulties and only when electrical machinery became available in the 1910s, significant mechanisation was achieved. The peak of [[Kiirunavaara]], ''Statsr\u00e5det'', was {{convert|247.7|m}} above [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] until it was spectacularly blown off in 1910.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nA general strike hit Sweden in 1909 and Kiruna was no exception. Hoping for a better future, thousands of people left Kiruna, including a group of 500 inhabitants emigrating to Brazil. Most of them returned, disappointed that life in [[Latin America]] was not what they had hoped it to be, Hjalmar Lundbohm personally lent money for the trip home to some of the emigrants.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], iron ore production dropped to the lowest level in LKAB's history, and when exports increased again, a successful three-month strike in 1920 led to a 20% increase in salaries for the miners. Production dropped to a minimum in 1922 and a three-day work week was introduced, but during the ''fabulous twenties'', it increased to a record nine million tonnes in 1927.<ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nIn 1921, mining started at Kiruna's other hill, [[Luossavaara]]. However, the total amount of ore that could be mined in [[open pit mining]] here was small compared to Kiirunavaara, and LKAB preferred to concentrate resources in one place. Nevertheless, mining here continued until 1974 and later it became a research mine.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /> While 19th-century mining in Kiruna had focused on Loussavaara the large-scale operation of LKAB focused on the Kiruna ore proper because it was both larger and not subject to legal restrictions that mandate Loussavaara ore to be refined in Sweden.<ref name=Hansson2015-212>Hansson 2015, p. 212.</ref>\n\nDuring the first decades of Kiruna's existence, no road connected it to the outside world. The only connection was by railway or, as in the time before the railway, by boat (in summer) via the [[Torne river|Torne]] and [[Kalix river|Kalix]] rivers to [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]] and H\u00e5moj\u00e5kk and then proceed by foot. A road from Kiruna was built to Tuolluvaara in 1901, Poikkij\u00e4rvi in 1909, Alttaj\u00e4rvi in 1913 and connected to [[Svappavaara]] in 1926, from where roads already connected via [[Vittangi]] to [[Pajala]] and via Lappesuando to [[G\u00e4llivare]] and further south.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] led to a 70% drop in ore production, a drop that would turn into a dramatic increase on the eve of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nAlthough some tourists had already started coming to the area in the 19th century, the completion of the railway line truly made tourism possible. Tourists came for the rivers and the mountains, but also geologists and entire classes of students came to see the mine. Additionally, a yearly winter sports festival was started, which attracted people from a wide area. The Sami population was already a tourist attraction in the early days of Kiruna's existence.<ref name=\"kiruna100turism\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Turismen |last=Barck |first=\u00c5ke |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=60\u201374 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{See also|Swedish iron ore during World War II}}\n\nThe municipality of Kiruna shares borders with Norway and Finland and Kiruna is located relatively close to both countries. This led to many soldiers being transported to the area whenever mobilisation was requested; first in September 1939 after the German [[invasion of Poland]], then in November 1939 after the [[Winter War|Russian invasion of Finland]], but in both cases, Swedish soldiers did not engage in any fighting. In March 1940, Churchill requested permission to transport soldiers from Narvik in Norway to Finland via Kiruna and Haparanda in ''[[Operation Catherine]]''. Out of fear that the presence of British soldiers near the Kiruna ore mine would provoke a German attack on Sweden, the request was declined.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=I skuggan av krigen|last=Theander |first=Agge|last2=Roth |first2=Thomas |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=234\u2013250 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]], at least ten soldiers were stationed along every bridge along [[Malmbanan]], to blow up the bridges should the German army invade Sweden. Additionally, foreigners were banned from visiting Kiruna or the iron ore line, and only the [[Sami people|Sami]], military personnel, locals and people working for the government were permitted to travel between Kiruna and Riksgr\u00e4nsen.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nAfter [[Battles of Narvik|the battle]] at [[Bj\u00f8rnfjell, Nordland|Bj\u00f8rnfjell]], 15 April 1940, wounded and fallen Norwegian soldiers were transported to Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nDespite the conditions for [[Sweden during World War II|Swedish neutrality]], rail cars with food, skis and helmets were transported from Kiruna to the Norwegian soldiers in Bj\u00f8rnfjell.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nSwedish iron ore from Kiruna was of major importance to the German war machine. A group of people working at LKAB organised in the Wollweberliga, planning to sabotage transports to Germany. In late November 1941, Edvard Nyberg, [[Ernst Wollweber]] and others produced a mine to be attached to the ore cars. Nyberg was caught, was fired from LKAB and spent 3\u00bd years in prison. Upon his release, he founded ''Nybergs Mekaniska Verkstad'' which is still one of Kiruna's biggest companies.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybergsmek.se/|title=Start - NMV Group|website=NMV Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=4386753|language=Swedish|title=De fick prestigefyllt pris |first=Hans |last=Sternlund|work=Norrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraterna|accessdate=22 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nGermany requested that Sweden provide use of the railway network to transport military equipment, but the Swedish government agreed only to ''transitering av human karakt\u00e4r, men ej underh\u00e5ll till stridande trupp'' (transit of humanitarian character, but no supply of fighting soldiers). Germany argued that, now that Norway was occupied, the German soldiers there were no longer fighting, and thus transported a large amount of military equipment, ammunition and, secretly, troops from southern to northern Norway, via Malmbanan and Kiruna. Troops were often transported in transports declared as material transports. Despite being strictly against the rules, there was considerable interaction between the German soldiers and the Swedish locals, including trading and football matches.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nDuring the war, up to 2000 refugees from 20 countries were kept in Kiruna. German prisoners of war, for example, from crashed airplanes, were kept in Kiruna before being transported south. However, small-scale sabotage, such as sand in the engines, was common and loose weapons often ended up at the bottom of the Luossaj\u00e4rvi lake, next to the railway stop.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nNorth of Tornetr\u00e4sk, at Kaivare, a radio base ''Kari'' was built in secrecy and used by the Norwegian resistance. It was also used for the smuggling of arms to Norway and refugees from Norway.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.internationalen.se/print.php?news.3067|work=Internationalen|title=Sverige, USA, FRA och signalspaning|last=Svensson|first=Anders|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=22 February 2009|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-war ===\n[[File:Kiruna-sentrum.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An old mansion near Kiruna centrum]]\n\nIn 1948, Kiruna gained city rights and started to receive large amounts of money from the mine. The city centre was renovated starting in 1953; most buildings built before 1920 were demolished and replaced, and many of the current buildings were built in the following period. The town grew and new neighborhoods were built, as well as new apartment buildings and villas in existing neighborhoods. The area is currently known as ''Lombolo'' was built in the 1960s.<ref name=\"kiruna100early\" />\n\nAfter World War II, the economy of Kiruna started to diversify. Initially, the mechanisation of the mining industry led to more mechanical workshops developing machinery for the mine, still dependent on the mining, but individual companies with spinoffs that could be sold to other areas than the Kiruna mine alone. In the 1950s, a fund, ''Norrlandsfonden'' was established, in which profits from LKAB would be invested in order to diversify the local economy. The municipality started to lend money to starting companies against very beneficial rates, a scheme that lasted until 1959 because the banks, that insisted this was false competition, had established more relaxed rules for lending out money. The industrial area east of the city was built in the 1950s to separate industry from neighborhoods.<ref name=\"kiruna100aktillit\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Fr\u00e5n AK till IT|last=Nilsson|first=Kjell|date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |page=86&ndash;90 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 November 1960, [[Kiruna Airport]] opened to separate civilian air traffic from the military airplanes that had landed at Kalixfors airport and at [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] since World War I. A road to [[Nikkaluokta]] was opened in 1971 and to [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]] and [[Narvik]] in 1984. The latter had been debated heavily, for alternative plans existed to build the road to Norway on the northern side of [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]], via Laimo, Kattuvuoma, [[Salmi (rural locality)|Salmi]] to Innset and [[Bardu]] in Norway. This road was never built, but a 25&nbsp;km long track between Laimo and Salmi was built at the initiatives of the locals and finished in 1962; however, this track, called Talmav\u00e4gen, is not connected to any other road.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nIncreased communications were also beneficial for tourism. [[Swedish Railways]] had already run special trains before World War II, but started a special Dollar train in the summer months between [[Gothenburg]] and Kiruna, connecting to cruise ships from the [[United States]]. The canoe club Kiruna L\u00e5ngf\u00e4rdspaddlare was founded in 1972 and rafting for tourists restarted after it had been discontinued for 20 years due to the drowning of Valfrid Johansson. Until the 1980s, tourism had been mainly a summer business, but touristic exploitation of dog sledging was started in 1983 in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi. In 1990, the first [[Icehotel]] was built in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi and advertised as the world's largest igloo. It had been built using techniques from the building of [[Malmbanan]] 90 years before and was also inspired by the Snow Festival, that had started in 1986 to celebrate the Swedish [[Viking (satellite)|Viking]] satellite. Since 1998, a special tourist area exists in the mine and since 1999, tourists can visit the various areas of research going on in Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100turism\" />\n\nIn 1957, the ''Kiruna Geophysical Observatory'' (KGO) (now the [[Swedish Institute of Space Physics]]) was founded and established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. [[Esrange]] Space Centre is established in 1966. Here, rocket operations and ground-based observations are carried out since 1966, balloon operations since 1974, satellite operations since 1978 and testing operations since 2000 (with the [[Swedish Defence Material Administration]]). ESA has operated a satellite station at Salmaj\u00e4rvi, near Esrange, since 1989. In 1987, [[Ume\u00e5 University]] started a space engineering program in Kiruna, and [[GIS]] education was started by [[Lule\u00e5 University of Technology]] in 1991. In 1993, The Ume\u00e5 space engineers moved to the same building housing IRF and a year later another Lule\u00e5 University programme, civil engineering with specialisation in space technology, started at the same location. Since 2006, the ''Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Space Science and Technology'' has started with at least one semester spent at LTU. In 2007, education along IRV was split and only the Department of Space Science, belonging to Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, remained, while the Ume\u00e5 University programme in Space Engineering quit.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"irf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irf.se/Overview/?dbfile=About_Kiruna&dbsec=Administration&chosen=overview|title=Overview \u2013 Swedish Institute of Space Physics|accessdate=2009-02-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220183342/http://www.irf.se/Overview/?dbfile=About_Kiruna&dbsec=Administration&chosen=overview|archivedate=2008-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"esrange\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.se/?id=5998|title=Esrange space centre \u2013 history|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref><ref name=\"kiruna100rymd\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Rymd, milj\u00f6 och gruva|last=Theander|first=Agge|date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |page=116&ndash;129 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Icehotel-se-04.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|ice hotel in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]]]]\n\nThe Kiruna [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|Icehotel]] has been built in [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]] each winter since 1990 and is a major tourist attraction.<ref name=\"icehotel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icehotel.com/|title=ICEHOTEL|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Moving the town ===\nThe re-development of Kiruna is a reconstruction project, as the Kirunavaara mine, run by [[LKAB]], undermines the current town center.

The city centre is built on the Haukavaara hill at an altitude of 530 m, high above the [[Torne river]] to the north and the [[Kalix river]] to the south. Other parts of the town are Lombolo and Tuolluvaara. Near Kiruna are the mountains [[Kiirunavaara]] and [[Luossavaara]]. Kiirunavaara is an iron ore mine that is the town's primary economic resource. Luossavaara is a former mine and now used as a skiing slope.\n\nThe city is built near the lake [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] with outflow to the Luossajoki that flows in the [[Torne river]] at Laxforsen. The area around Kiruna is very sparsely populated. The northwest, west and southwest of Kiruna are dominated by the [[Scandinavian mountains]], visible from the city centre. Sweden's highest mountain, [[Kebnekaise]], is {{convert|75|km|mi}} from the city centre and can be seen from it as well. To the west is [[Nikkaluokta]] and to the northwest are [[Abisko]], Bj\u00f6rkliden, [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]] and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] town of [[Narvik]], {{convert|180|km}} via the road. {{convert|12|km|mi|0}} north of Kiruna is [[Kurravaara]], on the edge of the [[Torne River]]. The land north of Kurravaara is roadless, uninhabited, partly barren and partly birch forest, up to the Norwegian and [[Finland|Finnish]] borders at [[Treriksr\u00f6set]]. The lower-lying east is dominated by boreal forest, stretching hundreds (if not thousands) of kilometers into Finland and [[Russia]]. Around 15&nbsp;km east of Kiruna is a group of villages at the Torne River, most notably [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]], where an [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|ice hotel]] is built in winter, attracting tourists from all over the world. The twin cities [[G\u00e4llivare]] and [[Malmberget]] are some 120&nbsp;km south of Kiruna.\n\nKiruna became a [[Stad (Sweden)|Swedish city]] on January 1, 1948, and was at one time listed as the largest city in the world by area,<ref>{{Cite web| title=Historien om v\u00e4rldens st\u00f6rsta stad| url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleID=3597686| language=Swedish| publisher=[[Norrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraten]]| accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> even if most of its territory was non-urban. After the Swedish [[municipalities of Sweden|municipality reform]] in the 1970s, the term \"city\" has been legally discontinued. Today only the built-up area is considered a ''[[de facto]]'' city.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeing located 145&nbsp;km (90 miles) north of the [[Arctic Circle]], Kiruna has a [[subarctic climate|subarctic]]  (''Dfc'') climate with short, cool summers and long, cold winters, although the city itself can be considerably milder than the surrounding forest. Snow cover generally lasts from late September to mid-May, but snowfall can occur year-round. The [[midnight sun|sun does not set]] between 28 May and 16 July (50 days), and white nights lasts from early May to early August. [[polar night|The period that the sun does not rise]] lasts from 11 December to 1 January (22 days), the exact boundaries depending on local topography. Even though Kiruna's winters are very cold by Swedish standards, they are still much less severe than winters on similar latitudes in [[North America]] and [[Siberia]], and even more southerly areas in other parts of the world due to some maritime influence. Similar winter temperatures go as far south as below the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] in the [[Russian Far East]]. Kiruna however, has cooler summers than such areas, but still warm enough to stay above polar climate and below the northern [[tree line]]. Winter temperatures however are significantly colder than areas immediately affected by the [[Gulf Stream]] such, where in fact the regular lows of Kiruna during January and February are colder than or similar to [[Troms\u00f8]]'s [[Troms\u00f8#Climate|all-time record low]].\n\nThe coldest confirmed temperature ever in Kiruna was recorded at the nearby weather station with {{convert|-43.3|C|F}} recorded in January 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?91867|title=Temperature and Wind for January 2015 - All Time Records section|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|accessdate=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016183657/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?91867|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The weather station recorded {{convert|31.6|C|F}} in July 1945, which is the all-time record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul14.pdf?715|title=Temperature and Wind for July 2014 - All Time Records section|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|accessdate=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016183657/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul14.pdf?715|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The warmest month on record at the weather station was July 2018, with average high temperatures of {{convert|24.3|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul18.pdf?66120|title=July 2018 Temperature & Wind|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref> Kiruna has a gloomy climate, affected by Atlantic low-pressure systems.

Although built to serve the mine, [[SJ AB|Swedish Rail]] runs daily passenger traffic on the line: a night train from Narvik to [[Stockholm]], a day train from Narvik to Lule\u00e5 (connecting with a second night train to Stockholm and [[Gothenburg]]), and trains to Lule\u00e5 and Narvik that start and finish in Kiruna. The latter is known as ''Karven'' and popular for day trips to the mountains near Abisko, Bj\u00f6rkliden and [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]], particularly in winter. Additional long-distance trains are run by [[Transdev]] in summer.\nIn 2013, the railway station was moved 2&nbsp;km away from the city centre, so walking is possible but not recommended. There is a free shuttlebus for every departure and arrival which starts from Kiruna bustation in the city centre.\n\n[[Kiruna Airport]] is southeast of the city, 8&nbsp;km by road. A few daily flights connect Kiruna with Stockholm, either directly or via Lule\u00e5 or [[Ume\u00e5]]. An airport bus is available for most Stockholm-Arlanda flights and starting from end of August 2015 the airport bus will be available for all flights to/from Stockholm-Arlanda.
