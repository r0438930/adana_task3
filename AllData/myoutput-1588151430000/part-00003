The '''wolf''' (''Canis lupus''),<!-- This article uses \"wolf\" rather than \"grey wolf\" or \"gray wolf\" throughout; see the discussion at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wolf/Archive_6#Requested_move_2_August_2018 --> also known as the '''gray wolf''' or '''grey wolf''', is a large [[Canis|canine]] native to [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. It is the largest [[Neontology|extant]] member of [[Canidae]], males averaging {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|37|kg|abbr=on}}. On average, wolves measure {{convert|105|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|80|\u2013|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other ''[[Canis]]'' species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller ''Canis'' species, such as the [[coyote]] and the [[golden jackal]], to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrid]]s with them. The [[Agouti (coloration)|banded]] fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of wolf]] have been recognized including the [[Dog|domestic dog]].\n\nOf all members of the [[genus]] ''Canis'', the wolf is most [[Generalist and specialist species|specialized]] for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more [[Sociality|social nature]], and its highly advanced [[Wolf communication|expressive behaviour]]. It travels in [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a [[carnivore]] and feeds primarily on large wild [[hooved mammal]]s, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, [[carrion]], and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. [[Pathogen]]s and parasites, notably [[rabies]], may infect wolves.\n\nThe global wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. [[Wolf attack]]s on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Wolf (name)}}\nThe English \"wolf\" stems from the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|wulf}}, which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wulfaz}}.

Examples include Wulfhere (\"Wolf Army\", or \"He whose army is the wolf\"), Cynewulf (\"Royal Wolf\"), C\u0113nwulf (\"Bold Wolf\"), Wulfheard (\"Wolf-hard\"), Earnwulf (\"Eagle Wolf\"), Wulfst\u0101n (\"Wolf Stone\") \u00c6\u00f0elwulf (\"Noble Wolf\"), Wolfhroc (\"Wolf-Frock\"), Wolfhetan (\"Wolf Hide\"), Isangrim (\"Gray Mask\"), Scrutolf (\"Garb Wolf\"), Wolfgang (\"Wolf Gait\") and Wolfdregil (\"Wolf Runner\").{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{cladogram|title=Canine phylogeny with ages of divergence\n|caption=Cladogram and divergence of the gray wolf (including the domestic dog) among its closest extant relatives<ref name=Koepfli-2015/>\n|cladogram={{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:75%;width:600px;\n|sublabel1=''3.50 [[Million years ago|mya]]''<!--E-->\n|1={{clade\n   |sublabel1=''3.06 mya''<!--F-->\n   |1={{clade\n      |sublabel1=''2.74 mya''<!--G-->\n      |1={{clade\n         |sublabel1=''1.92 mya''<!--H-->\n         |1={{clade\n            |sublabel1=''1.62 mya''<!--I-->\n            |1={{clade\n               |sublabel1=''1.32 mya''<!--J-->\n               |1={{clade\n                  |sublabel1=''1.10 mya''<!--K-->\n                  |1={{clade\n                     |1='''Gray wolf''' [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n                     |2=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).png|50 px]]\n                     }}\n                  |2=[[African golden wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n                  }}\n               |2=[[Ethiopian wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate VI).png|50 px]]\n               }}\n            |2=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).png|50 px]]\n            }}\n         |2=[[Dhole]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLI).png|50 px]]\n         }}\n      |2=[[African wild dog]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLIV).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   |sublabel2=''2.62 mya''<!--D-->\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Side-striped jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XIII).png|50 px]]\n      |2=[[Black-backed jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XII).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\nIn 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] published in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' the [[binomial nomenclature]].<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> ''[[Canis]]'' is the Latin word meaning \"[[dog]]\",<ref>{{OEtymD|canine}}</ref> and under this [[genus]] he listed the doglike carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and [[jackal]]s. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', and the wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its ''cauda recurvata''\u2013its upturning tail\u2013which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995/>\n\n===Subspecies===\n{{Main|Subspecies of Canis lupus}}\nIn the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the [[mammalogist]] [[W. Chris Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under ''C. lupus'' 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: ''familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and ''[[dingo]]'' (Meyer, 1793). Wozencraft included ''hallstromi''\u2013the [[New Guinea singing dog]]\u2013as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to a 1999 [[mitochondrial DNA]] study as one of the guides in forming his decision, and listed the 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of ''C. lupus'']] under the biological [[common name]] of \"wolf\", the [[nominate subspecies]] being the [[Eurasian wolf]] (''C. l. lupus'') based on the [[type specimen]] that Linnaeus studied in Sweden.<ref name=Wozencraft2005/> Studies using [[Paleogenomics|paleogenomic]] techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are [[sister taxa]], as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first [[Domestication|domesticated]].<ref name=Larson2014/> In 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n=== Evolution ===\n{{Main|Evolution of the wolf}}\n{{Further|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|alt=Skull of ''Canis etruscus'' |A ''[[Canis etruscus]]'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum]]\nThe [[phylogenetic]] descent of the extant wolf ''C. lupus'' from ''[[Canis etruscus|C. etruscus]]'' through ''[[Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' is widely accepted.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=239\u2013245}} The earliest fossils of ''C. lupus'' were found in what was once eastern [[Beringia]] at [[Old Crow, Yukon]], Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, [[Fairbanks]], Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the [[Late Pleistocene]]. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]], a pronounced development of the [[temporalis]] muscle, and robust [[premolar]]s. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct [[dire wolf]]. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern [[spotted hyena]], the frequency and location of tooth fractures found in these wolves indicates that they were habitual bone crackers.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[Genome|Genomic]] studies suggest that modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=Freedman2014/><ref name=Skoglund2015/><ref name=Fan2016/> that existed 20,000 years ago.<ref name=Freedman2014/> Studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] is part of a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to other wolves and [[Cladogenesis|split]] from them 691,000\u2013740,000 years ago.<ref name=Werhahn2017/><ref name=Werhahn2018/> Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes that occurred during the close of the Late Pleistocene.<ref name=Werhahn2018/> A study in 2016 indicates that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.<ref name=Koblmuller2016/>\n\nA 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100\u201312,300 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/> An extinct [[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]] may have been the ancestor of the dog,<ref name=Freedman2017/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of [[genetic admixture]] between the two.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> The dingo, [[Basenji]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves, the [[Mexican wolf]] diverged around 5,400 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/>\n\n===Admixture with other canids===\n{{Main|Canid hybrid}}\n[[File:F1 wolf-dog hybrids from Wildlife Park Kadzidlowo, Poland.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Photographs of two wolf-dog hybrids standing outdoors on snowy ground|[[Wolfdog|Wolf-dog hybrid]]s in the Wild Animal Park at [[Kadzid\u0142owo]], Poland. The first is the product of a male wolf and a female [[spaniel]], the second from a female wolf and a male [[West Siberian Laika]].]]\n\nIn the distant past, there has been [[gene flow]] between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackal]]s, and gray wolves. The African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows admixture with Middle Eastern wolves and dogs.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. This indicates that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nThe common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid. This canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and evolved after the divergence of the [[African hunting dog]] from the other canid species. The basal position of the [[coyote]] compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> Similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern China collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12\u201314% admixed from this unknown canid.<ref name=Wang2019/> In North America, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture. The [[red wolf]] of the [[southeastern United States]] is a hybrid animal with 40%:60% wolf to coyote ancestry. In addition, there was found to be 60%:40% wolf to coyote genetics in [[Eastern wolf|Eastern timber wolves]], and 75%:25% in the [[Great Lakes region]] wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nIn more recent times, some male [[Italian wolf|Italian wolves]] originated from dog ancestry, which indicates that female wolves will breed with male dogs in the wild.<ref name=Iacolina2010/> In the [[Caucasus Mountains]], 10% of dogs including [[livestock guardian dog]]s, are first generation hybrids.<ref name=Kopaliani2014/> Although mating between golden jackals and wolves has never been observed, evidence of [[jackal-wolf hybrid]]ization was discovered through mitochondrial DNA analysis of jackals living in the Caucasus Mountains<ref name=Kopaliani2014/> and in Bulgaria.<ref name=Moura2013/>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Canis lupus laying.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a reclining North American wolf looking directly at the photographer |A North American wolf]]\nThe wolf is the largest member of the [[Canidae]] family,<ref name=Mech1974/> and is further distinguished from coyotes and jackals by a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=129\u2013132}}<ref name=Mech1974/> It is slender and powerfully built with a large, deeply descending [[rib cage]], a sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=166}} The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=13}} The ears are relatively small and triangular.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=166}} The wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The skull averages {{convert|230|\u2013|280|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|130|\u2013|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} in width.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=14}} The teeth are heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids.

Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs, like the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lung]]s, and [[stomach]] lining. The [[kidney]]s and [[spleen]] are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=122\u2013125}} A wolf can eat 15\u201319% of its body weight in a single feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=201}}\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Viral and bacterial ===\n[[File:Arctic-Lineage-Canine-Distemper-Virus-as-a-Cause-of-Death-in-Apennine-Wolves-(Canis-lupus)-in-Italy-pone.0082356.s001.ogv|thumb|alt=Footage of a wolf with advanced canine distemper|Footage of a wolf taken from [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo Natural Park]] showing advanced signs of [[canine distemper]]]]\n\n[[Viral disease]]s carried by wolves include: [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[papillomatosis]], and [[canine coronavirus]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}} Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, Iran, [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and India.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} In wolves, the [[incubation period]] is eight to 21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[Endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, infections being most prevalent in winter months.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}}\n\n[[Bacterial diseases]] carried by wolves include: [[brucellosis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[leptospirosis]], [[tularemia]], [[bovine tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}} [[listeriosis]] and [[anthrax]].{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Wolves can catch ''[[Brucella suis]]'' from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from [[lagomorph]] prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in Canada.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Parasitic ===\n[[File:Wild Wolf Afflicted with Mange.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a wolf afflicted with sarcoptuc mange eating at a kill|A wolf in the Yellowstone National Park afflicted with [[sarcoptic mange]]]]\n\nWolves carry [[ectoparasite]]s and [[endoparasite]]s; those in the former [[Soviet Union]] have been recorded to carry at least 50 species.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} [[Parasitic infection]] in wolves is of particular concern to people. Wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nWolves are often infested with a variety of [[arthropod]] exoparasites, including [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[Louse|lice]], and [[mite]]s. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is the mange mite (''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''),{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} though they rarely develop full-blown [[mange]], unlike foxes.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Lice, such as ''[[Trichodectes canis]]'', may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' can infect wolves with Lyme disease and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} The tick ''[[Dermacentor]] pictus'' also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include [[Mallophaga|chewing lice]], [[Sucking louse|sucking lice]] and the fleas ''[[Pulex irritans]]'' and ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]''.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}}\n\nEndoparasites known to infect wolves include: [[protozoan]]s and [[helminth]]s ([[Trematoda|flukes]], [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s and [[thorny-headed worm]]s). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} Some wolves carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=Dubey2011/> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\nWolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}}. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''[[Nicolla skrjabini]]'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{Further|List of gray wolf populations by country}}\nThe global wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=230}} Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s. This has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection, changes in land use, and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf. Despite these threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] classifies the wolf as [[Least Concern]] on its [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] due to its relatively widespread range and stable population.

As well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programs or state insurance.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=309}} Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have been bred under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=173}} Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted. In Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidents are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}\n\nThe majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=307}} The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), [[Reindeer herding|domestic reindeer]] (northern Scandinavia), [[goat]]s (India), [[horse]]s (Mongolia), [[cattle]] and [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]] (North America).{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=306}} Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.{{sfn|Graves|2007|p=45}}\n\n==== Conflicts with dogs ====\nA review of the studies on the competitive effects of dogs on [[Sympatry|sympatric]] carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.<ref name=Vanak2014/><ref name=Lescureaux2014 /> Competition would favour the wolf, which is known to kill dogs; however wolves usually live in pairs or in small packs in areas with high human persecution, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Boitani1983/>\n\nWolves kill dogs on occasion, and some wolf populations rely on dogs as an important food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}<ref name=\"Jess\" /> The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are [[Harrier (dog)|Harrier]]s, older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as [[J\u00e4mthund|Swedish Elkhound]]s are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.<ref name=\"Jess\" />\n\nAlthough the numbers of dogs killed each year by wolves are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to prey on dogs. In many cultures, there are strong bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses, with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\nDogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human\u2013wolf conflicts, and are often proposed as one of the non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Shivik2006/> Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviours, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation,<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Coppinger1995 /> especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock guardian dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Espuno2004/> Shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\n==== Wolf attacks on humans ====\n{{Main|Wolf attack|List of wolf attacks}}\n[[File:Grenier Saint Martin loup MdlaC.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a wolf snarling at three children entitled ''Country children surprised by a wolf''  by Fran\u00e7ois Grenier de Saint-Martin|''Country children surprised by a wolf'' (1833) by Fran\u00e7ois Grenier de Saint-Martin]]\nThe fear of wolves has been pervasive in many societies, though humans are not part of the wolf's natural prey.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> How wolves react to humans depends largely on their prior experience with people: wolves lacking any negative experience of humans, or which are food-conditioned, may show little fear of people.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=300\u2013304}} Although wolves may react aggressively when provoked, such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities, and the attacks are not pressed.<ref name=\"Linnell\"/>\n\nPredatory attacks may be preceded by a long period of [[habituation]], in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans. The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June\u2013August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock [[grazing]] or berry and mushroom picking) increase.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in [[Belarus]], [[Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] oblasts, [[Karelia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called \"child-lifting\". They may be taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements.<ref name=\"Rajpurohit1999\"/>\n\nCases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the \"furious\" phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Bites from rabid wolves are 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=267}} Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. The victims are chosen at random, though most cases involve adult men. During the 50 years to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, and more than 200 in southern Asia.<ref name=\"Linnell\" />\n\n==== Human hunting of wolves ====\n{{Main|Wolf hunting|Wolf hunting with dogs}}\n{{See also|Wolf hunting#Quarry|l1=Human uses of hunted wolves}}\n[[File:Provedenie meropriyatii po otstrelu vrednyh givotnyh na territorii Kamyshinskogo raiona Volgogradskoi oblasti.jpg|thumb|alt=Two men with guns pose behind nine carcasses of hunted wolves|Carcasses of hunted wolves in [[Volgograd Oblast]], Russia]]\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] stated that wolves are difficult to hunt because of their elusiveness, sharp senses, high endurance, and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill hunting dogs.<ref name=\"Roosevelt\"/> Historic methods included killing of spring-born litters in their dens, [[coursing]] with dogs (usually combinations of [[sighthound]]s, [[Bloodhound]]s and [[Fox Terrier]]s), poisoning with [[strychnine]], and [[trapping]].{{sfn|Lopez|1978|p=108}}{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}}\n\nA popular method of wolf hunting in Russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with [[fladry]] poles carrying a human scent. This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor. Some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls. In [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practice is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}} Several types of dog, including the Borzoi and [[Taigan|Kyrgyz Tajgan]], have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.<ref name=Lescureaux2014/>\n\n=== As pets and working animals ===\n{{Main|Wolves as pets and working animals}}\nWolves and [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s are sometimes kept as [[exotic pet]]s. Although closely related to domestic dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, being generally less responsive to human commands and more likely to act aggressively. A person is more likely to be fatally mauled by a pet wolf or wolf-dog hybrid than by a dog.<ref name=\"Tucker1998\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Alaska2019>{{cite web|url=https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wolfhunting.main|title=Wolf Hunting in Alaska|last1=State of Alaska|date=29 October 2019|website=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|access-date=2019-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930014610/https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wolfhunting.main|archive-date=30 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Alvares2019>{{cite web |first1=Francisco|last1=Alvares|first2=Wieslaw|last2=Bogdanowicz|first3=Liz A.D.|last3=Campbell|first4=Rachel|last4=Godinho|first5=Jennifer|last5=Hatlauf|first6=Yadvendradev V.|last6=Jhala|first7=Andrew C.|last7=Kitchener|first8=Klaus-Peter|last8=Koepfli|first9=Miha|last9=Krofel|first10=Patricia D.|last10=Moehlman|first11=Helen|last11=Senn |first12=Claudio|last12=Sillero-Zubiri|first13=Suvi|last13=Viranta|first14=Geraldine|last14=Werhahn|year=2019|website=IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group|url=https://www.canids.org/CBC/Old_World_Canis_Taxonomy_Workshop.pdf|title=Old World Canis spp. with taxonomic ambiguity: Workshop conclusions and recommendations.

It is the largest [[Neontology|extant]] member of [[Canidae]], males averaging {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|37|kg|abbr=on}}. On average, wolves measure {{convert|105|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|80|\u2013|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other ''[[Canis]]'' species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller ''Canis'' species, such as the [[coyote]] and the [[golden jackal]], to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrid]]s with them. The [[Agouti (coloration)|banded]] fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of wolf]] have been recognized including the [[Dog|domestic dog]].\n\nOf all members of the [[genus]] ''Canis'', the wolf is most [[Generalist and specialist species|specialized]] for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more [[Sociality|social nature]], and its highly advanced [[Wolf communication|expressive behaviour]]. It travels in [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a [[carnivore]] and feeds primarily on large wild [[hooved mammal]]s, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, [[carrion]], and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. [[Pathogen]]s and parasites, notably [[rabies]], may infect wolves.\n\nThe global wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. [[Wolf attack]]s on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Wolf (name)}}\nThe English \"wolf\" stems from the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|wulf}}, which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wulfaz}}. The [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''{{PIE|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os|w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os]]}}'' may also be the source of the [[Latin]] word for the animal ''lupus'' (*''{{PIE|l\u00fak\u02b7os}}'').<ref>{{OEtymD|wolf}}</ref><ref name=Lehrman/> The name \"gray wolf\" refers to the grayish colour of the species.<ref name=Goldman/>\n\nSince pre-Christian times, [[Germanic peoples]] such as the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s took on ''wulf'' as a [[prefix]] or [[suffix]] in their names. Examples include Wulfhere (\"Wolf Army\", or \"He whose army is the wolf\"), Cynewulf (\"Royal Wolf\"), C\u0113nwulf (\"Bold Wolf\"), Wulfheard (\"Wolf-hard\"), Earnwulf (\"Eagle Wolf\"), Wulfst\u0101n (\"Wolf Stone\") \u00c6\u00f0elwulf (\"Noble Wolf\"), Wolfhroc (\"Wolf-Frock\"), Wolfhetan (\"Wolf Hide\"), Isangrim (\"Gray Mask\"), Scrutolf (\"Garb Wolf\"), Wolfgang (\"Wolf Gait\") and Wolfdregil (\"Wolf Runner\").{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{cladogram|title=Canine phylogeny with ages of divergence\n|caption=Cladogram and divergence of the gray wolf (including the domestic dog) among its closest extant relatives<ref name=Koepfli-2015/>\n|cladogram={{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:75%;width:600px;\n|sublabel1=''3.50 [[Million years ago|mya]]''<!--E-->\n|1={{clade\n   |sublabel1=''3.06 mya''<!--F-->\n   |1={{clade\n      |sublabel1=''2.74 mya''<!--G-->\n      |1={{clade\n         |sublabel1=''1.92 mya''<!--H-->\n         |1={{clade\n            |sublabel1=''1.62 mya''<!--I-->\n            |1={{clade\n               |sublabel1=''1.32 mya''<!--J-->\n               |1={{clade\n                  |sublabel1=''1.10 mya''<!--K-->\n                  |1={{clade\n                     |1='''Gray wolf''' [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n                     |2=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).png|50 px]]\n                     }}\n                  |2=[[African golden wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n                  }}\n               |2=[[Ethiopian wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate VI).png|50 px]]\n               }}\n            |2=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).png|50 px]]\n            }}\n         |2=[[Dhole]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLI).png|50 px]]\n         }}\n      |2=[[African wild dog]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLIV).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   |sublabel2=''2.62 mya''<!--D-->\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Side-striped jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XIII).png|50 px]]\n      |2=[[Black-backed jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XII).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\nIn 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] published in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' the [[binomial nomenclature]].<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> ''[[Canis]]'' is the Latin word meaning \"[[dog]]\",<ref>{{OEtymD|canine}}</ref> and under this [[genus]] he listed the doglike carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and [[jackal]]s. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', and the wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its ''cauda recurvata''\u2013its upturning tail\u2013which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995/>\n\n===Subspecies===\n{{Main|Subspecies of Canis lupus}}\nIn the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the [[mammalogist]] [[W. Chris Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under ''C. lupus'' 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: ''familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and ''[[dingo]]'' (Meyer, 1793). Wozencraft included ''hallstromi''\u2013the [[New Guinea singing dog]]\u2013as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to a 1999 [[mitochondrial DNA]] study as one of the guides in forming his decision, and listed the 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of ''C. lupus'']] under the biological [[common name]] of \"wolf\", the [[nominate subspecies]] being the [[Eurasian wolf]] (''C. l. lupus'') based on the [[type specimen]] that Linnaeus studied in Sweden.<ref name=Wozencraft2005/> Studies using [[Paleogenomics|paleogenomic]] techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are [[sister taxa]], as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first [[Domestication|domesticated]].<ref name=Larson2014/> In 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n=== Evolution ===\n{{Main|Evolution of the wolf}}\n{{Further|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|alt=Skull of ''Canis etruscus'' |A ''[[Canis etruscus]]'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum]]\nThe [[phylogenetic]] descent of the extant wolf ''C. lupus'' from ''[[Canis etruscus|C. etruscus]]'' through ''[[Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' is widely accepted.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=239\u2013245}} The earliest fossils of ''C. lupus'' were found in what was once eastern [[Beringia]] at [[Old Crow, Yukon]], Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, [[Fairbanks]], Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the [[Late Pleistocene]]. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]], a pronounced development of the [[temporalis]] muscle, and robust [[premolar]]s. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct [[dire wolf]]. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern [[spotted hyena]], the frequency and location of tooth fractures found in these wolves indicates that they were habitual bone crackers.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[Genome|Genomic]] studies suggest that modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=Freedman2014/><ref name=Skoglund2015/><ref name=Fan2016/> that existed 20,000 years ago.<ref name=Freedman2014/> Studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] is part of a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to other wolves and [[Cladogenesis|split]] from them 691,000\u2013740,000 years ago.<ref name=Werhahn2017/><ref name=Werhahn2018/> Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes that occurred during the close of the Late Pleistocene.<ref name=Werhahn2018/> A study in 2016 indicates that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.<ref name=Koblmuller2016/>\n\nA 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100\u201312,300 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/> An extinct [[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]] may have been the ancestor of the dog,<ref name=Freedman2017/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of [[genetic admixture]] between the two.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> The dingo, [[Basenji]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves, the [[Mexican wolf]] diverged around 5,400 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/>\n\n===Admixture with other canids===\n{{Main|Canid hybrid}}\n[[File:F1 wolf-dog hybrids from Wildlife Park Kadzidlowo, Poland.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Photographs of two wolf-dog hybrids standing outdoors on snowy ground|[[Wolfdog|Wolf-dog hybrid]]s in the Wild Animal Park at [[Kadzid\u0142owo]], Poland. The first is the product of a male wolf and a female [[spaniel]], the second from a female wolf and a male [[West Siberian Laika]].]]\n\nIn the distant past, there has been [[gene flow]] between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackal]]s, and gray wolves. The African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows admixture with Middle Eastern wolves and dogs.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. This indicates that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nThe common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid. This canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and evolved after the divergence of the [[African hunting dog]] from the other canid species. The basal position of the [[coyote]] compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> Similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern China collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12\u201314% admixed from this unknown canid.<ref name=Wang2019/> In North America, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture.

Though they mostly avoid areas within human sight, wolves have been known to nest near [[Architecture|domiciles]], paved [[road]]s and [[railway]]s.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=234\u2013238}} During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are less likely to occur.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=42\u201346}}\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 62\u201375 days with pups usually being born in the spring months or early summer in very cold places such as on the tundra. Young females give birth to four to five young, and older females from six to eight young and up to 14. Their mortality rate is 60\u201380%.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=249\u2013254}} Newborn wolf pups look similar to [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dog]] pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=47}} They are born blind and deaf and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur. They weigh {{convert|300|\u2013|500|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth and begin to see after nine to 12 days. The milk canines erupt after one month. Pups first leave the den after three weeks. At one-and-a-half months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young. Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of three to four weeks. They have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period, a pup's weight can increase nearly 30 times.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=249\u2013254}}{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=46\u201349}} Wolf pups begin play-fighting at the age of three weeks, though unlike young coyotes and foxes, their bites are gentle and controlled. Actual fights to establish hierarchy usually occur at five to eight weeks of age. This is in contrast to young coyotes and foxes, which may begin fighting even before the onset of play behaviour.<ref name=Fox1978/> By autumn, the pups are mature enough to accompany the adults on hunts for large prey.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=42\u201346}}\n\n===Hunting===\nSingle wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs; single wolves have occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose, bison and [[muskox]]en unaided.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}}<ref name=Thurber1993/> This contrasts with the commonly held belief that larger packs benefit from cooperative hunting to bring down large game.<ref name=Thurber1993/> The size of a wolf hunting pack is related to the number of pups that survived the previous winter, adult survival, and the rate of dispersing wolves leaving the pack. The optimal pack size for hunting elk is four wolves, and for bison a large pack size is more successful.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nAs well as their physical adaptations for hunting hoofed mammals, wolves possess certain behavioural, cognitive, and psychological adaptations to assist with their hunting lifestyle. Wolves are excellent learners that match or outperform domestic dogs. They can use gaze to focus attention on where other wolves are looking. This is important because wolves do not use vocalization when hunting. In laboratory tests they appear to exhibit insight, foresight, understanding, and the ability to plan. {{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} To survive, wolves must be able to solve two problems\u2014finding a prey animal, then confronting it.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Tracking====\n[[File:Indian Wolf Photo Dhaval Vargiya.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a wolf trotting across an arid terrain|An Indian wolf trotting at [[Blackbuck National Park]]]]\n\nWolves move around their territory when hunting, using the same trails for extended periods. After snowfalls, wolves find their old trails and continue using them. These follow the banks of rivers, the shorelines of lakes, through ravines overgrown with shrubs, through plantations, or roads and human paths.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=233}} Wolves are nocturnal predators. During the winter, a pack will commence hunting in the twilight of early evening and will hunt all night, traveling tens of kilometers. Sometimes hunting large prey occurs during the day. During the summer, wolves generally tend to hunt individually, ambushing their prey and rarely giving pursuit.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=240}}\n\nThe wolf usually travels at a loping pace, placing one of its paws directly in front of the other. This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of {{convert|8|\u2013|9|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=32}} On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of {{convert|50|-|60|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The wolf has a running gait of {{convert|55|-|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, can leap {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes.<ref name=Nowak1983/> A wolf's foot is large and flexible, which allows it to tread on a wide variety of terrain. A wolf's legs are long compared to their body size allowing them to travel up to {{cvt|76|km|mi}} in 12 hours. This adaptation allows wolves to locate prey within hours, but it can take days to find prey that can be killed without great risk. Moose and deer live singly in the summer. Caribou live in herds of thousands which presents dangers for wolves. Elk live in small herds and these are a safer target.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nWolves carry their heads at the same level as their back, raising it only when alert.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} In one study, wolves detected moose using scent 10 times, vision six times, and once by following tracks in the snow. Their vision is as good as that of humans, and they can smell prey at least {{convert|2.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. One wolf travelled to a herd {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. A human can detect the smell of a forest fire over the same distance if it is downwind. The wolf's sense of smell is at least comparable to that of the domestic dog. Both have a sense of smell at least 10,000 times more sensitive than that of humans.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Pursuit====\n[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of an American bison standing its ground surrounded by six wolves in winter|An [[American bison]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] standing its ground. Bison, elk, and moose will usually stand their ground against a pack of wolves.]]\nWhen hunting large gregarious prey, wolves will try to isolate an individual from its group.<ref name=MacNulty2007/> If successful, a wolf pack can bring down game that will feed it for days, but one error in judgement can lead to serious injury or death. Most large prey have developed defensive adaptations and behaviours. Wolves have been killed while attempting to bring down [[bison]], elk, moose, muskoxen, and even by one of their smallest hoofed prey, the white-tailed deer.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} Although people often believe that wolves can easily overcome any of their prey, their success rate in hunting hoofed prey is usually low.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=7}}\n\nGenerally, bison, elk, and moose will stand their ground, then the wolves must struggle with them to bring them down. Often caribou and deer will flee, but sometimes deer also make a stand. With smaller prey like [[beaver]], geese, and hares, there is no risk to the wolf.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} If the targeted animal stands its ground, wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.{{snf|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}} Wolves, or even a wolf on its own, will attempt to frighten a herd into panicking and dispersing.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nWhen wolves encounter prey that flees, they give chase. The speed of sprinting prey is closely related to the speed of their main predators. Wolves can run at {{convert|56|-|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} across several kilometers and will often pursue prey for at least {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}. One wolf chased a caribou for {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, another chased and tracked a deer for {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and one 11-year-old wolf chased and caught an [[Arctic hare]] after seven minutes. Most wolf prey will try to run to water, where they will either escape or be better placed to attempt to ward off the wolves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Disablement====\nThe wolf must give chase and gain on its fleeing prey, slow it down by biting through thick hair and hide, and then disable it enough to begin feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} After chasing and then confronting a large prey animal, the wolf makes use of its {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} fangs and its powerful [[masseter muscle]]s to deliver a [[Bite force quotient|bite force]] of {{convert|28|kg/cm2|lb/in2|abbr=on}}, which is capable of breaking open the skulls of many of its prey animals. The wolf leaps at its quarry and tears at it. One wolf was observed being dragged for dozens of metres attached to the hind leg of a moose; another was seen being dragged over a fallen log while attached to a bull elk's nose.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe most common point of wolf attacks on moose is the upper hind legs.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=28\u201345}}<ref name=Peterson2007/><ref name=Buskirk1978/> Hind leg wounds are inflicted from the rear, midway up the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]] with the canine teeth. These leave gaping skin perforations over {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Although blood loss, muscle damage, and tendon exposure may occur, there is no evidence of [[hamstringing]]. Attacks also occur on the fleshy nose, the back and sides of the neck, the ears, and the [[perineum]].<ref name=Buskirk1978/> Wolves may wound large prey and then lie around resting for hours before killing it when it is weaker due to blood loss, thereby lessening the risk of injury to themselves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=82\u201389}}\n[[File:Wolves eating deer.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of two wolves eating a deer carcass at night|Two wolves feeding on a [[white-tailed deer]] kill]]\nWith medium-sized prey, such as roe deer or [[sheep]], wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the [[carotid artery]], thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute. With small, [[mouse]]like prey, wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws.<ref name=Zimen/> When prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally [[Surplus killing|surplus kill]]. Such instances are common with domestic animals, but rare with wild prey. In the wild, surplus killing occurs primarily during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey){{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=144}} or during the denning period, when den bound wolves require a ready supply of meat.{{sfn|Lopez|1978|pp=54\u201355}} Medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method allows wolves to kill one animal quickly and move on to another.<ref name=Zimen/>\n\n====Feeding====\nOnce prey is brought down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=185}} The breeding pair typically monopolizes food to continue producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially non-pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=58}} The breeding pair typically eats first. They usually work the hardest at killing prey, and may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat undisturbed. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transports them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs, like the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lung]]s, and [[stomach]] lining. The [[kidney]]s and [[spleen]] are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=122\u2013125}} A wolf can eat 15\u201319% of its body weight in a single feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=201}}\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Viral and bacterial ===\n[[File:Arctic-Lineage-Canine-Distemper-Virus-as-a-Cause-of-Death-in-Apennine-Wolves-(Canis-lupus)-in-Italy-pone.0082356.s001.ogv|thumb|alt=Footage of a wolf with advanced canine distemper|Footage of a wolf taken from [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo Natural Park]] showing advanced signs of [[canine distemper]]]]\n\n[[Viral disease]]s carried by wolves include: [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[papillomatosis]], and [[canine coronavirus]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}} Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, Iran, [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and India.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} In wolves, the [[incubation period]] is eight to 21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[Endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, infections being most prevalent in winter months.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}}\n\n[[Bacterial diseases]] carried by wolves include: [[brucellosis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[leptospirosis]], [[tularemia]], [[bovine tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}} [[listeriosis]] and [[anthrax]].{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Wolves can catch ''[[Brucella suis]]'' from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from [[lagomorph]] prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in Canada.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Parasitic ===\n[[File:Wild Wolf Afflicted with Mange.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a wolf afflicted with sarcoptuc mange eating at a kill|A wolf in the Yellowstone National Park afflicted with [[sarcoptic mange]]]]\n\nWolves carry [[ectoparasite]]s and [[endoparasite]]s; those in the former [[Soviet Union]] have been recorded to carry at least 50 species.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} [[Parasitic infection]] in wolves is of particular concern to people. Wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nWolves are often infested with a variety of [[arthropod]] exoparasites, including [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[Louse|lice]], and [[mite]]s. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is the mange mite (''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''),{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} though they rarely develop full-blown [[mange]], unlike foxes.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Lice, such as ''[[Trichodectes canis]]'', may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' can infect wolves with Lyme disease and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} The tick ''[[Dermacentor]] pictus'' also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include [[Mallophaga|chewing lice]], [[Sucking louse|sucking lice]] and the fleas ''[[Pulex irritans]]'' and ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]''.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}}\n\nEndoparasites known to infect wolves include: [[protozoan]]s and [[helminth]]s ([[Trematoda|flukes]], [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s and [[thorny-headed worm]]s). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} Some wolves carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=Dubey2011/> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\nWolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}}. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''[[Nicolla skrjabini]]'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{Further|List of gray wolf populations by country}}\nThe global wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=230}} Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s. This has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection, changes in land use, and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf. Despite these threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] classifies the wolf as [[Least Concern]] on its [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] due to its relatively widespread range and stable population.

As well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programs or state insurance.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=309}} Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have been bred under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=173}} Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted. In Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidents are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}\n\nThe majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=307}} The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), [[Reindeer herding|domestic reindeer]] (northern Scandinavia), [[goat]]s (India), [[horse]]s (Mongolia), [[cattle]] and [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]] (North America).{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=306}} Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.{{sfn|Graves|2007|p=45}}\n\n==== Conflicts with dogs ====\nA review of the studies on the competitive effects of dogs on [[Sympatry|sympatric]] carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.<ref name=Vanak2014/><ref name=Lescureaux2014 /> Competition would favour the wolf, which is known to kill dogs; however wolves usually live in pairs or in small packs in areas with high human persecution, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Boitani1983/>\n\nWolves kill dogs on occasion, and some wolf populations rely on dogs as an important food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}<ref name=\"Jess\" /> The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are [[Harrier (dog)|Harrier]]s, older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as [[J\u00e4mthund|Swedish Elkhound]]s are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.<ref name=\"Jess\" />\n\nAlthough the numbers of dogs killed each year by wolves are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to prey on dogs. In many cultures, there are strong bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses, with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\nDogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human\u2013wolf conflicts, and are often proposed as one of the non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Shivik2006/> Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviours, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression.

The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June\u2013August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock [[grazing]] or berry and mushroom picking) increase.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in [[Belarus]], [[Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] oblasts, [[Karelia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called \"child-lifting\". They may be taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements.<ref name=\"Rajpurohit1999\"/>\n\nCases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the \"furious\" phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Bites from rabid wolves are 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=267}} Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. The victims are chosen at random, though most cases involve adult men.

This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor. Some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls. In [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practice is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}} Several types of dog, including the Borzoi and [[Taigan|Kyrgyz Tajgan]], have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.<ref name=Lescureaux2014/>\n\n=== As pets and working animals ===\n{{Main|Wolves as pets and working animals}}\nWolves and [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s are sometimes kept as [[exotic pet]]s.
