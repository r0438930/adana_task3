It typically has a range of six and a half octaves (47 strings)<ref>{{cite web |title=Philharmonia |url=https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/viola-2/ |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref>, weighs about {{convert|80|lb|kg|order=flip}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Betterharps.com |url=https://betterharps.com/how-much-does-a-harp-weigh/ |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref>, is about {{convert|1.85|m|ftin}} high, has a depth of {{convert|1|m|ftin}}, and is {{convert|55|cm|ftin}} wide at the bass end of the soundboard. The notes range from the C{{music|b}} three octaves below [[middle C]] to three and a half octaves above, usually ending on G{{music|b}}. Using [[Scientific pitch notation|octave designations]], the range is C{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> to G{{music|b}}<sub>7</sub>. At least one manufacturer{{which|date=January 2017}} gives the harp a 48th string, a high A{{music|b}} (A{{music|b}}<sub>7</sub>) giving the instrument a range of C{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> to A{{music|#}}<sub>7</sub>.\n\nThe role of the pedals in this type of harp is to alter the pitch of the strings, so that - unlike early kinds of harp - the pedal harp can easily play works written in any [[key (music)|key]]. This is particularly important in the harmonically complex music of the [[Romantic (music)|Romantic]] period and later 20th-century classical music. Nonetheless, the two lowest strings, C{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> and D{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub>, are not affected by the pedal mechanism (i.e. their tuning is not affected by the position of, respectively, the C and D pedals). They must be tuned manually in advance for the whole piece (or section of a piece).\n\n==Parts==\n\n===Body and strings===\nA pedal harp typically has a range of six and a half octaves (46 or 47 strings), weighs about {{convert|80|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}, is about {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, has a depth of {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and is {{convert|21+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide at the bass end of the soundboard. The notes range from three octaves below middle C to three and a half octaves above, usually ending on G. The tension of the strings on the soundboard is roughly equal to a ton (10 [[kilonewton]]s). The lowest strings are made of copper or steel-wound nylon, the middle-lower of gut, and the middle to highest of nylon, or more or all gut.\n\nThe pedal harp is identifiable as a large instrument with a straight pillar for support sometimes adorned with a crown at the top; a soundboard, which is pear-shaped with an extended width at the bottom in most harps, while some older pedal harps have soundboards that are straight-sided though widening toward the bottom; a mechanical action made up of over 1,400 parts attached to a harmonically curved neck; and a base with seven pedals that are arranged in the following: D, C, B (left) and E, F, G, A (right). The D, E, G, A, and B strings are normally colored white while the C strings are colored red and the F strings either black or blue. The strings are tuned to all flat pitches: the scale of [[C flat major|C{{music|flat}} major]]. C {{music|flat}} major is [[enharmonic equivalence|the same]] as B major, and for most instruments B major is a far more common key to use as it has five sharps rather than seven flats. However, for convenience, harp parts are notated in C {{music|flat}} rather than B, even when other instruments are written in B.\n[[File:ErardHarp2.jpg|thumb|[[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard]] harp mechanism]]\n\n===Pedals===\n[[Image:Harp pedals bigger.jpg|thumb|left|Pedals of a harp]]\n\n[[File:Harp pedal.svg|thumb|left|The action of the wheels in the pedal system to change the pitch of a string. The tip of a string is shown in blue, points in contact with the string are shown in red, and points not in contact with the string are in green.]]\n\nPedals were first used in 1697.<ref name=celt>{{cite web|url=http://www.alisonvardy.com/harp-info/celtic-harp-history.htm |title=Celtic harp history|first=Alison|last=Vardy}}</ref> Pedal harps use the mechanical action of pedals to change the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] of the strings. The seven pedals each affect the tuning of all strings of one [[pitch-class]]. The pedals, from left to right, are D, C, B on the left side and E, F, G, A on the right. Each pedal attaches to a rod or cable in the column of the harp, which connects to a mechanism in the neck. When the player presses a pedal, small discs at the top of the harp rotate. The discs are studded with two pegs that pinch the string as they turn, shortening its vibrating length. \n\nEach pedal has three positions. In the top position, no pegs touch the string and all notes are [[Flat (music)|flat]]. In the middle position, the top disc pins press against the string, resulting in a [[Natural (music)|natural]], giving the scale of [[C major|C{{music|natural}} major]] if all pedals are in the middle position. In the bottom position, the second, lower disc turns, shortening the string again to create a [[Sharp (music)|sharp]], giving the scale of [[C-sharp major|C{{music|sharp}} major]] if all pedals are in the bottom position.\n\nMany other scales, diatonic and synthetic, can be obtained by combining the pedals. It is also possible to play many chords in traditional harmony by adjusting pedals so some notes are [[enharmonic]]. This is central to pedal harp technique. In each position the pedal can be secured in a notch so the foot does not have to continuously hold it in position (unlike piano pedals).\n\nThree strings have no pedal tuning mechanism: the lowest  C and D and the highest G.<ref>Inglefield and Neill (1985), 3.  A few modern harps have a pedal mechanism for the high G string.</ref>  These strings are normally tuned to C{{music|natural}}, D{{music|natural}}, and G{{music|natural}} respectively.  However, they can also be tuned sharp or flat prior to performance.  This can be indicated by verbal statements at the beginning of a composition, for example, \"Tune low C to C{{music|flat}}\", or \"If necessary, tune high G to G{{music|sharp}}\".<ref>Inglefield and Neill (1985), 'Scordatura', p.49.</ref>\n\nPedal harps are essentially diatonic instruments with the double-action pedal mechanism providing chromatic alterations and key changes. No matter how the pedals are set, the pedal harp still has only seven strings per octave. Smaller harps, often called folk, lever or Celtic harps, are equally diatonic, with seven strings per octave, and use a mechanical lever on each string that the player must move manually for chromatic alterations.  The only completely chromatic harps are the double (arpa doppia) and triple (Welsh) harps and [[cross-strung harp]].\n\nThe pedal mechanism is called the ''double-action pedal system'', first patented in London by [[Sebastien Erard]] in 1801 (patent number 2502) and 1802 (patent number 2595). In 1807 Charles Groll was the first to register a patent (patent number 3059) where the harp mechanism was doubled with two lines of fourchettes (forks). Earlier pedal harps had a single-action mechanism that provided only sharped notes, the first of which was made in [[1720 in science|1720]] by [[Jacob Hochbrucker]] in Bavaria.<ref name=celt/>\n\n==Technique==\n[[File:Harpist Elaine Christy at Unitarian Church 2.jpg|thumb|right|Harpist [[Elaine Christy]] plays with both hands approaching the strings from either side of the harp; foot pedals (not shown) can change the pitch of specific strings by a half step.]]\nThe pedal harp is played with the fingertips of the first four fingers (thumb, index, middle and ring fingers). The little fingers are not used because they are too short and cannot reach the correct position without distorting the position of the other fingers (although on some folk harps with light tension and closely spaced strings they may occasionally be used).  The fifth finger may also have been used on earlier, more lightly strung modern harps. [[Madame de Genlis]], for example, in her ''M\u00e9thode'', published in Paris in the early 19th century, promotes the use of all fingers,<ref>Rensch (2007/1989), 164\u2013165.</ref> while Roslyn Rensch suggests that Mlle de Gu\u00eenes, the harpist for whom [[Mozart]] wrote his [[Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra (Mozart)|Concerto for Flute and Harp]], might occasionally have used all five fingers when playing the harp.<ref>Rensch (2007./1989), 170.</ref> In more modern music, the little finger is used very rarely, for example in simultaneous cluster chords, such as in Daniel Kessner's ''Sonatina''.<ref>Inglewood and Neill (1985), 77.</ref> The fingertips are drawn in to meet the palm, thus releasing the string from whatever pressure was placed upon it by the fingers. The fingers are naturally curved or rounded as they touch it, and the thumb is gently curved as the tip rises to it as an arc from its base.\n\nPlucking with varying degrees of force creates [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness). Different types of plucking can also create different tones and sounds. Depending on finger position, different tones can be produced: a full sound in the middle of the string and a nasal, guitar-like sound at the very bottom. Tone is also affected by the skin of the harpist, how much oil and moisture it contains, and the amount of thickening by callus formation and its surface texture.\n\nThere are differing schools of technique for playing the pedal harp. The largest are the various French schools. There are specific Russian, Viennese, and other schools across Europe. One is the Attl technique, after Kajetan Attl, in which apparently only the uppermost parts of the fingers move and the hand is largely still. There is a St. Petersburg school (more than one) in Russia in which the player moves the thumbs in a circular fashion rather than in and out toward the hand.\n\nThe differences between the French schools lie in the posture of the arms, shape of the hand, and musical aesthetics. The traditional French schooling lets the player lightly rest the right arm against the harp, using the wrist to sometimes bring the hand only away from the string. The left arm moves more freely. Finger technique and control are the emphasis of the technical approach, with extensive use of exercises and etudes to develop this. Two very influential 20th-century teachers of this approach were [[Henriette Reni\u00e9]] and [[Marcel Grandjany]], who studied with [[Alphonse Hasselmans]]. The other major French school is the Salzedo school, developed by [[Carlos Salzedo]], who also studied with [[Alphonse Hasselmans]] at the Paris Conservatoire. Salzedo's technique generally calls for the arms to be held horizontally<ref>Lawrence and Salzedo (1929), 6.</ref> and emphasises the role of aesthetic hand and arm gestures after the string has been plucked: \"Each of the thirty-seven tone colors and effects of the harp calls for a gesture corresponding to its sonorous meaning.\"<ref>Lawrence and Salzedo (1929), 17.</ref>\n\n==Orchestral role==\nThe harp found its early orchestral use as a solo instrument in concerti by many baroque and classical composers (Handel, Mozart, Boieldieu, Albrechtsberger, Schenk, Dussek, Spohr) and in the opera houses of London, Paris and Berlin and most other capitals. Hector Berlioz began to use it in symphonic music, but he found performances frustrating in countries such as Germany, which had few harps or sufficiently proficient harpists. Franz Liszt was seminal using the harp in his orchestral music. The French and Russian Romantic composers particularly expanded its symphonic use. In opera, the Italian composers used it regularly, and Puccini was a particular master of its expressive and coloristic use. Debussy can be said to have put the harp on the map in his many works that use one or more harps. Tchaikovsky also was of great influence, followed by Rimsky-Korsakov, Richard Strauss and Wagner. The greatest influence on use of the harp has always been the availability of fine harps and skilled players, and the great increase of them in the US of the 20th century resulted in its spread into popular music.\n\n==Jazz==\nThe first harpist known to play jazz was [[Casper Reardon]], a pioneer in the world of \"hot\" music. [[Dorothy Ashby]] (sampled by hip-hop artists) and [[Alice Coltrane]] are other jazz harpists.[[File:Harpist performing.jpg|thumb|Harpist performing]]\n\n==Ballet==\nMany passages for solo harp can be found in 19th-century ballet music, particularly in scores for the ballets staged for the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] of [[St. Petersburg]], where the harpist [[Albert Zabel]] played in the orchestra. In ballet, the harp was utilised to a great extent to embellish the dancing of the [[ballerina]]. Elaborate cadenzas were composed by [[Tchaikovsky]] for his ballets ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]''; as well as [[Alexander Glazunov]] for his score for the ballet ''[[Raymonda]]''. In particular, the scores of [[Riccardo Drigo]] contained many pieces for harp in such works as ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|Le Talisman]]'' (1889), ''[[Le R\u00e9veil de Flore]]'' (1894) and ''[[Harlequinade (ballet)|Les Millions d'Arlequin]]'' (1900).\n\n[[Cesare Pugni]] wrote extensively for the harp as well\u2014his ballet ''[[\u00c9oline, ou La Dryade]]'' included music written for harp to accompany the ballerina's numerous variations and enhance the atmosphere of the ballet's many fantastical scenes. [[Ludwig Minkus]] was celebrated for his harp cadenzas, most notably the ''Variation de la Reine du jour'' from his ballet ''La Nuit et le Jour'' (1881), the elaborate ''[[entr'acte]]'' composed for Albert Zabel from his ballet ''Roxana'' (1878), and numerous passages found in his score for the ballet ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'', which in some passages were used to represent a [[veena]], which was used on stage as a prop. French ballet composers such as Delibes, Gounod, and Massenet made use of the harp in their music.\n\n==Pop music==\nThere is a prominent harp part in \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\" by [[The Beatles]] in their 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s, harp parts were common in popular music, and can be heard in such hits as [[Cher]]'s \"[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]\" and \"[[Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves]]\", as well as \"[[Boogie Nights (song)|Boogie Nights]]\" by [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]. Most often it was played by Los Angeles studio harpist [[Gayle Levant]], who has played on hundreds of recordings. Irish band [[Clannad]] featured the harp heavily in their music during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nIn current pop music, the harp appears relatively rarely. [[Joanna Newsom]], [[Dee Carstensen]], [[Darian Scatton]], [[Habiba Doorenbos]], and [[Jessa Callen]] of [[Callen Sisters|The Callen Sisters]] have separately established images as harp-playing singer-songwriters with signature harp and vocal sounds. Canadian singer-songwriter [[Sarah McLachlan]] plays the harp in her 2006 holiday album, [[Wintersong]]. In Hong Kong, a notable example of harp in pop music is the song \"[[Tian Shui Walled City]]\" ({{zh|t=\u5929\u6c34\u570d\u57ce|labels=no}}) performed by [[Hacken Lee]] with harp played by Korean harpist [[Jung Kwak]] (Harpist K).\n\nThe harp is also used as a central instrument by many [[Alternative music|alternative]] popular musicians. A pedal harpist, [[Ricky Rasura]], is a member of the \"symphonic pop\" band, [[The Polyphonic Spree]]. Also, [[Bj\u00f6rk]] sometimes features acoustic and electric harp in her work, often played by [[Zeena Parkins]]. Philadelphia based Indie Pop Band [[Br'er]] uses a pedal harp as the foundation for their cinematic live sets. [[Art in America (band)|Art in America]] was the first known rock band featuring a pedal harp to appear on a major record label, released in 1983. The pedal harp was also present in the [[Michael Kamen]] and [[Metallica]] concert and album, [[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]], as part of the [[San Francisco Symphony]] orchestra. R&B singer [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]] featured harpist [[Gloria Agostini]] in 1997 on his cover of [[Kate Bush]]'s \"This Woman's Work\". On his 7th solo album [[Finding Forever]], [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] artist [[Common (rapper)|Common]] features harpist [[Brandee Younger]] on the introductory track, followed by a [[Dorothy Ashby]] [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from her 1969 recording of \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\".\n\nSome Celtic-pop crossover bands and artists such as [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and [[Loreena McKennitt]] include folk harps, following [[Alan Stivell]]'s work. Additionally [[Florence Welch]] of [[Florence and the Machine]] uses the harp frequently in both [[Lungs (album)|Lungs]] and [[Ceremonials (album)|Ceremonials]], notably on \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\". [[The Webb Sisters]] from UK use different size harps in almost all their material during live performances. Sierra Casady, of the [[freak-folk]] group [[CocoRosie]] plays harp on several of their songs. Another musician from the UK [[Patrick Wolf]] has used the [[Celtic harp]] throughout his career, often playing it himself while singing.\n\n==Electroacoustic harps==\n[[Lyon and Healy]], [[Camac Harps]], [[Salvi Harps]], and other manufacturers also make electroacoustic pedal harps.<ref>[http://www.salviharpsinc.com/HarpEchoSalvi.htm Salvi Echo]</ref><ref>[http://www.lyonhealy.com/pedal-style-2000-electroacoustic.htm Lyon and Healy electroacoustic]</ref><ref>[http://www.camac-harps.com/camac-harps-eng/littlebb.html Camac electroacoustic]</ref> The electroacoustic pedal harp is a modified concert harp, with piezoelectric pickups at the base of each string and an amplifier. Electroacoustic harps are a blend of electric and acoustic, with the option of using an amplifier or playing the harp just like a normal pedal harp. The '''[[electric harp]]''' is different from the electroacoustic harp, as it is entirely electric, lacking a soundbox and being nearly mute without an amplifier.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of compositions for harp]]\n* [[Claviharp]] (A harp combined with a keyboard)\n* [[Triple harp|Triple Harp]] (Baroque Harp)\n* [[Celtic harp|Celtic Harp]] (Medieval Harp)\n* [[Epigonion]]\n* [[Lyre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Harps}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pedal Harp}}\n[[Category:Frame harps]]\n[[Category:Pedals]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox Instrument\n|name=Harp\n|names= \n|image=Harfe-Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg-1995.245.png\n|image_size=200px\n|classification=[[String instrument]] ([[Pizzicato|plucked]])\n|range= [[Image:Range harp.svg|150px|center]]\n|related= \n* [[\u00c7eng]]\n* [[Konghou]]\n* [[Lyre]]\n}}\n[[Image:Eliza Ridgely with a Harp NGA.jpg|thumb|right|''Lady with Harp: [[Eliza Ridgely]]'', depicts a Regency-era single-action pedal harp ([[Thomas Sully]], 1818)]]\n{{listen|filename=Glissando Imprecision for 2 Harps.ogg|title=Tudor Tulok \u2013 Glissando Imprecision for 2 Harps|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe '''pedal harp''' (also known as the '''concert harp''') is a large and technically modern [[harp]], designed primarily for [[art music]] and may be played either solo, as part of a chamber ensemble, or in an [[orchestra]].

The notes range from three octaves below middle C to three and a half octaves above, usually ending on G. The tension of the strings on the soundboard is roughly equal to a ton (10 [[kilonewton]]s). The lowest strings are made of copper or steel-wound nylon, the middle-lower of gut, and the middle to highest of nylon, or more or all gut.\n\nThe pedal harp is identifiable as a large instrument with a straight pillar for support sometimes adorned with a crown at the top; a soundboard, which is pear-shaped with an extended width at the bottom in most harps, while some older pedal harps have soundboards that are straight-sided though widening toward the bottom; a mechanical action made up of over 1,400 parts attached to a harmonically curved neck; and a base with seven pedals that are arranged in the following: D, C, B (left) and E, F, G, A (right). The D, E, G, A, and B strings are normally colored white while the C strings are colored red and the F strings either black or blue. The strings are tuned to all flat pitches: the scale of [[C flat major|C{{music|flat}} major]]. C {{music|flat}} major is [[enharmonic equivalence|the same]] as B major, and for most instruments B major is a far more common key to use as it has five sharps rather than seven flats.

The little fingers are not used because they are too short and cannot reach the correct position without distorting the position of the other fingers (although on some folk harps with light tension and closely spaced strings they may occasionally be used).  The fifth finger may also have been used on earlier, more lightly strung modern harps. [[Madame de Genlis]], for example, in her ''M\u00e9thode'', published in Paris in the early 19th century, promotes the use of all fingers,<ref>Rensch (2007/1989), 164\u2013165.</ref> while Roslyn Rensch suggests that Mlle de Gu\u00eenes, the harpist for whom [[Mozart]] wrote his [[Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra (Mozart)|Concerto for Flute and Harp]], might occasionally have used all five fingers when playing the harp.<ref>Rensch (2007./1989), 170.</ref> In more modern music, the little finger is used very rarely, for example in simultaneous cluster chords, such as in Daniel Kessner's ''Sonatina''.<ref>Inglewood and Neill (1985), 77.</ref> The fingertips are drawn in to meet the palm, thus releasing the string from whatever pressure was placed upon it by the fingers.

Finger technique and control are the emphasis of the technical approach, with extensive use of exercises and etudes to develop this. Two very influential 20th-century teachers of this approach were [[Henriette Reni\u00e9]] and [[Marcel Grandjany]], who studied with [[Alphonse Hasselmans]]. The other major French school is the Salzedo school, developed by [[Carlos Salzedo]], who also studied with [[Alphonse Hasselmans]] at the Paris Conservatoire. Salzedo's technique generally calls for the arms to be held horizontally<ref>Lawrence and Salzedo (1929), 6.</ref> and emphasises the role of aesthetic hand and arm gestures after the string has been plucked: \"Each of the thirty-seven tone colors and effects of the harp calls for a gesture corresponding to its sonorous meaning.\"<ref>Lawrence and Salzedo (1929), 17.</ref>\n\n==Orchestral role==\nThe harp found its early orchestral use as a solo instrument in concerti by many baroque and classical composers (Handel, Mozart, Boieldieu, Albrechtsberger, Schenk, Dussek, Spohr) and in the opera houses of London, Paris and Berlin and most other capitals. Hector Berlioz began to use it in symphonic music, but he found performances frustrating in countries such as Germany, which had few harps or sufficiently proficient harpists. Franz Liszt was seminal using the harp in his orchestral music. The French and Russian Romantic composers particularly expanded its symphonic use. In opera, the Italian composers used it regularly, and Puccini was a particular master of its expressive and coloristic use. Debussy can be said to have put the harp on the map in his many works that use one or more harps. Tchaikovsky also was of great influence, followed by Rimsky-Korsakov, Richard Strauss and Wagner. The greatest influence on use of the harp has always been the availability of fine harps and skilled players, and the great increase of them in the US of the 20th century resulted in its spread into popular music.\n\n==Jazz==\nThe first harpist known to play jazz was [[Casper Reardon]], a pioneer in the world of \"hot\" music. [[Dorothy Ashby]] (sampled by hip-hop artists) and [[Alice Coltrane]] are other jazz harpists.[[File:Harpist performing.jpg|thumb|Harpist performing]]\n\n==Ballet==\nMany passages for solo harp can be found in 19th-century ballet music, particularly in scores for the ballets staged for the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] of [[St. Petersburg]], where the harpist [[Albert Zabel]] played in the orchestra. In ballet, the harp was utilised to a great extent to embellish the dancing of the [[ballerina]]. Elaborate cadenzas were composed by [[Tchaikovsky]] for his ballets ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]''; as well as [[Alexander Glazunov]] for his score for the ballet ''[[Raymonda]]''. In particular, the scores of [[Riccardo Drigo]] contained many pieces for harp in such works as ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|Le Talisman]]'' (1889), ''[[Le R\u00e9veil de Flore]]'' (1894) and ''[[Harlequinade (ballet)|Les Millions d'Arlequin]]'' (1900).\n\n[[Cesare Pugni]] wrote extensively for the harp as well\u2014his ballet ''[[\u00c9oline, ou La Dryade]]'' included music written for harp to accompany the ballerina's numerous variations and enhance the atmosphere of the ballet's many fantastical scenes. [[Ludwig Minkus]] was celebrated for his harp cadenzas, most notably the ''Variation de la Reine du jour'' from his ballet ''La Nuit et le Jour'' (1881), the elaborate ''[[entr'acte]]'' composed for Albert Zabel from his ballet ''Roxana'' (1878), and numerous passages found in his score for the ballet ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'', which in some passages were used to represent a [[veena]], which was used on stage as a prop. French ballet composers such as Delibes, Gounod, and Massenet made use of the harp in their music.\n\n==Pop music==\nThere is a prominent harp part in \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\" by [[The Beatles]] in their 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s, harp parts were common in popular music, and can be heard in such hits as [[Cher]]'s \"[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]\" and \"[[Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves]]\", as well as \"[[Boogie Nights (song)|Boogie Nights]]\" by [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]. Most often it was played by Los Angeles studio harpist [[Gayle Levant]], who has played on hundreds of recordings. Irish band [[Clannad]] featured the harp heavily in their music during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nIn current pop music, the harp appears relatively rarely. [[Joanna Newsom]], [[Dee Carstensen]], [[Darian Scatton]], [[Habiba Doorenbos]], and [[Jessa Callen]] of [[Callen Sisters|The Callen Sisters]] have separately established images as harp-playing singer-songwriters with signature harp and vocal sounds. Canadian singer-songwriter [[Sarah McLachlan]] plays the harp in her 2006 holiday album, [[Wintersong]]. In Hong Kong, a notable example of harp in pop music is the song \"[[Tian Shui Walled City]]\" ({{zh|t=\u5929\u6c34\u570d\u57ce|labels=no}}) performed by [[Hacken Lee]] with harp played by Korean harpist [[Jung Kwak]] (Harpist K).\n\nThe harp is also used as a central instrument by many [[Alternative music|alternative]] popular musicians. A pedal harpist, [[Ricky Rasura]], is a member of the \"symphonic pop\" band, [[The Polyphonic Spree]]. Also, [[Bj\u00f6rk]] sometimes features acoustic and electric harp in her work, often played by [[Zeena Parkins]]. Philadelphia based Indie Pop Band [[Br'er]] uses a pedal harp as the foundation for their cinematic live sets. [[Art in America (band)|Art in America]] was the first known rock band featuring a pedal harp to appear on a major record label, released in 1983. The pedal harp was also present in the [[Michael Kamen]] and [[Metallica]] concert and album, [[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]], as part of the [[San Francisco Symphony]] orchestra. R&B singer [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]] featured harpist [[Gloria Agostini]] in 1997 on his cover of [[Kate Bush]]'s \"This Woman's Work\". On his 7th solo album [[Finding Forever]], [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] artist [[Common (rapper)|Common]] features harpist [[Brandee Younger]] on the introductory track, followed by a [[Dorothy Ashby]] [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from her 1969 recording of \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\".\n\nSome Celtic-pop crossover bands and artists such as [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and [[Loreena McKennitt]] include folk harps, following [[Alan Stivell]]'s work. Additionally [[Florence Welch]] of [[Florence and the Machine]] uses the harp frequently in both [[Lungs (album)|Lungs]] and [[Ceremonials (album)|Ceremonials]], notably on \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\". [[The Webb Sisters]] from UK use different size harps in almost all their material during live performances. Sierra Casady, of the [[freak-folk]] group [[CocoRosie]] plays harp on several of their songs. Another musician from the UK [[Patrick Wolf]] has used the [[Celtic harp]] throughout his career, often playing it himself while singing.\n\n==Electroacoustic harps==\n[[Lyon and Healy]], [[Camac Harps]], [[Salvi Harps]], and other manufacturers also make electroacoustic pedal harps.<ref>[http://www.salviharpsinc.com/HarpEchoSalvi.htm Salvi Echo]</ref><ref>[http://www.lyonhealy.com/pedal-style-2000-electroacoustic.htm Lyon and Healy electroacoustic]</ref><ref>[http://www.camac-harps.com/camac-harps-eng/littlebb.html Camac electroacoustic]</ref> The electroacoustic pedal harp is a modified concert harp, with piezoelectric pickups at the base of each string and an amplifier. Electroacoustic harps are a blend of electric and acoustic, with the option of using an amplifier or playing the harp just like a normal pedal harp. The '''[[electric harp]]''' is different from the electroacoustic harp, as it is entirely electric, lacking a soundbox and being nearly mute without an amplifier.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of compositions for harp]]\n* [[Claviharp]] (A harp combined with a keyboard)\n* [[Triple harp|Triple Harp]] (Baroque Harp)\n* [[Celtic harp|Celtic Harp]] (Medieval Harp)\n* [[Epigonion]]\n* [[Lyre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Harps}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pedal Harp}}\n[[Category:Frame harps]]\n[[Category:Pedals]]\n", "name_user": "Dinnerandbreakfast", "label": "safe", "comment": "Citation for string number and weight", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_harp"}
