Servicing 37 stations, the line has 46.4&nbsp;km of grade-separated tracks running mostly on underground and elevated guideways. Formerly known as the PUTRA LRT, it is currently operated by [[Rapid KL]], a subsidiary of [[Prasarana Malaysia]]. The line is named after its former terminus, [[Kelana Jaya LRT station|Kelana Jaya station]]. The line is numbered&nbsp;{{Rint|my|5}} and coloured '''<span style=\"color:#{{KLRT color|5}};\">Ruby</span>''' on the official transit map.\n\n== Line information ==\n\n<mapframe text=\"Location of Kelana Jaya LRT line\" width=270 height=400 zoom=11 latitude=3.11445 longitude=101.65519>\n{\n  \"type\": \"ExternalData\",\n  \"service\": \"geoline\",\n  \"ids\": \"Q248445\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"stroke\": \"#e0115f\",\n    \"stroke-width\": 6\n  }\n}\n</mapframe>\n\n=== Stations ===\nThe line runs from [[Putra Heights]] through [[Kelana Jaya]] to [[Gombak]], serving the [[Subang Jaya]] and [[Petaling Jaya]] regions to the south; southwest and central [[Kuala Lumpur]], and Kuala Lumpur City Centre to the centre; and low density residential areas further north. At 46.4&nbsp;km in length, it is [[List of automated urban metro subway systems|one of the longest]] fully [[automatic train operation|automated driverless metro]] lines in the world.\n\nThe stations are given in a north\u2013south direction, consists primarily of elevated stops and a handful of underground and at-grade stations. Of the 37 stations, 31 are elevated, [[Sri Rampai LRT station|Sri Rampai]] lies at ground level, and five stops ([[Masjid Jamek LRT station|Masjid Jamek]], [[Dang Wangi LRT station|Dangi Wangi]], [[Kampung Baru LRT station|Kampung Baru]], [[KLCC LRT station|KLCC]] and [[Ampang Park LRT station|Ampang Park]]) are underground.\n\nThe stations, like those of the [[Ampang Line|Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines]], are styled in several types of architectural designs. Elevated stations, in most parts, were constructed in four major styles with distinctive roof designs for specific portions of the line. [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral|KL Sentral station]], added later, features a design more consistent with the Stesen Sentral station building. Underground stations, however, tend to feature unique concourse layout and [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibules]], and feature floor-to-ceiling [[platform screen doors]] to prevent platform-to-track intrusions. 22 stations (including two terminal stations and the five subway stations) use a single [[island platform]], while 15 others use two [[side platform]]s. Stations with island platforms allow easy interchange between north-bound and south-bound trains without requiring one to walk down/up to the concourse level. The island platform at Putra Heights terminal station is shared with the Sri Petaling Line trains bound for Sentul Timur, allowing cross-platform line interchange at the station.\n\nThe stations were built to support [[disability|disabled]] passengers, with [[elevator]]s and [[wheelchair lift]]s alongside [[escalator]]s and [[stairway]]s between the levels. The stations have platform gaps smaller than 5&nbsp;cm to allow easy access for the disabled and wheelchair users. They are able to achieve this with:\n* Tracks that are non-ballasted, lessening rail and train movements.\n* Trains that have direct rubber suspension, lessening train body movements.\n* Trains that do not rapidly run through stations.\n* Stations that have straight platforms.\n\nThe stations on the Kelana Jaya Line are the earliest rapid transit stations in the [[Klang Valley]] designed to provide a degree of accessibility for handicapped users. In contrast, handicapped-friendly facilities for the [[Ampang and Sri Petaling lines|Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines]] were installed beginning in 2012.\n\nThe stations have [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit security cameras]] for security purposes.\n\n===Station list===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em; color:black; font-size:95%;\"\n|- align=\"center\" style=\"color:white\" bgcolor=\"{{KLRT color|5}}\"\n| '''Code'''\n| '''Name'''\n| '''Platform type'''\n| '''Position'''\n| '''Parking bays'''\n| '''Interchange/notes'''\n|-\n|{{KLRT color code|KJ|1}}||'''{{lrts|Gombak}}||[[Terminus station|Terminus]] (Island)|| Elevated ||MSPR: 1,441||\n'''Northern terminus'''.

The extension will be part of a RM10 billion plan to expand [[Public transport in Kuala Lumpur|Kuala Lumpur's public transport network]].\n\nThe expansion plan will also see the [[Ampang Line|Sri Petaling Line]] extended to the suburbs of [[Puchong]] and the south-west of Kuala Lumpur The plan also involved the construction of an entirely new line, tentatively called the [[Kota Damansara\u2013Cheras line]], running from [[Kota Damansara]] in the western portion of the city, to [[Cheras, Kuala Lumpur|Cheras]] which lies to the south-east of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAs of August 2008, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] was reportedly running land and engineering studies for the proposed extension.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Two extra LRT lines being studied |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/21/nation/20080821121505&sec=nation |publisher=The Star |date=21 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824053942/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F21%2Fnation%2F20080821121505&sec=nation |archivedate=24 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2009, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] began displaying the alignment of the proposed extensions over a 3-month period for feedback.

They consist of two-[[electric multiple unit]]s, which serve as either a driving car or trailer car depending on its direction of travel. The trains use [[linear motor]]s and draw power from a [[third rail]] located at the side of the [[Rail profile|steel rails]]. The plating in between the running rails is used for accelerating and decelerating the train. The reaction plate is semi-magnetised, which pulls the train along as well as helps it to slow down.[[File:Kelana Jaya Line.jpg|thumb|The new [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]] 300 for Kelana Jaya Line|alt=]]The ART is completely automated and operates without drivers, stopping at stations for a limited amount of time. Nevertheless, [[manual override]] control panels are provided at each end of the trains for use in an event of an emergency. The technology is essentially identical to that of the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Vancouver SkyTrain]], which operates in very similar environments.\n\nThe interior of the ART, like its [[Ampang and Sri Petaling lines|Ampang  and Sri Petaling Lines]]' counterparts, consists of plastic seating aligned sideways towards the sides of the train, with spacing for passengers on wheelchair, and spacing in the middle for standing occupants. Since its launch in 1998, the ART rolling stock has remained relatively unchanged; only more holding straps have been added and the labeling has been modified from Putra-LRT to [[RapidKL]]. Some of the rolling stock has the majority of the seats removed for added passenger capacity during rush hours.\n\nOn 13 October 2006, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] signed an agreement with Bombardier [https://www.hartasuma.com/ HARTASUMA] Consortium for the purchase of 88 Mark II ART cars (22 train sets of 4-cars) with an option for another 13 for RM1.2 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prasarana.com.my/TheEdgeTamimi%5B131006%5D.html |title=Prasarana Homepage \u2013 Prasarana in RM1.2b deal for 35 LRT trains |website=Prasarana |url-status=dead |archivedate=20 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320142353/http://www.prasarana.com.my/TheEdgeTamimi%5B131006%5D.html |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2018}}</ref> The 22 train sets, initially targeted to be delivered from August 2008 onwards, will have four cars each and will boost the carrying capacity of the fleet by 1,500 people.

Each driverless train features a new design for the end caps and curved sidewall structure, with a bigger and more open interior. All trains come in a four-car configuration, with each car accommodating up to 220 passengers. They are equipped with Linear Induction Motor (LIM) propulsion technology which allows for operation on tighter curves, with less noise and greatly reduced wheel and track wear. Low energy consumption is realised through a combination of lightweight aluminium carshells and LIM propulsion system. Furthermore, the vehicle's regenerative braking enables the reuse of energy released during braking. The aisles and walk-through gangways are also wider when compared with the previous fleet. Other than that, the trains are also equipped with 16  cameras onboard each, infotainment LCD screens, dynamic route maps, better air-conditioning and bigger windows. With the new trains, the line can increase its capacity by 20 to 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotransportmagazine.com/21574/news/industry-news/innovia-metro-300-kuala-lumpur/ |title=Driverless INNOVIA Metro 300 fleet enters service in Kuala Lumpur |publisher=Eurotransportmagazine.com |date=2017-01-03 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/05/16/new-improved-trains-brought-in-for-lrt-kelana-jaya-line/ |title=New improved trains brought in for LRT Kelana Jaya line - Community &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2016-05-16 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/01/21/updated-trains-for-lrt-new-fleet-to-increase-passenger-capacity-by-20-on-kelana-jaya-line/ |title=New fleet to increase passenger capacity by 20% on Kelana Jaya line - Community &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2016-01-21 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbombardier-consortium-delivers-first-innovia-metro-300-train-for-kuala-lumpur-light-metro-4787787 |title=Bombardier consortium delivers first Innovia Metro 300 train for Kuala Lumpur light metro |publisher=Railway Technology |date= |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n\n===Fleet details===\nThe Kelana Jaya Line fleet consisted of the following models:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Servicing 37 stations, the line has 46.4&nbsp;km of grade-separated tracks running mostly on underground and elevated guideways. Formerly known as the PUTRA LRT, it is currently operated by [[Rapid KL]], a subsidiary of [[Prasarana Malaysia]]. The line is named after its former terminus, [[Kelana Jaya LRT station|Kelana Jaya station]]. The line is numbered&nbsp;{{Rint|my|5}} and coloured '''<span style=\"color:#{{KLRT color|5}};\">Ruby</span>''' on the official transit map.\n\n== Line information ==\n\n<mapframe text=\"Location of Kelana Jaya LRT line\" width=270 height=400 zoom=11 latitude=3.11445 longitude=101.65519>\n{\n  \"type\": \"ExternalData\",\n  \"service\": \"geoline\",\n  \"ids\": \"Q248445\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"stroke\": \"#e0115f\",\n    \"stroke-width\": 6\n  }\n}\n</mapframe>\n\n=== Stations ===\nThe line runs from [[Putra Heights]] through [[Kelana Jaya]] to [[Gombak]], serving the [[Subang Jaya]] and [[Petaling Jaya]] regions to the south; southwest and central [[Kuala Lumpur]], and Kuala Lumpur City Centre to the centre; and low density residential areas further north. At 46.4&nbsp;km in length, it is [[List of automated urban metro subway systems|one of the longest]] fully [[automatic train operation|automated driverless metro]] lines in the world.\n\nThe stations are given in a north\u2013south direction, consists primarily of elevated stops and a handful of underground and at-grade stations. Of the 37 stations, 31 are elevated, [[Sri Rampai LRT station|Sri Rampai]] lies at ground level, and five stops ([[Masjid Jamek LRT station|Masjid Jamek]], [[Dang Wangi LRT station|Dangi Wangi]], [[Kampung Baru LRT station|Kampung Baru]], [[KLCC LRT station|KLCC]] and [[Ampang Park LRT station|Ampang Park]]) are underground.\n\nThe stations, like those of the [[Ampang Line|Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines]], are styled in several types of architectural designs. Elevated stations, in most parts, were constructed in four major styles with distinctive roof designs for specific portions of the line. [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral|KL Sentral station]], added later, features a design more consistent with the Stesen Sentral station building. Underground stations, however, tend to feature unique concourse layout and [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibules]], and feature floor-to-ceiling [[platform screen doors]] to prevent platform-to-track intrusions. 22 stations (including two terminal stations and the five subway stations) use a single [[island platform]], while 15 others use two [[side platform]]s. Stations with island platforms allow easy interchange between north-bound and south-bound trains without requiring one to walk down/up to the concourse level. The island platform at Putra Heights terminal station is shared with the Sri Petaling Line trains bound for Sentul Timur, allowing cross-platform line interchange at the station.\n\nThe stations were built to support [[disability|disabled]] passengers, with [[elevator]]s and [[wheelchair lift]]s alongside [[escalator]]s and [[stairway]]s between the levels. The stations have platform gaps smaller than 5&nbsp;cm to allow easy access for the disabled and wheelchair users.

They consist of two-[[electric multiple unit]]s, which serve as either a driving car or trailer car depending on its direction of travel. The trains use [[linear motor]]s and draw power from a [[third rail]] located at the side of the [[Rail profile|steel rails]]. The plating in between the running rails is used for accelerating and decelerating the train. The reaction plate is semi-magnetised, which pulls the train along as well as helps it to slow down.[[File:Kelana Jaya Line.jpg|thumb|The new [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]] 300 for Kelana Jaya Line|alt=]]The ART is completely automated and operates without drivers, stopping at stations for a limited amount of time. Nevertheless, [[manual override]] control panels are provided at each end of the trains for use in an event of an emergency. The technology is essentially identical to that of the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Vancouver SkyTrain]], which operates in very similar environments.\n\nThe interior of the ART, like its [[Ampang and Sri Petaling lines|Ampang  and Sri Petaling Lines]]' counterparts, consists of plastic seating aligned sideways towards the sides of the train, with spacing for passengers on wheelchair, and spacing in the middle for standing occupants. Since its launch in 1998, the ART rolling stock has remained relatively unchanged; only more holding straps have been added and the labeling has been modified from Putra-LRT to [[RapidKL]]. Some of the rolling stock has the majority of the seats removed for added passenger capacity during rush hours.\n\nOn 13 October 2006, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] signed an agreement with Bombardier [https://www.hartasuma.com/ HARTASUMA] Consortium for the purchase of 88 Mark II ART cars (22 train sets of 4-cars) with an option for another 13 for RM1.2 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prasarana.com.my/TheEdgeTamimi%5B131006%5D.html |title=Prasarana Homepage \u2013 Prasarana in RM1.2b deal for 35 LRT trains |website=Prasarana |url-status=dead |archivedate=20 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320142353/http://www.prasarana.com.my/TheEdgeTamimi%5B131006%5D.html |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2018}}</ref> The 22 train sets, initially targeted to be delivered from August 2008 onwards, will have four cars each and will boost the carrying capacity of the fleet by 1,500 people.

Each driverless train features a new design for the end caps and curved sidewall structure, with a bigger and more open interior. All trains come in a four-car configuration, with each car accommodating up to 220 passengers. They are equipped with Linear Induction Motor (LIM) propulsion technology which allows for operation on tighter curves, with less noise and greatly reduced wheel and track wear. Low energy consumption is realised through a combination of lightweight aluminium carshells and LIM propulsion system. Furthermore, the vehicle's regenerative braking enables the reuse of energy released during braking. The aisles and walk-through gangways are also wider when compared with the previous fleet. Other than that, the trains are also equipped with 16  cameras onboard each, infotainment LCD screens, dynamic route maps, better air-conditioning and bigger windows. With the new trains, the line can increase its capacity by 20 to 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotransportmagazine.com/21574/news/industry-news/innovia-metro-300-kuala-lumpur/ |title=Driverless INNOVIA Metro 300 fleet enters service in Kuala Lumpur |publisher=Eurotransportmagazine.com |date=2017-01-03 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/05/16/new-improved-trains-brought-in-for-lrt-kelana-jaya-line/ |title=New improved trains brought in for LRT Kelana Jaya line - Community &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2016-05-16 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/01/21/updated-trains-for-lrt-new-fleet-to-increase-passenger-capacity-by-20-on-kelana-jaya-line/ |title=New fleet to increase passenger capacity by 20% on Kelana Jaya line - Community &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2016-01-21 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbombardier-consortium-delivers-first-innovia-metro-300-train-for-kuala-lumpur-light-metro-4787787 |title=Bombardier consortium delivers first Innovia Metro 300 train for Kuala Lumpur light metro |publisher=Railway Technology |date= |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n\n===Fleet details===\nThe Kelana Jaya Line fleet consisted of the following models:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
