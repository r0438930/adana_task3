The use of an edge swiping gesture as a \"Back\" command was noted as potentially causing conflicts with apps that utilize [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar menus]] and other functions accessible by swiping. An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \"peeked\" by long-pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open.

OEMs are free to add their own gestures alongside them. However, they must not be enabled by default, they must be listed in a separate area one level deeper than other navigation settings, and they cannot be promoted using notifications.

Google ended the practice of giving major releases titles based on [[dessert]]s, arguing that this was not \"inclusive\" to international users (due either to the aforementioned foods not being internationally known, or being difficult to pronounce in some languages). Android VP of engineering Dave Burke did reveal during a podcast that, in addition, most desserts beginning with \"Q\" were \"exotic\", and that he personally would have chosen \"[[queen cake]]\".

The use of an edge swiping gesture as a \"Back\" command was noted as potentially causing conflicts with apps that utilize [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar menus]] and other functions accessible by swiping. An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \"peeked\" by long-pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open. The traditional three-key navigation system used since [[Android Honeycomb|Android \"Honeycomb\"]] remains supported as an option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20791457/google-android-q-back-gesture-controversy-app-drawer-navigation|title=Android Q's back gesture controversy, explained|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=August 8, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/android-q-navigation-gestures-mandatory/|title=[Update: OEM Gestures Allowed] Google's new navigation gestures in Android Q will be mandatory for all devices|date=May 9, 2019|website=xda-developers|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPer Google certification requirements, OEMs are required to support Android 10's default gestures and three-key navigation. OEMs are free to add their own gestures alongside them. However, they must not be enabled by default, they must be listed in a separate area one level deeper than other navigation settings, and they cannot be promoted using notifications. The two-key gesture navigation system used on [[Android Pie]] is deprecated, and may not be included on devices that ship with Android 10. However, it can still be included as an option for continuity purposes on devices upgraded from Pie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/android-gesture-navigation-systems-google/|title=Google is hiding other forms of Android Gesture Navigation|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=October 7, 2019|website=9to5Google|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== User experience ===\nA feature known as \"bubbles\" can be used to present content from supported apps in pop-up overlays (similarly to the overlay-based \"chat heads\" feature of [[Facebook Messenger]]). Apps can spawn bubbles via notifications.

Google stated that this cipher was five times faster than AES-256-XTS on an [[ARM Cortex-A7]] CPU. Therefore, device encryption is now mandatory on all Android 10 devices, regardless of specifications, using Adiantum if their CPU is not capable of hardware-accelerated AES.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.securityweek.com/google-improves-android-encryption-adiantum|title=Google Improves Android Encryption with Adiantum |website=SecurityWeek|access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220019/google-adiantum-storage-encryption-android-low-power-cheap-cost|title=Google wants to bring encryption to all with Adiantum|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=February 11, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref> In addition, implementation of \"file-based encryption\" (first introduced in [[Android Nougat]]) is also mandatory for all devices.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/android-10-privacy-security-features/|title=The Android 10 Privacy and Security Upgrades You Should Know About|work=Wired|access-date=September 5, 2019|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>\n\nOn devices shipping with Android 10, security patches for selected system components (such as [[ANGLE (software)|ANGLE]], Conscrypt, media frameworks, networking components, and others) may be serviced via [[Google Play Store]], without requiring a complete system update (\"Project Mainline\"). In order to license [[Google mobile services]], manufacturers must support these updates for specific modules, while the remainder are marked as \"recommended\" but optional. Selected modules within this system use the new APEX package format, a variation of [[APK file]]s designed for housing and servicing low-level system components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18531350/google-android-q-project-mainline-security-updates-play-store-io-2019|title=Project Mainline is Google\u2019s new attempt to send security updates directly to your phone|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=May 7, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/digging-into-android-q-beta-3-better-gesture-nav-a-new-update-system-and-more/|title=Android at I/O 2019: The Project Mainline update system and other highlights|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=May 22, 2019|website=Ars Technica|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA major change to storage access permissions known as \"Scoped storage\" is supported on Android 10, and will become mandatory for all apps beginning with Android 11. Apps are only allowed to access files in external storage that they had created themselves (preferably contained within an app-specific directory), and audio, image, and video files contained within the Music, Pictures, or Videos directories.
