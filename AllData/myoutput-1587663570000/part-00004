It was unearthed a generation before the events of the present day. T'Challa, the current Black Panther, is the son of T'Chaka, the Black Panther before him and a descendant of Bashenga.  Knowing that others would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T'Chaka conceals his country from the outside world. He sells off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending the country's best scholars to study abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. Eventually, however, the explorer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] finds his way to Wakanda and covers up his work on a vibranium-powered, sound-based weapon. When exposed, Klaue kills T'Chaka, only to see his \"sound blaster\" turned on him by a grieving teenaged T'Challa.

Due to heavy resistance to the deployment of technological developments, both sides are forced to fight with swords and spears. The Wakandan forces voluntarily wear panther masks; this prevents the Skrulls from focusing attacks on their leader. Despite losses, the Wakandans defeat the Skrulls.

[[Digital Spy]].</ref> In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its location was established in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' when it was shown on a map: at the northern end of Lake Turkana, at a fictional point bordering Ethiopia, South Sudan, Uganda, and Kenya. In real life, this area is actually a disputed border region known as the [[Ilemi Triangle]], claimed by each of these countries. The ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' film further established that, in keeping with this map location, it is a landlocked country in the central mountains far from the coasts. Impassable mountains and jungles around its borders have helped Wakanda isolate itself from outsiders. Internally, Wakanda consists of lush river valleys, mountain ranges rich in natural resources, and a fabulous capital city that integrates space-age technology with traditional designs.\n\n* Wakanda appears prominently in the 2018 film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', which further expands on its background and culture. The film establishes that, as in the comics, the Black Panther's super-strength comes from consuming the \"heart-shaped herb\", stating that it is local vegetation that was mutated over millions of years of exposure to Vibranium. Wakanda consists of five tribes, four of which were united under the rule of the first Black Panther 10,000 years ago. As in the comics, the four tribes (The River tribe, the Mining tribe, the Merchant tribe, and the Border tribe<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-panther-beauty-looks-express-african-pride-afrofuturism |title=Teen Vogue, Black Panther |access-date=2018-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219151110/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-panther-beauty-looks-express-african-pride-afrofuturism |archive-date=2018-02-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>) worship Bast, the panther god, amongst others, and also have a strong spiritual tradition of ancestor worship. The River Tribe wear green clothes made from crocodile skin and some males have a [[lip plate]] on them. The Mining Tribe are in charge of the Vibranium that is mined, stored, and utilized. The Merchant Tribe are responsible for trades and crafts of art, clothing and pieces of art where they also wear veils during a trade to maintain anonymity. The Border Tribe reside on the mountainous borders of Wakanda posing as farmers in order to deceive foreigners of Wakanda's wealth as well as their talent of breeding [[white rhinoceros]] even for battle. The fifth tribe are the Jabari, who follow the white gorilla cult (of the god [[Hanuman]]) \u2013 they are staunch traditionalists who live isolated up in the mountains. While considered part of Wakanda, the Black Panther's hold over the Jabari is tenuous; during the film, their leader [[Man-Ape|M'Baku]] rejects T'Challa as a worthy heir to the throne during his coronation, and challenges him to ceremonial combat to claim it for himself. The lords of each tribe sit on the king's councils, and after the Mountain tribe assists T'Challa in his overthrow of the usurper, [[Erik Killmonger|N'Jadaka aka Erik Kilmonger]], to take back the throne, M'Baku is also granted a seat on that council in recognition of his loyalty. The four main tribes of Wakanda speak a version of the [[Xhosa language]], while the Jabari speak an [[Igbo language|Igbo]] dialect.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> The opening animated sequence explains Wakanda was aware that the outside world was becoming increasingly chaotic, throughout the various atrocities of history such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the [[Colonisation of Africa]] by European powers, [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. The Black Panthers of the past, however, were devoted to defending their own country and did not interfere, instead choosing to hide Wakanda from the world - fearing that if they became involved and revealed themselves, it would eventually lead outsiders to try to invade Wakanda itself. Wakanda passes itself off as a small, poor Third World nation of humble herdsmen, using an advanced holographic projection shroud around its borders to hide the advanced technological civilization within. A core tension of the film's narrative is that the new Black Panther, T'Challa, is torn between his loyalty to hide and defend Wakanda as its king, and his own conscience to help the faltering world beyond its borders. Erik Killmonger then arrives in Wakanda to try to seize the throne - mirroring T'Challa's desire to end Wakanda's isolationism, but by conquering the outside world using Wakanda's advanced technologies and weapons. Ultimately, T'Challa defeats Killmonger and decides to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world during an address at the [[United Nations]]. The film's popularity led to a trend among athletes and celebrities around the world to throw up \"Wakanda Forever\" salutes after their victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/the-black-panther-Wakanda-forever-symbol-is-showing-up-everywhere|title=The \"Wakanda Forever\" Symbol Is Showing Up Everywhere|last=Weaver|first=Hilary|work=Vanities|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Director [[Ryan Coogler]] stated that his depiction of Wakanda was inspired by the southern African kingdom of [[Lesotho]].<ref name=\"TimesLive\" /><ref name=\"Vulture\" /> [[Basotho blanket]]s also became more known as a result of the film and its basis on Lesotho.<ref>https://www.businessinsider.co.za/black-panther-has-not-real-effect-on-the-south-african-sale-of-basotho-blankts-2018-3</ref>\n\n* Wakanda appears in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.

[[Digital Spy]].</ref> In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its location was established in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' when it was shown on a map: at the northern end of Lake Turkana, at a fictional point bordering Ethiopia, South Sudan, Uganda, and Kenya. In real life, this area is actually a disputed border region known as the [[Ilemi Triangle]], claimed by each of these countries. The ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' film further established that, in keeping with this map location, it is a landlocked country in the central mountains far from the coasts. Impassable mountains and jungles around its borders have helped Wakanda isolate itself from outsiders. Internally, Wakanda consists of lush river valleys, mountain ranges rich in natural resources, and a fabulous capital city that integrates space-age technology with traditional designs.\n\n* Wakanda appears prominently in the 2018 film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', which further expands on its background and culture. The film establishes that, as in the comics, the Black Panther's super-strength comes from consuming the \"heart-shaped herb\", stating that it is local vegetation that was mutated over millions of years of exposure to Vibranium. Wakanda consists of five tribes, four of which were united under the rule of the first Black Panther 10,000 years ago. As in the comics, the four tribes (The River tribe, the Mining tribe, the Merchant tribe, and the Border tribe<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-panther-beauty-looks-express-african-pride-afrofuturism |title=Teen Vogue, Black Panther |access-date=2018-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219151110/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-panther-beauty-looks-express-african-pride-afrofuturism |archive-date=2018-02-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>) worship Bast, the panther god, amongst others, and also have a strong spiritual tradition of ancestor worship. The River Tribe wear green clothes made from crocodile skin and some males have a [[lip plate]] on them. The Mining Tribe are in charge of the Vibranium that is mined, stored, and utilized. The Merchant Tribe are responsible for trades and crafts of art, clothing and pieces of art where they also wear veils during a trade to maintain anonymity. The Border Tribe reside on the mountainous borders of Wakanda posing as farmers in order to deceive foreigners of Wakanda's wealth as well as their talent of breeding [[white rhinoceros]] even for battle. The fifth tribe are the Jabari, who follow the white gorilla cult (of the god [[Hanuman]]) \u2013 they are staunch traditionalists who live isolated up in the mountains. While considered part of Wakanda, the Black Panther's hold over the Jabari is tenuous; during the film, their leader [[Man-Ape|M'Baku]] rejects T'Challa as a worthy heir to the throne during his coronation, and challenges him to ceremonial combat to claim it for himself. The lords of each tribe sit on the king's councils, and after the Mountain tribe assists T'Challa in his overthrow of the usurper, [[Erik Killmonger|N'Jadaka aka Erik Kilmonger]], to take back the throne, M'Baku is also granted a seat on that council in recognition of his loyalty. The four main tribes of Wakanda speak a version of the [[Xhosa language]], while the Jabari speak an [[Igbo language|Igbo]] dialect.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> The opening animated sequence explains Wakanda was aware that the outside world was becoming increasingly chaotic, throughout the various atrocities of history such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the [[Colonisation of Africa]] by European powers, [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. The Black Panthers of the past, however, were devoted to defending their own country and did not interfere, instead choosing to hide Wakanda from the world - fearing that if they became involved and revealed themselves, it would eventually lead outsiders to try to invade Wakanda itself. Wakanda passes itself off as a small, poor Third World nation of humble herdsmen, using an advanced holographic projection shroud around its borders to hide the advanced technological civilization within. A core tension of the film's narrative is that the new Black Panther, T'Challa, is torn between his loyalty to hide and defend Wakanda as its king, and his own conscience to help the faltering world beyond its borders. Erik Killmonger then arrives in Wakanda to try to seize the throne - mirroring T'Challa's desire to end Wakanda's isolationism, but by conquering the outside world using Wakanda's advanced technologies and weapons. Ultimately, T'Challa defeats Killmonger and decides to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world during an address at the [[United Nations]]. The film's popularity led to a trend among athletes and celebrities around the world to throw up \"Wakanda Forever\" salutes after their victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/the-black-panther-Wakanda-forever-symbol-is-showing-up-everywhere|title=The \"Wakanda Forever\" Symbol Is Showing Up Everywhere|last=Weaver|first=Hilary|work=Vanities|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Director [[Ryan Coogler]] stated that his depiction of Wakanda was inspired by the southern African kingdom of [[Lesotho]].<ref name=\"TimesLive\" /><ref name=\"Vulture\" /> [[Basotho blanket]]s also became more known as a result of the film and its basis on Lesotho.<ref>https://www.businessinsider.co.za/black-panther-has-not-real-effect-on-the-south-african-sale-of-basotho-blankts-2018-3</ref>\n\n* Wakanda appears in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.
