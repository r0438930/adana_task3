The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections both ecologically and orographically \u2013 the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki the [[Kora La]] is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and [[K2]] (the highest peak of the Karakoram range and of Pakistan). To the east of Annapurna are the {{convert|8000|m|mile|abbr=on}} peaks of [[Manaslu]] and across the border in Tibet, [[Shishapangma]]. To the south of these lies [[Kathmandu]], the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] lies valley of the Bhote/[[Sun Kosi]] river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China \u2013 the [[Araniko Highway]]/[[China National Highway 318]]. Further east is the [[Mahalangur Himal]] with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: [[Cho Oyu]], [[Everest]], [[Lhotse]] and [[Makalu]]. The [[Khumbu]] region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The [[Arun River, China-Nepal|Arun river]] drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing to the range to the east of Makalu.\n\nIn the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the [[Kanchenjunga]] massif on the border with India, the third highest mountain in the world, the most easterly {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kanchenjunga is in the Indian state of [[Sikkim]]. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to [[Lhasa]], Tibet, which passes over the [[Nathu La]] pass into the Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. The highest mountain in Bhutan is [[Gangkhar Puensum]], which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of [[Namche Barwa]], situated in Tibet inside the great bend of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Yarlang Tsangpo]] river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the [[Kangri Garpo]] mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo including [[Gyala Peri]], however, are also sometimes also included in the Himalayas.\n\nGoing west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to [[Rara Lake]], the largest lake in Nepal. The [[Karnali River]] rises in Tibet but cuts through the center of the region. Further west, the border with [[India]] follows the [[Sarda River]] and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of [[Gurla Mandhata]]. Just across [[Lake Manasarovar]] from this lies the sacred [[Mount Kailash]], which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, and Bonpo. In the newly created Indian state of [[Uttarkhand]], the Himalayas rise again as the Kumaon Himalayas with the high peaks of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Kamet]]. The state is also an important pilgrimage destination, with the source of the Ganges at [[Gangotri]] and the Yamuna at [[Yamunotri]], and the temples at [[Badrinath]] and [[Kedarnath]].\n\nThe next Himalayan Indian state, [[Himachal Pradesh]], it is noted for its hill stations, particularly [[Shimla]], the summer capital of the [[British Raj]], and [[Dharmasala]], the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the [[Sutlej river]], the most easterly of the five tributaries of the [[Indus]], cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of the Indian administered Union territories of [[Jammu & Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]]. The twin peaks of [[Nun Kun]] are the only mountains over {{convert|7000|m|mile|abbr=on}} in this part of the Himalayas. Beyond lies the renown [[Kashmir Valley]] and the town and lakes of [[Srinagar]]. Finally, the Himalayas reach their western end in the dramatic 8000&nbsp;m peak of [[Nanga Parbat]], which rises over {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000&nbsp;m summits. The western end terminates at a magnificent point near Nanga Parbat (killer mountain ) where Karakoram, Himalayas and Hindu Kush ranges intersects. It's situated in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of the Himalaya}}\n[[File:Himalaya-formation.gif|thumb|upright|The {{convert|6000|km||adj=mid|-plus}} journey of the India landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate) about 40 to 50 million [[Before Present|years ago]]<ref name=USGS/>]]\n\nThe Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. According to the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]], its formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The [[Arakan Yoma]] highlands in [[Burma|Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were also formed as a result of this collision.\n\nDuring the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70&nbsp;million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate (which has subsequently broken into the [[Indian Plate]] and the [[Australian Plate]]<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/95/18688.html (1995) Geologists Find: An Earth Plate Is Breaking in Two]</ref>) was moving at about {{cvt|15|cm|||}} per year. About 50&nbsp;million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian Plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density [[continental crust]], they were [[thrust fault]]ed and [[Fold (geology)|folded]] into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] along an [[oceanic trench]].<ref name=USGS/> An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine [[limestone]] from this ancient ocean.<ref>[https://www.thoughtco.com/mount-everest-overview-1435553 Mount Everest \u2013 Overview and Information] by Matt Rosenberg. ThoughtCo Updated 17 March 2017</ref>\n\nToday, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap3-Plate-Margins/Convergent/Continental-Collision|title=Plate Tectonics -The Himalayas |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=The Geological Society |access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> The Indian plate is still moving at 67&nbsp;mm per year, and over the next 10&nbsp;million years it will travel about {{cvt|1500|km|||}} into Asia. About 20&nbsp;mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5&nbsp;mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region [[seismic]]ally active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.\n\nDuring the last [[ice age]], there was a connected ice stream of [[glacier]]s between [[Kangchenjunga]] in the east and [[Nanga Parbat]] in the west.<ref name=Kuhle2011/><ref>glacier maps [http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/ downloadable]</ref> In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the [[Karakoram]], and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice.

As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. The rivers of the Himalayas drain into two large river systems:\n* The western rivers combine into the ''Indus Basin''. The [[Indus River|Indus]] itself forms the northern and western boundaries of the Himalayas. It begins in Tibet at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows north-west through India into Pakistan before turning south-west to the [[Arabian Sea]]. It is fed by several major tributaries draining the southern slopes of the Himalayas, including the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Sutlej]] rivers, the five rivers of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].\n* The other Himalayan rivers drain the ''Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin''. Its main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra]] and the [[Yamuna]], as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of [[Assam]]. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in [[Bangladesh]] and drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through the world's largest river delta, the [[Sunderbans]].<ref name=gits4u/>\n\nThe northern slopes of [[Gyala Peri]] and the peaks beyond the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Tsangpo]], sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the [[Irrawaddy River]], which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the [[Andaman Sea]]. The [[Salween]], [[Mekong]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers.

For much of Himalayas \u2013 that on the south side of the high mountains, except in the furthest west, the most characteristic feature of the climate is the [[monsoon]]. Heavy rain arrives on the south-west monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism \u2013 the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, (or post-monsoon), winter and spring.\n\nUsing the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as ''Cwa'', [[humid subtropical climate#South Asia|Humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety|subtropical highland climate (''Cwb'')]].\n\nIn the furthest west of the Himalayas, in the west of the Kashmir valley and the Indus valley, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a dominant factor and most precipitation falls in the spring. Srinagar receives around {{convert|723|mm|abbr=on|0}} around half the rainfall of locations such as Shimla and Kathmandu, with the wettest months being March and April.\n\nThe northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold and generally wind swept particularly in the west where it has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]]. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during late winter and spring months.\n\nLocal impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by {{Convert|6.5|C-change|1}} for every {{cvt|1000|m||}} rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates from a nearly tropical climate in the foothills, to [[tundra]] and permanent snow and ice at higher elevations. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the [[rain shadow]] of large mountains can be significant, for example leading to near desert conditions in the [[Upper Mustang]] which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the [[Annapurna]] and [[Dhaulagiri]] massifs and has annual precipitation of around {{cvt|300|mm|||}}, while [[Pokhara]] on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall ({{cvt|3900|mm|disp=or||}} a year). Thus although annual precipitation is generally higher in east than the west, local variations are often more important.\n\nThe Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding [[temperate]] regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Devitt|first=Terry|title=Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau|newspaper=University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison News|date=3 May 2001|url=https://news.wisc.edu/climate-shift-linked-to-rise-of-himalayas-tibetan-plateau/|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAn acceleration of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850#Himalayas and Central Asia|ice loss across the Himalayas]] over the past 40 years has been proved with satellite photos.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu 19.

The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities.<ref name=\"O'Neill_2019\"/> The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor [[extremophile]] organisms.<ref>{{cite web|first=C.

Its prey includes members of the goat family grazing on the alpine pastures and living on the rocky terrain, notably the endemic [[bharal]] or Himalayan blue sheep. The [[Himalayan musk deer]] is also found at high altitude. Hunted for its musk, it is now rare and endangered. Other endemic or near endemic herbivores include the [[Himalayan tahr]], the [[takin]], the [[Himalayan serow]], and the [[Himalayan goral]]. The critically endangered [[Himalayan brown bear|Himalayan]] subspecies of the [[brown bear]] is found sporadically across the range as is the [[Asian black bear]]. In the mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests of the eastern Himalayas, [[Red panda]] feed in the dense understories of bamboo. Lower down the forests of the foothills are inhabited by several different primates, including the endangered [[Gee's golden langur]] and the [[Kashmir gray langur]], with highly restricted ranges in the east and west of the Himalayas respectively.<ref name=\"oneill_khecheopalri\"/>\n\nThe unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to [[climate change]]. ''[[Hydrangea hirta]]'' is an example of floral species that can be found in this area. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially [[rhododendron]], apple and ''[[Myrica esculenta|box myrtle]]''. The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is ''[[Juniperus tibetica]]'' located at {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|-1}} in Southeastern Tibet.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|title=Highest Treeline in the Northern Hemisphere Found in Southern Tibet|first1=Georg|last1=Miehe|first2=Sabine|last2=Miehe|first3=Jonas|last3=Vogel|first4=Sonam|last4=Co|first5=La|last5=Duo|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=27|issue=2|date=May 2007|pages=169\u2013173|doi=10.1659/mrd.0792|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606103046/http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2013|hdl=1956/2482}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Jains at Kailash.jpg|thumb|[[Jain]] pilgrims paying obeisance to Tirthankar [[Rishabhdev]] near [[Mount Kailash]].]]\n\nThe Himalayan population belongs to four distinct cultural groups, who throughout history have systematically penetrated the isolated indigenous Himalayan population.

The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections both ecologically and orographically \u2013 the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki the [[Kora La]] is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and [[K2]] (the highest peak of the Karakoram range and of Pakistan). To the east of Annapurna are the {{convert|8000|m|mile|abbr=on}} peaks of [[Manaslu]] and across the border in Tibet, [[Shishapangma]]. To the south of these lies [[Kathmandu]], the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] lies valley of the Bhote/[[Sun Kosi]] river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China \u2013 the [[Araniko Highway]]/[[China National Highway 318]]. Further east is the [[Mahalangur Himal]] with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: [[Cho Oyu]], [[Everest]], [[Lhotse]] and [[Makalu]]. The [[Khumbu]] region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The [[Arun River, China-Nepal|Arun river]] drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing to the range to the east of Makalu.\n\nIn the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the [[Kanchenjunga]] massif on the border with India, the third highest mountain in the world, the most easterly {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kanchenjunga is in the Indian state of [[Sikkim]]. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to [[Lhasa]], Tibet, which passes over the [[Nathu La]] pass into the Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. The highest mountain in Bhutan is [[Gangkhar Puensum]], which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of [[Namche Barwa]], situated in Tibet inside the great bend of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Yarlang Tsangpo]] river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the [[Kangri Garpo]] mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo including [[Gyala Peri]], however, are also sometimes also included in the Himalayas.\n\nGoing west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to [[Rara Lake]], the largest lake in Nepal. The [[Karnali River]] rises in Tibet but cuts through the center of the region. Further west, the border with [[India]] follows the [[Sarda River]] and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of [[Gurla Mandhata]]. Just across [[Lake Manasarovar]] from this lies the sacred [[Mount Kailash]], which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, and Bonpo. In the newly created Indian state of [[Uttarkhand]], the Himalayas rise again as the Kumaon Himalayas with the high peaks of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Kamet]]. The state is also an important pilgrimage destination, with the source of the Ganges at [[Gangotri]] and the Yamuna at [[Yamunotri]], and the temples at [[Badrinath]] and [[Kedarnath]].\n\nThe next Himalayan Indian state, [[Himachal Pradesh]], it is noted for its hill stations, particularly [[Shimla]], the summer capital of the [[British Raj]], and [[Dharmasala]], the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the [[Sutlej river]], the most easterly of the five tributaries of the [[Indus]], cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of the Indian administered Union territories of [[Jammu & Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]]. The twin peaks of [[Nun Kun]] are the only mountains over {{convert|7000|m|mile|abbr=on}} in this part of the Himalayas. Beyond lies the renown [[Kashmir Valley]] and the town and lakes of [[Srinagar]]. Finally, the Himalayas reach their western end in the dramatic 8000&nbsp;m peak of [[Nanga Parbat]], which rises over {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000&nbsp;m summits. The western end terminates at a magnificent point near Nanga Parbat (killer mountain ) where Karakoram, Himalayas and Hindu Kush ranges intersects. It's situated in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of the Himalaya}}\n[[File:Himalaya-formation.gif|thumb|upright|The {{convert|6000|km||adj=mid|-plus}} journey of the India landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate) about 40 to 50 million [[Before Present|years ago]]<ref name=USGS/>]]\n\nThe Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. According to the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]], its formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The [[Arakan Yoma]] highlands in [[Burma|Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were also formed as a result of this collision.\n\nDuring the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70&nbsp;million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate (which has subsequently broken into the [[Indian Plate]] and the [[Australian Plate]]<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/95/18688.html (1995) Geologists Find: An Earth Plate Is Breaking in Two]</ref>) was moving at about {{cvt|15|cm|||}} per year. About 50&nbsp;million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian Plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density [[continental crust]], they were [[thrust fault]]ed and [[Fold (geology)|folded]] into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] along an [[oceanic trench]].<ref name=USGS/> An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine [[limestone]] from this ancient ocean.<ref>[https://www.thoughtco.com/mount-everest-overview-1435553 Mount Everest \u2013 Overview and Information] by Matt Rosenberg. ThoughtCo Updated 17 March 2017</ref>\n\nToday, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap3-Plate-Margins/Convergent/Continental-Collision|title=Plate Tectonics -The Himalayas |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=The Geological Society |access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> The Indian plate is still moving at 67&nbsp;mm per year, and over the next 10&nbsp;million years it will travel about {{cvt|1500|km|||}} into Asia. About 20&nbsp;mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5&nbsp;mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region [[seismic]]ally active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.\n\nDuring the last [[ice age]], there was a connected ice stream of [[glacier]]s between [[Kangchenjunga]] in the east and [[Nanga Parbat]] in the west.<ref name=Kuhle2011/><ref>glacier maps [http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/ downloadable]</ref> In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the [[Karakoram]], and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice.

As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. The rivers of the Himalayas drain into two large river systems:\n* The western rivers combine into the ''Indus Basin''. The [[Indus River|Indus]] itself forms the northern and western boundaries of the Himalayas. It begins in Tibet at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows north-west through India into Pakistan before turning south-west to the [[Arabian Sea]]. It is fed by several major tributaries draining the southern slopes of the Himalayas, including the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Sutlej]] rivers, the five rivers of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].\n* The other Himalayan rivers drain the ''Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin''. Its main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra]] and the [[Yamuna]], as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of [[Assam]]. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in [[Bangladesh]] and drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through the world's largest river delta, the [[Sunderbans]].<ref name=gits4u/>\n\nThe northern slopes of [[Gyala Peri]] and the peaks beyond the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Tsangpo]], sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the [[Irrawaddy River]], which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the [[Andaman Sea]]. The [[Salween]], [[Mekong]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers.

[[Lake Puma Yumco]] is one of the highest of the larger lakes at an elevation of {{cvt|5030|m|||}}.\n\nSouth of the main range, the lakes are smaller. [[Tilicho Lake]] in Nepal in the Annapurna massif is one of the highest lakes in the world.

For much of Himalayas \u2013 that on the south side of the high mountains, except in the furthest west, the most characteristic feature of the climate is the [[monsoon]]. Heavy rain arrives on the south-west monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism \u2013 the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, (or post-monsoon), winter and spring.\n\nUsing the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as ''Cwa'', [[humid subtropical climate#South Asia|Humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety|subtropical highland climate (''Cwb'')]].\n\nIn the furthest west of the Himalayas, in the west of the Kashmir valley and the Indus valley, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a dominant factor and most precipitation falls in the spring. Srinagar receives around {{convert|723|mm|abbr=on|0}} around half the rainfall of locations such as Shimla and Kathmandu, with the wettest months being March and April.\n\nThe northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold and generally wind swept particularly in the west where it has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]]. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during late winter and spring months.\n\nLocal impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by {{Convert|6.5|C-change|1}} for every {{cvt|1000|m||}} rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates from a nearly tropical climate in the foothills, to [[tundra]] and permanent snow and ice at higher elevations. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the [[rain shadow]] of large mountains can be significant, for example leading to near desert conditions in the [[Upper Mustang]] which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the [[Annapurna]] and [[Dhaulagiri]] massifs and has annual precipitation of around {{cvt|300|mm|||}}, while [[Pokhara]] on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall ({{cvt|3900|mm|disp=or||}} a year). Thus although annual precipitation is generally higher in east than the west, local variations are often more important.\n\nThe Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding [[temperate]] regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Devitt|first=Terry|title=Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau|newspaper=University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison News|date=3 May 2001|url=https://news.wisc.edu/climate-shift-linked-to-rise-of-himalayas-tibetan-plateau/|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAn acceleration of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850#Himalayas and Central Asia|ice loss across the Himalayas]] over the past 40 years has been proved with satellite photos.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu 19.

The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities.<ref name=\"O'Neill_2019\"/> The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor [[extremophile]] organisms.<ref>{{cite web|first=C.

Its prey includes members of the goat family grazing on the alpine pastures and living on the rocky terrain, notably the endemic [[bharal]] or Himalayan blue sheep. The [[Himalayan musk deer]] is also found at high altitude. Hunted for its musk, it is now rare and endangered. Other endemic or near endemic herbivores include the [[Himalayan tahr]], the [[takin]], the [[Himalayan serow]], and the [[Himalayan goral]]. The critically endangered [[Himalayan brown bear|Himalayan]] subspecies of the [[brown bear]] is found sporadically across the range as is the [[Asian black bear]]. In the mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests of the eastern Himalayas, [[Red panda]] feed in the dense understories of bamboo. Lower down the forests of the foothills are inhabited by several different primates, including the endangered [[Gee's golden langur]] and the [[Kashmir gray langur]], with highly restricted ranges in the east and west of the Himalayas respectively.<ref name=\"oneill_khecheopalri\"/>\n\nThe unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to [[climate change]]. ''[[Hydrangea hirta]]'' is an example of floral species that can be found in this area. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially [[rhododendron]], apple and ''[[Myrica esculenta|box myrtle]]''.
