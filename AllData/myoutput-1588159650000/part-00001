The film stars [[Ajith Kumar]] and [[Nayanthara]]. Produced by [[Sathya Jyothi Films]], the film was officially announced on 20 November 2017 and [[principal photography]] began in May 2018. The film was released on 10 January 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nThookku Durai is the well-respected chieftain of his village Koduvilaarpatti of [[Theni district]]. After 10 years, a thiruvizha ([[festival]]) is set to occur at the village's [[Ayyanar]] temple, when Thooku Durai's rival Kozhimuthu tries to stop it from occurring. The thiruvizha occurs thanks to Thooku Durai's intervention; however, his aunts and grandmother have been longing to see his wife and daughter. After much deliberation, Thooku Durai decides to go to Mumbai to meet them.\n\nOn the journey, Merit and Rosamani are upset over Thooku Durai's current life and remind him of his life 10-12 years ago. Thooku Durai used to be a happy-go-lucky man and rice mill owner. He was also a [[Good Samaritan]], albeit using violent ways to deal with problems. While chasing a few goons, he stumbles across Niranjana, a doctor, who witnesses his antics and lodges a case against him. When Thooku Durai sees Niranjana, he is immediately smitten by her and surrenders to the police out of the love that he has for her, but she is later forced to release him after Aavudaiyappan threatens to close her medical camp unless she pays him. After fighting the goons, Thooku Durai relocates her camp to his rice mill. Niranjana realizes her love for Thooku Durai and proposes to him, which he gladly accepts. They get married and lead a happy life, but Niranjana is disturbed by Thooku Durai's involvement into feuds. Soon, she gets pregnant and is accepted to go to one of the finest pharmaceutical programs abroad, which she refuses for Thooku Durai. After their child is born, one day, Niranjana leaves out of town, after getting a promise from Thooku Durai not to bring Swetha to any fights, and on the way to pick her up, Aavudaiyappan, waiting for revenge, picks up a fight with Thooku Durai. Thooku Durai, not finding Niranjana at the train station, finds her at home, and the baby passes out as she had been injured during the fight. After rushing to the emergency ward, she survives, but Niranjana gets infuriated at Thooku Durai and tells him to stay away from her and the baby, and she then leaves him.\n\nBack to the present day, Thooku Durai tries to meet up with Niranjana at her company, Niranjana Pharmaceuticals, to no avail. He later sees his daughter Swetha, who is in contention for the Junior National 100m title. Swetha travels home, when attempts are made to kill her Thooku Durai arrives at the nick of time to save her. It is then revealed that Gautham Veer is the one behind this as his daughter Neha had been paralyzed while attempting suicide. Gautham is the CEO of Skyline exports and owns a range of multinational companies, and expects the first position in everything, as he used to achieve the same in his earlier days, including academics and sports. He expects the same of Neha, who is slower than Swetha by milliseconds. After Gautham threatens Neha that she would find no affection in him if she loses, she resorts to [[Doping in sport|doping]], which helps her win the race. Unfortunately, this is found out by Swetha, who reports it to the authorities. Fearing that her father's reputation and affection would completely vanish, Neha attempts suicide but becomes paralyzed in the process. Gautham is distraught on seeing his daughter's condition and vows to have Swetha killed at any cost. \n\nAfter saving her, Thooku Durai requests Niranjana to appoint him as Swetha's bodyguard for the next 10 days, until her competition, on the condition that he does not reveal any information about him being her father, to which she reluctantly accepts. He enjoys being in the company of his daughter, whilst saving her from goons on multiple occasions. Thooku Durai later meets Gautham face-to-face and challenges him. Unfortunately, Thooku Durai is run over a car before Swetha's competition and is critical. Swetha then is forced to leave for America, and Thooku Durai recovers. Swetha also brings Gautham's daughter and mother. Before the competition, Gautham fights an already injured Thooku Durai, at which point Niranjana reveals that Thooku Durai is Swetha's father. Swetha lags behind during the meet as she has no encouragement. Thooku Durai fights Gautham back, reaches the track, and encourages his daughter by whistling. Swetha wins the race. At the same time, Gautham arrives at the track to attack Thooku Durai, but after seeing his daughter's recovery, he realizes his mistake. Thooku Durai tells Gautham that children should grow up as they desire and not to burden them with what the parents desire. Swetha is announced as the winner, along with Thooku Durai's name added to her name by Niranjana, and they reunite with Thooku Durai.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as Thookku Durai<ref>[https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/south-gossip/article/viswasam-motion-poster-ajith-in-his-two-looks-has-stolen-the-hearts-of-his-fans/320736 Viswasam motion poster: Ajith, in his two looks, has stolen the hearts of his fans]. timesnownews.com. 26 November 2018</ref>\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Niranjana Thooku Durai\n* [[Jagapathi Babu]] as Gautham Veer\n* [[Anikha]] as Swetha Thooku Durai\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Kesavan\n* [[Yogi Babu]] as Velu\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Rosamani\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Merit\n* [[Kovai Sarala]] as Filomina\n* [[Kalairani]] as Pechiammal, Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[Sujatha Sivakumar]] as Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[R.

After much deliberation, Thooku Durai decides to go to Mumbai to meet them.\n\nOn the journey, Merit and Rosamani are upset over Thooku Durai's current life and remind him of his life 10-12 years ago. Thooku Durai used to be a happy-go-lucky man and rice mill owner. He was also a [[Good Samaritan]], albeit using violent ways to deal with problems. While chasing a few goons, he stumbles across Niranjana, a doctor, who witnesses his antics and lodges a case against him. When Thooku Durai sees Niranjana, he is immediately smitten by her and surrenders to the police out of the love that he has for her, but she is later forced to release him after Aavudaiyappan threatens to close her medical camp unless she pays him. After fighting the goons, Thooku Durai relocates her camp to his rice mill. Niranjana realizes her love for Thooku Durai and proposes to him, which he gladly accepts. They get married and lead a happy life, but Niranjana is disturbed by Thooku Durai's involvement into feuds. Soon, she gets pregnant and is accepted to go to one of the finest pharmaceutical programs abroad, which she refuses for Thooku Durai. After their child is born, one day, Niranjana leaves out of town, after getting a promise from Thooku Durai not to bring Swetha to any fights, and on the way to pick her up, Aavudaiyappan, waiting for revenge, picks up a fight with Thooku Durai. Thooku Durai, not finding Niranjana at the train station, finds her at home, and the baby passes out as she had been injured during the fight. After rushing to the emergency ward, she survives, but Niranjana gets infuriated at Thooku Durai and tells him to stay away from her and the baby, and she then leaves him.\n\nBack to the present day, Thooku Durai tries to meet up with Niranjana at her company, Niranjana Pharmaceuticals, to no avail. He later sees his daughter Swetha, who is in contention for the Junior National 100m title. Swetha travels home, when attempts are made to kill her Thooku Durai arrives at the nick of time to save her. It is then revealed that Gautham Veer is the one behind this as his daughter Neha had been paralyzed while attempting suicide. Gautham is the CEO of Skyline exports and owns a range of multinational companies, and expects the first position in everything, as he used to achieve the same in his earlier days, including academics and sports. He expects the same of Neha, who is slower than Swetha by milliseconds. After Gautham threatens Neha that she would find no affection in him if she loses, she resorts to [[Doping in sport|doping]], which helps her win the race. Unfortunately, this is found out by Swetha, who reports it to the authorities. Fearing that her father's reputation and affection would completely vanish, Neha attempts suicide but becomes paralyzed in the process. Gautham is distraught on seeing his daughter's condition and vows to have Swetha killed at any cost. \n\nAfter saving her, Thooku Durai requests Niranjana to appoint him as Swetha's bodyguard for the next 10 days, until her competition, on the condition that he does not reveal any information about him being her father, to which she reluctantly accepts. He enjoys being in the company of his daughter, whilst saving her from goons on multiple occasions. Thooku Durai later meets Gautham face-to-face and challenges him. Unfortunately, Thooku Durai is run over a car before Swetha's competition and is critical. Swetha then is forced to leave for America, and Thooku Durai recovers. Swetha also brings Gautham's daughter and mother. Before the competition, Gautham fights an already injured Thooku Durai, at which point Niranjana reveals that Thooku Durai is Swetha's father. Swetha lags behind during the meet as she has no encouragement. Thooku Durai fights Gautham back, reaches the track, and encourages his daughter by whistling. Swetha wins the race. At the same time, Gautham arrives at the track to attack Thooku Durai, but after seeing his daughter's recovery, he realizes his mistake. Thooku Durai tells Gautham that children should grow up as they desire and not to burden them with what the parents desire. Swetha is announced as the winner, along with Thooku Durai's name added to her name by Niranjana, and they reunite with Thooku Durai.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as Thookku Durai<ref>[https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/south-gossip/article/viswasam-motion-poster-ajith-in-his-two-looks-has-stolen-the-hearts-of-his-fans/320736 Viswasam motion poster: Ajith, in his two looks, has stolen the hearts of his fans]. timesnownews.com. 26 November 2018</ref>\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Niranjana Thooku Durai\n* [[Jagapathi Babu]] as Gautham Veer\n* [[Anikha]] as Swetha Thooku Durai\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Kesavan\n* [[Yogi Babu]] as Velu\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Rosamani\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Merit\n* [[Kovai Sarala]] as Filomina\n* [[Kalairani]] as Pechiammal, Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[Sujatha Sivakumar]] as Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[R.
