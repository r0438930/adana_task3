Barnum]] and his troupe perform a show at the circus (\"The Greatest Show (Part 1)\").\n\nAs a child, Barnum and his tailor father Philo work for the Hallett family. He loves their daughter Charity who is being sent to [[finishing school]]. The two keep in touch through letters (\"A Million Dreams\"), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City. They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more.\n\nBarnum loses his job as a clerk at a shipping company after the company goes bankrupt, and returns home for Caroline's birthday (\"A Million Dreams (Reprise)\"). He takes out a loan from a bank, deceiving them into accepting his former employer's lost ships as collateral. He uses this loan to set up [[Barnum's American Museum]] in downtown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models. Initially, sales are slow. On the suggestion of his children to showcase something \"alive\", Barnum searches for \"freaks\" to serve as performers for his museum (\"Come Alive\"). He gathers a large group of them, including [[bearded lady]] Lettie Lutz. This attracts a large audience despite protests and poor reviews from well-known critic [[James Gordon Bennett Sr.|James Gordon Bennett]], prompting Barnum to rename his venture \"Barnum's Circus\".\n\nSearching for ways to further his reputation, Barnum meets playwright Phillip Carlyle and convinces him to join his venture (\"The Other Side\"). Phillip is mesmerized by the African American trapeze artist Anne Wheeler, but he hides his feelings. During a trip, Phillip arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet [[Queen Victoria]]. Afterwards, Barnum convinces famed Swedish singer [[Jenny Lind]] to perform in America with him as her manager. Lind's first American performance is a rousing success (\"Never Enough\"); during the song, Phillip and Anne are spotted by Phillip's parents as they are holding hands. As Barnum gains favor with the aristocratic patrons, he begins to distance himself from his troupe as he advises them to work on their performances without him. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local harassers (\"This Is Me\").\nThe film is also based on a real life threatre which burned down.\n\nPhillip and Anne attend the theatre but they run into Phillip's parents, who chastise Phillip for \"parading around with the help\". Anne runs off, and Phillip angrily berates them, then chases Anne and tries to convince her that they can be together, but she rejects him (\"[[Rewrite the Stars]]\"). As Barnum takes Lind on a US tour, Charity feels isolated from her husband as she stays home with their daughters (\"Tightrope\"). While on tour, Lind begins falling in love with Barnum. When he refuses her advances, she threatens to quit and orchestrates a kiss with him at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press (\"Never Enough (Reprise)\").\n\nBarnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between the protesters and the troupe. Phillip runs into the burning building, believing that Anne is still inside, and suffers serious injuries before being rescued by Barnum. Barnum gets word from a sympathetic Bennett that the culprits have been caught and that Lind has canceled her tour after her and Barnum's \"scandal\". Barnum's mansion is foreclosed upon and Charity takes their daughters to her parents' home.\n\nDevastated by his selfishness, Barnum retreats to a local bar where his troupe find him and explain that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family that needs him. Inspired, he resolves to start a new show and not let ambition overtake his love (\"From Now On\"). Phillip wakes in a hospital with Anne by his side. Barnum finds Charity and they mend their relationship.\n\nBarnum is faced with the financial difficulty of rebuilding the circus, but the recovering Phillip steps in, offering to use his share of the circus's profits to rebuild it under condition of becoming a full partner, which Barnum happily accepts. To save money, Barnum transforms the enterprise into an open-air tent circus by the docks.\n\nThe revamped circus is a huge success (\"The Greatest Show (Part 2)\"). Barnum gives full control of the show to Phillip to spend more time with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[P.&nbsp;T.

Barnum]] and his troupe perform a show at the circus (\"The Greatest Show (Part 1)\").\n\nAs a child, Barnum and his tailor father Philo work for the Hallett family. He loves their daughter Charity who is being sent to [[finishing school]]. The two keep in touch through letters (\"A Million Dreams\"), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City. They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more.\n\nBarnum loses his job as a clerk at a shipping company after the company goes bankrupt, and returns home for Caroline's birthday (\"A Million Dreams (Reprise)\"). He takes out a loan from a bank, deceiving them into accepting his former employer's lost ships as collateral. He uses this loan to set up [[Barnum's American Museum]] in downtown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models. Initially, sales are slow. On the suggestion of his children to showcase something \"alive\", Barnum searches for \"freaks\" to serve as performers for his museum (\"Come Alive\"). He gathers a large group of them, including [[bearded lady]] Lettie Lutz. This attracts a large audience despite protests and poor reviews from well-known critic [[James Gordon Bennett Sr.|James Gordon Bennett]], prompting Barnum to rename his venture \"Barnum's Circus\".\n\nSearching for ways to further his reputation, Barnum meets playwright Phillip Carlyle and convinces him to join his venture (\"The Other Side\"). Phillip is mesmerized by the African American trapeze artist Anne Wheeler, but he hides his feelings. During a trip, Phillip arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet [[Queen Victoria]]. Afterwards, Barnum convinces famed Swedish singer [[Jenny Lind]] to perform in America with him as her manager. Lind's first American performance is a rousing success (\"Never Enough\"); during the song, Phillip and Anne are spotted by Phillip's parents as they are holding hands. As Barnum gains favor with the aristocratic patrons, he begins to distance himself from his troupe as he advises them to work on their performances without him. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local harassers (\"This Is Me\").\n\nPhillip and Anne attend the theatre but they run into Phillip's parents, who chastise Phillip for \"parading around with the help\". Anne runs off, and Phillip angrily berates them, then chases Anne and tries to convince her that they can be together, but she rejects him (\"[[Rewrite the Stars]]\"). As Barnum takes Lind on a US tour, Charity feels isolated from her husband as she stays home with their daughters (\"Tightrope\"). While on tour, Lind begins falling in love with Barnum. When he refuses her advances, she threatens to quit and orchestrates a kiss with him at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press (\"Never Enough (Reprise)\").\n\nBarnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between the protesters and the troupe. Phillip runs into the burning building, believing that Anne is still inside, and suffers serious injuries before being rescued by Barnum. Barnum gets word from a sympathetic Bennett that the culprits have been caught and that Lind has canceled her tour after her and Barnum's \"scandal\". Barnum's mansion is foreclosed upon and Charity takes their daughters to her parents' home.\n\nDevastated by his selfishness, Barnum retreats to a local bar where his troupe find him and explain that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family that needs him. Inspired, he resolves to start a new show and not let ambition overtake his love (\"From Now On\"). Phillip wakes in a hospital with Anne by his side. Barnum finds Charity and they mend their relationship.\n\nBarnum is faced with the financial difficulty of rebuilding the circus, but the recovering Phillip steps in, offering to use his share of the circus's profits to rebuild it under condition of becoming a full partner, which Barnum happily accepts. To save money, Barnum transforms the enterprise into an open-air tent circus by the docks.\n\nThe revamped circus is a huge success (\"The Greatest Show (Part 2)\"). Barnum gives full control of the show to Phillip to spend more time with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[P.&nbsp;T.
