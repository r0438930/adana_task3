The cartoon stars [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]] on a near disastrous road trip in a [[travel trailer]]. It was directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]] and features the voices of [[Walt Disney]] as Mickey, [[Clarence Nash]] as Donald, and [[Pinto Colvig]] as Goofy. Animators include Ed Love, Louie Schmitt, Johnny Cannon, Don Patterson, Clyde Geronimi, Tom Palmer, Frenchy de Tr\u00e9maudan and Cy Young.<ref name=bcdb>\"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/3993-Mickeys_Trailer.html Mickey's Trailer]\".

This cartoon was released a year after ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie starts at what seems like a small house in a natural setting. Mickey walks out the door and says, \"Oh boy! What a day!\" Then, he pulls a lever and walks inside. The house is converted into a trailer (with the natural setting in the shape of a giant hand fan revealed to be a city dump) and Goofy's car is released from the side. Then, Goofy starts driving through the countryside while Mickey makes dinner-like breakfast (corn on the cob, baked potatoes, watermelon, coffee, and milk). Meanwhile, Donald can't wake up, even when his alarm clock rings and pulls off his blanket. Thanks to a secret controlboard, Mickey manages to rouse him for a machine-assisted bath, but he sees birds and tries to swat them with the towel. Later, the bath is converted into a dining area.\n\nWhen Mickey rings the dinner bell, Goofy foolishly leaves the driver's seat - while the car and trailer are still in motion and without stopping - for breakfast, in which it drives through a closed road. After several mishaps during the meal, eventually having popcorn for breakfast, Goofy notices that no one is in the driver's seat and accidentally and unknowingly unhitches the trailer in his panic to resume driving and goes on his way. The trailer rolls downhill on an epic runaway adventure, nearly crashing into a truck and two trains and is a wreck on the inside (but okay on the outside) by the time it's miraculously rehitched to the car. Unaware of the dramatic events, Goofy, who was singing \"''She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain When She Comes''\" while driving down the hill, says in the end, \"Well, I brought you down, safe and sound.\"\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Mickey Mouse: [[Walt Disney]]\n* Donald Duck: [[Clarence Nash]]\n* Goofy: [[Pinto Colvig]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hischak |first1=Thomas S. |title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn=978-0786462711 |page=257 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Disney_Voice_Actors/e1RTP8thtR0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=traffic+troubles+mickey+mouse&pg=PA257&printsec=frontcover |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Home video==\nA Fisher-Price version of the movie (and silent), was released for the Movie Viewer in 1974, and lasted until 1979.
