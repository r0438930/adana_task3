He assumed management positions at various [[state-owned companies]]. In 1978, he was elected as [[Dewan Rakyat|Member of Parliament]] for [[Pagoh]]. During his term as Member of Parliament, he was appointed [[List of Parliamentary Secretaries of Malaysia|Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|minister of foreign affairs]], [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Deputy ministers|deputy minister of federal territories]] and later [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Composition before cabinet dissolution|deputy minister of trade and industry]]. As Johor UMNO chief, he was [[Menteri Besar of Johor|the state's Menteri Besar]] from 1986 to 1995.\n\nHe returned to federal politics [[1995 Malaysian general election|in 1995]] and was appointed to the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Minister of Youth and Sports]].

He received his secondary education at the Muar High School, Johor. Subsequently, he attended the [[University of Malaya]], Kuala Lumpur and received an honours bachelor's degree in economics and Malay studies in 1971.\n\n==Early career==\nAfter the completion of his studies, Muhyiddin joined the Johor state public service as the assistant secretary of training and scholarship. In 1974, he was appointed the assistant district officer (ADO) of [[Muar District|Muar]]. He left the civil service to join the corporate sector in the Johor State Economic Development Corporation (PKENJ), managing its subsidiary companies like Sergam Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131977), Equity Mal (Johore) Sdn Bhd as Director (1974\u20131978), Sri Saujana Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131978) and SGS Ates (M) Sdn Bhd as [[Human Resources Manager]] (1974).\n\n== Political career ==\nMuhyiddin's involvement in politics began when he joined [[UMNO]] as ordinary member at the [[Pagoh]] division in 1971. He was elected as [[UMNO]] Youth Chief of the Pagoh division and the Secretary in 1976. Later he became Youth Chief of Johor state [[UMNO]] Youth until 1987.\n\nMuhyiddin occupied the seats of Exco in the national Malaysia UMNO Youth. In 1984, Muhyiddin was elected the UMNO Division Chief of Pagoh replacing [[Othman Saat]]. Muhyiddin rose up the ranks and file of Johor UMNO quickly. From being a state executive council member, he rose to become [[Johor]] UMNO's head and later became Menteri Besar of Johor.\n\nMuhyiddin contested and was elected Member of Parliament for the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh constituency]] in the 1978 general election and kept the seat until 1982. Muhyiddin was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; subsequently he was promoted to Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Federal Territories and later the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In the 1986 general election, Muhyiddin contested and won the [[Johor State Legislative Assembly|Johor State Legislative]] constituency seat of Bukit Serampang, opening the path for him to become the [[Menteri Besar of Johor]] on 13 August 1986.\n\nHis tenure as Menteri Besar lasted until 6 May 1995.\n\nMuhyiddin returned to contest the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh parliamentary seat]] in the [[1995 Malaysian general election|1995 General Election]].\n\nHe served several different federal government cabinet posts as [[Minister of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Minister of Youth and Sports]] (1995\u20131999), [[Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (Malaysia)|Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs]] (1999\u20132004), [[Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry]] (2004\u20132008) and [[Minister of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia)|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] (2008\u20132009). He was appointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]], and [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister of Education]], by Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] in 2009.\n\nIn 1984, Muhyiddin contested a UMNO Supreme Council seat but lost. Muhyiddin was later appointed the UMNO Johor state liaison chairman and next appointed a Supreme Council member. In November 1990 he was a candidate for the UMNO vice-presidency, but lost again. Muhyiddin attempted again in the November 1993 UMNO party election, successfully this time. But he lost the 1996 election when defending the vice-president post. Eventually, in the election in 2000, he again won the post of vice-president of UMNO, remaining in that post until the October 2008 party election, when Muhyiddin successfully sought the higher post of deputy president, which was left vacant as the incumbent, Najib Razak (who was acting party president after the retirement of [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]), became UMNO president.\n\n==2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election==\nMuhyiddin attacked [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]'s original transition plan as \"too long\", and some people say that at one point Muhyiddin was about to ask and force Abdullah to quit, though he never did so directly. During the 2008 general election, Muhyiddin managed to keep his seat and remained as an UMNO leader. Shocked by the election results, he called for reforms.\n\nDuring the 2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election, Muhyiddin was a candidate for the deputy president post which was vacated by the incoming prime minister [[Najib Tun Razak]]. He was challenged by [[Mohd Ali Rustam]], Malacca chief minister, and [[Muhammad Muhammad Taib]], Rural and Regional Development Minister. Muhyiddin, seen as a supporter of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], was seen to be the front-runner for the race, garnering many nominations by the UMNO divisions. But the competition was tough, as Taib and Rustam gained more ground especially from the Badawi camp. The race was tipped by political analysts to be very tight. However, the UMNO supreme council decided to disqualify Ali Rustam's candidacy after his assistants were caught involved with corruption after an investigation. The election resulted in Muhyiddin's election to the post with 1,575 votes to Muhammad Taib's 916.\n\n==Deputy Prime Minister==\n\nMuhyiddin was appointed deputy prime minister on 9 April 2009, when Najib took over from Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and unveiled his [[First Najib cabinet|first Cabinet]].\n\nContinuing as [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister for Education]], he announced the decision to return to the teaching of mathematics and science in Malay in all government primary and secondary schools.<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision \"Muhyiddin defends PPSMI decision\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825153840/http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision |date=25 August 2009 }}, ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'', 21 July 2009.</ref>\n\nMuhyiddin waded into controversy in March 2010 by stating he was '[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] first' rather than 'Malaysian first'.<ref>{{YouTube|_rxiJSs7aYE|Muhyiddin: I'm Malay first}} 31 March 2010</ref> He also said that there is nothing wrong with other races doing the same; for example, the Chinese could claim themselves to be \"[[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] first, [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] second\" and same for the [[Malaysian Indians|Indians]].

He assumed management positions at various [[state-owned companies]]. In 1978, he was elected as [[Dewan Rakyat|Member of Parliament]] for [[Pagoh]]. During his term as Member of Parliament, he was appointed [[List of Parliamentary Secretaries of Malaysia|Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|minister of foreign affairs]], [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Deputy ministers|deputy minister of federal territories]] and later [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Composition before cabinet dissolution|deputy minister of trade and industry]].

He received his secondary education at the Muar High School, Johor. Subsequently, he attended the [[University of Malaya]], Kuala Lumpur and received an honours bachelor's degree in economics and Malay studies in 1971.\n\n==Early career==\nAfter the completion of his studies, Muhyiddin joined the Johor state public service as the assistant secretary of training and scholarship. In 1974, he was appointed the assistant district officer (ADO) of [[Muar District|Muar]]. He left the civil service to join the corporate sector in the Johor State Economic Development Corporation (PKENJ), managing its subsidiary companies like Sergam Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131977), Equity Mal (Johore) Sdn Bhd as Director (1974\u20131978), Sri Saujana Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131978) and SGS Ates (M) Sdn Bhd as [[Human Resources Manager]] (1974).\n\n== Political career ==\nMuhyiddin's involvement in politics began when he joined [[UMNO]] as ordinary member at the [[Pagoh]] division in 1971. He was elected as [[UMNO]] Youth Chief of the Pagoh division and the Secretary in 1976. Later he became Youth Chief of Johor state [[UMNO]] Youth until 1987.\n\nMuhyiddin occupied the seats of Exco in the national Malaysia UMNO Youth. In 1984, Muhyiddin was elected the UMNO Division Chief of Pagoh replacing [[Othman Saat]]. Muhyiddin rose up the ranks and file of Johor UMNO quickly. From being a state executive council member, he rose to become [[Johor]] UMNO's head and later became Menteri Besar of Johor.\n\nMuhyiddin contested and was elected Member of Parliament for the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh constituency]] in the 1978 general election and kept the seat until 1982. Muhyiddin was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; subsequently he was promoted to Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Federal Territories and later the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In the 1986 general election, Muhyiddin contested and won the [[Johor State Legislative Assembly|Johor State Legislative]] constituency seat of Bukit Serampang, opening the path for him to become the [[Menteri Besar of Johor]] on 13 August 1986.\n\nHis tenure as Menteri Besar lasted until 6 May 1995.\n\nMuhyiddin returned to contest the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh parliamentary seat]] in the [[1995 Malaysian general election|1995 General Election]].\n\nHe served several different federal government cabinet posts as [[Minister of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Minister of Youth and Sports]] (1995\u20131999), [[Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (Malaysia)|Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs]] (1999\u20132004), [[Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry]] (2004\u20132008) and [[Minister of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia)|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] (2008\u20132009). He was appointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]], and [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister of Education]], by Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] in 2009.\n\nIn 1984, Muhyiddin contested a UMNO Supreme Council seat but lost. Muhyiddin was later appointed the UMNO Johor state liaison chairman and next appointed a Supreme Council member. In November 1990 he was a candidate for the UMNO vice-presidency, but lost again. Muhyiddin attempted again in the November 1993 UMNO party election, successfully this time. But he lost the 1996 election when defending the vice-president post. Eventually, in the election in 2000, he again won the post of vice-president of UMNO, remaining in that post until the October 2008 party election, when Muhyiddin successfully sought the higher post of deputy president, which was left vacant as the incumbent, Najib Razak (who was acting party president after the retirement of [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]), became UMNO president.\n\n==2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election==\nMuhyiddin attacked [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]'s original transition plan as \"too long\", and some people say that at one point Muhyiddin was about to ask and force Abdullah to quit, though he never did so directly. During the 2008 general election, Muhyiddin managed to keep his seat and remained as an UMNO leader. Shocked by the election results, he called for reforms.\n\nDuring the 2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election, Muhyiddin was a candidate for the deputy president post which was vacated by the incoming prime minister [[Najib Tun Razak]]. He was challenged by [[Mohd Ali Rustam]], Malacca chief minister, and [[Muhammad Muhammad Taib]], Rural and Regional Development Minister. Muhyiddin, seen as a supporter of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], was seen to be the front-runner for the race, garnering many nominations by the UMNO divisions. But the competition was tough, as Taib and Rustam gained more ground especially from the Badawi camp. The race was tipped by political analysts to be very tight. However, the UMNO supreme council decided to disqualify Ali Rustam's candidacy after his assistants were caught involved with corruption after an investigation. The election resulted in Muhyiddin's election to the post with 1,575 votes to Muhammad Taib's 916.\n\n==Deputy Prime Minister==\n\nMuhyiddin was appointed deputy prime minister on 9 April 2009, when Najib took over from Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and unveiled his [[First Najib cabinet|first Cabinet]].\n\nContinuing as [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister for Education]], he announced the decision to return to the teaching of mathematics and science in Malay in all government primary and secondary schools.<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision \"Muhyiddin defends PPSMI decision\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825153840/http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision |date=25 August 2009 }}, ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'', 21 July 2009.</ref>\n\nMuhyiddin waded into controversy in March 2010 by stating he was '[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] first' rather than 'Malaysian first'.<ref>{{YouTube|_rxiJSs7aYE|Muhyiddin: I'm Malay first}} 31 March 2010</ref> He also said that there is nothing wrong with other races doing the same; for example, the Chinese could claim themselves to be \"[[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] first, [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] second\" and same for the [[Malaysian Indians|Indians]].
