This is a type of deformity that starts and progresses because of the collapse of the vertebral column in an asymmetrical manner. As bones start to become weaker and the ligaments and discs located in the spine become worn as a result of age-related changes, the spine begins to curve. The word 'de novo' is associated with this form of scoliosis as it means 'new', referring to the occurrence of the condition during later life.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Scoliosis cobb.gif|thumb|upright|[[Cobb angle]] measurement of a scoliosis]]\n\nPeople who initially present with scoliosis undergo physical examination to determine whether the deformity has an underlying cause and to exclude the possibility of the underlying condition more serious than simple scoliosis.\n\nThe person's [[gait analysis|gait is assessed]], with an exam for [[sign (medicine)|sign]]s of other abnormalities (e.g., [[spina bifida]] as evidenced by a [[dimple]], hairy patch, [[lipoma]], or [[hemangioma]]).  A thorough [[neurological examination]] is also performed, the [[skin]] for [[caf\u00e9 au lait spot|''caf\u00e9 au lait'' spots]], indicative of [[neurofibromatosis]], the feet for [[Pes cavus|cavovarus deformity]], abdominal reflexes and muscle tone for [[spasticity]].\n\nWhen a person can cooperate, he or she is asked to bend forward as far as possible.

Full-length standing spine [[radiography|X-ray]]s are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of the scoliosis, and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature. In growing individuals, serial radiographs are obtained at 3- to 12-month intervals to follow curve progression, and, in some instances, [[MRI]] investigation is warranted to look at the spinal cord.<ref name=\"ScoliosisMRI\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim HS, Moon ES, Yoon CS, Chung TS, Song HT, Suh JS, Lee YH, Kim S | title = Scoliosis imaging: what radiologists should know | journal = Radiographics | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 1823\u201342 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21057122 | doi = 10.1148/rg.307105061 | quote = The main purpose of performing CT or MR imaging in a patient with scoliosis is to identify an underlying cause.

Nevertheless, two reasons for performing such screening are plausible: First, the treatment of an underlying neurologic lesion could help alleviate progressive neurologic deterioration and lead to improvement or stabilization of scoliosis; second, surgery performed to correct scoliosis in the presence of an underlying neurologic disorder that has not been identified and treated could result in new or additional neurologic deficits. }}</ref>\n\nThe standard method for assessing the curvature quantitatively is measuring the [[Cobb angle]], which is the angle between two lines, drawn perpendicular to the upper endplate of the uppermost vertebra involved and the lower endplate of the lowest vertebra involved.

In some people, lateral-bending X-rays are obtained to assess the flexibility of the curves or the primary and compensatory curves.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nCongenital and idiopathic scoliosis that develops before the age of 10 is referred to as early-onset scoliosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srs.org/patients-and-families/conditions-and-treatments/parents/scoliosis/early-onset-scoliosis|title=Early Onset Scoliosis {{!}} Scoliosis Research Society|website=www.srs.org|access-date=10 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621014135/http://www.srs.org/patients-and-families/conditions-and-treatments/parents/scoliosis/early-onset-scoliosis|archive-date=21 June 2016}}</ref> Scoliosis that develops after 10 is referred to as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.<ref name=GHR2013/> Screening adolescents without symptoms for scoliosis is of unclear benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman DC, Curry SJ, Owens DK, Barry MJ, Davidson KW, Doubeni CA, Epling JW, Kemper AR, Krist AH, Kurth AE, Landefeld CS, Mangione CM, Phipps MG, Silverstein M, Simon MA, Tseng CW | title = Screening for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | journal = JAMA | volume = 319 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u2013172 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29318284 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2017.19342 }}</ref>\n\n===Definition===\nScoliosis is defined as a three-dimensional deviation in the axis of a person's [[vertebral column|spine]].<ref name=\"trobisch-2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Trobisch P, Suess O, Schwab F | title = Idiopathic scoliosis | journal = Deutsches Arzteblatt International | volume = 107 | issue = 49 | pages = 875\u201383;

In some cases with juveniles, bracing has reduced curves significantly, going from a 40\u00b0 (of the curve, mentioned in length above) out of the brace to 18\u00b0. Braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis. Bracing involves fitting the person with a device that covers the torso; in some cases, it extends to the neck.\n\nThe most commonly used brace is a [[TLSO]], such as a [[Boston brace]], a [[corset]]-like appliance that fits from armpits to hips and is custom-made from fiberglass or plastic. It is sometimes worn 22\u201323 hours a day, depending on the doctor's prescription, and applies pressure on the curves in the spine. The effectiveness of the brace depends on not only brace design and [[orthotist]] skill, but also people's compliance and amount of wear per day.\nThe typical use of braces is for idiopathic curves that are not grave enough to warrant surgery, but they may also be used to prevent the progression of more severe curves in young children, to buy the child time to grow before performing surgery, which would prevent further growth in the part of the spine affected.\n\nIndications for bracing: people who are still growing who present with Cobb angles less than 20\u00b0 should be closely monitored. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles of 20 to 29\u00b0 should be braced according to the risk of progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles greater than 30\u00b0 should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person will fit into this table.\n\nFor example, a person who is still growing with a 17\u00b0 Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flat back could be considered for nighttime bracing. On the opposite end of the growth spectrum, a 29\u00b0 Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because the potential for progression is reduced.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wood | first = Grant | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2013 | title = Academy Today (The Edge) | publisher = American Academy of Orthosits and Prosthetist. | chapter = To Brace or Not to Brace: The Three-Dimensional Nature and Growth Considerations for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis | pages = 5\u20138 }}</ref> The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25\u00b0, curves presenting between 30 and 45\u00b0, [[Risser sign]] 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.<ref name=\"Herring JA 2002\"/>\n\nScoliosis braces are usually comfortable, especially when well designed and well fitted, also after the 7- to 10-day break-in period.

In the mid-20th century, new treatments and improved screening methods have been developed to reduce the progression of scoliosis in patients and alleviate the associated pain they suffer. School children were during this period believed to suffer from poor posture as a result of working at their desks, and many were diagnosed with scoliosis.

Because of the constant pressure applied to the spine, the brace was uncomfortable. It caused jaw and muscle pain, skin irritation, as well as low self-esteem.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Surgery===\nIn 1962, the American orthopaedic surgeon [[Paul Randall Harrington|Paul Harrington]] introduced a metal spinal system of instrumentation that assisted with straightening the spine, as well as holding it rigid while [[Spinal fusion|fusion]] took place. The now obsolete [[Harrington rod]] operated on a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet system]], attached by hooks to the spine at the top and bottom of the curvature that when cranked would distract\u2014or straighten\u2014the curve. The Harrington rod obviates the need for prolonged casting, allowing patients greater mobility in the postoperative period and significantly reducing the quality of life burden of fusion surgery. The Harrington rod was the precursor to most modern spinal instrumentation systems. A major shortcoming was that it failed to produce a posture wherein the skull would be in proper alignment with the pelvis, and it did not address rotational deformity. As the person aged, there would be increased wear and tear, early onset [[arthritis]], disc degeneration, muscular stiffness, and acute pain.

Some of the [[lumbar vertebrae]] in Pan are \"captured\", meaning that they are held fast between the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] bones of the pelvis. Compared to humans, [[Old World monkey]]s have far larger [[erector spinae muscles]], which are the muscles which hold the spine steady.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/> These factors make the [[lumbar spine]] of most primates less flexible and far less likely to deviate than those of humans. While this may explicitly relate only to lumbar scoliosis, small imbalances in the lumbar spine could precipitate thoracic problems as well.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/>\n\nScoliosis may be a byproduct of strong selection for [[bipedalism]]. For a bipedal stance, a highly mobile, elongated lower spine is very beneficial.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/> For instance, the human spine takes on an S-shaped curve with [[lumbar lordosis]], which allows for better balance and support of an upright trunk.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harcourt-Smith|first=William E|title=Handbook of Paleoanthropology|year=2007|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Chapter 5|pages=1483\u20131518}}</ref> Selection for bipedality was likely strong enough to justify the maintenance of such a disorder. Bipedality is hypothesized to have emerged for a variety of different reasons, many of which would have certainly conferred fitness advantages.

Their fossils indicate that there may have been selected over time for a slight reduction in lumbar length to what we see today, favouring a spine that could efficiently support bipedality with a lower risk of scoliosis.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\nThe cost of scoliosis involves both monetary losses and lifestyle limitations that increase with severity.

This is a type of deformity that starts and progresses because of the collapse of the vertebral column in an asymmetrical manner. As bones start to become weaker and the ligaments and discs located in the spine become worn as a result of age-related changes, the spine begins to curve. The word 'de novo' is associated with this form of scoliosis as it means 'new', referring to the occurrence of the condition during later life.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Scoliosis cobb.gif|thumb|upright|[[Cobb angle]] measurement of a scoliosis]]\n\nPeople who initially present with scoliosis undergo physical examination to determine whether the deformity has an underlying cause and to exclude the possibility of the underlying condition more serious than simple scoliosis.\n\nThe person's [[gait analysis|gait is assessed]], with an exam for [[sign (medicine)|sign]]s of other abnormalities (e.g., [[spina bifida]] as evidenced by a [[dimple]], hairy patch, [[lipoma]], or [[hemangioma]]).  A thorough [[neurological examination]] is also performed, the [[skin]] for [[caf\u00e9 au lait spot|''caf\u00e9 au lait'' spots]], indicative of [[neurofibromatosis]], the feet for [[Pes cavus|cavovarus deformity]], abdominal reflexes and muscle tone for [[spasticity]].\n\nWhen a person can cooperate, he or she is asked to bend forward as far as possible.

Full-length standing spine [[radiography|X-ray]]s are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of the scoliosis, and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature. In growing individuals, serial radiographs are obtained at 3- to 12-month intervals to follow curve progression, and, in some instances, [[MRI]] investigation is warranted to look at the spinal cord.<ref name=\"ScoliosisMRI\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim HS, Moon ES, Yoon CS, Chung TS, Song HT, Suh JS, Lee YH, Kim S | title = Scoliosis imaging: what radiologists should know | journal = Radiographics | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 1823\u201342 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21057122 | doi = 10.1148/rg.307105061 | quote = The main purpose of performing CT or MR imaging in a patient with scoliosis is to identify an underlying cause.

In some cases with juveniles, bracing has reduced curves significantly, going from a 40\u00b0 (of the curve, mentioned in length above) out of the brace to 18\u00b0. Braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis. Bracing involves fitting the person with a device that covers the torso; in some cases, it extends to the neck.\n\nThe most commonly used brace is a [[TLSO]], such as a [[Boston brace]], a [[corset]]-like appliance that fits from armpits to hips and is custom-made from fiberglass or plastic. It is sometimes worn 22\u201323 hours a day, depending on the doctor's prescription, and applies pressure on the curves in the spine. The effectiveness of the brace depends on not only brace design and [[orthotist]] skill, but also people's compliance and amount of wear per day.\nThe typical use of braces is for idiopathic curves that are not grave enough to warrant surgery, but they may also be used to prevent the progression of more severe curves in young children, to buy the child time to grow before performing surgery, which would prevent further growth in the part of the spine affected.\n\nIndications for bracing: people who are still growing who present with Cobb angles less than 20\u00b0 should be closely monitored. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles of 20 to 29\u00b0 should be braced according to the risk of progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles greater than 30\u00b0 should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person will fit into this table.\n\nFor example, a person who is still growing with a 17\u00b0 Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flat back could be considered for nighttime bracing. On the opposite end of the growth spectrum, a 29\u00b0 Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because the potential for progression is reduced.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wood | first = Grant | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2013 | title = Academy Today (The Edge) | publisher = American Academy of Orthosits and Prosthetist. | chapter = To Brace or Not to Brace: The Three-Dimensional Nature and Growth Considerations for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis | pages = 5\u20138 }}</ref> The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25\u00b0, curves presenting between 30 and 45\u00b0, [[Risser sign]] 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.<ref name=\"Herring JA 2002\"/>\n\nScoliosis braces are usually comfortable, especially when well designed and well fitted, also after the 7- to 10-day break-in period.

These patients were treated with questionable remedies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Linker B | title = A dangerous curve: the role of history in America's scoliosis screening programs | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 606\u201316 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22397340 | pmc = 3489358 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300531 }}</ref> A theory at the time\u2014now discredited\u2014was that the condition needed to be detected early to halt its progression, and so some schools made screening for scoliosis mandatory. Measurements of shoulder height, leg length and spinal curvature were made, and the ability to bend forwards, along with body posture, was tested, but students were sometimes misdiagnosed because of their poor posture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAn early treatment was the [[Milwaukee brace]], a rigid contraption of metal rods attached to a plastic or leather girdle, designed to straighten the spine. Because of the constant pressure applied to the spine, the brace was uncomfortable. It caused jaw and muscle pain, skin irritation, as well as low self-esteem.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Surgery===\nIn 1962, the American orthopaedic surgeon [[Paul Randall Harrington|Paul Harrington]] introduced a metal spinal system of instrumentation that assisted with straightening the spine, as well as holding it rigid while [[Spinal fusion|fusion]] took place. The now obsolete [[Harrington rod]] operated on a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet system]], attached by hooks to the spine at the top and bottom of the curvature that when cranked would distract\u2014or straighten\u2014the curve. The Harrington rod obviates the need for prolonged casting, allowing patients greater mobility in the postoperative period and significantly reducing the quality of life burden of fusion surgery. The Harrington rod was the precursor to most modern spinal instrumentation systems. A major shortcoming was that it failed to produce a posture wherein the skull would be in proper alignment with the pelvis, and it did not address rotational deformity. As the person aged, there would be increased wear and tear, early onset [[arthritis]], disc degeneration, muscular stiffness, and acute pain. [http://www.iscoliosis.com/symptoms-flat.html \"Flatback\"] became the medical name for a related complication, especially for those who had [[lumbar]] scoliosis.<ref name=\"news-medical1\">[http://www.news-medical.net/health/Scoliosis-Surgery.aspx Scoliosis Surgery].

Post-operative recovery involved bed rest, casts, and braces. Poor results became apparent over time.<ref name=bridwell-2014>{{cite web |url=http://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/scoliosis/idiopathic-scoliosis-options-fixation-fusion-thoracic-curves |title=Idiopathic Scoliosis: Options of Fixation and Fusion of Thoracic Curves |author=Keith Bridwell |publisher=SpineUniverse |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, an improved technique was developed using two rods and wires attached at each level of the spine. This segmented instrumentation system allowed patients to become mobile soon after surgery.<ref name=bridwell-2014/>\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation]] improved fixation and addressed [[sagittal]] imbalance and rotational defects unresolved by the Harrington rod system. This technique used multiple hooks with rods to give stronger fixation in three dimensions, usually eliminating the need for postoperative bracing.<ref name=bridwell-2014/>\n\n===Evolution===\n[[File:Abnormal bone growth.jpg|thumb|upright|A 14\u201315th century woman who had severe scoliosis, and died at about 35 years, Limburgs Museum [[Venlo]]]]\n\nThere are links between human spinal morphology, bipedality, and scoliosis which suggest an evolutionary basis for the condition. Scoliosis has not been found in [[chimpanzee]]s or [[gorilla]]s.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lovejoy OC | year = 2005 | title = The natural history of human gait and posture: Part 1.

Some of the [[lumbar vertebrae]] in Pan are \"captured\", meaning that they are held fast between the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] bones of the pelvis. Compared to humans, [[Old World monkey]]s have far larger [[erector spinae muscles]], which are the muscles which hold the spine steady.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/> These factors make the [[lumbar spine]] of most primates less flexible and far less likely to deviate than those of humans. While this may explicitly relate only to lumbar scoliosis, small imbalances in the lumbar spine could precipitate thoracic problems as well.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/>\n\nScoliosis may be a byproduct of strong selection for [[bipedalism]]. For a bipedal stance, a highly mobile, elongated lower spine is very beneficial.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/> For instance, the human spine takes on an S-shaped curve with [[lumbar lordosis]], which allows for better balance and support of an upright trunk.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harcourt-Smith|first=William E|title=Handbook of Paleoanthropology|year=2007|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Chapter 5|pages=1483\u20131518}}</ref> Selection for bipedality was likely strong enough to justify the maintenance of such a disorder. Bipedality is hypothesized to have emerged for a variety of different reasons, many of which would have certainly conferred fitness advantages. It may increase viewing distance, which can be beneficial in hunting and foraging as well as protection from predators or other humans; it makes long-distance travel more efficient for foraging or hunting; and it facilitates terrestrial feeding from grasses, trees, and bushes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Kevin D|title=The evolution of human bipedality: ecology and functional morphology|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=March 1994|volume=26|issue=3|pages=182\u2013202|doi=10.1006/jhev.1994.1011}}</ref> Given the many benefits of bipedality which depends on a particularly formed spine, it is likely that selection for bipedalism played a large role in the development of the spine as we see it today, in spite of the potential for \"scoliotic deviations\".<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/> According to the fossil record, scoliosis may have been more prevalent among earlier hominids such as [[Australopithecus]] and [[Homo erectus]], when bipedality was first emerging. Their fossils indicate that there may have been selected over time for a slight reduction in lumbar length to what we see today, favouring a spine that could efficiently support bipedality with a lower risk of scoliosis.<ref name=\"Lovejoy OC 2005\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\nThe cost of scoliosis involves both monetary losses and lifestyle limitations that increase with severity.
