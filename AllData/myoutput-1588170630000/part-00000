Boyett]], [[Thomas L. Miller]] and [[Chris Thompson (TV producer)|Chris Thompson]] ([[Miller-Boyett Productions|Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions]]). It aired for two seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from November 27, 1980, to March 27, 1982, and in reruns in the summer of 1984 on [[NBC]]. The show features the misadventures of two single men, working in creative advertising, struggling in their industry while disguising themselves as women in order to live in the one apartment they could afford. Gender stereotypes and male/female interpersonal relationships were frequent themes.\n\nThe show became known for its quirky humor and its frequent use of [[improvisation]], especially between stars Hanks and Scolari. Though the show started out with good ratings, it failed to hold the public's interest and was canceled after two seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nIn the pilot episode, after their own apartment is demolished (while they are still asleep in it), two men disguise themselves as women in order to live in the dirt-cheap Susan B. Anthony Hotel (which happens to be female-only). Kip Wilson (Hanks) is originally skeptical of the plan, but after meeting gorgeous resident model/dancer/nurse Sonny Lumet ([[Donna Dixon]]), he ends up convincing aspiring writer Henry Desmond (Scolari) that the experience will make a great book. Their co-worker, Amy Cassidy ([[Wendie Jo Sperber]]) [who's attracted to Henry] is the only resident in on the plan. The boys\u2019 deception includes outwitting the hotel manager, Darlene ([[Edie Adams]]), and fellow resident, Isabelle Hammond ([[Telma Hopkins]]), an aspiring singer. When the pilot sold to ABC, the character of Darlene was replaced by Lilly Sinclair ([[Lucille Benson]]).\n\nIn the first season, Kip, Henry, and Amy work for Ruth Dunbar ([[Holland Taylor]]) at the [[Manhattan]]-based advertising firm of Livingston, Gentry & Mishkin, where Kip is a graphic artist, Henry is a copy writer, and Amy is the receptionist. Ruth often takes credit for the boys\u2019 work when reporting to her (unseen) boss, Mr. Rubinowitz.\n\nThe show was barely renewed for a second season. In order to improve the mediocre ratings of the first season, revise the format, and at the same time, do some cost-cutting, it was decided that the part of Lilly Sinclair was superfluous and was written out. As a result, veteran actress Lucille Benson left the series and Telma Hopkins' character of Isabelle became the new hotel manager. Kip, Henry and Amy left Livingston, Gentry & Mishkin to start their own advertising firm, Sixty Seconds Street, with Ruth serving as a not-quite silent partner.\n\nIn the first episode of the second season, the male characters\u2019 ruse of living in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] is revealed, but they are allowed to continue living at the women-only hotel anyway. Sonny forgives Kip for the deception, and Isabelle, the new hotel manager, agrees to go along with the ruse rather than admit it to the other residents. From this point on, the drag element was de-emphasized and the show moved closer to the creators' original concept of a regular buddy comedy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as Kip Wilson/Buffy (when in drag)\n*[[Peter Scolari]] as Henry Desmond/Hildegard (when in drag)\n*[[Wendie Jo Sperber]] as Amy Cassidy, co-worker and friend who knows their secret\n*[[Holland Taylor]] as Ruth Dunbar, their boss\n*[[Donna Dixon]] as Sonny Lumet, Kip's love interest and hotel resident\n*[[Telma Hopkins]] as Isabelle Hammond, hotel resident; hotel manager in season 2\n*[[Lucille Benson]] as Lilly Sinclair, hotel manager (season 1)\n\n==Production==\nThe series was conceived by [[Miller-Boyett Productions|Miller and Boyett]] as a male counterpart to their hit sitcom ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]''. They originally pitched it as a straightforward buddy comedy done in what they described as \"a sophisticated Billy Wilder kind of way.\" When ABC executives asked Miller and Boyett to explain what they meant by the comparison to Wilder, the producers mentioned ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ABC bought the show on condition that it would include men in women's clothing, just like that movie. \"We weren't there to pitch that,\" Miller recalled. \"And they jumped on it! We drove back to the studio in the car saying, 'Oh my God, what are we gonna do? We have to do something in drag.'\"<ref name=\"sonsky\">{{Citation|last =Sonsky| first= Steve |title= Do Not Adjust Your Set. This Is As Good As It Gets (A Critic Tells Why TV's Greatest Art May Always Be Carney)|newspaper= Miami Herald|date=August 3, 1986}}</ref>\n\nAfter the cast had been chosen, Miller and Boyett asked Chris Thompson, one of the writer-producers of ''Laverne & Shirley'', to write the pilot and be the series [[showrunner]]. Thompson (who would go on to executive-produce such shows as ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'') said later that he took the job purely for the money, but unexpectedly found it to be \"my completely favorite experience in show business\", because the network left him and his young cast free to experiment. \"We were left alone,\" he recalled. \"Nobody was paying attention to us. We were all really young, but it was like we had daddy's Porsche. We had $500,000 to play with every week.\"<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60house+rules'+exec+breaks+the+mold%3b+honesty+works+for+this+tv+guy-a083814230 ''House Rules'' Exec Breaks The Mold; Honesty Works For This TV Guy.{{spaced ndash}}Free Online Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n''Bosom Buddies'' was taped on Stage 25 at Paramount Pictures.  Stage 25 was also the home of ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', and its spin-off ''[[Frasier]]''.\n\nLike many other sitcoms that aired during the 1980-81 television season, ''Bosom Buddies'' felt the effects of a strike by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] that occurred in 1980. As a result, the show had an abbreviated first season. At first, its ratings were strong. However, ABC kept switching the show's day and time slots, which hurt the first season's overall standing. The second season, with its revised premise, fared even worse, and after more time slot changes by the network, the show was canceled in the spring of 1982.\n\n''Bosom Buddies'' was one of the last shows to use the Miller-Milkis-Boyett production team due to Eddie Milkis leaving the company in 1984. This was also one of the last Miller-Boyett sitcoms to be produced by [[Paramount Television]] (now [[CBS Television Studios]]) before they moved their base of operations to [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Productions]] (later [[Warner Bros. Television]]); ''[[Happy Days]]'' ended its run in 1984, making the latter the last program to meet cancellation before the Miller-Boyett move to Lorimar, with ''[[The Hogan Family|Valerie]]'' being the first since to debut.\n\n==Episodes==\nWhile the [[television pilot|pilot episode]] was shot on [[Film stock|film]], the rest of the series was shot on [[videotape]].\n\n{{Series overview\n|

Some reruns shown in syndication (such as when [[USA Network]] aired reruns, as well as its later runs on [[MeTV]]) and all home video and DVD releases use a vocal version of the show's end credit instrumental theme, \"Shake Me Loose\", performed by [[Stephanie Mills]], for the opening credits, replacing \"My Life\".\n\n==Syndication==\n''Bosom Buddies'' reruns aired briefly on NBC in the summer of 1984 after Tom Hanks had become a major film star that summer with ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' and ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]''. Ratings were good, however any chances of reviving the show were futile since Hanks would obviously not be available. Reruns also aired on USA Network up until November 18, 1995 as well as on TBS and TV Land up until the mid-2000s. Nickelodeon UK also aired reruns of ''Bosom Buddies'' from November 1, 1995 - February 4, 2001 as part of its nightly  Paramount Comedy Channel (originally The Paramount Channel) programming block until Paramount Comedy became its own 24/7 UK channel separate from Nickelodeon.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-bDbDhIrdo</ref> More recently, ''Bosom Buddies'' began airing on Me-TV on October 2, 2011 and again on Thursday nights beginning May 29, 2014, as part of the network's \"Summer of Me\" promotion.  As of April 6, 2020, the show is on [[Decades_(TV_network)|Decades]] during its \"Television Through the Decades\" morning/afternoon block.\n\n==Home media==\n[[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount]]) released both seasons of ''Bosom Buddies'' on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]]. The original theme song \"My Life\" by [[Billy Joel]] was replaced with \"Shake Me Loose\", a song penned by show creator Chris Thompson, which was used during the show's syndication run.  Many of the musical numbers featured during the show's run are edited or eliminated altogether from the DVD releases. Notable in this vein are the songs \"Yakkity Yak\" (from the episode \"Call Me Irresponsible\"), \"Chances Are\" (from \"All You Need is Love\") and \"Rock and Roll Heaven\" (from \"Hildy's Dirt Nap\"). \n\nOn February 6, 2018, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] released ''Bosom Buddies- The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.<ref>[http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bosom-Buddies-The-Complete-Series/23800 Tom Hanks, Peter Scolari, Telma Hopkins in 'The Complete Series']</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In Season 5 Episode 20 of the [[NBC]] comedy ''[[30 Rock]]'', Hanks makes a cameo appearance wherein he references ''Bosom Buddies'' by singing lines from that show's theme song, \"My Life\".<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382106/trivia?tab=mc&ref_=tt_trv_cnn</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cross-dressing in film and television]]\n* ''[[Three's Company]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0080202}}\n* {{epguides|id=BosomBuddies}}\n\n{{MillerBoyett|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:1980 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1982 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1980s American workplace comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:Cross-dressing in television]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in New York City]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the song \"Bosom Buddies\"|Mame (film soundtrack)}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Bosom Buddies\n| image = Bosom Buddies.jpg\n| creator = [[Chris Thompson (TV producer)|Chris Thompson]]<br>[[Miller-Boyett Productions|Thomas L.

Boyett]], [[Thomas L. Miller]] and [[Chris Thompson (TV producer)|Chris Thompson]] ([[Miller-Boyett Productions|Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions]]). It aired for two seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from November 27, 1980, to March 27, 1982, and in reruns in the summer of 1984 on [[NBC]]. The show features the misadventures of two single men, working in creative advertising, struggling in their industry while disguising themselves as women in order to live in the one apartment they could afford. Gender stereotypes and male/female interpersonal relationships were frequent themes.\n\nThe show became known for its quirky humor and its frequent use of [[improvisation]], especially between stars Hanks and Scolari. Though the show started out with good ratings, it failed to hold the public's interest and was canceled after two seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nIn the pilot episode, after their own apartment is demolished (while they are still asleep in it), two men disguise themselves as women in order to live in the dirt-cheap Susan B. Anthony Hotel (which happens to be female-only). Kip Wilson (Hanks) is originally skeptical of the plan, but after meeting gorgeous resident model/dancer/nurse Sonny Lumet ([[Donna Dixon]]), he ends up convincing aspiring writer Henry Desmond (Scolari) that the experience will make a great book. Their co-worker, Amy Cassidy ([[Wendie Jo Sperber]]) [who's attracted to Henry] is the only resident in on the plan. The boys\u2019 deception includes outwitting the hotel manager, Darlene ([[Edie Adams]]), and fellow resident, Isabelle Hammond ([[Telma Hopkins]]), an aspiring singer. When the pilot sold to ABC, the character of Darlene was replaced by Lilly Sinclair ([[Lucille Benson]]).\n\nIn the first season, Kip, Henry, and Amy work for Ruth Dunbar ([[Holland Taylor]]) at the [[Manhattan]]-based advertising firm of Livingston, Gentry & Mishkin, where Kip is a graphic artist, Henry is a copy writer, and Amy is the receptionist. Ruth often takes credit for the boys\u2019 work when reporting to her (unseen) boss, Mr. Rubinowitz.\n\nThe show was barely renewed for a second season. In order to improve the mediocre ratings of the first season, revise the format, and at the same time, do some cost-cutting, it was decided that the part of Lilly Sinclair was superfluous and was written out. As a result, veteran actress Lucille Benson left the series and Telma Hopkins' character of Isabelle became the new hotel manager. Kip, Henry and Amy left Livingston, Gentry & Mishkin to start their own advertising firm, Sixty Seconds Street, with Ruth serving as a not-quite silent partner.\n\nIn the first episode of the second season, the male characters\u2019 ruse of living in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] is revealed, but they are allowed to continue living at the women-only hotel anyway. Sonny forgives Kip for the deception, and Isabelle, the new hotel manager, agrees to go along with the ruse rather than admit it to the other residents. From this point on, the drag element was de-emphasized and the show moved closer to the creators' original concept of a regular buddy comedy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as Kip Wilson/Buffy (when in drag)\n*[[Peter Scolari]] as Henry Desmond/Hildegard (when in drag)\n*[[Wendie Jo Sperber]] as Amy Cassidy, co-worker and friend who knows their secret\n*[[Holland Taylor]] as Ruth Dunbar, their boss\n*[[Donna Dixon]] as Sonny Lumet, Kip's love interest and hotel resident\n*[[Telma Hopkins]] as Isabelle Hammond, hotel resident; hotel manager in season 2\n*[[Lucille Benson]] as Lilly Sinclair, hotel manager (season 1)\n\n==Production==\nThe series was conceived by [[Miller-Boyett Productions|Miller and Boyett]] as a male counterpart to their hit sitcom ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]''. They originally pitched it as a straightforward buddy comedy done in what they described as \"a sophisticated Billy Wilder kind of way.\" When ABC executives asked Miller and Boyett to explain what they meant by the comparison to Wilder, the producers mentioned ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ABC bought the show on condition that it would include men in women's clothing, just like that movie. \"We weren't there to pitch that,\" Miller recalled. \"And they jumped on it! We drove back to the studio in the car saying, 'Oh my God, what are we gonna do? We have to do something in drag.'\"<ref name=\"sonsky\">{{Citation|last =Sonsky| first= Steve |title= Do Not Adjust Your Set. This Is As Good As It Gets (A Critic Tells Why TV's Greatest Art May Always Be Carney)|newspaper= Miami Herald|date=August 3, 1986}}</ref>\n\nAfter the cast had been chosen, Miller and Boyett asked Chris Thompson, one of the writer-producers of ''Laverne & Shirley'', to write the pilot and be the series [[showrunner]]. Thompson (who would go on to executive-produce such shows as ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'') said later that he took the job purely for the money, but unexpectedly found it to be \"my completely favorite experience in show business\", because the network left him and his young cast free to experiment. \"We were left alone,\" he recalled. \"Nobody was paying attention to us. We were all really young, but it was like we had daddy's Porsche. We had $500,000 to play with every week.\"<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60house+rules'+exec+breaks+the+mold%3b+honesty+works+for+this+tv+guy-a083814230 ''House Rules'' Exec Breaks The Mold; Honesty Works For This TV Guy.{{spaced ndash}}Free Online Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n''Bosom Buddies'' was taped on Stage 25 at Paramount Pictures.  Stage 25 was also the home of ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', and its spin-off ''[[Frasier]]''.\n\nLike many other sitcoms that aired during the 1980-81 television season, ''Bosom Buddies'' felt the effects of a strike by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] that occurred in 1980. As a result, the show had an abbreviated first season. At first, its ratings were strong. However, ABC kept switching the show's day and time slots, which hurt the first season's overall standing. The second season, with its revised premise, fared even worse, and after more time slot changes by the network, the show was canceled in the spring of 1982.\n\n''Bosom Buddies'' was one of the last shows to use the Miller-Milkis-Boyett production team due to Eddie Milkis leaving the company in 1984. This was also one of the last Miller-Boyett sitcoms to be produced by [[Paramount Television]] (now [[CBS Television Studios]]) before they moved their base of operations to [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Productions]] (later [[Warner Bros. Television]]); ''[[Happy Days]]'' ended its run in 1984, making the latter the last program to meet cancellation before the Miller-Boyett move to Lorimar, with ''[[The Hogan Family|Valerie]]'' being the first since to debut.\n\n==Episodes==\nWhile the [[television pilot|pilot episode]] was shot on [[Film stock|film]], the rest of the series was shot on [[videotape]].\n\n{{Series overview\n|

Some reruns shown in syndication (such as when [[USA Network]] aired reruns, as well as its later runs on [[MeTV]]) and all home video and DVD releases use a vocal version of the show's end credit instrumental theme, \"Shake Me Loose\", performed by [[Stephanie Mills]], for the opening credits, replacing \"My Life\".\n\n==Syndication==\n''Bosom Buddies'' reruns aired briefly on NBC in the summer of 1984 after Tom Hanks had become a major film star that summer with ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' and ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]''. Ratings were good, however any chances of reviving the show were futile since Hanks would obviously not be available. Reruns also aired on USA Network up until November 18, 1995 as well as on TBS and TV Land up until the mid-2000s. Nickelodeon UK also aired reruns of ''Bosom Buddies'' from November 1, 1995 - February 4, 2001 as part of its nightly  Paramount Comedy Channel (originally The Paramount Channel) programming block until Paramount Comedy became its own 24/7 UK channel separate from Nickelodeon.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-bDbDhIrdo</ref> More recently, ''Bosom Buddies'' began airing on Me-TV on October 2, 2011 and again on Thursday nights beginning May 29, 2014, as part of the network's \"Summer of Me\" promotion.  As of April 6, 2020, the show is on [[Decades_(TV_network)|Decades]] during its \"Television Through the Decades\" morning/afternoon block.\n\n==Home media==\n[[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount]]) released both seasons of ''Bosom Buddies'' on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]]. The original theme song \"My Life\" by [[Billy Joel]] was replaced with \"Shake Me Loose\", a song penned by show creator Chris Thompson, which was used during the show's syndication run.  Many of the musical numbers featured during the show's run are edited or eliminated altogether from the DVD releases. Notable in this vein are the songs \"Yakkity Yak\" (from the episode \"Call Me Irresponsible\"), \"Chances Are\" (from \"All You Need is Love\") and \"Rock and Roll Heaven\" (from \"Hildy's Dirt Nap\"). \n\nOn February 6, 2018, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] released ''Bosom Buddies- The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.<ref>[http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bosom-Buddies-The-Complete-Series/23800 Tom Hanks, Peter Scolari, Telma Hopkins in 'The Complete Series']</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
