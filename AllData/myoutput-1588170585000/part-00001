He began his career by writing two works of historical fiction in the 1990s, later turning to non-fiction, and has since written several critically acclaimed and best-selling historical works.\n\n==Career and works==\nKing was born in [[Estevan]], Saskatchewan, Canada and was raised in the nearby village of [[North Portal]].  He received his undergraduate university education at the [[University of Regina]], where in 1984 he completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in English Literature.  Continuing his studies at the University of Regina, he received a Master of Arts degree in 1986 upon completing a thesis on the poet [[T. S. Eliot]].  Later he achieved a PhD from [[York University]] in Toronto (1992), where he specialized in eighteenth-century English literature.\n\nKing moved to England to take up a position as a post-doctoral research fellow at [[University College London]].  It was at this time that he began writing his first novel.\n\nKing's first novel, ''Domino'', (1995), tells the story of a castrato singer seen through the experience of an aspiring painter in the London of the 1770s.\n\nIn 1998, King published ''Ex-Libris'', his second work of historical fiction.  Set in London and Prague, it chronicles how a London bookseller's search in the 1660s for a missing manuscript leads him unwittingly into a world of deception and murder.\n\n''Brunelleschi's Dome: The Story of the Great Cathedral in Florence'' (2000) describes how the Italian architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] designed what still stands as the largest masonry dome ever built: the dome of the cathedral of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]], completed in 1436.
