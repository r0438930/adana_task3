''Opossum'' and several Motor Launches started a search for the submarine using [[Hydrophone]]s and sweeps. ''UC-49'' was assumed to by lying on the sea bed, and when the submarine restarted motors at 15:20 hr, the noise attracted several depth charges, and more depth charges were dropped at 17:57 hr.

After 20 seconds, the submarine descended under the surface again, with her bows at an angle of 50 degrees, and several more depth charges were dropped, bringing up oil and bubbles. The next day, the wreck, which had been located by sweeps, was plastered with depth charges in order to break it up to confirm that the submarine had being sunk. When debris including a light bulb manufactured in [[Vienna]] came to the surface, it was confirmed that the submarine had been destroyed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grant|1964|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kemp1997|p=54}}</ref>\n\n''Opossum'' remained part of the Devonport Local Defence Flotilla at the end of the war in November 1918.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ships of the Royal Navy - Location/Action Date, 1914\u20131918: Part 2 - Admiralty \"Pink Lists\", 11 November 1918|publisher=Naval-history.net|url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyBritishShips-Locations2PL1811.htm|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Supplement to the Monthly Navy List Showing Organisation of the Fleet, Flag Officers' Commands &c: Local Defence Flotillas: VII.
