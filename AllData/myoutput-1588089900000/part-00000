The band's name was taken from a line in the [[Nick Drake]] song \"River Man\".\n\nSince its formation, The Lilac Time has gone through various line-up changes, with the Duffy brothers as mainstays. The band's activity has intertwined with Stephen Duffy's solo and songwriting career.\n\n==History==\nThe Duffy brothers and Michael Weston had recorded music that would become the band's self-titled debut, which was first released on Swordfish Records in 1987. Michael Giri and Fraser Kent joined when the band went on tour. The group signed to [[Fontana Records|Fontana]], which reissued the band's first album in remixed form in 1988. The group went on to release the albums ''Paradise Circus'' in 1989, and ''& Love For All'' in 1990, the latter of which was produced by [[Andy Partridge]] and [[John Leckie]].\n\nThe Lilac Time was dropped by Fontana then briefly signed to [[Creation Records]], where the band was subsequently managed by label head [[Alan McGee]]. The band's sole release on Creation was ''Astronauts'', in 1990. The Duffy brothers' cousin, noted-session musician [[Cara Tivey]], contributed organ and piano to the album.\n\nThe band later regrouped with Claire Worrall and Melvin Duffy (no relation to the brothers) and recorded ''Looking For A Day In The Night'' with producer [[Stephen Street]] for [[spinART Records]] in 1999. They then released ''Lilac 6'' on [[Cooking Vinyl]] in 2001, followed by ''Keep Going'', which was released in 2003 under the name \"Stephen Duffy and the Lilac Time\" on Folk Modern.\n\n''Runout Groove'' was released on 22 October 2007 on Bogus Frontage. The band played the 2007 [[Green Man Festival]] and the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] as a six-piece. The band's gig at the Green Man Festival serves as the backdrop to the film \"Memory & Desire \u2014 30 Years in the Wilderness With Stephen Duffy & The Lilac Time.\" The documentary was filmed over six years by Douglas Arrowsmith, who included new and vintage Lilac footage. The film is accompanied by a [[Universal Records]] album of the same name, which compiles songs from Duffy's thirty years making music. The Queen Elizabeth Hall concert is to be released as a live recording.\n\n''No Sad Songs'' was released on Tapete Records in April 2015.\n\nA new Lilac Time album, ''Return to Us'' was released in October 2019.\n\nThe band is now based in [[Cornwall]].\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[The Lilac Time (The Lilac Time album)|The Lilac Time]]'' (1987)\n* ''Paradise Circus'' (1989) \n* ''& Love for All'' (1990) \n* ''Astronauts'' (1991)\n* ''Looking for a Day in the Night'' (1999)\n* ''lilac6'' (2001)\n* ''Keep Going'' (2003) (as '''Stephen Duffy & The Lilac Time''')\n* ''Runout Groove'' (2007) (as '''Stephen Duffy & The Lilac Time''')\n* ''Sapphire Stylus'' (2009) (as '''Nick Duffy & The Lilac Time''')\n* ''No Sad Songs'' (2015)\n* ''Return to Us'' (2019)\n\n===Compilation albums===\n* ''Compendium -
