It is located on a hill overlooking  the [[\u00c7oruh River]] near the [[Deriner Dam]]. It is a former bishopric and (vacant) Armenian Catholic [[titular see]] and the home of Artvin \u00c7oruh University.\n\n== History ==\nThe area has a rich history but has not been studied extensively by archaeologists in recent decades. Artifacts dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] and even earlier have been found. The area was part of the kingdom of [[Colchis]] and part of the [[Greater Armenia]] but was always vulnerable to invasions, first the [[Scythians]] from across the [[Caucasus]], then the Muslim armies led by Habib, son of [[Uthman|Caliph Uthman]] who controlled the area from 853&nbsp;AD to 1023 when it was conquered by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] from the Sac Emirate linked to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]. \n\nThe [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Principalities of Tao-Klarjeti]] arose out of the turmoils of the [[Arab rule in Georgia|Muslim conquests in the Caucasus]] in the 7th and 8th centuries, succeeding the early medieval [[Kingdom of Iberia]] and latter leading unification of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian Kingdom]]. For a long time the region became a [[Culture of Georgia (country)|cultural]] [[Safe house|safe-house]] and one of the most important [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|religious]] centers of Georgia.\n\nThe [[Seljuk Turks]] of [[Alp Arslan]] conquered the area in 1064&nbsp;AD; but soon, it was briefly recaptured by the Georgians with the help of the Byzantines. But in 1081 Turkish forces led by Saltuko\u011flu Beylik managed to take it back with the aid of [[Melik\u015fah]]. With the collapse of the Seljuks, the Artvin area came under the control of the [[Ildeniz]] tribe of the [[Anatolian beyliks|Anatolian Turkish beyliks]].<ref>The Turks: Middle ages, Hasan Cel\u0101l G\u00fczel, Cem O\u011fuz, Osman Karatay, 2002</ref><ref>Les Origines de l'Empire ottoman, Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, Gary Leiser, 1992, page 82</ref><ref>European and Islamic trade in the early Ottoman state: the merchants of Genoa and Turkey, Kate Fleet, 1999, page 49</ref><ref>Turkey, Verity Campbell, 2007, page 35</ref><ref>Turkey, James Bainbridge, 2009, page 33</ref><ref>Eastern Turkey: The Bradt Travel Guide, Diana Darke, 2011, page 77</ref><ref>The Turks: Early ages, Hasan Cel\u0101l G\u00fczel, Cem O\u011fuz, Osman Karatay, 2002</ref><ref>The sons of Bayezid: empire building and representation in the Ottoman civil war of 1402-1413, Dimitris J. Kastritsis, 2007, page 2</ref> \n\n[[Kingdom of Georgia]] regained control over the region through [[Georgian\u2013Seljuk wars|Georgian-Seljuk wars]]. Taking advantage of Georgia's weakness through [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol invasions]], Turkmen incursions started to south-western Georgia. The largely Georgian population of the region called on lord of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]], to assist them against the Turkmens. By the mid-13th century, the [[House of Jaqeli|Jaqelis]] realm thus incorporated most of the mountainous areas of north eastern Anatolia. Various Turkish clans fought for control over the area and this continued until the [[Safavid]]s ultimately took advantage of this fighting and conquered the area in 1502.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire under Mehmet II defeated the [[Empire of Trebizond]] to bring the eastern Black Sea coast and the mountainous hinterland under their control.  Subsequent expeditions into the mountains by Selim I and Mehmed Han Yusufeli gave them control of a number of castles and thus the whole district. Kara Ahmet Pasha, the vizer of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] formed the first Livane Sanjak with the name Pert-E\u011fekte.  On 13 July 1551, with \u0130skender Pasha's Ardanu\u00e7  castle, the Ottoman control of Artvin was secure. [[Ahmed III]]'s vizer Hasan Pasha founded the city of Batum in the newly acquired lands of Ajaria and it became the hub of the area.[[File:General view of Artvin from the small town of Svet, Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb| 240px|Artvin city from Mamacimla district, 1905-1915, taken by [[Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky]].|alt=]]This lasted 250 years until the area was ceded to the Russians by the [[Ottoman Empire]] following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)]], and recovered and again ceded at the conclusion of the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]]. Artvin was in a war zone and continuously changing control between Russia and Turkey with the Treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]], [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Moscow]] and [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]]. All this fighting and uncertainty between Russia and Turkey in the late 19th century caused the people of Artvin ([[Chveneburi|Muslim Georgians]]) to suffer terribly, with much of the population moving westwards away from the Russian-controlled zones.\n\nThe Russians withdrew from Artvin following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917; but when the [[World War I|First World War]] ended with the Ottomans on the losing side, British troops moved into the area in 1918, followed by  [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]]. As a result of [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]], Artvin was ceded to newly established Turkey under the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921.<ref>[http://www.artvin.gov.tr Artvin Valili\u011fi Resmi Web Sayfas\u0131 <<!

The site consists of a single circuit wall surrounding the summit of the outcrop, several impressive rooms, an outwork protecting the south entrance, and a large donjon at the west.  There are also embrasures and windows suitable for archers.  In 1983 the fortress was surveyed and three years later an accurate scaled plan and description were published.<ref>Robert W.

It is located on a hill overlooking  the [[\u00c7oruh River]] near the [[Deriner Dam]]. It is a former bishopric and (vacant) Armenian Catholic [[titular see]] and the home of Artvin \u00c7oruh University.\n\n== History ==\nThe area has a rich history but has not been studied extensively by archaeologists in recent decades. Artifacts dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] and even earlier have been found. The area was part of the kingdom of [[Colchis]] and part of the [[Greater Armenia]] but was always vulnerable to invasions, first the [[Scythians]] from across the [[Caucasus]], then the Muslim armies led by Habib, son of [[Uthman|Caliph Uthman]] who controlled the area from 853&nbsp;AD to 1023 when it was conquered by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] from the Sac Emirate linked to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]. \n\nThe [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Principalities of Tao-Klarjeti]] arose out of the turmoils of the [[Arab rule in Georgia|Muslim conquests in the Caucasus]] in the 7th and 8th centuries, succeeding the early medieval [[Kingdom of Iberia]] and latter leading unification of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian Kingdom]]. For a long time the region became a [[Culture of Georgia (country)|cultural]] [[Safe house|safe-house]] and one of the most important [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|religious]] centers of Georgia.\n\nThe [[Seljuk Turks]] of [[Alp Arslan]] conquered the area in 1064&nbsp;AD; but soon, it was briefly recaptured by the Georgians with the help of the Byzantines. But in 1081 Turkish forces led by Saltuko\u011flu Beylik managed to take it back with the aid of [[Melik\u015fah]]. With the collapse of the Seljuks, the Artvin area came under the control of the [[Ildeniz]] tribe of the [[Anatolian beyliks|Anatolian Turkish beyliks]].<ref>The Turks: Middle ages, Hasan Cel\u0101l G\u00fczel, Cem O\u011fuz, Osman Karatay, 2002</ref><ref>Les Origines de l'Empire ottoman, Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, Gary Leiser, 1992, page 82</ref><ref>European and Islamic trade in the early Ottoman state: the merchants of Genoa and Turkey, Kate Fleet, 1999, page 49</ref><ref>Turkey, Verity Campbell, 2007, page 35</ref><ref>Turkey, James Bainbridge, 2009, page 33</ref><ref>Eastern Turkey: The Bradt Travel Guide, Diana Darke, 2011, page 77</ref><ref>The Turks: Early ages, Hasan Cel\u0101l G\u00fczel, Cem O\u011fuz, Osman Karatay, 2002</ref><ref>The sons of Bayezid: empire building and representation in the Ottoman civil war of 1402-1413, Dimitris J. Kastritsis, 2007, page 2</ref> \n\n[[Kingdom of Georgia]] regained control over the region through [[Georgian\u2013Seljuk wars|Georgian-Seljuk wars]]. Taking advantage of Georgia's weakness through [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol invasions]], Turkmen incursions started to south-western Georgia. The largely Georgian population of the region called on lord of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]], to assist them against the Turkmens. By the mid-13th century, the [[House of Jaqeli|Jaqelis]] realm thus incorporated most of the mountainous areas of north eastern Anatolia. Various Turkish clans fought for control over the area and this continued until the [[Safavid]]s ultimately took advantage of this fighting and conquered the area in 1502.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire under Mehmet II defeated the [[Empire of Trebizond]] to bring the eastern Black Sea coast and the mountainous hinterland under their control.  Subsequent expeditions into the mountains by Selim I and Mehmed Han Yusufeli gave them control of a number of castles and thus the whole district. Kara Ahmet Pasha, the vizer of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] formed the first Livane Sanjak with the name Pert-E\u011fekte.  On 13 July 1551, with \u0130skender Pasha's Ardanu\u00e7  castle, the Ottoman control of Artvin was secure. [[Ahmed III]]'s vizer Hasan Pasha founded the city of Batum in the newly acquired lands of Ajaria and it became the hub of the area.[[File:General view of Artvin from the small town of Svet, Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb| 240px|Artvin city from Mamacimla district, 1905-1915, taken by [[Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky]].|alt=]]This lasted 250 years until the area was ceded to the Russians by the [[Ottoman Empire]] following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)]], and recovered and again ceded at the conclusion of the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]]. Artvin was in a war zone and continuously changing control between Russia and Turkey with the Treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]], [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Moscow]] and [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]]. All this fighting and uncertainty between Russia and Turkey in the late 19th century caused the people of Artvin ([[Chveneburi|Muslim Georgians]]) to suffer terribly, with much of the population moving westwards away from the Russian-controlled zones.\n\nThe Russians withdrew from Artvin following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917; but when the [[World War I|First World War]] ended with the Ottomans on the losing side, British troops moved into the area in 1918, followed by  [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]]. As a result of [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]], Artvin was ceded to newly established Turkey under the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921.<ref>[http://www.artvin.gov.tr Artvin Valili\u011fi Resmi Web Sayfas\u0131 <<!

The site consists of a single circuit wall surrounding the summit of the outcrop, several impressive rooms, an outwork protecting the south entrance, and a large donjon at the west.
