His father was a younger son of the [[Theobald Dillon, 7th Viscount Dillon|7th Viscount Dillon]].

==Early life and career==
While Charles was a child, he lived with his mother at the Jacobite court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye where James II of England died on 16 September 1701 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]],{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/n266/ cclxvii, line 45]|ps=: \"JAMES II (who d. 16 Sept. 1701, at St. Germains, where he was bur.)\"}} the year of Charles's birth. James II was succeeded by [[James Francis Edward]], whom Louis XIV immediately recognised as the rightful heir to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. Dillon's Regiment, led by Charles's father, fought for France in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714). Louis XIV made Charles's father lieutenant-general in 1706 and comte de Dillon in 1711.{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/603/ 603, left column, line 70]|ps=: \"He was created COUNT DILLON by Louis XIV, 1711&nbsp;...\"}} However, in 1713 France signed the [[Peace of Utrecht]], recognising the Hanoverian succession and ending its support for the Jacobites.{{sfn|Miller|1971|p=[https://archive.org/details/james00mill/page/147/ 147, line 8]|ps=: \"On 11 April 1713 the peace was signed at Utrecht: in return for the acknowledgement of his grandson as Philip V of Spain, Louis had had to recognize the Hanoverian and Protestant succession in England.\"}} James Francis Edward had to leave France and went to the [[Duchy of Lorraine]], then to [[Avignon]], and finally to Italy. His mother, [[Mary of Modena]], stayed behind at St Germains where she died in 1718.

On 13 January 1714 Charles's uncle the [[Henry Dillon, 8th Viscount Dillon|8th Viscount Dillon]] died in Ireland.{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/603/ 603, left column, line 96]|ps=: \"He [Henry] died 13 Jan. 1713 and was s. by his son.\"}}{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=[https://archive.org/details/completepeerageo04coka/page/359/ 359, line 34]|ps=: \"He [Henry] d. in Dublin, 13 and was bur. 23 Jan 1713/4 at Ballyhawnis, co. Mayo.\"}}{{efn|{{Harv|Burke|1949}} gives 13 January 1713, but {{Harv|Cokayne|1916}} gives 13 January 1713/4.}} This uncle had been attainted as Jacobite in 1690 but had been pardoned and had obtained the reversal of the attainder in 1693. He was succeeded by his son Richard as the 9th Viscount Dillon, to whom Charles would succeed later as the 10th Viscount.

On 10 November 1718 Charles was made a captain in the regiment.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 42a]|ps=: \"... [charles] became a full captain November 10th, 1718;\"}} In 1722 [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the old pretender), who now resided in Rome, created his father Earl of Dillon.{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/603/ 603, left column, line 72]|ps=: \"... and was created Earl Dillon, 1722, by the Old Pretender.\"}}

In 1730 his father retired from active service{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 36b]|ps=: \"In 1730, quitting the service, as he was then in his 60th year, resigned his regiment to his eldest son;\"}} and on 1 May 1730 Charles became colonel of Dillon's Regiment.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 42b]|ps=: \"... [Charles Dillon became] and Colonel, May 1st 1730.\"}} On 5 February 1733 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]], Charles's father died at the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].{{sfn|Lodge|1789|p=[]|ps=: \"\"}}{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 38]|ps=: \"... died February 5th, at the Palace of St. Germain-en-Laye, aged 63 years.\"}} Charles, already colonel, now also succeeded in his father's titles: comte de Dillon in France and Earl of Dillon in the Jacobite peerage.
<!--
He succeeded in [[1733]] to the French title of Count Dillon, granted to his father, the [[Honourable Arthur Dillon]], in [[1711]] by [[Louis XIV]] and also to the [[Jacobite Peerage|Jacobite peerages]] of \"Viscount and Baron Dillon\" ([[1717]]) and \"Earl of Dillon\" ([[1721]]) granted by [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the [[Old Pretender]]. He succeeded his cousin as 10th titular [[Viscount Dillon|Viscount Dillon of Costello Gallen]] in [[1737]], although this title remained under attainder between [[1690]] and [[1767]].
-->

During the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733–1735), Charles, comte de Dillon, as he was now, and his younger brother Henry fought under Marshal [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick|Berwick]], the commander of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s Rhine army, at the [[Siege of Kehl (1733)|Siege of Kehl]] and then at the [[Siege of Philippsburg (1734)|Siege of Philippsburg]]{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/49/ 49, line 3b]|ps=: \"... in the war from 1733 to 1735, against the Germans, served at the sieges of Kehl and Philipsburgh&nbsp;...\"}} where Berwick was beheaded by a chance cannon ball on 12 June 1734.{{sfn|Handley|2004|p=[https://archive.org/details/oxforddictionary19matt/page/883/ 883, right column, line 26]|ps=: \"While he was inspecting the front line on 12 June 1734, 'three cannon balls came directly to the place'^&nbsp;...\"}}

==Marriage, later life and death==
On 16 January 1735 Charles, comte de Dillon, married his Irish cousin, Frances Dillon, daughter of Richard Dillon, the 9th Viscount.{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=[https://archive.org/details/completepeerageo04coka/page/360/ 360, line 15]|ps=: \"He m. 16 Jan. 1734/5, Frances, only da. and h. of his predecessor, RICHARD (DILLON), 9th VISCOUNT DILLON [I.], by Bridget his wife abovenamed.\"}}{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 45]|ps=: \"... having married his Irish cousin-germain, Lady Frances Dillon in January 1735&nbsp;...\"}} In 1736 he went to Ireland to take possession of some land that was part of her dowry.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 46]|ps=: \"... he came over to Ireland in September, 1736, to take possession of the property to which he was entitled;\"}} His wife must have come with him or joined him later. They never returned to France. In 1737 Richard, the 9th Viscount, his father-in-law, died and Charles, already comte and earl, now succeeded as the 10th Viscount in the Irish peerage.{{sfn|Debrett|1828|p=[https://archive.org/details/debrettspeerage01debrgoog/page/n327/ 748, line 24]|ps=: \"... whose only son RICHARD, 9th viscount, d. without male issue, 1737;\"}} As his wife was Richard's only heiress Charles, Viscount Dillon, as he now was, also inherited the land.

They had an only son:

His wife died on 17 January 1739 in London.{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=[https://archive.org/details/completepeerageo04coka/page/360/ 360, line 17]|ps=: \"She d. 17 Jan. 1738/9, in London.\"}} He died on 24 Octtober 1641, also in London.{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=[https://archive.org/details/completepeerageo04coka/page/360/ 360, line 18]|ps=: \"He [Charles] d. there [in London] s.p.s., 24 and was buried 27 Oct 1741 at St. Pancras, Midx.\"}}<ref>{{Cite news|title=A List of Deaths for the year 1741|date=1741|work=Gentleman’s Magazine|series=New series|volume=11|page=554, left column, bottom|quote=[24 October] The Lord Dillon of Ireland and Colonel of a Regiment in the French Service.|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.l0082191669&view=1up&seq=574}}</ref> As his only son had predeceased him, he was succeeded by his younger brother Henry as the 11th Viscount,{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/603/ 603, right column, line 1]|ps=: \"CHARLES, 10th Viscount Dillon, Col. proprietor of Dillon Regt., 1730–1741 (refer to Arthur, son of Theobald, 7th Viscount).

He was the eldest of the five sons of [[Arthur Dillon, Count Dillon|Arthur Dillon]] and his wife Christina Sheldon. His father was born in 1670 in Ireland, fought for the Jacobites in the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] and had gone to France as the colonel of [[Dillon's Regiment]] with the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]] in April 1690 when Irish troops were sent to France in exchange for French troops sent to Ireland with [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Lauzun]]. His father was a younger son of the [[Theobald Dillon, 7th Viscount Dillon|7th Viscount Dillon]]. His father's family was [[Normans in Ireland|Old English]] Irish and descended from Sir Henry Dillon who came to Ireland with [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in 1185.{{sfn|Webb|1878|p=[https://archive.org/details/acompendiumiris00webbgoog/page/n157/ 149, line 7]|ps=: \"...

==Early life and career==
While Charles was a child, he lived with his mother at the Jacobite court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye where James II of England died on 16 September 1701 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]],{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/n266/ cclxvii, line 45]|ps=: \"JAMES II (who d. 16 Sept. 1701, at St. Germains, where he was bur.)\"}} the year of Charles's birth. James II was succeeded by [[James Francis Edward]], whom Louis XIV immediately recognised as the rightful heir to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. Dillon's Regiment, led by Charles's father, fought for France in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714). Louis XIV made Charles's father lieutenant-general in 1706 and comte de Dillon in 1711.{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/603/ 603, left column, line 70]|ps=: \"He was created COUNT DILLON by Louis XIV, 1711&nbsp;...\"}} However, in 1713 France signed the [[Peace of Utrecht]], recognising the Hanoverian succession and ending its support for the Jacobites.{{sfn|Miller|1971|p=[https://archive.org/details/james00mill/page/147/ 147, line 8]|ps=: \"On 11 April 1713 the peace was signed at Utrecht: in return for the acknowledgement of his grandson as Philip V of Spain, Louis had had to recognize the Hanoverian and Protestant succession in England.\"}} James Francis Edward had to leave France and went to the [[Duchy of Lorraine]], then to [[Avignon]], and finally to Italy. His mother, [[Mary of Modena]], stayed behind at St Germains where she died in 1718.

On 13 January 1714 Charles's uncle the [[Henry Dillon, 8th Viscount Dillon|8th Viscount Dillon]] died in Ireland.{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/603/ 603, left column, line 96]|ps=: \"He [Henry] died 13 Jan. 1713 and was s. by his son.\"}}{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=[https://archive.org/details/completepeerageo04coka/page/359/ 359, line 34]|ps=: \"He [Henry] d. in Dublin, 13 and was bur. 23 Jan 1713/4 at Ballyhawnis, co. Mayo.\"}}{{efn|{{Harv|Burke|1949}} gives 13 January 1713, but {{Harv|Cokayne|1916}} gives 13 January 1713/4.}} This uncle had been attainted as Jacobite in 1690 but had been pardoned and had obtained the reversal of the attainder in 1693. He was succeeded by his son Richard as the 9th Viscount Dillon, to whom Charles would succeed later as the 10th Viscount.

On 10 November 1718 Charles was made a captain in the regiment.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 42a]|ps=: \"... [charles] became a full captain November 10th, 1718;\"}} In 1722 [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the old pretender), who now resided in Rome, created his father Earl of Dillon.{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/603/ 603, left column, line 72]|ps=: \"... and was created Earl Dillon, 1722, by the Old Pretender.\"}}

In 1730 his father retired from active service{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 36b]|ps=: \"In 1730, quitting the service, as he was then in his 60th year, resigned his regiment to his eldest son;\"}} and on 1 May 1730 Charles became colonel of Dillon's Regiment.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 42b]|ps=: \"... [Charles Dillon became] and Colonel, May 1st 1730.\"}} On 5 February 1733 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]], Charles's father died at the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].{{sfn|Lodge|1789|p=[]|ps=: \"\"}}{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 38]|ps=: \"... died February 5th, at the Palace of St. Germain-en-Laye, aged 63 years.\"}} Charles, already colonel, now also succeeded in his father's titles: comte de Dillon in France and Earl of Dillon in the Jacobite peerage.
<!--
He succeeded in [[1733]] to the French title of Count Dillon, granted to his father, the [[Honourable Arthur Dillon]], in [[1711]] by [[Louis XIV]] and also to the [[Jacobite Peerage|Jacobite peerages]] of \"Viscount and Baron Dillon\" ([[1717]]) and \"Earl of Dillon\" ([[1721]]) granted by [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the [[Old Pretender]]. He succeeded his cousin as 10th titular [[Viscount Dillon|Viscount Dillon of Costello Gallen]] in [[1737]], although this title remained under attainder between [[1690]] and [[1767]].
-->

During the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733–1735), Charles, comte de Dillon, as he was now, and his younger brother Henry fought under Marshal [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick|Berwick]], the commander of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s Rhine army, at the [[Siege of Kehl (1733)|Siege of Kehl]] and then at the [[Siege of Philippsburg (1734)|Siege of Philippsburg]]{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/49/ 49, line 3b]|ps=: \"... in the war from 1733 to 1735, against the Germans, served at the sieges of Kehl and Philipsburgh&nbsp;...\"}} where Berwick was beheaded by a chance cannon ball on 12 June 1734.{{sfn|Handley|2004|p=[https://archive.org/details/oxforddictionary19matt/page/883/ 883, right column, line 26]|ps=: \"While he was inspecting the front line on 12 June 1734, 'three cannon balls came directly to the place'^&nbsp;...\"}}

==Marriage, later life and death==
On 16 January 1735 Charles, comte de Dillon, married his Irish cousin, Frances Dillon, daughter of Richard Dillon, the 9th Viscount.{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=[https://archive.org/details/completepeerageo04coka/page/360/ 360, line 15]|ps=: \"He m. 16 Jan. 1734/5, Frances, only da. and h. of his predecessor, RICHARD (DILLON), 9th VISCOUNT DILLON [I.], by Bridget his wife abovenamed.\"}}{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 45]|ps=: \"... having married his Irish cousin-germain, Lady Frances Dillon in January 1735&nbsp;...\"}} In 1736 he went to Ireland to take possession of some land that was part of her dowry.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1854|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofirishbr01ocal/page/48/ 48, line 46]|ps=: \"... he came over to Ireland in September, 1736, to take possession of the property to which he was entitled;\"}} His wife must have come with him or joined him later. They never returned to France. In 1737 Richard, the 9th Viscount, his father-in-law, died and Charles, already comte and earl, now succeeded as the 10th Viscount in the Irish peerage.{{sfn|Debrett|1828|p=[https://archive.org/details/debrettspeerage01debrgoog/page/n327/ 748, line 24]|ps=: \"... whose only son RICHARD, 9th viscount, d. without male issue, 1737;\"}} As his wife was Richard's only heiress Charles, Viscount Dillon, as he now was, also inherited the land.

'''John Henry Hammond II''' (December 15, 1910 – July 10, 1987) was an American [[record producer]], [[civil rights]] activist, and music critic from the 1930s to the early 1980s. In his service as a [[A&R|talent scout]], Hammond became one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music. He is the father of famous blues musician [[John P. Hammond]].

Hammond was instrumental in sparking or furthering numerous musical careers, including those of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Harry James]], [[Charlie Christian]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Babatunde Olatunji]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[George Benson]], [[Freddie Green]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Arthur Russell (musician)|Arthur Russell]], [[Jim Copp]], [[Asha Puthli]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Mike Bloomfield]]. He is also largely responsible for the revival of [[delta blues]] artist [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s music.

==Early years and family==
Hammond was born in [[New York City|New York]], christened John Henry Hammond Jr., although both his father and grandfather shared the same name. He was the youngest child and only son of John Henry Hammond and [[Emily Vanderbilt Sloane]]. His mother was one of three daughters of William Douglas Sloane and [[Emily Thorn Vanderbilt]], and a granddaughter of [[William Henry Vanderbilt]].

His father attended [[Yale University]], graduating with a law degree from [[Columbia Law School]]. His grandfather was Civil War General John Henry Hammond, who married Sophia Vernon Wolfe. His father was a brother of [[Ogden H. Hammond]], ambassador to [[Spain]], and uncle to politician [[Millicent Fenwick]]. Despite the family fortune from his mother's side of the family, which included wealth from the [[W. & J. Sloane]] chain, his father worked to provide for his family and maintain the family fortune. He worked \"as a banker, lawyer, and railroad executive\".<ref name=Prial>Dunstan Prial (2006) ''The Producer: John Hammond and the Soul of American Music'', Farrar, Straus and Giroux, {{ISBN|0-374-11304-1}}</ref>

Hammond had four sisters: Emily, Adele, Rachel, and Alice. The youngest, Alice married first, [[Arthur Duckworth]] in 1927, which ended in divorce and second, musician [[Benny Goodman]] in 1942.

Hammond showed interest in music from an early age. At four he began studying the piano, only to switch to the violin at age eight. He was steered toward classical music by his mother, but was more interested in the music sung and played by the servants, many of whom were black. He was known to go down to his basement to listen to the upbeat music in the servants' quarters. He loved [[Sir Harry Lauder]]'s \"[[Roamin' in the Gloamin']]\". While he was in the basement, the rest of his family in the greater part of the five-story mansion would listen to \"the great opera tenor [[Enrico Caruso]], as well as to standard classics by [[Beethoven]], [[Brahms]], and [[Mozart]]\".<ref name=Prial />

Hammond became interested in social reform at a young age. His mother also promoted social reform as a means to give back some of her fortune to the community. She often found solace in religion. Hammond shared her desire to help the community with his privilege.<ref name=Prial />

Hammond notes that the first jazz music that he heard was in London in 1923 on a trip with his family. He heard a band called [[The Georgians (Frank Guarente)|The Georgians]], a white Dixieland jazz group, and saw a Negro show called ''From Dixie to Broadway'', that featured [[Sidney Bechet]]. This trip changed the way that he thought about music. Upon his return to the states, Hammond searched for records by Negro musicians but could not find them in the greater [[Manhattan]] area. He learned that Negro music was sold in different stores, so he began to search for this music in [[Harlem]].<ref name=JazzHist>John Hammond, \"An Experience in Jazz History\", in Dominique-René de Lerma, ed., ''Black Music in Our Culture: Curricular Ideas on the Subjects, Materials, and Problems'' (Kent State University Press, 1970), pp. 42–53.</ref>

In 1925 Hammond graduated from the elementary institution [[St. Bernard's School]] at the age of 14. He persuaded his family to allow him to attend [[Hotchkiss School]] due to its liberal curriculum. Hammond's love for music flourished. However, he felt limited within the confines of a boarding school. Hammond succeeded in convincing the headmaster to allow him to go into the city every other weekend, a rare privilege, so that he could take lessons from Ronald Murat. However, the headmaster was not aware that outside his formal lessons, Hammond would go up to Harlem to hear jazz. During this time, he said that he heard [[Bessie Smith]] perform at [[The Harlem Alhambra]], but her biographer disagrees about the dates.<ref name=Prial />

The summer after graduating from Hotchkiss in 1929, Hammond went to work for a newspaper in Maine, the ''Portland Evening News''. Its editor [[Ernest Gruening]] was also a Hotchkiss alumnus, class of 1903, who was interested in social issues and social justice.<ref name=Prial /><ref name=\"HOTCHKISSNEWS\">[https://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/closerlook.aspx?id=8 \"Alumni Accomplishments: Ernest Gruening '03\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111112714/http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/closerlook.aspx?id=8 |date=November 11, 2012 }}, The Hotchkiss School</ref>

In the fall of 1929, Hammond entered [[Yale University]] as a member of the class of 1933. He studied the violin and, later, [[viola]]. He felt a disconnect with his fellow students at Yale and felt that he was already well acquainted with the professional world. He made frequent trips into New York city and wrote regularly for trade magazines. In the fall semester of 1930, Hammond had to withdraw due to a recurring case of [[jaundice]]. Hammond had no desire to a repeat a semester, which contributed to his dissatisfaction with the university lifestyle. Much to the disappointment of his father, a Yale alumnus, in 1931 he dropped out of school for a career in the music industry, first becoming the U.S. correspondent for ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name=Prial />

==Career==
In 1931, Hammond funded the recording of pianist [[Garland Wilson]], marking the beginning of a long string of artistic successes as record producer. He moved to [[Greenwich Village]], where he claimed to have engaged in bohemian life and worked for an integrated music world. He set up one of the first regular live [[jazz]] programs, and wrote regularly about the racial divide. As he wrote in his memoirs,<ref>''John Hammond On Record: An Autobiography'', {{ISBN|0-671-40003-7}}</ref> \"I heard no color line in the music.... To bring recognition to the negro's supremacy in jazz was the most effective and constructive form of social protest I could think of.\" This pre-occupation with social issues was to continue, and in 1941 he was one of the founders of the [[Council on African Affairs]].

In 1932, Hammond acquired a nonpaying job on the [[WEVD]] radio station as a disc jockey. He did not discriminate when choosing which musicians to air; the station allowed Hammond complete freedom on the station as long as he paid for his time slot. Through this position, Hammond gained a reputation as a well-educated jazz fan. Various musicians were guests on his show, including [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], and [[Art Tatum]]. When the station transferred from the [[Broadway Central Hotel]] to the [[Hotel Claridge|Claridge Hotel]], the new venue would not allow the black musicians to use the main elevator. For this reason, Hammond quit his work with WEVD.<ref name=Prial />

By 1932–33, through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond arranged for the faltering US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough during the [[Great Depression]] that many of them would not have otherwise had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US).

In 1934, Hammond is known to have introduced [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Fletcher Henderson]]. It is said that Hammond convinced the musicians to 'swing' the current jazz hits, so that they could play in a free manner like the original New Orleans Jazz.<ref>\"Swing\". ''The Subject Is Jazz''. WNBC. New York, New York, 1958. Television.</ref>

Hammond always strived for racial integration within the musical scene. For this purpose, he frequently visited musicians in Harlem in order to connect with musicians in their own area. While initially his race proved a problem in connecting with this community, he formed relationships with various musicians that allowed him to surpass this barrier. His friendship with [[Benny Carter]] gave him a status that allowed him to enter this musical community.<ref name=Prial />

He played a role in organizing Benny Goodman's band, and in persuading him to hire black musicians such as [[Charlie Christian]], [[Teddy Wilson]] and [[Lionel Hampton]]. In 1933 he heard the seventeen-year-old [[Billie Holiday]] perform in Harlem and arranged for her recording debut, on a Benny Goodman session. Four years later, he heard the [[Count Basie]] orchestra broadcasting from Kansas City and brought it to New York, where it began to receive national attention.<ref name=\"Centennial\">{{cite web

In 1938, Hammond organized the first ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' concert at Carnegie Hall, presenting a broad program of [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] artists, including [[Ida Cox]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Albert Ammons]], [[Pete Johnson]], [[Meade Lux Lewis|Meade \"Lux\" Lewis]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], the [[Count Basie]] orchestra, [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[James P. Johnson]], and [[Big Bill Broonzy]] (who took the place of the murdered [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]). He coordinated a second ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' concert in 1939.<ref>Berger, Edward. \"Hammond, John (Henry Jr.)\". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz''. Web.</ref>

After serving in the military during World War II, Hammond felt unmoved by the [[bebop]] jazz scene of the mid-1940s. Rejoining [[Columbia Records]] in the late 1950s, he signed [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Babatunde Olatunji]] to the label, and discovered [[Aretha Franklin]],<ref name=pc52>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |Show 52 – The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

In 1961, he heard folk singer [[Bob Dylan]] playing harmonica on a session for [[Carolyn Hester]]; he signed him to Columbia and kept him on the label despite the protests of executives, who referred to Dylan as \"Hammond's folly\".<ref name=pc31>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19789/m1/|title=Show 31 - Ballad in Plain D: An introduction to the Bob Dylan era.

Hammond oversaw the highly influential posthumous reissues of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s recorded work (produced by Frank Driggs), convincing Columbia Records to issue the album ''King of the Delta Blues Singers'' in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smh.com.au/noisepollution/archives/2008/05/the_king_of_the_delta_blues_mi.html|title=The Sydney Morning Herald Blogs: Noise Pollution|website=Blogs.smh.com.au}}</ref> Musicians Hammond signed to the label included [[Leonard Cohen]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]].<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book

Hammond retired from Columbia in 1975, but continued to scout for talent. In 1983, he brought guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] to Columbia and was credited as executive producer on his debut album.

==Personal accounts==
Hammond recognized jazz music to have originated as an African-American musical genre. When Hammond entered the jazz community, integration had not yet begun. Black and white musicians rarely played together and often the prestigious locations permitted only white audiences. Hammond remembers that before the 1920s, black musicians could always find jobs, even if they were low paying. After the instatement of Local 802, a union of professional musicians within New York City, Hammond saw more white people receiving jobs than black people. However, this did not stop the African-American musicians. Through burlesque and record making, these musicians continued to be a presence.<ref name=JazzHist />

1933 was a defining year for Hammond. He remembers this year being extraordinary due to his establishment of relationships with British record companies. Hammond was able to secure contracts for various musicians. He was an attractive producer to these companies because he did not desire a profit for himself. In 1933, he helped [[Benny Goodman]] receive a record deal with [[Columbia Records]], which at the time was only known as English Columbia. During this time, Goodman was in need of a big break, as he was getting a reputation as being difficult to work with. Hammond proposed that Goodman produce a multiracial record; however, Goodman believed this route would hurt his musical reputation.<ref name=Prial />

In this year, Hammond broke out of the traditional role of a producer and became a talent scout, after hearing [[Billie Holiday]]. He remarks that he was astounded to discover that she was the daughter of [[Clarence Holiday]] from [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band. That same year, he was able to get her involved in the [[Benny Goodman Orchestra]].<ref name=JazzHist /> Hammond attributes fate to his finding of Holiday. After hearing her sing for the first time, he wrote, \"She weighs over 200 pounds, is incredibly beautiful, and sings as well as anybody I have ever heard.\"<ref name=Prial />

Later in 1933, he heard [[Teddy Wilson]], a jazz pianist, on the Chicago radio. While he did not discover him, he was able to provide significant opportunities for him, even some collaboration with Billie Holiday.<ref name=JazzHist />

Hammond's work with civil rights came from multiple angles. In 1933, he traveled South to attend a trial regarding the [[Scottsboro case]], a case in which two white girls accused nine black boys of raping them. The testimonies of the two girls did not align with the story. While all nine boys were convicted, Hammond viewed this trial as a \"catalyst for black activism\".<ref name=Prial />

Record integration became an important component of jazz music. Starting in 1935, musicians began to record in mixed-race groups. While some of this integration had already taken place, Hammond remembers it as being hidden. However, in 1935, the Goodman Trio began recording. In 1936, the group appeared in a live concert at the Chicago Hot Jazz Society. Hammond fondly remembers this as an innovative moment in jazz history.<ref name=JazzHist />

==FBI investigation==
[[J. Edgar Hoover]], FBI director, investigated Hammond's link to the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. Due to the various benefits and fund-raisers that Hammond hosted for the popular front, his name was often listed in ''[[The Daily Worker]]'', a communist newspaper. Furthermore, his name often appeared on the letterheads of left-wing organizations for which he was a donor or member. However, Hammond was not a communist.<ref name=Prial />

==Personal life==
John had four sisters: Alice, Rachel, Adele, and Emily.

Early in his career, Hammond focused more on his work than his love life. While he was seen publicly with various women, the relationships were never substantial. However, in 1940 at a Manhattan party, Hammond met Jemison \"Jemy\" McBride. On March 8, 1941, Hammond married Jemy in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The couple had a small, non-denominational wedding with only about ten guests. Although both sets of parents approved of the couple, neither set attended the wedding.<ref name=Prial />

In 1942, Hammond took his wife on a road trip to Los Angeles. Shortly after this trip, Jemy realized that she was pregnant. In November 1942, Jemy gave birth to their first son, [[John P. Hammond]].<ref name=Prial />

On March 21, 1942, Hammond's sister, Alice married [[Benny Goodman]]. She had previously been married to Englishman George Duckworth, a member of the British House of Commons. Hammond did not look kindly upon her marriage to Goodman. After years of arguments and disagreements about musical issues for Goodman's band, Hammond and Goodman had a complete falling out, some of which has been attributed to their differing class and educational backgrounds (Goodman had been born into poverty and had quit high school in order to help support his family as a musician). However, out of a sense of shared grief following Alice's death in 1978, John and Benny reconciled their friendship.<ref name=Prial />

In November 1943, after the United States entered World War II, Hammond began military training. He underwent his basic training at [[Fort Belvoir]]. Hammond was much older than the majority of the other men, and he had a rough time adjusting to the military life. While he was still in basic training, Jemy gave birth to their second child, Douglas, early in 1944. Douglas came down with a serious illness. While Jemy sent Hammond a telegram to alert him of his newborn's condition, Hammond said that he never received it. Jemy speculated that Hammond was in a concert and disregarded the letter; however, that claim has been proven unlikely due to Hammond's strict schedule in basic training. Douglas died shortly after birth from his illness, and Jemy had to undergo the family tragedy without her husband. Hammond returned after basic training on a three-day pass, but he and his wife were distant.<ref name=Prial />

After basic training, Hammond reported to Camp Plauche, where he was placed to organize activities for the black soldiers. During this time period, African-American soldiers were given little to do within the military. The  armed forces were still segregated and discriminatory. Hammond began his efforts by organizing concerts for the soldiers featuring African-American musicians. He noted that shortly after these concerts began, an integrated sports team formed. Toward the end of [[World War II]], Hammond was transferred to [[Fort Benning]], Georgia, known for its intense racism. Hammond was not the only jazz fan irritated with racism. During this time period, [[bebop]] music grew out of late night jam sessions of black musicians. Hammond was not much a part of the bebop movement, but he shared the sentiment against racism.<ref name=Prial />

In 1946, Hammond was discharged from the military. His family moved to [[Greenwich Village]], where Jemy gave birth to their third son, Jason. Hammond threw himself back into his work, which greatly upset his wife. In 1948, Jemy asked Hammond for a divorce. While he was originally reluctant, Hammond agreed to the divorce. Jemy never remarried.<ref name=Prial />

A year later, in 1949, Hammond met Esme Sarnoff, originally Esme O'Brien, the former wife of [[NBC]] chairman Robert W. Sarnoff, and a daughter of Mary and Esmond O'Brien. Esme shared Hammond's musical passion and was planning to divorce her husband. That year, Hammond married Esme Sarnoff. By this marriage Hammond had one stepdaughter, (Esme) Rosita Sarnoff (born 1943). During this time, Hammond's father died on a golf course. Left a widow, Emily Hammond became infatuated with [[Frank Buchman]].<ref name=Prial />

In 1985, Hammond had his first stroke. Although this impaired him physically, his wife's death left him in despair. Esme Hammond was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. While treatments worked for some time, she died May 19, 1986,<ref>\"Esme Hammond, 66, A Prominent Socialite\"; ''The New York Times'' (May 22, 1986); Retrieved October 16, 2011.

Hammond was distraught and died on July 10, 1987, after a series of strokes. It is said that he died listening to the music of Billie Holiday.<ref name=Prial />

Hammond's son, [[John P. Hammond]], became an American Blues musician.

Hammond was one of the first men to racially integrate the American music industry. Before the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] passed, [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], an African American, replaced Hammond as [[Bob Dylan]]'s record producer.<ref name=Prial />

'''John Henry Hammond II''' (December 15, 1910 – July 10, 1987) was an American [[record producer]], [[civil rights]] activist, and music critic from the 1930s to the early 1980s. In his service as a [[A&R|talent scout]], Hammond became one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music. He is the father of famous blues musician [[John P. Hammond]].

Hammond was instrumental in sparking or furthering numerous musical careers, including those of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Harry James]], [[Charlie Christian]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Babatunde Olatunji]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[George Benson]], [[Freddie Green]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Arthur Russell (musician)|Arthur Russell]], [[Jim Copp]], [[Asha Puthli]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Mike Bloomfield]]. He is also largely responsible for the revival of [[delta blues]] artist [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s music.

==Early years and family==
Hammond was born in [[New York City|New York]], christened John Henry Hammond Jr., although both his father and grandfather shared the same name. He was the youngest child and only son of John Henry Hammond and [[Emily Vanderbilt Sloane]]. His mother was one of three daughters of William Douglas Sloane and [[Emily Thorn Vanderbilt]], and a granddaughter of [[William Henry Vanderbilt]].

His father attended [[Yale University]], graduating with a law degree from [[Columbia Law School]]. His grandfather was Civil War General John Henry Hammond, who married Sophia Vernon Wolfe. His father was a brother of [[Ogden H. Hammond]], ambassador to [[Spain]], and uncle to politician [[Millicent Fenwick]]. Despite the family fortune from his mother's side of the family, which included wealth from the [[W. & J. Sloane]] chain, his father worked to provide for his family and maintain the family fortune. He worked \"as a banker, lawyer, and railroad executive\".<ref name=Prial>Dunstan Prial (2006) ''The Producer: John Hammond and the Soul of American Music'', Farrar, Straus and Giroux, {{ISBN|0-374-11304-1}}</ref>

Hammond had four sisters: Emily, Adele, Rachel, and Alice. The youngest, Alice married first, [[Arthur Duckworth]] in 1927, which ended in divorce and second, musician [[Benny Goodman]] in 1942.

Hammond showed interest in music from an early age. At four he began studying the piano, only to switch to the violin at age eight. He was steered toward classical music by his mother, but was more interested in the music sung and played by the servants, many of whom were black. He was known to go down to his basement to listen to the upbeat music in the servants' quarters. He loved [[Sir Harry Lauder]]'s \"[[Roamin' in the Gloamin']]\". While he was in the basement, the rest of his family in the greater part of the five-story mansion would listen to \"the great opera tenor [[Enrico Caruso]], as well as to standard classics by [[Beethoven]], [[Brahms]], and [[Mozart]]\".<ref name=Prial />

Hammond became interested in social reform at a young age. His mother also promoted social reform as a means to give back some of her fortune to the community. She often found solace in religion. Hammond shared her desire to help the community with his privilege.<ref name=Prial />

Hammond notes that the first jazz music that he heard was in London in 1923 on a trip with his family. He heard a band called [[The Georgians (Frank Guarente)|The Georgians]], a white Dixieland jazz group, and saw a Negro show called ''From Dixie to Broadway'', that featured [[Sidney Bechet]]. This trip changed the way that he thought about music. Upon his return to the states, Hammond searched for records by Negro musicians but could not find them in the greater [[Manhattan]] area. He learned that Negro music was sold in different stores, so he began to search for this music in [[Harlem]].<ref name=JazzHist>John Hammond, \"An Experience in Jazz History\", in Dominique-René de Lerma, ed., ''Black Music in Our Culture: Curricular Ideas on the Subjects, Materials, and Problems'' (Kent State University Press, 1970), pp. 42–53.</ref>

In 1925 Hammond graduated from the elementary institution [[St. Bernard's School]] at the age of 14. He persuaded his family to allow him to attend [[Hotchkiss School]] due to its liberal curriculum. Hammond's love for music flourished. However, he felt limited within the confines of a boarding school. Hammond succeeded in convincing the headmaster to allow him to go into the city every other weekend, a rare privilege, so that he could take lessons from Ronald Murat. However, the headmaster was not aware that outside his formal lessons, Hammond would go up to Harlem to hear jazz. During this time, he said that he heard [[Bessie Smith]] perform at [[The Harlem Alhambra]], but her biographer disagrees about the dates.<ref name=Prial />

The summer after graduating from Hotchkiss in 1929, Hammond went to work for a newspaper in Maine, the ''Portland Evening News''. Its editor [[Ernest Gruening]] was also a Hotchkiss alumnus, class of 1903, who was interested in social issues and social justice.<ref name=Prial /><ref name=\"HOTCHKISSNEWS\">[https://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/closerlook.aspx?id=8 \"Alumni Accomplishments: Ernest Gruening '03\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111112714/http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/closerlook.aspx?id=8 |date=November 11, 2012 }}, The Hotchkiss School</ref>

In the fall of 1929, Hammond entered [[Yale University]] as a member of the class of 1933. He studied the violin and, later, [[viola]]. He felt a disconnect with his fellow students at Yale and felt that he was already well acquainted with the professional world. He made frequent trips into New York city and wrote regularly for trade magazines. In the fall semester of 1930, Hammond had to withdraw due to a recurring case of [[jaundice]]. Hammond had no desire to a repeat a semester, which contributed to his dissatisfaction with the university lifestyle. Much to the disappointment of his father, a Yale alumnus, in 1931 he dropped out of school for a career in the music industry, first becoming the U.S. correspondent for ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name=Prial />

==Career==
In 1931, Hammond funded the recording of pianist [[Garland Wilson]], marking the beginning of a long string of artistic successes as record producer. He moved to [[Greenwich Village]], where he claimed to have engaged in bohemian life and worked for an integrated music world. He set up one of the first regular live [[jazz]] programs, and wrote regularly about the racial divide. As he wrote in his memoirs,<ref>''John Hammond On Record: An Autobiography'', {{ISBN|0-671-40003-7}}</ref> \"I heard no color line in the music.... To bring recognition to the negro's supremacy in jazz was the most effective and constructive form of social protest I could think of.\" This pre-occupation with social issues was to continue, and in 1941 he was one of the founders of the [[Council on African Affairs]].

In 1932, Hammond acquired a nonpaying job on the [[WEVD]] radio station as a disc jockey. He did not discriminate when choosing which musicians to air; the station allowed Hammond complete freedom on the station as long as he paid for his time slot. Through this position, Hammond gained a reputation as a well-educated jazz fan. Various musicians were guests on his show, including [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], and [[Art Tatum]]. When the station transferred from the [[Broadway Central Hotel]] to the [[Hotel Claridge|Claridge Hotel]], the new venue would not allow the black musicians to use the main elevator. For this reason, Hammond quit his work with WEVD.<ref name=Prial />

By 1932–33, through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond arranged for the faltering US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough during the [[Great Depression]] that many of them would not have otherwise had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US).

In 1934, Hammond is known to have introduced [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Fletcher Henderson]]. It is said that Hammond convinced the musicians to 'swing' the current jazz hits, so that they could play in a free manner like the original New Orleans Jazz.<ref>\"Swing\". ''The Subject Is Jazz''. WNBC. New York, New York, 1958. Television.</ref>

Hammond always strived for racial integration within the musical scene. For this purpose, he frequently visited musicians in Harlem in order to connect with musicians in their own area. While initially his race proved a problem in connecting with this community, he formed relationships with various musicians that allowed him to surpass this barrier. His friendship with [[Benny Carter]] gave him a status that allowed him to enter this musical community.<ref name=Prial />

He played a role in organizing Benny Goodman's band, and in persuading him to hire black musicians such as [[Charlie Christian]], [[Teddy Wilson]] and [[Lionel Hampton]]. In 1933 he heard the seventeen-year-old [[Billie Holiday]] perform in Harlem and arranged for her recording debut, on a Benny Goodman session. Four years later, he heard the [[Count Basie]] orchestra broadcasting from Kansas City and brought it to New York, where it began to receive national attention.<ref name=\"Centennial\">{{cite web

In 1938, Hammond organized the first ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' concert at Carnegie Hall, presenting a broad program of [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] artists, including [[Ida Cox]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Albert Ammons]], [[Pete Johnson]], [[Meade Lux Lewis|Meade \"Lux\" Lewis]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], the [[Count Basie]] orchestra, [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[James P. Johnson]], and [[Big Bill Broonzy]] (who took the place of the murdered [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]). He coordinated a second ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' concert in 1939.<ref>Berger, Edward. \"Hammond, John (Henry Jr.)\". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz''. Web.</ref>

After serving in the military during World War II, Hammond felt unmoved by the [[bebop]] jazz scene of the mid-1940s. Rejoining [[Columbia Records]] in the late 1950s, he signed [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Babatunde Olatunji]] to the label, and discovered [[Aretha Franklin]],<ref name=pc52>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |Show 52 – The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

In 1961, he heard folk singer [[Bob Dylan]] playing harmonica on a session for [[Carolyn Hester]]; he signed him to Columbia and kept him on the label despite the protests of executives, who referred to Dylan as \"Hammond's folly\".<ref name=pc31>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19789/m1/|title=Show 31 - Ballad in Plain D: An introduction to the Bob Dylan era.

Hammond oversaw the highly influential posthumous reissues of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s recorded work (produced by Frank Driggs), convincing Columbia Records to issue the album ''King of the Delta Blues Singers'' in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smh.com.au/noisepollution/archives/2008/05/the_king_of_the_delta_blues_mi.html|title=The Sydney Morning Herald Blogs: Noise Pollution|website=Blogs.smh.com.au}}</ref> Musicians Hammond signed to the label included [[Leonard Cohen]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]].<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book

Hammond retired from Columbia in 1975, but continued to scout for talent. In 1983, he brought guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] to Columbia and was credited as executive producer on his debut album.

==Personal accounts==
Hammond recognized jazz music to have originated as an African-American musical genre. When Hammond entered the jazz community, integration had not yet begun. Black and white musicians rarely played together and often the prestigious locations permitted only white audiences. Hammond remembers that before the 1920s, black musicians could always find jobs, even if they were low paying. After the instatement of Local 802, a union of professional musicians within New York City, Hammond saw more white people receiving jobs than black people. However, this did not stop the African-American musicians. Through burlesque and record making, these musicians continued to be a presence.<ref name=JazzHist />

1933 was a defining year for Hammond. He remembers this year being extraordinary due to his establishment of relationships with British record companies. Hammond was able to secure contracts for various musicians. He was an attractive producer to these companies because he did not desire a profit for himself. In 1933, he helped [[Benny Goodman]] receive a record deal with [[Columbia Records]], which at the time was only known as English Columbia. During this time, Goodman was in need of a big break, as he was getting a reputation as being difficult to work with. Hammond proposed that Goodman produce a multiracial record; however, Goodman believed this route would hurt his musical reputation.<ref name=Prial />

In this year, Hammond broke out of the traditional role of a producer and became a talent scout, after hearing [[Billie Holiday]]. He remarks that he was astounded to discover that she was the daughter of [[Clarence Holiday]] from [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band. That same year, he was able to get her involved in the [[Benny Goodman Orchestra]].<ref name=JazzHist /> Hammond attributes fate to his finding of Holiday. After hearing her sing for the first time, he wrote, \"She weighs over 200 pounds, is incredibly beautiful, and sings as well as anybody I have ever heard.\"<ref name=Prial />

Later in 1933, he heard [[Teddy Wilson]], a jazz pianist, on the Chicago radio. While he did not discover him, he was able to provide significant opportunities for him, even some collaboration with Billie Holiday.<ref name=JazzHist />

Hammond's work with civil rights came from multiple angles. In 1933, he traveled South to attend a trial regarding the [[Scottsboro case]], a case in which two white girls accused nine black boys of raping them. The testimonies of the two girls did not align with the story. While all nine boys were convicted, Hammond viewed this trial as a \"catalyst for black activism\".<ref name=Prial />

Record integration became an important component of jazz music. Starting in 1935, musicians began to record in mixed-race groups. While some of this integration had already taken place, Hammond remembers it as being hidden. However, in 1935, the Goodman Trio began recording. In 1936, the group appeared in a live concert at the Chicago Hot Jazz Society. Hammond fondly remembers this as an innovative moment in jazz history.<ref name=JazzHist />

==FBI investigation==
[[J. Edgar Hoover]], FBI director, investigated Hammond's link to the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. Due to the various benefits and fund-raisers that Hammond hosted for the popular front, his name was often listed in ''[[The Daily Worker]]'', a communist newspaper. Furthermore, his name often appeared on the letterheads of left-wing organizations for which he was a donor or member. However, Hammond was not a communist.<ref name=Prial />

==Personal life==
John had four sisters: Alice, Rachel, Adele, and Emily.

Early in his career, Hammond focused more on his work than his love life. While he was seen publicly with various women, the relationships were never substantial. However, in 1940 at a Manhattan party, Hammond met Jemison \"Jemy\" McBride. On March 8, 1941, Hammond married Jemy in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The couple had a small, non-denominational wedding with only about ten guests. Although both sets of parents approved of the couple, neither set attended the wedding.<ref name=Prial />

In 1942, Hammond took his wife on a road trip to Los Angeles. Shortly after this trip, Jemy realized that she was pregnant. In November 1942, Jemy gave birth to their first son, [[John P. Hammond]].<ref name=Prial />

On March 21, 1942, Hammond's sister, Alice married [[Benny Goodman]]. She had previously been married to Englishman George Duckworth, a member of the British House of Commons. Hammond did not look kindly upon her marriage to Goodman. After years of arguments and disagreements about musical issues for Goodman's band, Hammond and Goodman had a complete falling out, some of which has been attributed to their differing class and educational backgrounds (Goodman had been born into poverty and had quit high school in order to help support his family as a musician). However, out of a sense of shared grief following Alice's death in 1978, John and Benny reconciled their friendship.<ref name=Prial />

In November 1943, after the United States entered World War II, Hammond began military training. He underwent his basic training at [[Fort Belvoir]]. Hammond was much older than the majority of the other men, and he had a rough time adjusting to the military life. While he was still in basic training, Jemy gave birth to their second child, Douglas, early in 1944. Douglas came down with a serious illness. While Jemy sent Hammond a telegram to alert him of his newborn's condition, Hammond said that he never received it. Jemy speculated that Hammond was in a concert and disregarded the letter; however, that claim has been proven unlikely due to Hammond's strict schedule in basic training. Douglas died shortly after birth from his illness, and Jemy had to undergo the family tragedy without her husband. Hammond returned after basic training on a three-day pass, but he and his wife were distant.<ref name=Prial />

After basic training, Hammond reported to Camp Plauche, where he was placed to organize activities for the black soldiers. During this time period, African-American soldiers were given little to do within the military. The  armed forces were still segregated and discriminatory. Hammond began his efforts by organizing concerts for the soldiers featuring African-American musicians. He noted that shortly after these concerts began, an integrated sports team formed. Toward the end of [[World War II]], Hammond was transferred to [[Fort Benning]], Georgia, known for its intense racism. Hammond was not the only jazz fan irritated with racism. During this time period, [[bebop]] music grew out of late night jam sessions of black musicians. Hammond was not much a part of the bebop movement, but he shared the sentiment against racism.<ref name=Prial />

In 1946, Hammond was discharged from the military. His family moved to [[Greenwich Village]], where Jemy gave birth to their third son, Jason. Hammond threw himself back into his work, which greatly upset his wife. In 1948, Jemy asked Hammond for a divorce. While he was originally reluctant, Hammond agreed to the divorce. Jemy never remarried.<ref name=Prial />

A year later, in 1949, Hammond met Esme Sarnoff, originally Esme O'Brien, the former wife of [[NBC]] chairman Robert W. Sarnoff, and a daughter of Mary and Esmond O'Brien. Esme shared Hammond's musical passion and was planning to divorce her husband. That year, Hammond married Esme Sarnoff. By this marriage Hammond had one stepdaughter, (Esme) Rosita Sarnoff (born 1943). During this time, Hammond's father died on a golf course. Left a widow, Emily Hammond became infatuated with [[Frank Buchman]].<ref name=Prial />

In 1985, Hammond had his first stroke. Although this impaired him physically, his wife's death left him in despair. Esme Hammond was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. While treatments worked for some time, she died May 19, 1986,<ref>\"Esme Hammond, 66, A Prominent Socialite\"; ''The New York Times'' (May 22, 1986); Retrieved October 16, 2011. [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/22/obituaries/esme-hammond-66-a-prominent-socialite.html]</ref> of complications of [[AIDS]]. She had contracted it from a [[blood transfusion]]. Hammond was distraught and died on July 10, 1987, after a series of strokes. It is said that he died listening to the music of Billie Holiday.<ref name=Prial />

The '''Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters''', more commonly called the '''Hague Service Convention''', is a [[multilateral treaty]] which was adopted in [[The Hague]], The [[Netherlands]], on 15 November 1965 by member states of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]. It came into existence to give litigants a reliable and efficient means of [[Service of process|serving]] the documents on parties living, operating or based in another country. The provisions of the convention apply to service of process in civil and commercial matters but not criminal matters. Also, [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=17 Article 1] states that the Convention shall not apply if the address of the person to be served with the document is not known.

== Diplomatic service via letters rogatory ==
{{Main|Letter rogatory}}

For states which are not party to the Hague Service Convention, diplomatic channels are generally used for the service of legal documents. It is generally effected by a [[letter rogatory]], which is a formal request to issue a judicial order from a court in the state where proceedings are underway to a court in another state. This procedure generally requires transmission of the document to be served from the originating court to the foreign ministry in the state of origin. The foreign ministry in the state of origin forwards the request to the foreign ministry in the destination state. The foreign ministry then forwards the documents to the local court. The local court then makes an order to allow for the service. Once service is made, a certificate of service would then pass through the same channels in reverse. Under a somewhat more streamlined procedure, courts can sometimes forward service requests to the foreign ministry or the foreign court directly, cutting out one or more steps in the process.

== Procedure ==
The Hague Service Convention established a more simplified means for parties to effect service in other contracting states. Under the convention, each contracting state is required to designate a central authority to accept incoming requests for service. A judicial officer who is competent to serve process in the state of origin is permitted to send request for service directly to the central authority of the state where service is to be made. Upon receiving the request, the central authority in the receiving state arranges for service in a manner permitted within the receiving state, typically through a local court. Once service is effected, the central authority sends a certificate of service to the judicial officer who made the request. Parties are required to use three standardized forms: a request for service, a summary of the proceedings (similar to a summons), and a certificate of service.

The main benefits of the Hague Service Convention over letters rogatory is that it is faster (requests generally take two to four months rather than six months to one year), it uses standardized forms which should be recognized by authorities in other states, and it is cheaper (in most cases) because service can be effected by a local attorney without hiring a foreign attorney to advise on foreign service procedures.

The Hague Service Convention does not prohibit a receiving state from permitting international service by methods otherwise authorized by domestic law. For example, a state could allow for service directly by mail or by personal service. States which permit parties to use these alternative means of service make a separate designation in the documents they file upon ratifying or acceding to the Convention.

== Alternate methods of service ==
The Hague Convention provides various modes of process service of documents such as by postal channel or by diplomatic/consular agents, judicial officers, officials or other competent persons. These provisions are covered under Articles 8 to 10 and may or not be allowed by member countries as a valid mode of serving the documents in their territory. The method of serving the documents through a central agency (Article 5) is not optional but is binding on all the member countries. Service through a central agency usually takes a long time: 4 to 12 months. The convention gives relief to the litigants if they have not received certificate of service or delivery from the central agency even after waiting for six months. In such cases, the court may, if it considers that a reasonable time has elapsed, give its judgment. Also, in case of urgency, the court may issue a provisional order or protective measure even before six-month waiting period.  
  
=== Central authority ===
Although the service is free, it may take 4 to 12 months for the central authority to process. The central authority decides which method is to be used. In many cases, a bailiff will be assigned by a local court to serve the documents and mail back the proof of service, but service by mail is also possible.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Service of Process in Hong Kong|url=https://plexus-pi.com/the-hague-convention/process-service-under-the-hague-convention/|website=www.plexus-pi.com|publisher=Plexus Investigative Solutions|access-date=22 May 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808080125/https://plexus-pi.com/the-hague-convention/process-service-under-the-hague-convention/|archive-date=8 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Service by mail ===
Service by mail is possible only in states that have not objected to that method under Article 10(a) of the convention and if the jurisdiction where the court case takes place allows it under its applicable law. It is therefore possible in France and the Netherlands but not in Germany, Switzerland, and South Korea, where incoming service is to be effected exclusively through the state's central authority.<ref name=\"List of states\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=17 |title=Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters: Status table |publisher=Hague Conference on Private International Law |accessdate=26 September 2014}}</ref>

In the United States, the interpretation of a provision in Article 10(a) has long been controversial, as the judiciary in some of its jurisdictions contended that service by mail was impossible because the word \"send\" rather than \"serve\" was used in the English-language version of the convention. The matter was finally resolved in May 2017 by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon]]'', bringing the interpretation in line with parties in other US jurisdictions and the rest of the world.

== Relation with other instruments ==
Under the convention, states may conclude different agreements between them that take precedence over the convention. Thus, in the [[European Union]] (except for [[Denmark]]) [[Service regulation|other rules]] are applied instead of the Convention.

==State parties==
{{As of|2019|July}}, 75 states are contracting parties of the Hague Service Convention. They include 62 of the 82 Hague Conference on Private International Law member states in addition to 13 other states.<ref name=\"List of states\"/> Austria has signed the convention, but did not ratify it.

The '''Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters''', more commonly called the '''Hague Service Convention''', is a [[multilateral treaty]] which was adopted in [[The Hague]], The [[Netherlands]], on 15 November 1965 by member states of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]. It came into existence to give litigants a reliable and efficient means of [[Service of process|serving]] the documents on parties living, operating or based in another country. The provisions of the convention apply to service of process in civil and commercial matters but not criminal matters. Also, [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=17 Article 1] states that the Convention shall not apply if the address of the person to be served with the document is not known.

== Diplomatic service via letters rogatory ==
{{Main|Letter rogatory}}

For states which are not party to the Hague Service Convention, diplomatic channels are generally used for the service of legal documents. It is generally effected by a [[letter rogatory]], which is a formal request to issue a judicial order from a court in the state where proceedings are underway to a court in another state. This procedure generally requires transmission of the document to be served from the originating court to the foreign ministry in the state of origin. The foreign ministry in the state of origin forwards the request to the foreign ministry in the destination state. The foreign ministry then forwards the documents to the local court. The local court then makes an order to allow for the service. Once service is made, a certificate of service would then pass through the same channels in reverse. Under a somewhat more streamlined procedure, courts can sometimes forward service requests to the foreign ministry or the foreign court directly, cutting out one or more steps in the process.

== Procedure ==
The Hague Service Convention established a more simplified means for parties to effect service in other contracting states. Under the convention, each contracting state is required to designate a central authority to accept incoming requests for service. A judicial officer who is competent to serve process in the state of origin is permitted to send request for service directly to the central authority of the state where service is to be made. Upon receiving the request, the central authority in the receiving state arranges for service in a manner permitted within the receiving state, typically through a local court. Once service is effected, the central authority sends a certificate of service to the judicial officer who made the request. Parties are required to use three standardized forms: a request for service, a summary of the proceedings (similar to a summons), and a certificate of service.

The main benefits of the Hague Service Convention over letters rogatory is that it is faster (requests generally take two to four months rather than six months to one year), it uses standardized forms which should be recognized by authorities in other states, and it is cheaper (in most cases) because service can be effected by a local attorney without hiring a foreign attorney to advise on foreign service procedures.

The Hague Service Convention does not prohibit a receiving state from permitting international service by methods otherwise authorized by domestic law. For example, a state could allow for service directly by mail or by personal service. States which permit parties to use these alternative means of service make a separate designation in the documents they file upon ratifying or acceding to the Convention.

== Alternate methods of service ==
The Hague Convention provides various modes of process service of documents such as by postal channel or by diplomatic/consular agents, judicial officers, officials or other competent persons. These provisions are covered under Articles 8 to 10 and may or not be allowed by member countries as a valid mode of serving the documents in their territory. The method of serving the documents through a central agency (Article 5) is not optional but is binding on all the member countries. Service through a central agency usually takes a long time: 4 to 12 months. The convention gives relief to the litigants if they have not received certificate of service or delivery from the central agency even after waiting for six months. In such cases, the court may, if it considers that a reasonable time has elapsed, give its judgment. Also, in case of urgency, the court may issue a provisional order or protective measure even before six-month waiting period.  
  
=== Central authority ===
Although the service is free, it may take 4 to 12 months for the central authority to process. The central authority decides which method is to be used. In many cases, a bailiff will be assigned by a local court to serve the documents and mail back the proof of service, but service by mail is also possible.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Service of Process in Hong Kong|url=https://plexus-pi.com/the-hague-convention/process-service-under-the-hague-convention/|website=www.plexus-pi.com|publisher=Plexus Investigative Solutions|access-date=22 May 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808080125/https://plexus-pi.com/the-hague-convention/process-service-under-the-hague-convention/|archive-date=8 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Service by mail ===
Service by mail is possible only in states that have not objected to that method under Article 10(a) of the convention and if the jurisdiction where the court case takes place allows it under its applicable law. It is therefore possible in France and the Netherlands but not in Germany, Switzerland, and South Korea, where incoming service is to be effected exclusively through the state's central authority.<ref name=\"List of states\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=17 |title=Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters: Status table |publisher=Hague Conference on Private International Law |accessdate=26 September 2014}}</ref>

In the United States, the interpretation of a provision in Article 10(a) has long been controversial, as the judiciary in some of its jurisdictions contended that service by mail was impossible because the word \"send\" rather than \"serve\" was used in the English-language version of the convention. The matter was finally resolved in May 2017 by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon]]'', bringing the interpretation in line with parties in other US jurisdictions and the rest of the world.

== Relation with other instruments ==
Under the convention, states may conclude different agreements between them that take precedence over the convention. Thus, in the [[European Union]] (except for [[Denmark]]) [[Service regulation|other rules]] are applied instead of the Convention.

==State parties==
{{As of|2019|July}}, 75 states are contracting parties of the Hague Service Convention. They include 62 of the 82 Hague Conference on Private International Law member states in addition to 13 other states.<ref name=\"List of states\"/> Austria has signed the convention, but did not ratify it.

[[San Marino]] has participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] 10 times, debuting in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]], followed by participation from [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] onward. Having failed to qualify in their first four attempts, San Marino qualified for the Eurovision final for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]]. [[Valentina Monetta]] represented [[San Marino]] in 2012, 2013 and 2014, making her the first Sanmarinese singer to participate in three consecutive contests. Her most recent representation in 2017 together with [[Jimmie Wilson (singer)|Jimmie Wilson]], gave her the title of the woman with the most participations ever in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. In {{escyr|2019}}, [[Serhat (singer)|Serhat]] managed to qualify, marking the second appearance of the country in a Eurovision final.

==History==
In June 2007, [[San Marino RTV|Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino]] (SMRTV), the [[San Marino|Sammarinese]] public service broadcaster, indicated interest in joining the contest in the near future, all depending on the interest of the stockholders, especially [[Italy|Italian]] broadcaster [[RAI]], which had been absent from the Contest since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]]. Five months later, the broadcaster confirmed its participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] in Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/9694/exclusive_san_marino_in_belgrade_confirmed/|title=Exclusive: San Marino in Belgrade confirmed|publisher=ESCToday|date=2007-11-21|accessdate=2007-11-21|last=Hondal|first=Víctor}}</ref> The first Sammarinese entry in the Eurovision Song Contest was [[Miodio]], with the [[Italian language]] song \"[[Complice]]\". San Marino holds the honour of being the 50th country to participate at Eurovision, participating 5th in the first semi-final of the contest. Miodio failed to qualify for the final, receiving just 5 points in total and coming last. SMRTV had originally planned to compete at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 contest]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with the Sammarinese Minister of Culture announcing shortly after the 2008 contest that they had \"good hopes to return\". SMRTV announced that it would be reviewing the 2008 contest, and would have a decision on 2009 participation by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12078/san_marino__we_have_good_hopes_to_return/|title=San Marino: \"We have good hopes to return\"|last=Floras|first=Stella|date=2008-06-10|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=3608|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103113241/http://oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=3608|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-01-03|title=San Marino: State television hopes to participate in 2009 as well|date=2008-06-10|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> It was then rumoured that the country would not be participating in the 2009 contest following reports that SMRTV would withdraw due to poor results at the 2008 contest,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=4439|title=San Marino & Monaco out?|last=Konstantopoulos|first=Fotis|date=2008-11-27|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> however SMRTV rebuked the claim and confirmed its interest in the 2009 contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12654/san_marino_not_quitting_after_poor_start/|title=San Marino not quitting after poor start|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2008-12-08|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> In the end, SMRTV announced that it would not participate in the 2009 contest, having already applied to enter. The broadcaster insisted that this was not due to the poor results of the previous year, but financial difficulties faced by SMRTV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12736/san_marino_leaves_eurovision_song_contest/|title=San Marino leaves Eurovision Song Contest|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2008-12-18|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> San Marino did not return for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]], again stating financial reasons preventing participation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Floras|first=Stella|title=No San Marino either for Eurovision 2010|url=http://esctoday.com/14627/no_san_marino_either_for_eurovision_2010/|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=4 August 2010|date=2009-12-15}}</ref> The broadcaster announced that it hoped to return to the competition in the future and discussed possible participation in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=6241|title=SMRTV not yet decided on ESC or JESC|last=Konstantopoulos|first=Fotis|date=2009-08-21|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2009-08-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103112907/http://oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=6241|archivedate=3 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 
After a two-year absence from the Contest, San Marino returned in [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] with Italian singer [[Senit]] performing \"[[Stand By (Senit song)|Stand By]]\", which failed to take the nation to the final. Between 2012 and 2014, San Marino sent [[Valentina Monetta]] to the contest on three consecutive occasions, which made her the first singer to participate in three consecutive contests since [[Udo Jürgens]], who competed in 1964, 1965 and 1966 for Austria. Her entries in [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] (\"[[The Social Network Song]]\") and [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]] (\"[[Crisalide (Vola)]]\") also failed to qualify San Marino to the final. However, in [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]], Monetta managed to bring San Marino to the final for the first time, where she placed 24th with the song \"[[Maybe (Valentina Monetta song)|Maybe]]\". In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]], the nation once again failed to qualify to the final with the song \"[[Chain of Lights]]\" performed by [[Anita Simoncini]] and [[Michele Perniola]]. In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], San Marino failed to qualify with \"[[I Didn't Know]]\" sung by Turkish performer [[Serhat]]. [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 |2017]] marked Valentina Monetta's fourth time in the contest, however, her song \"[[Spirit in the Night]]\" (with [[Jimmie Wilson (singer)|Jimmie Wilson]]) placed last in the semi-final, tying San Marino's worst performance. This was only slightly improved upon in 2018 with [[Jessika Muscat|Jessika]] and [[Jenifer Brening]]'s second to last place finish with \"[[Who We Are (Jessika Muscat song)|Who We Are]]\". In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]] San Marino sent Serhat again with the song \"[[Say Na Na Na]] \", finishing in 19th place with 77 points, giving San Marino its best result to date. SMRTV confirmed San Marino's participation at the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest on 25 May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://escxtra.com/2019/05/25/san-marino-rtv-confirm-2020-participation/|title=San Marino: RTV confirm 2020 participation!|last=Christou|first=Costa|date=25 May 2019|website=escxtra|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The Sammarinese national broadcaster, [[San Marino RTV]] (SMRTV), broadcasts the event within San Marino and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. Throughout the years, this selection process has varied from an internal selection, where the broadcaster chooses the entry, to a national final with public input. For 2020, San Marino used a national final-type process titled ''Digital Battle Eurovision''. After selecting the [[Senhit (singer)|Senhit]] internally, an online poll was open for two days from 7 March 2020 until 8 March 2020 in order to select the song she would perform in the 2020 contest. The winning song, \"[[Freaky (Senhit song)|Freaky!]]\" was announced on 9 March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2020/03/06/senhit-san-marino-eurovision-2020-digital-battle/251415/|title=Senhit will represent San Marino at Eurovision 2020 and fans will choose her song in a “digital battle”|last=Scarpone|first=Cristian|date=6 March 2020|website=Wiwibloggs|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Later that month, however, the 2020 Contest was cancelled due to the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic|pandemic]] of the [[coronavirus disease 2019|Coronavirus]] (COVID-19).<ref name=\"cancellation\">{{cite news|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-2020-in-rotterdam-is-cancelled|title=Eurovision 2020 in Rotterdam is cancelled|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=18 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref>

===Commentators and spokespersons===
For the show's broadcast on SMRTV, various commentators have been hired throughout the years to provide comment on the Concert in the local language. At Eurovision, after all points are calculated, the presenters of the show call upon each voting country to invite their respective spokesperson to announce the results of their vote on-screen. In 2014, San Marino RTV also provided an English commentary in its internet streaming, with John Kennedy O'Connor and Jamarie Milkovic directly from Copenhagen.

[[San Marino]] has participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] 10 times, debuting in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]], followed by participation from [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] onward. Having failed to qualify in their first four attempts, San Marino qualified for the Eurovision final for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]]. [[Valentina Monetta]] represented [[San Marino]] in 2012, 2013 and 2014, making her the first Sanmarinese singer to participate in three consecutive contests. Her most recent representation in 2017 together with [[Jimmie Wilson (singer)|Jimmie Wilson]], gave her the title of the woman with the most participations ever in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. In {{escyr|2019}}, [[Serhat (singer)|Serhat]] managed to qualify, marking the second appearance of the country in a Eurovision final.

==History==
In June 2007, [[San Marino RTV|Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino]] (SMRTV), the [[San Marino|Sammarinese]] public service broadcaster, indicated interest in joining the contest in the near future, all depending on the interest of the stockholders, especially [[Italy|Italian]] broadcaster [[RAI]], which had been absent from the Contest since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]]. Five months later, the broadcaster confirmed its participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] in Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/9694/exclusive_san_marino_in_belgrade_confirmed/|title=Exclusive: San Marino in Belgrade confirmed|publisher=ESCToday|date=2007-11-21|accessdate=2007-11-21|last=Hondal|first=Víctor}}</ref> The first Sammarinese entry in the Eurovision Song Contest was [[Miodio]], with the [[Italian language]] song \"[[Complice]]\". San Marino holds the honour of being the 50th country to participate at Eurovision, participating 5th in the first semi-final of the contest. Miodio failed to qualify for the final, receiving just 5 points in total and coming last. SMRTV had originally planned to compete at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 contest]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with the Sammarinese Minister of Culture announcing shortly after the 2008 contest that they had \"good hopes to return\". SMRTV announced that it would be reviewing the 2008 contest, and would have a decision on 2009 participation by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12078/san_marino__we_have_good_hopes_to_return/|title=San Marino: \"We have good hopes to return\"|last=Floras|first=Stella|date=2008-06-10|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=3608|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103113241/http://oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=3608|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-01-03|title=San Marino: State television hopes to participate in 2009 as well|date=2008-06-10|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> It was then rumoured that the country would not be participating in the 2009 contest following reports that SMRTV would withdraw due to poor results at the 2008 contest,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=4439|title=San Marino & Monaco out?|last=Konstantopoulos|first=Fotis|date=2008-11-27|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> however SMRTV rebuked the claim and confirmed its interest in the 2009 contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12654/san_marino_not_quitting_after_poor_start/|title=San Marino not quitting after poor start|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2008-12-08|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> In the end, SMRTV announced that it would not participate in the 2009 contest, having already applied to enter. The broadcaster insisted that this was not due to the poor results of the previous year, but financial difficulties faced by SMRTV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12736/san_marino_leaves_eurovision_song_contest/|title=San Marino leaves Eurovision Song Contest|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2008-12-18|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> San Marino did not return for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]], again stating financial reasons preventing participation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Floras|first=Stella|title=No San Marino either for Eurovision 2010|url=http://esctoday.com/14627/no_san_marino_either_for_eurovision_2010/|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=4 August 2010|date=2009-12-15}}</ref> The broadcaster announced that it hoped to return to the competition in the future and discussed possible participation in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=6241|title=SMRTV not yet decided on ESC or JESC|last=Konstantopoulos|first=Fotis|date=2009-08-21|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2009-08-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103112907/http://oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=6241|archivedate=3 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 
[[File:ESC2013 - San Marino 03 (crop).jpg|thumb|right|Four time entrant [[Valentina Monetta]] performing in Malmö ([[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]])]]
After a two-year absence from the Contest, San Marino returned in [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] with Italian singer [[Senit]] performing \"[[Stand By (Senit song)|Stand By]]\", which failed to take the nation to the final. Between 2012 and 2014, San Marino sent [[Valentina Monetta]] to the contest on three consecutive occasions, which made her the first singer to participate in three consecutive contests since [[Udo Jürgens]], who competed in 1964, 1965 and 1966 for Austria. Her entries in [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] (\"[[The Social Network Song]]\") and [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]] (\"[[Crisalide (Vola)]]\") also failed to qualify San Marino to the final. However, in [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]], Monetta managed to bring San Marino to the final for the first time, where she placed 24th with the song \"[[Maybe (Valentina Monetta song)|Maybe]]\". In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]], the nation once again failed to qualify to the final with the song \"[[Chain of Lights]]\" performed by [[Anita Simoncini]] and [[Michele Perniola]]. In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], San Marino failed to qualify with \"[[I Didn't Know]]\" sung by Turkish performer [[Serhat]]. [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 |2017]] marked Valentina Monetta's fourth time in the contest, however, her song \"[[Spirit in the Night]]\" (with [[Jimmie Wilson (singer)|Jimmie Wilson]]) placed last in the semi-final, tying San Marino's worst performance. This was only slightly improved upon in 2018 with [[Jessika Muscat|Jessika]] and [[Jenifer Brening]]'s second to last place finish with \"[[Who We Are (Jessika Muscat song)|Who We Are]]\". In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]] San Marino sent Serhat again with the song \"[[Say Na Na Na]] \", finishing in 19th place with 77 points, giving San Marino its best result to date. SMRTV confirmed San Marino's participation at the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest on 25 May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://escxtra.com/2019/05/25/san-marino-rtv-confirm-2020-participation/|title=San Marino: RTV confirm 2020 participation!|last=Christou|first=Costa|date=25 May 2019|website=escxtra|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The Sammarinese national broadcaster, [[San Marino RTV]] (SMRTV), broadcasts the event within San Marino and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. Throughout the years, this selection process has varied from an internal selection, where the broadcaster chooses the entry, to a national final with public input. For 2020, San Marino used a national final-type process titled ''Digital Battle Eurovision''. After selecting the [[Senhit (singer)|Senhit]] internally, an online poll was open for two days from 7 March 2020 until 8 March 2020 in order to select the song she would perform in the 2020 contest. The winning song, \"[[Freaky (Senhit song)|Freaky!]]\" was announced on 9 March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2020/03/06/senhit-san-marino-eurovision-2020-digital-battle/251415/|title=Senhit will represent San Marino at Eurovision 2020 and fans will choose her song in a “digital battle”|last=Scarpone|first=Cristian|date=6 March 2020|website=Wiwibloggs|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Later that month, however, the 2020 Contest was cancelled due to the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic|pandemic]] of the [[coronavirus disease 2019|Coronavirus]] (COVID-19).<ref name=\"cancellation\">{{cite news|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-2020-in-rotterdam-is-cancelled|title=Eurovision 2020 in Rotterdam is cancelled|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=18 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref>

===Commentators and spokespersons===
For the show's broadcast on SMRTV, various commentators have been hired throughout the years to provide comment on the Concert in the local language. At Eurovision, after all points are calculated, the presenters of the show call upon each voting country to invite their respective spokesperson to announce the results of their vote on-screen. In 2014, San Marino RTV also provided an English commentary in its internet streaming, with John Kennedy O'Connor and Jamarie Milkovic directly from Copenhagen.

{{nihongo|'''''Battle Arena Toshinden'''''|バトルアリーナ闘神伝|Batoru Arīna Tōshinden}} is a weapons-based [[fighting game]] developed by [[Tamsoft]] and published by [[Takara Tomy|Takara]] and [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] in 1995-1996 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Game Boy]], and [[MS-DOS]]. It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, and features a sidestep maneuver which is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3D.\"<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> The gameboy version of the of Battle Arena Toshiden despite sharing the same name as the console & PC counterparts is a different game. It is a 2D weapons based fighter & supports the Super Gameboy cartridge peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom to allow the game to be played on a TV with colour palettes & borders. 

The game was announced as a PlayStation exclusive,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=December 1995|page=14}}</ref> with Sony initially promoting it as a \"[[Killer app|Saturn killer]]\" (against Sega's ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115002712/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |archive-date=2015-01-15 |url-status=live}}</ref> but it was ported to the Saturn with additional features less than a year later. Once fighting games like ''[[Tekken (arcade game)|Tekken]]'' started emerging, ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' declined in popularity, but still spawned a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by ''[[Soul Edge]]'' and other games of the genre.

==Gameplay==
Each character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.

Players move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.

As with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.

==Plot==
A young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father.

Eiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the match is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.

==Characters==
Initially playable characters:
*Eiji Shinjo - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho.
*Kayin Amoh - A Scottish (later retconned as English) swordsman/bounty hunter who happens to be a friend and rival of Eiji. He seeks to avenge the death of his foster father, who was killed by the previous tournament's champion from last year.
*Sofia - A whip-wielding blonde Russian woman who works as a private detective. She seeks to find and recover her long-lost memories.
*Rungo Iron - A strong yet kind-hearted miner who seeks to rescue his wife Lila and his son Christopher from the Secret Society.
*Fo Fai - An elderly Chinese magician who is secretly a cold-hearted serial killer. Fo Fai enters the tournament to satisfy his bloodlust.
*Mondo - An emotionless Japanese ninja warrior who infiltrates the tournament under orders from a rival group of the Secret Society.
*Duke B. Rambert - An arrogant French knight who seeks to find and defeat Eiji to avenge a past loss to him.

[[Unlockable (gaming)|Unlockable]] characters:
*Gaia - The sponsor of the tournament and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the game. His reasons for holding the tournament in the first place are shrouded in mystery. He is later revealed to be the father of Ellis.
*Sho Shinjo - The secret final boss of the game, reached by clearing the game without continues. The champion from last year's previous tournament and Eiji's older brother, he is a merciless swordsman who holds nothing back from within the fights that he participates in. His soundtrack is a variation of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]]
*Cupido ([[Sega Saturn]] version) - A mysterious woman who speaks with cryptic riddles and messages. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and not much is known about her. The \"true\" final boss in this version.
*Uranus ([[Game Boy]] version)
*[[Earthworm Jim (series)#Earthworm Jim|Earthworm Jim]] (PC version) - A guest character who happens to be the main protagonist from his self-named series. His attacks are identical to those of Rungo Iron.

==Release==
The original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was ported by [[Nex Entertainment|Nextech]]/[[Sega]] to the Sega Saturn as '''''Toh Shin Den S''''' in Japan and as '''''Battle Arena Toshinden Remix''''' in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Wave: Toh Shin Den S |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1996|pages=88–89}}</ref> Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Is War Hell for Sega?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=8|quote=''Toshinden'' is almost a year old and ... Takara has been working on the Saturn version for more than a year.}}</ref>

Developed by Digital Dialect, the [[DOS]] port of the PlayStation version added an exclusive new character, Earthworm Jim, complete with his unique arena music, but he only uses the moves of Rungo Iron. It also supports resolutions up to 640x480. The PC port uses the Japanese PlayStation version's voices and music in all regions, unlike the original PlayStation version.

The game was also ported to the [[Game Boy]] by [[Takara]] in 1996, titled '''''Nettou Toshinden''''' in Japan. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the ''Battle Arena Toshinden 2'' version of Gaia (without his armor).

''[[GamePro]]'' reviewed the Japanese version of the game in early 1995 (prior to the PlayStation's launch in the U.S.). They remarked that the game is very impressive, and superior to ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]'' in some aspects, but also flawed in several respects. They particularly praised the [[Texture mapping|texture-mapped]] polygon graphics, original fighters, myriad moves, unique style of play, and the sidestep move, commenting that \"The only problem with this slick defensive move is that from some viewing angles, the fighters obstruct the front of the screen, making it impossible to see where a move is coming from.\"<ref name=\"gamepro69\">{{cite magazine |title=Overseas ProSpects: Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=69 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1995|page=144}}</ref> Their review of the later U.S. release was also generally positive; they praised the graphics, stage design, playability, and dynamic camera, but criticized the game for being simplistic and easy, remarking that \"This game relies more on flash than fighting.\" They summarized the game as \"an enjoyable fight.\"<ref name=\"gamepro74\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Battle Arena Toshinden|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=74|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1995|pages=40–41}}</ref> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' also reviewed the game prior to the PlayStation's U.S. launch. They commented that while the gameplay lacks originality and good reaction speed, the 3D aesthetics and graphics make it a much more powerful experience to play than a typical 2D fighter.

However, they remarked that the poor quality directional pad on the original PlayStation controller \"just isn't built for taking diagonals and quarter circle rolls\", making it irritatingly difficult to pull off special moves. Though they assessed the game as good overall, they advised gamers to instead hold out for the PlayStation port of ''[[Tekken (video game)|Tekken]]'', which they felt to be far superior in every respect.<ref name=\"Max1\">{{cite magazine |title=Battle Arena Toshinden|magazine=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=1|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1995|page=152}}</ref> [[IGN]] gave the game a score of 7 out of 10 in 1996, by which time it was seen as slow and \"not as impressive\" as the more recent ''[[Tekken 2]]'', though they praised ''Toshinden'' for important innovations to the fighting game genre, such as taking \"the fighter into true 3-D\" and \"one little move\" that \"changed the fighter forever\" with the introduction of sidestep movement.<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\">{{cite web|title=Battle Arena Toshinden takes the fighter into true 3-D, but is it enough?|url=http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/150/150716p1.html|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=31 August 2011|date=November 21, 1996|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822005754/http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/150/150716p1.html|archivedate=22 August 2012}}</ref> ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"Dragon221\">{{cite journal|title=Eye of the Monitor|author=Jay & Dee|journal=Dragon|issue=221 |date=September 1995|pages=115–118}}</ref> In an early 1995 interview, when asked which PlayStation game he was most impressed with so far, [[Ken Kutaragi]] answered ''Battle Arena Toshinden''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=An Interview with Ken Kutaragi |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|page=53}}</ref>

The Sega Saturn version was not as well-received as the PlayStation original. The four reviewers of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' complained of the fact that the graphics were not improved from the PlayStation version, and felt that the game was overshadowed by the recent release of ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden 2]]''.<ref name=EGM83/> While Rob Allsetter of ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' greatly praised the visuals of the game and judged the button configuration to be superior to that of the PlayStation version, he criticized the \"slow\" gameplay and the limited variety of moves, concluding that ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' is \"still decent enough, but ... lacks the speed and depth of its more illustrious successors.\"<ref name=ssm>{{cite magazine|last=Allsetter |first=Rob |title=Review: Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=February 1996|pages=76–77}}</ref> A reviewer for ''Next Generation'' said that the visuals of the Japanese release were not up to par with those of the PlayStation version, and advised Saturn owners to wait for the U.S. release in hopes that Sega of America would fix the graphical shortcomings.<ref name=NGen15>{{cite magazine |title=Second Best|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=82}}</ref> ''GamePro'''s Tommy Glide commented that there is not enough additional content in the Saturn version and the graphics do not look as smooth as the PlayStation version's, assessing it as overall \"a poor conversion.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Battle Arena Toshinden Remix|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=93|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1996|page=66}}</ref> ''Maximum''{{'}}s Rich Leadbetter stated that it fails to recreate the graphical effects of the PlayStation original, which he opined were the only saving grace of an extremely dull game.

According to ''Next Generation'', the Saturn release also had \"disappointing sales\" in Japan, which they attributed to the strong association of the game with the PlayStation (due to the use of the character Ellis in Japanese ads for the PlayStation) and its weak use of the Saturn hardware when compared to ''[[Virtua Fighter 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=NG Alphas: Toshinden URA|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=23 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1996|page=90}}</ref>

==Sequels==
During the late 1990s, the game was followed by three sequels, ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden 2]]'', ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden 3]]'', and ''[[Toshinden 4]]'', as well as a spin-off game ''[[Battle Arena Nitoshinden]]''. [[Battle Arena Toshinden (anime)|An anime adaptation of the same title]] was also released in 1996.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/04/25/battle-arena-toshinden/|title=Battle Arena Toshinden|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082019/https://ew.com/article/1997/04/25/battle-arena-toshinden/|archive-date=2018-09-03|url-status=live}}</ref> Eiji appeared as a secret guest character in the Sega Saturn game ''D-Xhird'', released by Takara in 1997.

{{nihongo|'''''Battle Arena Toshinden'''''|バトルアリーナ闘神伝|Batoru Arīna Tōshinden}} is a weapons-based [[fighting game]] developed by [[Tamsoft]] and published by [[Takara Tomy|Takara]] and [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] in 1995-1996 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Game Boy]], and [[MS-DOS]]. It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, and features a sidestep maneuver which is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3D.\"<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/>

The game was announced as a PlayStation exclusive,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=December 1995|page=14}}</ref> with Sony initially promoting it as a \"[[Killer app|Saturn killer]]\" (against Sega's ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115002712/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |archive-date=2015-01-15 |url-status=live}}</ref> but it was ported to the Saturn with additional features less than a year later. Once fighting games like ''[[Tekken (arcade game)|Tekken]]'' started emerging, ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' declined in popularity, but still spawned a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by ''[[Soul Edge]]'' and other games of the genre.

==Gameplay==
Each character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.

Players move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.

As with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.

==Plot==
A young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father.

Eiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the match is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.

*Eiji Shinjo - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho.

==Release==
The original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was ported by [[Nex Entertainment|Nextech]]/[[Sega]] to the Sega Saturn as '''''Toh Shin Den S''''' in Japan and as '''''Battle Arena Toshinden Remix''''' in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Wave: Toh Shin Den S |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1996|pages=88–89}}</ref> Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Is War Hell for Sega?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=8|quote=''Toshinden'' is almost a year old and ... Takara has been working on the Saturn version for more than a year.}}</ref>

Developed by Digital Dialect, the [[DOS]] port of the PlayStation version added an exclusive new character, Earthworm Jim, complete with his unique arena music, but he only uses the moves of Rungo Iron. It also supports resolutions up to 640x480. The PC port uses the Japanese PlayStation version's voices and music in all regions, unlike the original PlayStation version.

The game was also ported to the [[Game Boy]] by [[Takara]] in 1996, titled '''''Nettou Toshinden''''' in Japan. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the ''Battle Arena Toshinden 2'' version of Gaia (without his armor).

''[[GamePro]]'' reviewed the Japanese version of the game in early 1995 (prior to the PlayStation's launch in the U.S.). They remarked that the game is very impressive, and superior to ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]'' in some aspects, but also flawed in several respects. They particularly praised the [[Texture mapping|texture-mapped]] polygon graphics, original fighters, myriad moves, unique style of play, and the sidestep move, commenting that \"The only problem with this slick defensive move is that from some viewing angles, the fighters obstruct the front of the screen, making it impossible to see where a move is coming from.\"<ref name=\"gamepro69\">{{cite magazine |title=Overseas ProSpects: Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=69 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1995|page=144}}</ref> Their review of the later U.S. release was also generally positive; they praised the graphics, stage design, playability, and dynamic camera, but criticized the game for being simplistic and easy, remarking that \"This game relies more on flash than fighting.\" They summarized the game as \"an enjoyable fight.\"<ref name=\"gamepro74\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Battle Arena Toshinden|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=74|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1995|pages=40–41}}</ref> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' also reviewed the game prior to the PlayStation's U.S. launch.

The Sega Saturn version was not as well-received as the PlayStation original.

According to ''Next Generation'', the Saturn release also had \"disappointing sales\" in Japan, which they attributed to the strong association of the game with the PlayStation (due to the use of the character Ellis in Japanese ads for the PlayStation) and its weak use of the Saturn hardware when compared to ''[[Virtua Fighter 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=NG Alphas: Toshinden URA|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=23 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1996|page=90}}</ref>

==Sequels==
During the late 1990s, the game was followed by three sequels, ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden 2]]'', ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden 3]]'', and ''[[Toshinden 4]]'', as well as a spin-off game ''[[Battle Arena Nitoshinden]]''. [[Battle Arena Toshinden (anime)|An anime adaptation of the same title]] was also released in 1996.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/04/25/battle-arena-toshinden/|title=Battle Arena Toshinden|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082019/https://ew.com/article/1997/04/25/battle-arena-toshinden/|archive-date=2018-09-03|url-status=live}}</ref> Eiji appeared as a secret guest character in the Sega Saturn game ''D-Xhird'', released by Takara in 1997.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.
[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]

==Trenton Plant Assets==
===Iron Making===
* Two blast furnaces
:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company. The hearth diameter was 28' 6\" with a working volume of 56,676 cubic ft.
* Sinter Plant
:Phased out in 1969. Very inefficient; it produced low-grade ore from wastes from the blast furnaces.
* Three Ore Bridges
:Built by Dravo Corp. Two cranes in 1954, with the last in 1958. 12 net tons each.
* One conventional ore yard opposite of the blast furnace, and two conveyor fed auxiliary yards.

===Steelmaking===
====Oxygen Process shop====
* OP 1
:Three 60 ton vessels added in 1954.
:First successful basic oxygen shop in the United States. This shop was dismantled in 1968 as a result of the high operating costs compared to OP 2.
* OP 2
:Five oxygen process vessels
::Two 110 ton vessels added in 1958, one more 110 ton vessel added in 1960, two more added in 1968. All five were built by Pennsylvania Engineering Company (PECOR).
::The reason that relatively small 110 ton vessels were used was due to the low ceilings in the existing building.

====Melt Shop====
:Four 60 ton electric arc furnaces installed in 1948 as the first expansion project.
:Two 200 ton electric arc furnaces installed in 1954 to replace the four original furnaces.

====A.O.D shop====
:Installed in 1977. 100 Net ton heat size. Three [[argon oxygen decarburization]] vessels were installed by PECOR.
::Only a total of 39 heats produced by this process. Average time per heat was 2 hours and 15 minutes. Later dismantled and turned into the ladle metallurgy station.

The entire steelmaking building, with the exception of the lime storage building, was demolished in 2005. The lime storage building was brought down with explosives on April 18th, 2010.

===Continuous Casting===
Pilot plant
:The first straight stick slab casting machine in America was installed in 1963. The machine was located south of OP 1. Schloemann was the main equipment vendor. Dismantled in 1968.
Concast department
:Four low profile curved molds with progressive straightening.
::Three molds cast 12\" thick while the other casts 9.5\". All molds could adjust the width from 36\" to 57\". Typical casting speed was 34-46 inches per minute for a 12\" slab, and 48-55 IPM for a 9.5\" slab. Maximum 120 inches per minute.

Main building was demolished in 2006.

===Hot Strip Mill===
====Furnaces====
Soaking pits
:5 two hole batteries. Natural gas fired. Built by Amsler Morton and the Rust Furnace Company in 1948.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer process|Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the [[electric arc furnace|electric furnaces]]. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate different ways to supplement its electric furnaces. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.
<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer process|Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the electric furnace capability. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate different ways to supplement its [[electric arc furnace|electric furnaces]]. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.
<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

Different methods can be used to define Southern Europe, including its [[political]], [[economic]], and [[cultural]] attributes. Southern Europe can also be defined by its natural features — its [[geography]], [[climate]], and [[flora]]. Politically, seven of the Southern European states form the [[EU Med]] group.

==Geography==
Geographically, Southern Europe is the southern half of the landmass of [[Europe]]. This definition is relative, although largely based in history, culture, [[climate]], and flora which is shared across the region. Southern Europe can be subdivided in:

*[[Southwestern Europe]]: the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Andorra]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]), including the [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. 

*[[Southcentral Europe]]:  The Italian peninsula ([[Italy]] and the micro-states of [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]])

The major islands in the region include [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Corsica]], [[Crete]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and the [[Island country|Island countries]] of [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]].

==Climate==
[[File:Europe Köppen Map.png|thumb|upright=1.2|European climate.]]
Southern Europe's most emblematic [[climate]] is that of the [[Mediterranean climate]], which has become a typically known characteristic of the area, which is due to the large subtropical semi-permanent centre of high atmospheric pressure found, not in the Mediterranean itself, but in the Atlantic Ocean, the [[Azores High]]. The Mediterranean climate covers [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], coastal [[Croatia]], coastal [[Slovenia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], [[Greece]], as well as the Mediterranean islands. Those areas of Mediterranean climate present similar vegetations and landscapes throughout, including dry [[hill]]s, small [[plain]]s, [[pine]] [[forest]]s and [[olive]] [[tree]]s.

Cooler climates can be found in certain parts of Southern European countries, for example within the mountain ranges of Spain and Italy. Additionally, the north coast of Spain experiences a wetter Atlantic climate.

Southern Europe's [[flora]] is that of the Mediterranean Region, one of the [[phytochoria]] recognized by [[Armen Takhtajan]]. The Mediterranean and Submediterranean climate regions in Europe are found in much of Southern Europe, mainly in Southern Portugal, most of Spain, the southern coast of [[France]], Italy, the Croatian coast, much of Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Greece, and the Mediterranean islands.<ref>[[:de:Wolfgang Frey|Wolfgang Frey]] and [[:de:Rainer Lösch|Rainer Lösch]]; ''Lehrbuch der Geobotanik.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Prima tetrarchia Diocletianus.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Roman Empire. In yellow the south-west of Europe, and in violet the south-east.]]
The [[Phoenicians]] originally expanded from [[Canaan]] [[port]]s, dominating trade in the [[Mediterranean]] by the 8th century BC. [[Carthage]] was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]] and [[Sardinia]], which created conflicts of interest with [[Etruria]]. Its colonies later reached the [[Mediterranean Sea|Western Mediterranean]], such as [[Cádiz]] in Spain and most notably [[Carthage]] in North Africa, and even the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The civilisation spread across the Mediterranean between 1500 BC and 300 BC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/phoenicia/|title=Phoenicia|encyclopedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref>

The period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the rise of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout [[Asia]]. The [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean Basin]] in a vast empire based on [[Roman law]] and [[Roman legion]]s. It promoted trade, tolerance, and Greek culture. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the [[Western Roman Empire]] based in Rome, and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] based in Constantinople. The attacks of the [[Goths]] led to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]]. During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the Byzantine Empire. In Western Europe, [[Germanic peoples]] moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established [[Barbarian kingdoms|kingdoms]] and empires of their own.

The period known as the [[Crusades]], a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back into Christian rule, began. Several [[Crusader states]] were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the [[Silk Road]] and open the way for the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers. The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] for Christendom. The [[late Middle Ages]] represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused [[Demography|demographic]] catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and [[War of aggression|wars of conquest]] kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In the [[Balkans]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], a Turkish state originating in [[Anatolia]], encroached steadily on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.

===Post-Middle Ages===
[[File:Iberian Union Empires2.png|thumb|[[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colonies]]
Beginning roughly in the 12th century in [[Florence]], and later spreading through Europe with the development of the [[printing press]], a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and [[theology]], with the Arabic texts and thought<ref>e.g. [[Averroes#Commentaries on Aristotle and Plato]] written in the 12th century, which was mentioned in ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' [http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display?Italian?Inferno?4?121?151?45?1?????1?

The Catholic reconquest of Portugal and Spain led to a series of oceanic explorations resulting in the [[Age of Discovery]] that established direct links with Africa, the Americas, and Asia. During this period, Iberian forces engaged in a worldwide struggle with Islamic societies; the battlefronts in this Ibero-Islamic World War stretched from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] into the [[Indian Ocean]], finally involving the islands of [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Truxillo |first1=Charles A. |title=By the Sword and the Cross: The Historical Evolution of the Catholic World Monarchy in Spain and the New World, 1492-1825}}</ref> Eventually this ecumenical conflict ended when new players—England, Holland and France—replaced Spain and Portugal as the main agents of European imperialism in the mid-17th century.

European overseas expansion led to the rise of [[colonial empire]]s, producing the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard J.

Balkan nations began to regain independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Italy unified into a nation state. The [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 ended the [[Temporal power (papal)|Papal temporal power]].

===20th century===
The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in Southeastern Europe as the [[Great Powers]] took up sides. The Allies defeated the [[Central Powers]] in 1918. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The Nazi regime under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and along with [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] sought to gain control of the continent by the [[Second World War]].
Following the Allied victory in the Second World War, Europe was divided by the [[Iron Curtain]]. The countries in Southeastern Europe were dominated by the [[Soviet Union]] and became [[communist state]]s. The major non-communist Southern European countries joined a US-led military alliance ([[NATO]]) and formed the [[European Economic Community]] amongst themselves. The countries in the Soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the economic bloc called [[Comecon]]. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] was neutral. The common attribute of the eastern countries is that all of them have experiences about [[socialism]], but nevertheless, the beginning of the 1990s was just roughly the same. For some of them becoming independent was the major challenge, while others needed to face with poverty and deep dictatorship also Economically, parallel with the political changes, and the democratic transition, – as a rule of law states – the previous command economies were transformed via the legislation into market economies, and set up or renewed the major macroeconomic factors: budgetary rules, national audit, national currency, central bank. Generally, they shortly encountered the following problems: high inflation, high unemployment, low economic growth and high government debt. By 2000 these economies were stabilized, and sooner or later between 2004 and 2013 some of them joined the European Union, and Slovenia introduced the euro.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vértesy|first=László|date=2018|title=Macroeconomic Legal Trends in the EU11 Countries|url=https://www.dialogcampus.hu/users/default/dialogcampus/uploads/elektronikus_konyvek/pga2018_01_09_vertesy.pdf|journal=Public Governance, Administration and Finances Law Review|volume=Vol. 3. No. 1. 2018|pages=|via=}}</ref> 

Italy became a major [[industrialized country]] again, due to its post-war [[economic miracle]]. The [[European Union]] (EU) involved the division of powers, with taxation, health, and education handled by the nation states, while the EU had charge of market rules, competition, legal standards and environmentalism. The Soviet economic and political system collapsed, leading to the end of communism in the satellite countries in 1989, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. As a consequence, [[Maastricht Treaty|Europe's integration deepened]], the continent became depolarised, and the European Union expanded to subsequently include many of the formerly communist European countries – [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] (2007) and [[Croatia]] (2013).

===Romance languages===
The most widely spoken family of languages in Southern Europe are the [[Romance languages]], the heirs of Latin, which have spread from the Italian peninsula, and are emblematic of Southwestern Europe. ''(See the [[Latin Arch]].)''
By far the most common Romance languages in Southern Europe are Italian (spoken by over 50 million people in Italy, Malta, San Marino, and the Vatican) and Spanish, which is spoken by over 40 million people in Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar. Other common Romance languages include Portuguese (spoken in Portugal and Andorra), Catalan (spoken in eastern Spain, Andorra, Southwestern France, and the [[Sardinia]]n town of [[Alghero]] in Italy), [[Galician language|Galician]] (spoken in northwestern Spain) and [[Occitan]], which is spoken in the [[Val d'Aran]] in Catalonia, in the [[Occitan Valleys]] in Italy and in southern France.

===Other languages===
The [[Hellenic languages]] or [[Greek language]] are widely spoken in Greece and Cyprus. Additionally, other varieties of Greek are spoken in small communities in parts of other European countries.

English is used as a second language in parts of Southern Europe. As a primary language, however, English has only a small presence in Southern Europe, only in Gibraltar (alongside Spanish) and Malta (secondary to Maltese). English is also widely spoken in Cyprus.

The predominant religion in Southern Europe is [[Christianity]]. Christianity spread throughout Southern Europe during the Roman Empire, and Christianity was adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire in the year 380 AD. 
Due to [[East–West Schism|the historical break of the Church]] into the western half based in Rome and the eastern half based in Constantinople, different denominations of Christianity are prominent in different parts of Europe.
[[Christians]] in the western half of Southern Europe — e.g., Portugal, Spain, Italy — are generally [[Roman Catholic]]. Christians in the eastern half of Southern Europe — e.g., Greece, North Macedonia — are generally [[Eastern Orthodox]]. [[Islam]] is widely practiced in Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo and Turkey and [[Northern Cyprus]]. Muslims are a significant minority in several countries of Southern Europe- e.g., Greece, Italy, Spain.<ref name=\"pewresearch.org\">{{citation|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/29/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/|title=5 facts about the Muslim population in Europe|date=November 29, 2017|work=[[Pew Research Center]]|author=Conrad Hackett}}</ref>
Judaism was practiced widely throughout the European continent within the Roman Empire from the 2nd century. Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews were accused of ritual murder, faced pogroms and legal discrimination.

Also often included despite not having a coast in the Mediterranean are [[Portugal]], [[Serbia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Andorra]], [[San Marino]] and [[Vatican City]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1t2CAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA210 Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology], Dr Alan Barnard and Jonathan Spence. Retrieved 10 October 2015.</ref><ref> https://guides.ucf.edu/countries/southerneurope </ref> Some definitions may also include [[Southern France]] ([[Corsica]], [[Occitanie]] and [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]) and [[Monaco]], which are otherwise considered parts of [[Western Europe]], and [[Bulgaria]], which is otherwise considered part of [[Eastern Europe]].

Different methods can be used to define Southern Europe, including its [[political]], [[economic]], and [[cultural]] attributes. Southern Europe can also be defined by its natural features — its [[geography]], [[climate]], and [[flora]]. Politically, seven of the Southern European states form the [[EU Med]] group.

==Geography==
Geographically, Southern Europe is the southern half of the landmass of [[Europe]]. This definition is relative, although largely based in history, culture, [[climate]], and flora which is shared across the region. Southern Europe can be subdivided in:

*[[Southwestern Europe]]: the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Andorra]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]), including the [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. 

*[[Southcentral Europe]]:  The Italian peninsula ([[Italy]] and the micro-states of [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]])

*[[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]]: [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[East Thrace]] (part of European [[Turkey]]), [[Greece]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/place/Balkans Article in ''Britannica'']</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20970684|title=New five-euro note has goddess|date=27 October 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>Library of Congress.

The major islands in the region include [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Corsica]], [[Crete]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and the [[Island country|Island countries]] of [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]].

==Climate==
[[File:Europe Köppen Map.png|thumb|upright=1.2|European climate.]]
Southern Europe's most emblematic [[climate]] is that of the [[Mediterranean climate]], which has become a typically known characteristic of the area, which is due to the large subtropical semi-permanent centre of high atmospheric pressure found, not in the Mediterranean itself, but in the Atlantic Ocean, the [[Azores High]]. The Mediterranean climate covers [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], coastal [[Croatia]], coastal [[Slovenia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], [[Greece]], as well as the Mediterranean islands. Those areas of Mediterranean climate present similar vegetations and landscapes throughout, including dry [[hill]]s, small [[plain]]s, [[pine]] [[forest]]s and [[olive]] [[tree]]s.

Cooler climates can be found in certain parts of Southern European countries, for example within the mountain ranges of Spain and Italy. Additionally, the north coast of Spain experiences a wetter Atlantic climate.

Southern Europe's [[flora]] is that of the Mediterranean Region, one of the [[phytochoria]] recognized by [[Armen Takhtajan]]. The Mediterranean and Submediterranean climate regions in Europe are found in much of Southern Europe, mainly in Southern Portugal, most of Spain, the southern coast of [[France]], Italy, the Croatian coast, much of Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Greece, and the Mediterranean islands.<ref>[[:de:Wolfgang Frey|Wolfgang Frey]] and [[:de:Rainer Lösch|Rainer Lösch]]; ''Lehrbuch der Geobotanik.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Prima tetrarchia Diocletianus.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Roman Empire. In yellow the south-west of Europe, and in violet the south-east.]]
The [[Phoenicians]] originally expanded from [[Canaan]] [[port]]s, dominating trade in the [[Mediterranean]] by the 8th century BC. [[Carthage]] was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]] and [[Sardinia]], which created conflicts of interest with [[Etruria]]. Its colonies later reached the [[Mediterranean Sea|Western Mediterranean]], such as [[Cádiz]] in Spain and most notably [[Carthage]] in North Africa, and even the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The civilisation spread across the Mediterranean between 1500 BC and 300 BC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/phoenicia/|title=Phoenicia|encyclopedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref>

The period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the rise of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout [[Asia]]. The [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean Basin]] in a vast empire based on [[Roman law]] and [[Roman legion]]s. It promoted trade, tolerance, and Greek culture. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the [[Western Roman Empire]] based in Rome, and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] based in Constantinople. The attacks of the [[Goths]] led to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]]. During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the Byzantine Empire. In Western Europe, [[Germanic peoples]] moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established [[Barbarian kingdoms|kingdoms]] and empires of their own.

The period known as the [[Crusades]], a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back into Christian rule, began. Several [[Crusader states]] were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the [[Silk Road]] and open the way for the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers. The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] for Christendom. The [[late Middle Ages]] represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused [[Demography|demographic]] catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and [[War of aggression|wars of conquest]] kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In the [[Balkans]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], a Turkish state originating in [[Anatolia]], encroached steadily on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.

===Post-Middle Ages===
[[File:Iberian Union Empires2.png|thumb|[[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colonies]]
Beginning roughly in the 12th century in [[Florence]], and later spreading through Europe with the development of the [[printing press]], a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and [[theology]], with the Arabic texts and thought<ref>e.g. [[Averroes#Commentaries on Aristotle and Plato]] written in the 12th century, which was mentioned in ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' [http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display?Italian?Inferno?4?121?151?45?1?????1? IV:144] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620010334/http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display%3FItalian%3FInferno%3F4%3F121%3F151%3F45%3F1%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F1%3F |date=2015-06-20 }} around 1320 AD</ref> bringing about rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge. The Catholic reconquest of Portugal and Spain led to a series of oceanic explorations resulting in the [[Age of Discovery]] that established direct links with Africa, the Americas, and Asia. During this period, Iberian forces engaged in a worldwide struggle with Islamic societies; the battlefronts in this Ibero-Islamic World War stretched from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] into the [[Indian Ocean]], finally involving the islands of [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Truxillo |first1=Charles A. |title=By the Sword and the Cross: The Historical Evolution of the Catholic World Monarchy in Spain and the New World, 1492-1825}}</ref> Eventually this ecumenical conflict ended when new players—England, Holland and France—replaced Spain and Portugal as the main agents of European imperialism in the mid-17th century.

European overseas expansion led to the rise of [[colonial empire]]s, producing the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard J.

Balkan nations began to regain independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Italy unified into a nation state. The [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 ended the [[Temporal power (papal)|Papal temporal power]].

===20th century===
The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in Southeastern Europe as the [[Great Powers]] took up sides. The Allies defeated the [[Central Powers]] in 1918. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The Nazi regime under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and along with [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] sought to gain control of the continent by the [[Second World War]].
Following the Allied victory in the Second World War, Europe was divided by the [[Iron Curtain]]. The countries in Southeastern Europe were dominated by the [[Soviet Union]] and became [[communist state]]s. The major non-communist Southern European countries joined a US-led military alliance ([[NATO]]) and formed the [[European Economic Community]] amongst themselves. The countries in the Soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the economic bloc called [[Comecon]]. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] was neutral. The common attribute of the eastern countries is that all of them have experiences about [[socialism]], but nevertheless, the beginning of the 1990s was just roughly the same. For some of them becoming independent was the major challenge, while others needed to face with poverty and deep dictatorship also Economically, parallel with the political changes, and the democratic transition, – as a rule of law states – the previous command economies were transformed via the legislation into market economies, and set up or renewed the major macroeconomic factors: budgetary rules, national audit, national currency, central bank. Generally, they shortly encountered the following problems: high inflation, high unemployment, low economic growth and high government debt. By 2000 these economies were stabilized, and sooner or later between 2004 and 2013 some of them joined the European Union, and Slovenia introduced the euro.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vértesy|first=László|date=2018|title=Macroeconomic Legal Trends in the EU11 Countries|url=https://www.dialogcampus.hu/users/default/dialogcampus/uploads/elektronikus_konyvek/pga2018_01_09_vertesy.pdf|journal=Public Governance, Administration and Finances Law Review|volume=Vol. 3. No. 1. 2018|pages=|via=}}</ref> 

Italy became a major [[industrialized country]] again, due to its post-war [[economic miracle]]. The [[European Union]] (EU) involved the division of powers, with taxation, health, and education handled by the nation states, while the EU had charge of market rules, competition, legal standards and environmentalism. The Soviet economic and political system collapsed, leading to the end of communism in the satellite countries in 1989, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. As a consequence, [[Maastricht Treaty|Europe's integration deepened]], the continent became depolarised, and the European Union expanded to subsequently include many of the formerly communist European countries – [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] (2007) and [[Croatia]] (2013).

===Romance languages===
The most widely spoken family of languages in Southern Europe are the [[Romance languages]], the heirs of Latin, which have spread from the Italian peninsula, and are emblematic of Southwestern Europe. ''(See the [[Latin Arch]].)''
By far the most common Romance languages in Southern Europe are Italian (spoken by over 50 million people in Italy, Malta, San Marino, and the Vatican) and Spanish, which is spoken by over 40 million people in Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar. Other common Romance languages include Portuguese (spoken in Portugal and Andorra), Catalan (spoken in eastern Spain, Andorra, Southwestern France, and the [[Sardinia]]n town of [[Alghero]] in Italy), [[Galician language|Galician]] (spoken in northwestern Spain) and [[Occitan]], which is spoken in the [[Val d'Aran]] in Catalonia, in the [[Occitan Valleys]] in Italy and in southern France.

===Other languages===
The [[Hellenic languages]] or [[Greek language]] are widely spoken in Greece and Cyprus. Additionally, other varieties of Greek are spoken in small communities in parts of other European countries.

English is used as a second language in parts of Southern Europe. As a primary language, however, English has only a small presence in Southern Europe, only in Gibraltar (alongside Spanish) and Malta (secondary to Maltese). English is also widely spoken in Cyprus.

There are other language groupings in Southern Europe. [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is spoken in Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro,  Serbia and parts of Italy (particularly by the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] people in [[Southern Italy]]) and Greece, and [[Serbo-Croatian]] is spoken in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro. [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] is spoken in Slovenia, Italy (in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]) and Croatia (in [[Istria]]) and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] is spoken in North Macedonia. [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is a [[Semitic language]] that is the official language of Malta, descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]], but written in the Latin script with heavy Latin and Italian influences. The [[Basque language]] is spoken in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], a region in northern Spain and southwestern France.

The predominant religion in Southern Europe is [[Christianity]]. Christianity spread throughout Southern Europe during the Roman Empire, and Christianity was adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire in the year 380 AD. 
Due to [[East–West Schism|the historical break of the Church]] into the western half based in Rome and the eastern half based in Constantinople, different denominations of Christianity are prominent in different parts of Europe.
[[Christians]] in the western half of Southern Europe — e.g., Portugal, Spain, Italy — are generally [[Roman Catholic]]. Christians in the eastern half of Southern Europe — e.g., Greece, North Macedonia — are generally [[Eastern Orthodox]]. [[Islam]] is widely practiced in Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo and Turkey and [[Northern Cyprus]]. Muslims are a significant minority in several countries of Southern Europe- e.g., Greece, Italy, Spain.<ref name=\"pewresearch.org\">{{citation|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/29/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/|title=5 facts about the Muslim population in Europe|date=November 29, 2017|work=[[Pew Research Center]]|author=Conrad Hackett}}</ref>
Judaism was practiced widely throughout the European continent within the Roman Empire from the 2nd century. Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews were accused of ritual murder, faced pogroms and legal discrimination.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer process|Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the electric furnace capability. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate different ways to supplement its [[electric arc furnace|electric furnaces]]. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer process|Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the electric furnace capability. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate different ways to supplement its [[electric arc furnace|electric furnaces]]. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.

McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer process|Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the [[electric arc furnace|electric furnaces]]. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to take a different approach. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.
<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer process|Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the [[electric arc furnace|electric furnaces]]. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate a different avenue. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.
<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

'''''Bretagne''''' was a large 110-gun three-decker French [[ship of the line]], built at [[Brest, France|Brest]], which became famous as the flagship of the Brest Fleet during the [[American War of Independence]]. She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />

== Context ==
The [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''. On 1 September 1762,<ref name=nomprestigieux>{{cite web |last1=Mioque |first1=Nicolas |title=La Bretagne : origine d’un nom prestigieux dans la Marine française |url=https://troisponts.net/2019/02/01/la-bretagne-origine-dun-nom-prestigieux-dans-la-marine-francaise/ |website=Trois Ponts ! |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=French |date=1 February 2019}}</ref> the [[Estates of Brittany]] gathered at the Couvent des Cordeliers in Rennes<ref name=binet212>Binet, p.212</ref> and decided to raise one million [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] in order to offer a 100-gun [[Three-decker]].<ref name=binet211>Binet, p.211</ref> [[Ship-of-the-line lieutenant|Lieutenant]] Jean-Claude Louis de Quelen rode to [[Choisy-le-Roi]]<ref name=binet215>Binet, p.215</ref> to inform [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], arriving on 5 and returning on 9 with acceptance letters from the King and from the Duke de Choiseul.<ref name=nomprestigieux /> Administrative dispositions for a load started on 2 November, and were completed by 17.<ref name=binet217>Binet, p.217</ref> Budget would eventually reach  1,010,000 [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] for her.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 />

The donation had political connotations, both in terms of rivalry between the various donating institutions, and for the status of Bretagne within France.<ref name=forrer13>Forrer, p. 13</ref> Therefore, the Estates of Brittany attached their gift to a number of requests: that the ship be named ''Bretagne'' rather than ''États de Bretagne'', that the crew be composed of Bretons exlusively, and that the ship be a three-decker.<ref name=binet213>Binet, p.213</ref> Furthermore, rather than donate funds that the Crown would invest in construction, the Estates demanded to supervise construction themselves at the shipyards of the [[French East India Company]] in [[Lorient]].<ref name=nomprestigieux /><ref name=binet211 />

On 2 November 1761, the Commission of the Estates of Brittany in charge of construction mandated [[Antoine Groignard]] as chief engineer, with Gaubry as deputy and Damel as an advisor.<ref name=binet218>Binet, p.218</ref> Groignard worked both for the French Royal Navy and for the French East India Company; he had recently directed the construction of the 80-gun [[French ship Orient (1756)|''Orient'']], the [[74-gun]] [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], the 64-gun [[French ship Vengeur (1765)|''Vengeur'']] and [[French ship Solitaire (1774)|''Solitaire'']], and was supervising ongoing construction of the 74-gun [[French ship Diligent (1763)|''Diligent'']] and [[French ship Six Corps (1762)|''Six Corps'']], the 56-gun [[French ship Bordelois|''Bordelois'']] in Lorient, that of the 56-gun [[French ship Utile (1764)|''Utile'']],  [[French ship Ferme (1763)|''Ferme'']] and [[French ship Flamand|''Flamand'']] in [[Bordeaux]], and four frigates in Nantes.<ref name=binet219>Binet, p.219</ref> 

On 17 November 1761, Groignard sent of proposal for a budget between 919,000 and 1,115,000 pounds.<ref name=binet220>Binet, p.220</ref> The shipyards in Lorient received their first orders in early December.<ref name=binet221>Binet, p.221</ref> Choiseul wrote the Groignard to congratulate him for his appointment, and to argue in favour of building a 80-gun two-decker, with [[36-pounder long gun|36-pounders]] on the lower battery and [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounders]] on the upper, although he conceded that political considerations mandated a three-decker. He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> 

Groignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> 

[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien Régime]].]]
By 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and manœuverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />

The Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />

In August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>

However, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided cease procuring material directly and to mandate a harbour for the overall budget of the project, either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> 

On 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />

Completion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />

== Career ==
In 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777. She took two more months for fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 />

=== Anglo-French War (1778–1783)===
[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130049.JPG|thumb|Later, naive representation of the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] depicting ''Bretagne'' fighting [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']].]]
[[File:Bretagne engraving Salem.jpeg|thumb|Representation of ''Bretagne'' circa 1782, [[Peabody Essex Museum]], [[Salem, Massachusetts]].]]
She took part in most of the engagements of the European theatre of the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]],<ref name=binet262>Binet, p.262</ref> notably the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] in 1778, where she served as [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]]' flagship. <ref name=Roche85 /> She took part in the [[Armada of 1779]], but an epidemic aboard forced her to return to Brest in September.<ref name=binet262 /> In 1779, her armament was reinforced by adding 10 further [[6-pounder long gun|6-pounders]] to her [[quarterdeck]], turning her into a 110-gun.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> On 2 September 1780, ''Bretagne'' left Brest for Cadiz, where she took part in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]].

Although she had good nautical qualities,''Bretagne'' had a tendency to leak and [[Hogging and sagging|hog]], <ref name=forrer20>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.20</ref> and from February to April 1781, she underwent a refit in Brest and notably received a [[copper sheathing]].<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> ''Bretagne'' then undertook an expedition under Captain Soulange<ref name=forrer20 /> in [[Luc Urbain de Bouëxic, comte de Guichen|Guichen]]'s squadron in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic from 22 June to early September.<ref name=forrer19>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.19</ref> 

After spending three months in Brest, she sailed again on 12 December 1781.<ref name=forrer19 /> She sustained damage in foul weather, <ref name=forrer19 /> notably in a hurricane on 25 and 26 December.<ref name=binet262 /> At her return to Brest, ''Bretagne'' was in need of serious repairs, and Guichen, to his chagrin, had to transfer his flag to [[French ship Terrible (1780)|''Terrible'']].<ref name=forrer19 /> In 1782, her keel had [[Hogging and sagging|hogged]] by 1'7\" ''pied du roi''.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> ''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest from 2 March to July 1782,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19>Demerliac, ''1792—1799'', n°1, p. 19</ref> undergoing extensive repairs of her hull but losing her copper sheating in the process.<ref name=forrer20 /> 

On 8 July 1782,<ref name=forrer20 /> ''Bretagne'' departed Brest under Captain [[Charles Picot de Dampierre]] to join the franco-Spanish combined fleet still [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|besieging Gibraltar]], arriving on 11 along with [[French ship Invincible (1780)|''Invincible'']], [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], [[French ship Protecteur|''Protecteur'']], ''Actif'', ''Zodiaque'', ''Bien Aimé'' and [[French ship Guerrier (1753)|''Guerrier'']].<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.128</ref> Her cutter rescued men from the crew of the Spanish floating battery ''Talla Piedra'' on 13 September. ''Bretagne'', under Dampierre,<ref>Kerguelen-Trémarec, p.323</ref><ref>Troude, vol.2, p.134</ref> blockaded Gibraltar until 10 October, when a gale damaged her rigging, killing a [[helmsman]] and ripping anchors from the ship. <ref name=forrer20 /> On 13 October 1782, the fleet moved to intercept a British squadron, resulting in the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]] on 20 where ''Bretagne'' sustained 5 men wounded.<ref name=binet262 /><ref name=forrer20 /> ''Bretagne'' then returned to Cadiz harbour in preparation for an expedition to America under [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing|Admiral d'Estaing]], but by then the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] had been concluded and ''Bretagne'' returned to Brest.<ref name=forrer20 />

''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest in 1788 until the end of the year.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> The [[poop deck]] was removed to improve stability. <ref name=forrer20 />

=== French Revolutionary Wars ===
''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest from 1792 to June 1793,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> 6 [[Obusier de vaisseau|obusiers de vaisseau]] being added that year.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> ''Bretagne'', under Captain [[Joseph de Richery]], became the flagship of Admiral [[Jean-Amable Lelarge]].<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.287</ref><ref name=forrer21>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.21</ref> In September 1793, her crew was involved in the [[Quibéron mutinies]]; <ref name=Roche85 /> in reaction [[Jeanbon Saint-André]] had Lelarge destitued and Richery arrested,<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.290</ref> and ''Bretagne'' renamed to '''''Révolutionnaire'''''.<ref name=forrer21 /> 

Captain [[Daniel Vandongen]]<ref>Johnson, p. 96</ref> took command of ''Révolutionnaire'' and put her in good order. By 19 June 1794, she was copperd and fully armed.<ref name=forrer21 />  

On 16 May 1794, the fleet departed Brest.<ref name=forrer21 /><ref>Troude, vol.2, p.328</ref>  On 28, the British and French squadrons met, leading to the skirmishes that would culminate into the so-called [[Glorious First of June]].<ref name=Roche85 /> The French line of battle was set in reverse order, and ''Révolutionnaire'' found herself at the rear, last ship in the line.<ref name=forrer21 /> In action against five or six 74-gun ships ([[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|''Bellerophon'']], [[HMS Audacious (1785)|''Audacious'']] and [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|''Leviathan'']])<ref name=Roche85 /> she was badly damaged, losing all her masts. At 0930,  a shot killed Captain Vandongen,<ref name=forrer21 /> leaving ''Révolutionnaire'' without experienced command as the first lieutenant was wounded and the second lieutenant has already been killed.<ref name=johnson87>Johnson, p.87</ref> Third Lieutenant Renaudeau assumed command but was incapacitated almost immediately as well, and Fourth Lieutenant Dorré took over.<ref name=troude334>Troude, vol.2, p.334</ref> ''Révolutionnaire'' was isolated and defenceless, and avoided captured mostly thanks to [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Howe]]'s order to his ships to regroup.<ref name=forrer21 />{{refn|A rumour states that ''Révolutionnaire'' struck her colours at some point, which her officers disputed.<ref name=forrer21 />|group=Note}} In the night, ''Révolutionnaire'' lost her [[mizen]] and her [[mainmast]]. <ref name=troude334 /> The next day, she met [[French ship Audacieux (1784)|''Audacieux'']]<ref name=Roche85 /> and [[HMS Surprise (1796)|''Unité'']], of Nielly's squadron; ''Audacieux'' took ''Révolutionnaire'' in tow and brought her to [[Île-d'Aix]], where she arrived on 8 June<ref name=troude334 /> with 160 crewmembers killed or wounded.<ref name=johnson87 />

''Révolutionnaire'' was fully repaired and rigged anew at Île-d'Aix, which entailed the construction of a workshop specially for that purpose, as well as bringing all parts from [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. She was ready again on 7 August 1794, and rejoined Brest on 27 of the same month.<ref name=forrer21 /> 

On 29 December 1794, under Captain Le Gouardun,<ref name=forrer21 /> ''Révolutionnaire'' departed Brest for the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]], where she was very heavily damaged. <ref name=Roche85 /> She limped back to Brest on 2 February 1795, her hull leaking heavily.<ref name=forrer21 />

Too damaged in the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]] to be repaired,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> she was struck on 28 January 1796<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer21 /> and broken up between January and May 1796. <ref name=Roche85 />

== Legacy ==
A scale model of the ''Bretagne'' is on display at Brest naval museum ([[:commons:Category:Model of Bretagne-MnM 13 MG 4|MnM 13 MG 4]]). Admiral [[François-Edmond Pâris]] states that it was built by of under supervision from [[Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent Forfait|Forfait]] around 1780.<ref name=forrer17 /> The model  depicts ''Bretagne'' in her 1777 state (no coppering yet, but already 16 guns on the castles, 10 on the quarterdeck and 6 on the forecastle).<ref name=forrer17>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.17</ref> The ornaments are not quite realistic: the aft is overly decorated compared to the drawings to master sculptor Lubet, and the [[figurehead]] is a woman carrying the arms of Bretagne, reflecting a project that was never realised in reality. The actual figurehead featured a lion carrying the arms of Bretagne.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maquette de bateau, Bretagne, vaisseau de 100 canons, 1766 |url=http://mnm.webmuseo.com/ws/musee-national-marine/app/collection/record/8956 |website=Les collections du musée |publisher=Musée national de la Marine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=forrer17 />

'''''Bretagne''''' was a large 110-gun three-decker French [[ship of the line]], built at [[Brest, France|Brest]], which became famous as the flagship of the Brest Fleet during the [[American War of Independence]]. She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />

== Context ==
The [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''. On 1 September 1762,<ref name=nomprestigieux>{{cite web |last1=Mioque |first1=Nicolas |title=La Bretagne : origine d’un nom prestigieux dans la Marine française |url=https://troisponts.net/2019/02/01/la-bretagne-origine-dun-nom-prestigieux-dans-la-marine-francaise/ |website=Trois Ponts ! |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=French |date=1 February 2019}}</ref> the [[Estates of Brittany]] gathered at the Couvent des Cordeliers in Rennes<ref name=binet212>Binet, p.212</ref> and decided to raise one million [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] in order to offer a 100-gun [[Three-decker]].<ref name=binet211>Binet, p.211</ref> [[Ship-of-the-line lieutenant|Lieutenant]] Jean-Claude Louis de Quelen rode to [[Choisy-le-Roi]]<ref name=binet215>Binet, p.215</ref> to inform [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], arriving on 5 and returning on 9 with acceptance letters from the King and from the Duke de Choiseul.<ref name=nomprestigieux /> Administrative dispositions for a load started on 2 November, and were completed by 17.<ref name=binet217>Binet, p.217</ref> Budget would eventually reach  1,010,000 [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] for her.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 />

The donation had political connotations, both in terms of rivalry between the various donating institutions, and for the status of Bretagne within France.<ref name=forrer13>Forrer, p. 13</ref> Therefore, the Estates of Brittany attached their gift to a number of requests: that the ship be named ''Bretagne'' rather than ''États de Bretagne'', that the crew be composed of Bretons exlusively, and that the ship be a three-decker.<ref name=binet213>Binet, p.213</ref> Furthermore, rather than donate funds that the Crown would invest in construction, the Estates demanded to supervise construction themselves at the shipyards of the [[French East India Company]] in [[Lorient]].<ref name=nomprestigieux /><ref name=binet211 />

== Construction ==
On 2 November 1761, the Commission of the Estates of Brittany in charge of construction mandated [[Antoine Groignard]] as chief engineer, with Gaubry as deputy and Damel as an advisor.<ref name=binet218>Binet, p.218</ref> Groignard worked both for the French Royal Navy and for the French East India Company; he had recently directed the construction of the 80-gun [[French ship Orient (1756)|''Orient'']], the [[74-gun]] [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], the 64-gun [[French ship Vengeur (1765)|''Vengeur'']] and [[French ship Solitaire (1774)|''Solitaire'']], and was supervising ongoing construction of the 74-gun [[French ship Diligent (1763)|''Diligent'']] and [[French ship Six Corps (1762)|''Six Corps'']], the 56-gun [[French ship Bordelois|''Bordelois'']] in Lorient, that of the 56-gun [[French ship Utile (1764)|''Utile'']],  [[French ship Ferme (1763)|''Ferme'']] and [[French ship Flamand|''Flamand'']] in [[Bordeaux]], and four frigates in Nantes.<ref name=binet219>Binet, p.219</ref> 

On 17 November 1761, Groignard sent of proposal for a budget between 919,000 and 1,115,000 pounds.<ref name=binet220>Binet, p.220</ref> The shipyards in Lorient received their first orders in early December.<ref name=binet221>Binet, p.221</ref> Choiseul wrote the Groignard to congratulate him for his appointment, and to argue in favour of building a 80-gun two-decker, with [[36-pounder long gun|36-pounders]] on the lower battery and [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounders]] on the upper, although he conceded that political considerations mandated a three-decker. He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> 

Groignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> 

[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien Régime]].]]
By 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and manœuverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />

The Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />

In August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>

However, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided cease procuring material directly and to mandate a harbour for the overall budget of the project, either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> 

On 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />

Completion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />

== Career ==
In 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777. She took two more months for fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 />

=== Anglo-French War (1778–1783)===
[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130049.JPG|thumb|Later, naive representation of the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] depicting ''Bretagne'' fighting [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']].]]
[[File:Bretagne engraving Salem.jpeg|thumb|Representation of ''Bretagne'' circa 1782, [[Peabody Essex Museum]], [[Salem, Massachusetts]].]]
She took part in most of the engagements of the European theatre of the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]],<ref name=binet262>Binet, p.262</ref> notably the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] in 1778, where she served as [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]]' flagship. <ref name=Roche85 /> She took part in the [[Armada of 1779]], but an epidemic aboard forced her to return to Brest in September.<ref name=binet262 /> In 1779, her armament was reinforced by adding 10 further [[6-pounder long gun|6-pounders]] to her [[quarterdeck]], turning her into a 110-gun.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> On 2 September 1780, ''Bretagne'' left Brest for Cadiz, where she took part in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]].

Although she had good nautical qualities,''Bretagne'' had a tendency to leak and [[Hogging and sagging|hog]], <ref name=forrer20>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.20</ref> and from February to April 1781, she underwent a refit in Brest and notably received a [[copper sheathing]].<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> ''Bretagne'' then undertook an expedition under Captain Soulange<ref name=forrer20 /> in [[Luc Urbain de Bouëxic, comte de Guichen|Guichen]]'s squadron in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic from 22 June to early September.<ref name=forrer19>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.19</ref> 

After spending three months in Brest, she sailed again on 12 December 1781.<ref name=forrer19 /> She sustained damage in foul weather, <ref name=forrer19 /> notably in a hurricane on 25 and 26 December.<ref name=binet262 /> At her return to Brest, ''Bretagne'' was in need of serious repairs, and Guichen, to his chagrin, had to transfer his flag to [[French ship Terrible (1780)|''Terrible'']].<ref name=forrer19 /> In 1782, her keel had [[Hogging and sagging|hogged]] by 1'7\" ''pied du roi''.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> ''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest from 2 March to July 1782,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19>Demerliac, ''1792—1799'', n°1, p. 19</ref> undergoing extensive repairs of her hull but losing her copper sheating in the process.<ref name=forrer20 /> 

On 8 July 1782,<ref name=forrer20 /> ''Bretagne'' departed Brest under Captain [[Charles Picot de Dampierre]] to join the franco-Spanish combined fleet still [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|besieging Gibraltar]], arriving on 11 along with [[French ship Invincible (1780)|''Invincible'']], [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], [[French ship Protecteur|''Protecteur'']], ''Actif'', ''Zodiaque'', ''Bien Aimé'' and [[French ship Guerrier (1753)|''Guerrier'']].<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.128</ref> Her cutter rescued men from the crew of the Spanish floating battery ''Talla Piedra'' on 13 September. ''Bretagne'', under Dampierre,<ref>Kerguelen-Trémarec, p.323</ref><ref>Troude, vol.2, p.134</ref> blockaded Gibraltar until 10 October, when a gale damaged her rigging, killing a [[helmsman]] and ripping anchors from the ship. <ref name=forrer20 /> On 13 October 1782, the fleet moved to intercept a British squadron, resulting in the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]] on 20 where ''Bretagne'' sustained 5 men wounded.<ref name=binet262 /><ref name=forrer20 /> ''Bretagne'' then returned to Cadiz harbour in preparation for an expedition to America under [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing|Admiral d'Estaing]], but by then the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] had been concluded and ''Bretagne'' returned to Brest.<ref name=forrer20 />

''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest in 1788 until the end of the year.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> The [[poop deck]] was removed to improve stability. <ref name=forrer20 />

=== French Revolutionary Wars ===
''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest from 1792 to June 1793,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> 6 [[Obusier de vaisseau|obusiers de vaisseau]] being added that year.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> ''Bretagne'', under Captain [[Joseph de Richery]], became the flagship of Admiral [[Jean-Amable Lelarge]].<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.287</ref><ref name=forrer21>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.21</ref> In September 1793, her crew was involved in the [[Quibéron mutinies]]; <ref name=Roche85 /> in reaction [[Jeanbon Saint-André]] had Lelarge destitued and Richery arrested,<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.290</ref> and ''Bretagne'' renamed to '''''Révolutionnaire'''''.<ref name=forrer21 /> 

Captain [[Daniel Vandongen]]<ref>Johnson, p. 96</ref> took command of ''Révolutionnaire'' and put her in good order. By 19 June 1794, she was copperd and fully armed.<ref name=forrer21 />  

On 16 May 1794, the fleet departed Brest.<ref name=forrer21 /><ref>Troude, vol.2, p.328</ref>  On 28, the British and French squadrons met, leading to the skirmishes that would culminate into the so-called [[Glorious First of June]].<ref name=Roche85 /> The French line of battle was set in reverse order, and ''Révolutionnaire'' found herself at the rear, last ship in the line.<ref name=forrer21 /> In action against five or six 74-gun ships ([[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|''Bellerophon'']], [[HMS Audacious (1785)|''Audacious'']] and [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|''Leviathan'']])<ref name=Roche85 /> she was badly damaged, losing all her masts. At 0930,  a shot killed Captain Vandongen,<ref name=forrer21 /> leaving ''Révolutionnaire'' without experienced command as the first lieutenant was wounded and the second lieutenant has already been killed.<ref name=johnson87>Johnson, p.87</ref> Third Lieutenant Renaudeau assumed command but was incapacitated almost immediately as well, and Fourth Lieutenant Dorré took over.<ref name=troude334>Troude, vol.2, p.334</ref> ''Révolutionnaire'' was isolated and defenceless, and avoided captured mostly thanks to [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Howe]]'s order to his ships to regroup.<ref name=forrer21 />{{refn|A rumour states that ''Révolutionnaire'' struck her colours at some point, which her officers disputed.<ref name=forrer21 />|group=Note}} In the night, ''Révolutionnaire'' lost her [[mizen]] and her [[mainmast]]. <ref name=troude334 /> The next day, she met [[French ship Audacieux (1784)|''Audacieux'']]<ref name=Roche85 /> and [[HMS Surprise (1796)|''Unité'']], of Nielly's squadron; ''Audacieux'' took ''Révolutionnaire'' in tow and brought her to [[Île-d'Aix]], where she arrived on 8 June<ref name=troude334 /> with 160 crewmembers killed or wounded.<ref name=johnson87 />

''Révolutionnaire'' was fully repaired and rigged anew at Île-d'Aix, which entailed the construction of a workshop specially for that purpose, as well as bringing all parts from [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. She was ready again on 7 August 1794, and rejoined Brest on 27 of the same month.<ref name=forrer21 /> 

On 29 December 1794, under Captain Le Gouardun,<ref name=forrer21 /> ''Révolutionnaire''departed Brest for the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]], where she was very heavily damaged. <ref name=Roche85 /> She limped back to Brest on 2 February 1795, her hull leaking heavily.<ref name=forrer21 />

Too damaged in the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]] to be repaired,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> she was struck on 28 January 1796<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer21 /> and broken up between January and May 1796. <ref name=Roche85 />

== Legacy ==
A scale model of the ''Bretagne'' is on display at Brest naval museum ([[:commons:Category:Model of Bretagne-MnM 13 MG 4|MnM 13 MG 4]]). Admiral [[François-Edmond Pâris]] states that it was built by of under supervision from [[Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent Forfait|Forfait]] around 1780.<ref name=forrer17 /> The model  depicts ''Bretagne'' in her 1777 state (no coppering yet, but already 16 guns on the castles, 10 on the quarterdeck and 6 on the forecastle).<ref name=forrer17>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.17</ref> The ornaments are not quite realistic: the aft is overly decorated compared to the drawings to master sculptor Lubet, and the [[figurehead]] is a woman carrying the arms of Bretagne, reflecting a project that was never realised in reality. The actual figurehead featured a lion carrying the arms of Bretagne.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maquette de bateau, Bretagne, vaisseau de 100 canons, 1766 |url=http://mnm.webmuseo.com/ws/musee-national-marine/app/collection/record/8956 |website=Les collections du musée |publisher=Musée national de la Marine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=forrer17 />

'''''Bretagne''''' was a large 110-gun three-decker French [[ship of the line]], built at [[Brest, France|Brest]], which became famous as the flagship of the Brest Fleet during the [[American War of Independence]]. She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]].

The [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''. On 1 September 1762,<ref name=nomprestigieux>{{cite web |last1=Mioque |first1=Nicolas |title=La Bretagne : origine d’un nom prestigieux dans la Marine française |url=https://troisponts.net/2019/02/01/la-bretagne-origine-dun-nom-prestigieux-dans-la-marine-francaise/ |website=Trois Ponts ! |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=French |date=1 February 2019}}</ref> the [[Estates of Brittany]] gathered at the Couvent des Cordeliers in Rennes<ref name=binet212>Binet, p.212</ref> and decided to raise one million [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] in order to offer a 100-gun [[Three-decker]].<ref name=binet211>Binet, p.211</ref> [[Ship-of-the-line lieutenant|Lieutenant]] Jean-Claude Louis de Quelen rode to [[Choisy-le-Roi]]<ref name=binet215>Binet, p.215</ref> to inform [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], arriving on 5 and returning on 9 with acceptance letters from the King and from the Duke de Choiseul.<ref name=nomprestigieux /> Administrative dispositions for a load started on 2 November, and were completed by 17.<ref name=binet217>Binet, p.217</ref> Budget would eventually reach  1,010,000 [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] for her.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 />

The donation had political connotations, both in terms of rivalry between the various donating institutions, and for the status of Bretagne within France.<ref name=forrer13>Forrer, p. 13</ref> Therefore, the Estates of Brittany attached their gift to a number of requests: that the ship be named ''Bretagne'' rather than ''États de Bretagne'', that the crew be composed of Bretons exlusively, and that the ship be a three-decker.<ref name=binet213>Binet, p.213</ref> Furthermore, rather than donate funds that the Crown would invest in construction, the Estates demanded to supervise construction themselves at the shipyards of the [[French East India Company]] in [[Lorient]].<ref name=nomprestigieux /><ref name=binet211 />

== Construction ==
On 2 November 1761, the Commission of the Estates of Brittany in charge of construction mandated [[Antoine Groignard]] as chief engineer, with Gaubry as deputy and Damel as an advisor.<ref name=binet218>Binet, p.218</ref> Groignard worked both for the French Royal Navy and for the French East India Company; he had recently directed the construction of the 80-gun [[French ship Orient (1756)|''Orient'']], the [[74-gun]] [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], the 64-gun [[French ship Vengeur (1765)|''Vengeur'']] and [[French ship Solitaire (1774)|''Solitaire'']], and was supervising ongoing construction of the 74-gun [[French ship Diligent (1763)|''Diligent'']] and [[French ship Six Corps (1762)|''Six Corps'']], the 56-gun [[French ship Bordelois|''Bordelois'']] in Lorient, that of the 56-gun [[French ship Utile (1764)|''Utile'']],  [[French ship Ferme (1763)|''Ferme'']] and [[French ship Flamand|''Flamand'']] in [[Bordeaux]], and four frigates in Nantes.<ref name=binet219>Binet, p.219</ref> 

On 17 November 1761, Groignard sent of proposal for a budget between 919,000 and 1,115,000 pounds.<ref name=binet220>Binet, p.220</ref> The shipyards in Lorient received their first orders in early December.<ref name=binet221>Binet, p.221</ref> Choiseul wrote the Groignard to congratulate him for his appointment, and to argue in favour of building a 80-gun two-decker, with [[36-pounder long gun|36-pounders]] on the lower battery and [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounders]] on the upper, although he conceded that political considerations mandated a three-decker. He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> 

Groignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> 

[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien Régime]].]]
By 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and manœuverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />

The Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />

In August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>

However, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided cease procuring material directly and to mandate a harbour for the overall budget of the project, either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> 

On 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />

Completion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />

== Career ==
In 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777. She took two more months for fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 />

=== Anglo-French War (1778–1783)===
[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130049.JPG|thumb|Later, naive representation of the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] depicting ''Bretagne'' fighting [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']].]]
[[File:Bretagne engraving Salem.jpeg|thumb|Representation of ''Bretagne'' circa 1782, [[Peabody Essex Museum]], [[Salem, Massachusetts]].]]
She took part in most of the engagements of the European theatre of the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]],<ref name=binet262>Binet, p.262</ref> notably the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] in 1778, where she served as [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]]' flagship. <ref name=Roche85 /> She took part in the [[Armada of 1779]], but an epidemic aboard forced her to return to Brest in September.<ref name=binet262 /> In 1779, her armament was reinforced by adding 10 further [[6-pounder long gun|6-pounders]] to her [[quarterdeck]], turning her into a 110-gun.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> On 2 September 1780, ''Bretagne'' left Brest for Cadiz, where she took part in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]].

Although she had good nautical qualities,''Bretagne'' had a tendency to leak and [[Hogging and sagging|hog]], <ref name=forrer20>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.20</ref> and from February to April 1781, she underwent a refit in Brest and notably received a [[copper sheathing]].<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> ''Bretagne'' then undertook an expedition under Captain Soulange<ref name=forrer20 /> in [[Luc Urbain de Bouëxic, comte de Guichen|Guichen]]'s squadron in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic from 22 June to early September.<ref name=forrer19>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.19</ref> 

After spending three months in Brest, she sailed again on 12 December 1781.<ref name=forrer19 /> She sustained damage in foul weather, <ref name=forrer19 /> notably in a hurricane on 25 and 26 December.<ref name=binet262 /> At her return to Brest, ''Bretagne'' was in need of serious repairs, and Guichen, to his chagrin, had to transfer his flag to [[French ship Terrible (1780)|''Terrible'']].<ref name=forrer19 /> In 1782, her keel had [[Hogging and sagging|hogged]] by 1'7\" ''pied du roi''.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> ''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest from 2 March to July 1782,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19>Demerliac, ''1792—1799'', n°1, p. 19</ref> undergoing extensive repairs of her hull but losing her copper sheating in the process.<ref name=forrer20 /> 

On 8 July 1782,<ref name=forrer20 /> ''Bretagne'' departed Brest under Captain [[Charles Picot de Dampierre]] to join the franco-Spanish combined fleet still [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|besieging Gibraltar]], arriving on 11 along with [[French ship Invincible (1780)|''Invincible'']], [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], [[French ship Protecteur|''Protecteur'']], ''Actif'', ''Zodiaque'', ''Bien Aimé'' and [[French ship Guerrier (1753)|''Guerrier'']].<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.128</ref> Her cutter rescued men from the crew of the Spanish floating battery ''Talla Piedra'' on 13 September. ''Bretagne'', under Dampierre,<ref>Kerguelen-Trémarec, p.323</ref><ref>Troude, vol.2, p.134</ref> blockaded Gibraltar until 10 October, when a gale damaged her rigging, killing a [[helmsman]] and ripping anchors from the ship. <ref name=forrer20 /> On 13 October 1782, the fleet moved to intercept a British squadron, resulting in the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]] on 20 where ''Bretagne'' sustained 5 men wounded.<ref name=binet262 /><ref name=forrer20 /> ''Bretagne'' then returned to Cadiz harbour in preparation for an expedition to America under [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing|Admiral d'Estaing]], but by then the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] had been concluded and ''Bretagne'' returned to Brest.<ref name=forrer20 />

''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest in 1788 until the end of the year.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> The [[poop deck]] was removed to improve stability. <ref name=forrer20 />

=== French Revolutionary Wars ===
''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest from 1792 to June 1793,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> 6 [[Obusier de vaisseau|obusiers de vaisseau]] being added that year.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> ''Bretagne'', under Captain [[Joseph de Richery]], became the flagship of Admiral [[Jean-Amable Lelarge]].<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.287</ref><ref name=forrer21>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.21</ref> In September 1793, her crew was involved in the [[Quibéron mutinies]]; <ref name=Roche85 /> in reaction [[Jeanbon Saint-André]] had Lelarge destitued and Richery arrested,<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.290</ref> and ''Bretagne'' renamed to '''''Révolutionnaire'''''.<ref name=forrer21 /> 

Captain [[Daniel Vandongen]]<ref>Johnson, p. 96</ref> took command of ''Révolutionnaire'' and put her in good order. By 19 June 1794, she was copperd and fully armed.<ref name=forrer21 />  

On 16 Mai 1794, the fleet departed Brest.<ref name=forrer21 /><ref>Troude, vol.2, p.328</ref>  On 28, the British and French squadrons met, leading to the skirmishes that would culminate into the so-called [[Glorious First of June]].<ref name=Roche85 /> The French line of battle was set in reverse order, and ''Révolutionnaire'' found herself at the rear, last ship in the line.<ref name=forrer21 /> In action against five or six 74-gun ships ([[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|''Bellerophon'']], [[HMS Audacious (1785)|''Audacious'']] and [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|''Leviathan'']])<ref name=Roche85 /> she was badly damaged, losing all her masts. At 0930,  a shot killed Captain Vandongen,<ref name=forrer21 /> leaving ''Révolutionnaire'' without experienced command as the first lieutenant was wounded and the second lieutenant has already been killed.<ref name=johnson87>Johnson, p.87</ref> Third Lieutenant Renaudeau assumed command but was incapacitated almost immediately as well, and Fourth Lieutenant Dorré took over.<ref name=troude334>Troude, vol.2, p.334</ref> ''Révolutionnaire'' was isolated and defenceless, and avoided captured mostly thanks to [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Howe]]'s order to his ships to regroup.<ref name=forrer21 />{{refn|A rumour states that ''Révolutionnaire'' struck her colours at some point, which her officers disputed.<ref name=forrer21 />|group=Note}} In the night, ''Révolutionnaire'' lost her [[mizen]] and her [[mainmast]]. <ref name=troude334 /> The next day, she met [[French ship Audacieux (1784)|''Audacieux'']]<ref name=Roche85 /> and [[HMS Surprise (1796)|''Unité'']], of Nielly's squadron; ''Audacieux'' took ''Révolutionnaire'' in tow and brought her to [[Île-d'Aix]], where she arrived on 8 June<ref name=troude334 /> with 160 crewmembers killed or wounded.<ref name=johnson87 />

''Révolutionnaire'' was fully repaired and rigged anew at Île-d'Aix, which entailed the construction of a workshop specially for that purpose, as well as bringing all parts from [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. She was ready again on 7 August 1794, and rejoined Brest on 27 of the same month.<ref name=forrer21 /> 

On 29 December 1794, under Captain Le Gouardun,<ref name=forrer21 /> ''Révolutionnaire''departed Brest for the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]], where she was very heavily damaged. <ref name=Roche85 /> She limped back to Brest on 2 February 1795, her hull leaking heavily.<ref name=forrer21 />

Too damaged in the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]] to be repaired,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> she was struck on 28 January 1796<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer21 /> and broken up between January and May 1796. <ref name=Roche85 />

== Legacy ==
A scale model of the ''Bretagne'' is on display at Brest naval museum ([[:commons:Category:Model of Bretagne-MnM 13 MG 4|MnM 13 MG 4]]). Admiral [[François-Edmond Pâris]] states that it was built by of under supervision from [[Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent Forfait|Forfait]] around 1780.<ref name=forrer17 /> The model  depicts ''Bretagne'' in her 1777 state (no coppering yet, but already 16 guns on the castles, 10 on the quarterdeck and 6 on the forecastle).<ref name=forrer17>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.17</ref> The ornaments are not quite realistic: the aft is overly decorated compared to the drawings to master sculptor Lubet, and the [[figurehead]] is a woman carrying the arms of Bretagne, reflecting a project that was never realised in reality. The actual figurehead featured a lion carrying the arms of Bretagne.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maquette de bateau, Bretagne, vaisseau de 100 canons, 1766 |url=http://mnm.webmuseo.com/ws/musee-national-marine/app/collection/record/8956 |website=Les collections du musée |publisher=Musée national de la Marine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=forrer17 />

'''''Bretagne''''' was a large 110-gun three-decker French [[ship of the line]], built at [[Brest, France|Brest]], which became famous as the flagship of the Brest Fleet during the [[American War of Independence]]. She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />

== Context ==
The [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''. On 1 September 1762,<ref name=nomprestigieux>{{cite web |last1=Mioque |first1=Nicolas |title=La Bretagne : origine d’un nom prestigieux dans la Marine française |url=https://troisponts.net/2019/02/01/la-bretagne-origine-dun-nom-prestigieux-dans-la-marine-francaise/ |website=Trois Ponts ! |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=French |date=1 February 2019}}</ref> the [[Estates of Brittany]] gathered at the Couvent des Cordeliers in Rennes<ref name=binet212>Binet, p.212</ref> and decided to raise one million [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] in order to offer a 100-gun [[Three-decker]].<ref name=binet211>Binet, p.211</ref> [[Ship-of-the-line lieutenant|Lieutenant]] Jean-Claude Louis de Quelen rode to [[Choisy-le-Roi]]<ref name=binet215>Binet, p.215</ref> to inform [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], arriving on 5 and returning on 9 with acceptance letters from the King and from the Duke de Choiseul.<ref name=nomprestigieux /> Administrative dispositions for a load started on 2 November, and were completed by 17.<ref name=binet217>Binet, p.217</ref> Budget would eventually reach  1,010,000 [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]] for her.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 />

The donation had political connotations, both in terms of rivalry between the various donating institutions, and for the status of Bretagne within France.<ref name=forrer13>Forrer, p. 13</ref> Therefore, the Estates of Brittany attached their gift to a number of requests: that the ship be named ''Bretagne'' rather than ''États de Bretagne'', that the crew be composed of Bretons exlusively, and that the ship be a three-decker.<ref name=binet213>Binet, p.213</ref> Furthermore, rather than donate funds that the Crown would invest in construction, the Estates demanded to supervise construction themselves at the shipyards of the [[French East India Company]] in [[Lorient]].<ref name=nomprestigieux /><ref name=binet211 />

== Construction ==
On 2 November 1761, the Commission of the Estates of Brittany in charge of construction mandated [[Antoine Groignard]] as chief engineer, with Gaubry as deputy and Damel as an advisor.<ref name=binet218>Binet, p.218</ref> Groignard worked both for the French Royal Navy and for the French East India Company; he had recently directed the construction of the 80-gun [[French ship Orient (1756)|''Orient'']], the [[74-gun]] [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], the 64-gun [[French ship Vengeur (1765)|''Vengeur'']] and [[French ship Solitaire (1774)|''Solitaire'']], and was supervising ongoing construction of the 74-gun [[French ship Diligent (1763)|''Diligent'']] and [[French ship Six Corps (1762)|''Six Corps'']], the 56-gun [[French ship Bordelois|''Bordelois'']] in Lorient, that of the 56-gun [[French ship Utile (1764)|''Utile'']],  [[French ship Ferme (1763)|''Ferme'']] and [[French ship Flamand|''Flamand'']] in [[Bordeaux]], and four frigates in Nantes.<ref name=binet219>Binet, p.219</ref> 

On 17 November 1761, Groignard sent of proposal for a budget between 919,000 and 1,115,000 pounds.<ref name=binet220>Binet, p.220</ref> The shipyards in Lorient received their first orders in early December.<ref name=binet221>Binet, p.221</ref> Choiseul wrote the Groignard to congratulate him for his appointment, and to argue in favour of building a 80-gun two-decker, with [[36-pounder long gun|36-pounders]] on the lower battery and [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounders]] on the upper, although he conceded that political considerations mandated a three-decker. He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> 

Groignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> 

[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien Régime]].]]
By 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and manœuverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />

The Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />

In August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>

However, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided cease procuring material directly and to mandate a harbour for the overall budget of the project, either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> 

On 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />

Completion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />

== Career ==
In 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777. She took two more months for fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 />

=== Anglo-French War (1778–1783)===

[[File:Bretagne engraving Salem.jpeg|thumb|Representation of ''Bretagne'' circa 1782, [[Peabody Essex Museum]], [[Salem, Massachusetts]].]]
She took part in most of the engagements of the European theatre of the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]],<ref name=binet262>Binet, p.262</ref> notably the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] in 1778, where she served as [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]]' flagship. <ref name=Roche85 /> She took part in the [[Armada of 1779]], but an epidemic aboard forced her to return to Brest in September.<ref name=binet262 /> In 1779, her armament was reinforced by adding 10 further [[6-pounder long gun|6-pounders]] to her [[quarterdeck]], turning her into a 110-gun.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> On 2 September 1780, ''Bretagne'' left Brest for Cadiz, where she took part in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]].

Although she had good nautical qualities,''Bretagne'' had a tendency to leak and [[Hogging and sagging|hog]], <ref name=forrer20>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.20</ref> and from February to April 1781, she underwent a refit in Brest and notably received a [[copper sheathing]].<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> ''Bretagne'' then undertook an expedition under Captain Soulange<ref name=forrer20 /> in [[Luc Urbain de Bouëxic, comte de Guichen|Guichen]]'s squadron in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic from 22 June to early September.<ref name=forrer19>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.19</ref> 

After spending three months in Brest, she sailed again on 12 December 1781.<ref name=forrer19 /> She sustained damage in foul weather, <ref name=forrer19 /> notably in a hurricane on 25 and 26 December.<ref name=binet262 /> At her return to Brest, ''Bretagne'' was in need of serious repairs, and Guichen, to his chagrin, had to transfer his flag to [[French ship Terrible (1780)|''Terrible'']].<ref name=forrer19 /> In 1782, her keel had [[Hogging and sagging|hogged]] by 1'7\" ''pied du roi''.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> ''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest from 2 March to July 1782,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19>Demerliac, ''1792—1799'', n°1, p. 19</ref> undergoing extensive repairs of her hull but losing her copper sheating in the process.<ref name=forrer20 /> 

On 8 July 1782,<ref name=forrer20 /> ''Bretagne'' departed Brest under Captain [[Charles Picot de Dampierre]] to join the franco-Spanish combined fleet still [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|besieging Gibraltar]], arriving on 11 along with [[French ship Invincible (1780)|''Invincible'']], [[French ship Robuste (1758)|''Robuste'']], [[French ship Protecteur|''Protecteur'']], ''Actif'', ''Zodiaque'', ''Bien Aimé'' and [[French ship Guerrier (1753)|''Guerrier'']].<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.128</ref> Her cutter rescued men from the crew of the Spanish floating battery ''Talla Piedra'' on 13 September. ''Bretagne'', under Dampierre,<ref>Kerguelen-Trémarec, p.323</ref><ref>Troude, vol.2, p.134</ref> blockaded Gibraltar until 10 October, when a gale damaged her rigging, killing a [[helmsman]] and ripping anchors from the ship. <ref name=forrer20 /> On 13 October 1782, the fleet moved to intercept a British squadron, resulting in the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]] on 20 where ''Bretagne'' sustained 5 men wounded.<ref name=binet262 /><ref name=forrer20 /> ''Bretagne'' then returned to Cadiz harbour in preparation for an expedition to America under [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing|Admiral d'Estaing]], but by then the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] had been concluded and ''Bretagne'' returned to Brest.<ref name=forrer20 />

''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest in 1788 until the end of the year.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> The [[poop deck]] was removed to improve stability. <ref name=forrer20 />

=== French Revolutionary Wars ===
''Bretagne'' was refitted in Brest from 1792 to June 1793,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> 6 [[Obusier de vaisseau|obusiers de vaisseau]] being added that year.<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> ''Bretagne'', under Captain [[Joseph de Richery]], became the flagship of Admiral [[Jean-Amable Lelarge]].<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.287</ref><ref name=forrer21>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.21</ref> In September 1793, her crew was involved in the [[Quibéron mutinies]]; <ref name=Roche85 /> in reaction [[Jeanbon Saint-André]] had Lelarge destitued and Richery arrested,<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.290</ref> and ''Bretagne'' renamed to '''''Révolutionnaire'''''.<ref name=forrer21 /> 

Captain [[Daniel Vandongen]]<ref>Johnson, p. 96</ref> took command of ''Révolutionnaire'' and put her in good order. By 19 June 1794, she was copperd and fully armed.<ref name=forrer21 />  

On 16 Mai 1794, the fleet departed Brest.<ref name=forrer21 /><ref>Troude, vol.2, p.328</ref>  On 28, the British and French squadrons met, leading to the skirmishes that would culminate into the so-called [[Glorious First of June]].<ref name=Roche85 /> The French line of battle was set in reverse order, and ''Révolutionnaire'' found herself at the rear, last ship in the line.<ref name=forrer21 /> In action against five or six 74-gun ships ([[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|''Bellerophon'']], [[HMS Audacious (1785)|''Audacious'']] and [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|''Leviathan'']])<ref name=Roche85 /> she was badly damaged, losing all her masts. At 0930,  a shot killed Captain Vandongen,<ref name=forrer21 /> leaving ''Révolutionnaire'' without experienced command as the first lieutenant was wounded and the second lieutenant has already been killed.<ref name=johnson87>Johnson, p.87</ref> Third Lieutenant Renaudeau assumed command but was incapacitated almost immediately as well, and Fourth Lieutenant Dorré took over.<ref name=troude334>Troude, vol.2, p.334</ref> ''Révolutionnaire'' was isolated and defenceless, and avoided captured mostly thanks to [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Howe]]'s order to his ships to regroup.<ref name=forrer21 />{{refn|A rumour states that ''Révolutionnaire'' struck her colours at some point, which her officers disputed.<ref name=forrer21 />|group=Note}} In the night, ''Révolutionnaire'' lost her [[mizeen]] and her [[mainmast]]. <ref name=troude334 /> The next day, she met [[French ship Audacieux (1784)|''Audacieux'']]<ref name=Roche85 /> and [[HMS Surprise (1796)|''Unité'']], of Nielly's squadron; ''Audacieux'' took ''Révolutionnaire'' in tow and brought her to [[Île-d'Aix]], where she arrived on 8 June<ref name=troude334 /> with 160 crewmembers killed or wounded.<ref name=johnson87 />

''Révolutionnaire'' was fully repaired and rigged anew at Île-d'Aix, which entailed the construction of a workshop specially for that purpose, as well as bringing all parts from [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. She was ready again on 7 August 1794, and rejoined Brest on 27 of the same month.<ref name=forrer21 /> 

On 29 December 1794, under Captain Le Gouardun,<ref name=forrer21 /> ''Révolutionnaire''departed Brest for the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]], where she was very heavily damaged. <ref name=Roche85 /> She limped back to Brest on 2 February 1795, her hull leaking heavily.<ref name=forrer21 />

Too damaged in the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]] to be repaired,<ref name=demerliac_1792_19 /> she was struck on 28 January 1796<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer21 /> and broken up between January and May 1796. <ref name=Roche85 />

== Legacy ==
A scale model of the ''Bretagne'' is on display at Brest naval museum ([[:commons:Category:Model of Bretagne-MnM 13 MG 4|MnM 13 MG 4]]). Admiral [[François-Edmond Pâris]] states that it was built by of under supervision from [[Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent Forfait|Forfait]] around 1780.<ref name=forrer17 /> The model  depicts ''Bretagne'' in her 1777 state (no coppering yet, but already 16 guns on the castles, 10 on the quarterdeck and 6 on the forecastle).<ref name=forrer17>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.17</ref> The ornaments are not quite realistic: the aft is overly decorated compared to the drawings to master sculptor Lubet, and the [[figurehead]] is a woman carrying the arms of Bretagne, reflecting a project that was never realised in reality. The actual figurehead featured a lion carrying the arms of Bretagne.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maquette de bateau, Bretagne, vaisseau de 100 canons, 1766 |url=http://mnm.webmuseo.com/ws/musee-national-marine/app/collection/record/8956 |website=Les collections du musée |publisher=Musée national de la Marine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=forrer17 />

'''Durham''' is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Strafford County, New Hampshire|Strafford County]], [[New Hampshire]], United States. The population was 14,638 at the 2010 census.<ref name=2010Census>United States Census Bureau, [https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website] , 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011.</ref> Durham is home to the [[University of New Hampshire]].

The primary settlement in the town, where 10,345 people resided at the 2010 census,<ref name=\"2010Census\"/> is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the [[Durham (CDP), New Hampshire|Durham census-designated place]] (CDP) and includes the densely populated portion of the town centered on the intersection of [[New Hampshire Route 108]] and Main Street, which includes the university that dominates the town.

== History ==
[[File:General View of UNH 1913.jpg|thumb|left|General View of UNH in 1913]]
Situated beside [[Great Bay (New Hampshire)|Great Bay]] at the mouth of the [[Oyster River (New Hampshire)|Oyster River]], Durham was originally called \"Oyster River Plantation\". It was settled in 1635 by pioneers who traveled up the [[Piscataqua River]] and across Little Bay to settle at the falls of the Oyster River.

At the time, the land that is now New Hampshire belonged to Massachusetts; not until 1692 did the [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire colony]] finally gain full and permanent independence from its southern neighbor. Most of the coastal area was divided among four townships, and for its first century, Durham was part of [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]]. The location was ideal for its fresh water, natural meadows for livestock, and the transportation opportunities afforded by the waterways leading to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The land along the river was quickly settled, and nearby dense forests provided the timber necessary to construct homes as well as boats. Oyster River Plantation took the form of a small agricultural village, and the first generation of residents worked to clear and shape the land for planting.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DHM| title=Durham, NH| publisher=The Great American Stations| accessdate=Sep 5, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129190504/http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DHM| archivedate=2014-11-29}}</ref>

The town name \"Durham\" was suggested by the Rev. Hugh Adams, as claimed by him in an address to the General Assembly in 1738.<ref>''N.H. Province Papers'', Vol. V, page 35</ref><ref>Mary P. Thompson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QarkVaNCBvEC&pg=PA282&lpg=PA282&dq=Mary+P.+Thompson%27s+Landmarks+in+Ancient+Dover,+p.+67.&source=bl&ots=rXTLCrmIF1&sig=hfGsgNxRcAnY_TGtBdJBaaH1IzA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLtPrQx97JAhVFzIMKHcSdAPcQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=Rev%2C%20HUgh%20Adams&f=falseMary&#x20;P.&#x20;Thompson's&#x20;Landmarks&#x20;in&#x20;Ancient&#x20;Dover,&#x20;p.&#x20;67 ''Landmarks in Ancient Dover''], p. 67</ref> Two of the earliest settlers of Dover were William and Edward Hilton, the direct descendants of Sir William de Hilton, Lord of [[Hylton Castle|Hilton Castle]] in [[County Durham]], England, but there is nothing to prove that Durham was named in their honor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

During [[King William's War]], on July 18, 1694, the English settlement was attacked in the [[Raid on Oyster River]] by French career soldier [[Claude-Sébastien de Villieu]] with about 250 [[Abenaki]] from [[Norridgewock]] under command of their [[sachem|sagamore]] Bomazeen (or Bomoseen). In all, 104 inhabitants were killed and 27 taken captive,<ref>Webster, John Clarence. ''Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century''. [[Saint John, NB]], New Brunswick Museum, 1979. p. 65</ref> with half the dwellings, including the [[garrison]]s, pillaged and burned to the ground.

The community rebuilt, however, and by 1716 Durham was a separate [[parish]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Incorporated in 1732, Durham at first included portions of the present-day towns of [[Madbury, New Hampshire|Madbury]], [[Lee, New Hampshire|Lee]] and [[Newmarket, New Hampshire|Newmarket]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Because of its [[arable land]], the town would develop as a [[farming]] community.

[[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]], a descendant of an early settler, bequeathed his assets and family estate, Warner Farm, to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jd5DAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA21&dq=Warner%20Farm%2C%20New%20Hampshire%20agricultural%20college&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q=Warner%20Farm,%20New%20Hampshire%20agricultural%20college&f=false|title=The land in our hands: Burley-Demeritt Farm in Lee, NH : its history.|last=Butterfield|first=Martha Lamson|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=9781329902954|location=|pages=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/will-benjamin-thompson|title=Will of Benjamin Thompson - University of New Hampshire Library|website=www.library.unh.edu|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020065032/http://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/will-benjamin-thompson|archivedate=20 October 2017}}</ref> Founded in 1866 in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] moved to Durham in 1893 and became the University of New Hampshire in 1923.

Designed in the [[Romanesque Revival]] style by the [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Dow & Randlett]], it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/961213.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings -- December 13, 1996|access-date=November 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526213349/https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/961213.htm|archivedate=May 26, 2017}}</ref>

===Libraries===
Over the years the people of Durham have created several libraries:

Durham Social Library (1815-1857): This library was incorporated by act of the New Hampshire Legislature in 1815. The library contained several hundred books and had a membership numbering nearly 50.

Durham Agricultural Library (1862-1881): Formed Feb. 3, 1862, with [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] as president, this library was small (approximately 72 books) and vocationally-based.

Durham Social Library (1881-1892): Organized March 9, 1881, the library had a membership of 80 and several hundred books. In 1883 the Richardson house was purchased to house the library. It eventually merged with the Durham Public Library.

Durham Public Library (1892-1906): Established in 1892 through the provisions of a New Hampshire state act, this was the town's first \"public\" library. It contained more than 3,500 books and eventually merged with the library of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.
 
Library of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts (1893- ): Came to Durham with the arrival of the College in 1893. Initially, the College housed the library in a single room in Thompson Hall. In 1900 Hamilton Smith gave the University $10,000 to construct a library, another $20,000 was obtained from Andrew Carnegie. In 1907 – a year after the town and the college agreed to merge their collective library resources – the building (Hamilton Smith Hall) was completed.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/durham-nh| title=Durham Town Records, New Hampshire| publisher=University of New Hampshire Library| accessdate=February 3, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202115912/http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/durham-nh| archivedate=February 2, 2014}}</ref>

In March 1997 by a margin of 2-1, Durham voters passed a charter amendment to establish a Board of Trustees and allow plans for a new library to go forward. In July 1997 a temporary space was found for the new Public Library in a storefront between the dollar store and a pizzeria. Under the guidance of the Trustees and a newly formed Friends of the Library group, many volunteer townspeople come forward to sheetrock, paint, assemble shelves, and unpack and shelve 719 boxes of books. On July 21, 1997 a dedication ceremony was held for the new library, with Governor Jeanne Shaheen as the keynote speaker. It was the first new public library to be established in New Hampshire in almost a century. In July 2013 a new public library building was completed on Madbury Road.

===Police department===
A police force of some manner has served Durham since at least 1848.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.durham.nh.us/departments/police/history.html |title=Police Dept.

=== Fire department and EMS ===
The first fire department organization in Durham was organized in 1927 and the first salaried firefighter was employed in 1934.<ref name=\"FireDept\"/>

The Durham Fire Department is one of the few fire departments in the country that is funded by both a municipality and a university.<ref name=\"FireDept\">{{cite web |url=http://ci.durham.nh.us/DEPARTMENTS/fire_dept/History.html |title=Durham Fire Department History |work=Town of Durham, NH |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215132324/http://www.ci.durham.nh.us/DEPARTMENTS/fire_dept/history.html |archivedate=December 15, 2010 }}</ref>

'''Durham''' is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Strafford County, New Hampshire|Strafford County]], [[New Hampshire]], United States. The population was 14,638 at the 2010 census.<ref name=2010Census>United States Census Bureau, [https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website] , 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011.</ref> Durham is home to the [[University of New Hampshire]].

The primary settlement in the town, where 10,345 people resided at the 2010 census,<ref name=\"2010Census\"/> is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the [[Durham (CDP), New Hampshire|Durham census-designated place]] (CDP) and includes the densely populated portion of the town centered on the intersection of [[New Hampshire Route 108]] and Main Street, which includes the university that dominates the town.

== History ==
[[File:General View of UNH 1913.jpg|thumb|left|General View of UNH in 1913]]
Situated beside [[Great Bay (New Hampshire)|Great Bay]] at the mouth of the [[Oyster River (New Hampshire)|Oyster River]], Durham was originally called \"Oyster River Plantation\". It was settled in 1635 by pioneers who traveled up the [[Piscataqua River]] and across Little Bay to settle at the falls of the Oyster River.

At the time, the land that is now New Hampshire belonged to Massachusetts; not until 1692 did the [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire colony]] finally gain full and permanent independence from its southern neighbor. Most of the coastal area was divided among four townships, and for its first century, Durham was part of [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]]. The village location was ideal for its fresh water, natural meadows for livestock, and the transportation opportunities afforded by the waterways leading to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The land along the river was quickly settled, and nearby dense forests provided the timber necessary to construct homes as well as boats. Oyster River Plantation took the form of a small agricultural village, and the first generation of residents worked to clear and shape the land for planting.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DHM| title=Durham, NH| publisher=The Great American Stations| accessdate=Sep 5, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129190504/http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DHM| archivedate=2014-11-29}}</ref>

The town name \"Durham\" was suggested by the Rev. Hugh Adams, as claimed by him in an address to the General Assembly in 1738.<ref>''N.H. Province Papers'', Vol. V, page 35</ref><ref>Mary P. Thompson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QarkVaNCBvEC&pg=PA282&lpg=PA282&dq=Mary+P.+Thompson%27s+Landmarks+in+Ancient+Dover,+p.+67.&source=bl&ots=rXTLCrmIF1&sig=hfGsgNxRcAnY_TGtBdJBaaH1IzA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLtPrQx97JAhVFzIMKHcSdAPcQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=Rev%2C%20HUgh%20Adams&f=falseMary&#x20;P.&#x20;Thompson's&#x20;Landmarks&#x20;in&#x20;Ancient&#x20;Dover,&#x20;p.&#x20;67 ''Landmarks in Ancient Dover''], p. 67</ref> Two of the earliest settlers of Dover were William and Edward Hilton, the direct descendants of Sir William de Hilton, Lord of [[Hylton Castle|Hilton Castle]] in [[County Durham]], England, but there is nothing to prove that Durham was named in their honor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

During [[King William's War]], on July 18, 1694, the English settlement was attacked in the [[Raid on Oyster River]] by French career soldier [[Claude-Sébastien de Villieu]] with about 250 [[Abenaki]] from [[Norridgewock]] under command of their [[sachem|sagamore]] Bomazeen (or Bomoseen). In all, 104 inhabitants were killed and 27 taken captive,<ref>Webster, John Clarence. ''Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century''. [[Saint John, NB]], New Brunswick Museum, 1979. p. 65</ref> with half the dwellings, including the [[garrison]]s, pillaged and burned to the ground.

The community rebuilt, however, and by 1716 Durham was a separate [[parish]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Incorporated in 1732, Durham at first included portions of the present-day towns of [[Madbury, New Hampshire|Madbury]], [[Lee, New Hampshire|Lee]] and [[Newmarket, New Hampshire|Newmarket]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Because of its [[arable land]], the town would develop as a [[farming]] community.

[[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]], a descendant of an early settler, bequeathed his assets and family estate, Warner Farm, to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jd5DAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA21&dq=Warner%20Farm%2C%20New%20Hampshire%20agricultural%20college&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q=Warner%20Farm,%20New%20Hampshire%20agricultural%20college&f=false|title=The land in our hands: Burley-Demeritt Farm in Lee, NH : its history.|last=Butterfield|first=Martha Lamson|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=9781329902954|location=|pages=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/will-benjamin-thompson|title=Will of Benjamin Thompson - University of New Hampshire Library|website=www.library.unh.edu|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020065032/http://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/will-benjamin-thompson|archivedate=20 October 2017}}</ref> Founded in 1866 in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] moved to Durham in 1893 and became the University of New Hampshire in 1923.

Designed in the [[Romanesque Revival]] style by the [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Dow & Randlett]], it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/961213.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings -- December 13, 1996|access-date=November 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526213349/https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/961213.htm|archivedate=May 26, 2017}}</ref>

===Libraries===
Over the years the people of Durham have created several libraries:

Durham Social Library (1815-1857): This library was incorporated by act of the New Hampshire Legislature in 1815. The library contained several hundred books and had a membership numbering nearly 50.

Durham Agricultural Library (1862-1881): Formed Feb. 3, 1862, with [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] as president, this library was small (approximately 72 books) and vocationally-based.

Durham Social Library (1881-1892): Organized March 9, 1881, the library had a membership of 80 and several hundred books. In 1883 the Richardson house was purchased to house the library. It eventually merged with the Durham Public Library.

Durham Public Library (1892-1906): Established in 1892 through the provisions of a New Hampshire state act, this was the town's first \"public\" library. It contained more than 3,500 books and eventually merged with the library of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.
 
Library of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts (1893- ): Came to Durham with the arrival of the College in 1893. Initially, the College housed the library in a single room in Thompson Hall. In 1900 Hamilton Smith gave the University $10,000 to construct a library, another $20,000 was obtained from Andrew Carnegie. In 1907 – a year after the town and the college agreed to merge their collective library resources – the building (Hamilton Smith Hall) was completed.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/durham-nh| title=Durham Town Records, New Hampshire| publisher=University of New Hampshire Library| accessdate=February 3, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202115912/http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/durham-nh| archivedate=February 2, 2014}}</ref>

In March 1997 by a margin of 2-1, Durham voters passed a charter amendment to establish a Board of Trustees and allow plans for a new library to go forward. In July 1997 a temporary space was found for the new Public Library in a storefront between the dollar store and a pizzeria. Under the guidance of the Trustees and a newly formed Friends of the Library group, many volunteer townspeople come forward to sheetrock, paint, assemble shelves, and unpack and shelve 719 boxes of books. On July 21, 1997 a dedication ceremony was held for the new library, with Governor Jeanne Shaheen as the keynote speaker. It was the first new public library to be established in New Hampshire in almost a century. In July 2013 a new public library building was completed on Madbury Road.

===Police department===
A police force of some manner has served Durham since at least 1848.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.durham.nh.us/departments/police/history.html |title=Police Dept.

The Police Department's Adopt-A-Cop program was instituted in 1999 to improve relationships between University of New Hampshire fraternities. Each fraternity is assigned a police officer who attends house meetings and events and acts a liaison between the fraternity and the community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ci.durham.nh.us/DEPARTMENTS/POLICE/programs.html |title=Durham PD Programs |work=Town of Durham, NH |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813150415/http://ci.durham.nh.us/DEPARTMENTS/POLICE/programs.html |archivedate=August 13, 2011 }}</ref>

=== Fire department and EMS ===
The first fire department organization in Durham was organized in 1927 and the first salaried firefighter was employed in 1934.<ref name=\"FireDept\"/>

The Durham Fire Department is one of the few fire departments in the country that is funded by both a municipality and a university.<ref name=\"FireDept\">{{cite web |url=http://ci.durham.nh.us/DEPARTMENTS/fire_dept/History.html |title=Durham Fire Department History |work=Town of Durham, NH |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215132324/http://www.ci.durham.nh.us/DEPARTMENTS/fire_dept/history.html |archivedate=December 15, 2010 }}</ref>

{{Distinguish|Bohemistics|Bohemism}}
[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - En été (La Bohémienne).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''[[The Bohemian (Renoir painting)|The Bohemian]]'' (or ''Lise the Bohemian''), 1868, oil on canvas, Berlin, Germany: [[Alte Nationalgalerie]]]]

'''Bohemianism''' is the practice of an [[unconventional]] lifestyle, often in the company of like-minded people and with few permanent ties. It involves musical, artistic, literary, or spiritual pursuits. In this context, Bohemians may or may not be [[Nomadism|wanderers]], [[adventurer]]s, or [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]].

This use of the word bohemian first appeared in the English language in the 19th century to describe the non-traditional lifestyles of [[marginalized]] and impoverished artists, writers, journalists, musicians, and actors in major European cities.<ref>First occurrence in this sense in English, 1848 (''[[OED]]'').</ref>

Bohemians were associated with unorthodox or [[anti-establishment]] political or social viewpoints, which often were expressed through [[free love]], [[frugality]], and—in some cases—[[simple living]] or [[voluntary poverty]]. A more economically privileged, wealthy, or even aristocratic bohemian circle is sometimes referred to as ''haute bohème''<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.seadict.com/en/en/haute%20boh%C3%A8me|title = SeaDict Online Dictionary|accessdate = 16 November 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150406013058/http://www.seadict.com/en/en/haute%20boh%C3%A8me|archive-date = 6 April 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> (literally \"high Bohemia\").<ref>{{cite news|title = Montgomery County looks to get hip|date = 17 February 2013|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/montgomery-county-looks-to-get-hip/2013/02/16/2d477284-7577-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html|last = Turque|first = Bill|newspaper = Washington Post|accessdate = 16 November 2013}}

The term bohemianism emerged in France in the early 19th century, when artists and creators began to concentrate in the lower-rent, lower class, [[Romani people|Romani]] neighborhoods. ''Bohémien'' was a common term for the [[Romani people in France|Romani people of France]], who were mistakenly thought to have reached France in the 15th century via [[Bohemia]] (the western part of modern [[Czech Republic]]).<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Bohemian|title=''Bohemian'' etymology |accessdate=2008-12-27|last=Harper |first=Douglas |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}</ref>

==Origins==

===European bohemianism===
Literary and artistic bohemians were associated in the French imagination with the roving [[Romani people|Romani]] people. Not only were Romani called ''bohémiens'' in French because they were believed to have come to France from Bohemia,<ref name=\"etymonline\" /><ref>[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Bohemian Bohemian] in ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fifth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> but literary bohemians and the Romani were both outsiders, apart from conventional society and untroubled by its disapproval. Use of the French and English terms  to refer to the Romani is now old-fashioned and archaic, respectively, and both the French and English terms carry a connotation of [[Western esotericism|arcane]] enlightenment (and are considered antonyms of the word [[Philistinism|philistine]]) and the less frequently intended, pejorative connotation of carelessness about personal hygiene and marital fidelity.

The title character in ''[[Carmen]]'' (1876), a French opera set in the Spanish city of [[Seville]], is referred to as a \"bohémienne\" in Meilhac and Halévy's libretto. Her [[Habanera (aria)|signature aria]] declares love itself to be a \"gypsy child\" ''(enfant de Bohême)'', going where it pleases and obeying no laws.

{{quote|The term bohemian has come to be very commonly accepted in our day as the description of a certain kind of literary gypsy, no matter in what language he speaks, or what city he inhabits .... A Bohemian is simply an artist or \"[[littérateur]]\" who, consciously or unconsciously, secedes from conventionality in life and in art.|''Westminster Review'', 1862<ref name=\"etymonline\" />)}}

[[Henri Murger]]'s collection of short stories ''[[Scenes of Bohemian Life|Scènes de la vie de bohème]]'' (''Scenes of Bohemian Life''), published in 1845, was written to glorify and legitimize the bohemian lifestyle.<ref>
{{cite web

|title=Scenes de la Vie de Boheme
|publisher=www.mtholyoke.edu
|accessdate=2008-04-22
}}</ref> Murger's collection formed the basis of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s [[opera]] ''[[La bohème]]'' (1896).

In England, bohemian in this sense initially was popularised in [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s novel, ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', published in 1848. Public perceptions of the alternative lifestyles supposedly led by artists were further molded by [[George du Maurier]]'s romanticized best-selling novel of Bohemian culture ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' (1894). The novel outlines the fortunes of three [[expatriate]] English artists, their Irish model, and two colourful [[Central Europe]]an musicians, in the artist quarter of Paris.

In Spanish literature, the Bohemian impulse can be seen in [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán]]'s play ''[[Luces de Bohemia]]'', published in 1920.

In his song [[La Bohème (Charles Aznavour song)|La Bohème]], [[Charles Aznavour]] described the Bohemian lifestyle in [[Montmartre]]. The film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001) also reflects the Bohemian lifestyle of actors and artists in Montmartre at the turn of the 20th century.

===American bohemianism===

In the 1850s, aesthetic bohemians began arriving in the United States.<ref>Roy Kotynek, John Cohassey (2008). \"American Cultural Rebels: Avant-Garde and Bohemian Artists, Writers and Musicians from the 1850s through the 1960s\".

Similar groups in other cities were broken up as well by the Civil War and reporters spread out to report on the conflict. During the war, correspondents began to assume the title bohemian, and newspapermen in general took up the moniker. Bohemian became synonymous with newspaper writer.<ref name=\"Twain\" /> In 1866, war correspondent [[Junius Henri Browne]], who wrote for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' and ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', described bohemian journalists such as he was, as well as the few carefree women and lighthearted men he encountered during the war years.<ref>Brown, Junius Henri. [https://archive.org/details/fouryearsinsece00unkngoog ''Four Years in Secessia''], O.D. Case and Co., 1866</ref>

San Francisco journalist [[Bret Harte]] first wrote as \"The Bohemian\" in ''[[The Golden Era]]'' in 1861, with this persona taking part in many satirical doings, the lot published in his book ''Bohemian Papers'' in 1867. Harte wrote, \"Bohemia has never been located geographically, but any clear day when the sun is going down, if you mount [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], you shall see its pleasant valleys and cloud-capped hills glittering in the West{{nbsp}}...\"<ref name=TheatreWest>Ogden, Dunbar H.; Douglas McDermott; Robert Károly Sarlós [https://books.google.com/books?id=96lCI145-38C&pg=PA20 ''Theatre West: Image and Impact''], Rodopi, 1990, pp. 17–42. {{ISBN|90-5183-125-0}}</ref>

[[Mark Twain]] included himself and [[Charles Warren Stoddard]] in the bohemian category in 1867.<ref name=Twain/> By 1872, when a group of journalists and artists who gathered regularly for cultural pursuits in San Francisco were casting about for a name, the term bohemian became the main choice, and the [[Bohemian Club]] was born.<ref>[[Bohemian Club]].

{{quote|Any good mixer of convivial habits considers he has a right to be called a bohemian. But that is not a valid claim. There are two elements, at least, that are essential to Bohemianism. The first is devotion or addiction to one or more of the [[Liberal arts|Seven Arts]]; the other is poverty. Other factors suggest themselves: for instance, I like to think of my Bohemians as young, as radical in their outlook on art and life; as unconventional, and, though this is debatable, as dwellers in a city large enough to have the somewhat cruel atmosphere of all great cities.|Parry, 2005<ref name=Parry238>Parry, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ov2dz3Pnea4C&pg=PA238 p. 238.]</ref>).}}

Despite his views, Sterling associated with the Bohemian Club, and caroused with artist and industrialist alike at the [[Bohemian Grove]].<ref name=Parry238/>

Canadian composer [[Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann]] and poet [[George Frederick Cameron]] wrote the song \"The Bohemian\" in the 1889 opera ''[[Leo, the Royal Cadet]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_06551 |title=Leo, the Royal cadet [microform&#93; : Cameron, George Frederick, 1854–1885 : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>

The impish American writer and Bohemian Club member [[Gelett Burgess]], who coined the word ''blurb'', supplied this description of the amorphous place called Bohemia:

[[File:Gelett Burgess - Map of Bohemia 1896.jpg|thumb|[[Gelett Burgess]] drew this fanciful \"Map of Bohemia\" for ''The Lark'', March 1, 1896 (see also {{slink|The Winter's Tale|The seacoast of Bohemia}})]]

{{quote|To take the world as one finds it, the bad with the good, making the best of the present moment—to laugh at Fortune alike whether she be generous or unkind—to spend freely when one has money, and to hope gaily when one has none—to fleet the time carelessly, living for love and art—this is the temper and spirit of the modern Bohemian in his outward and visible aspect. It is a light and graceful philosophy, but it is the Gospel of the Moment, this exoteric phase of the Bohemian religion; and if, in some noble natures, it rises to a bold simplicity and naturalness, it may also lend its butterfly precepts to some very pretty vices and lovable faults, for in Bohemia one may find almost every sin save that of Hypocrisy. ...

His faults are more commonly those of self-indulgence, thoughtlessness, vanity and procrastination, and these usually go hand-in-hand with generosity, love and charity; for it is not enough to be one’s self in Bohemia, one must allow others to be themselves, as well. ...

What, then, is it that makes this mystical empire of Bohemia unique, and what is the charm of its mental fairyland? It is this: there are no roads in all Bohemia!

The term has become associated with various artistic or academic communities and is used as a generalized adjective describing such people, environs, or situations: bohemian (''boho''—informal) is defined in ''The American College Dictionary'' as \"a person with artistic or intellectual tendencies, who lives and acts with no regard for conventional rules of behavior\".

Many prominent European and American figures of the 19th and 20th centuries belonged to the bohemian [[subculture]], and any comprehensive \"list of bohemians\" would be tediously long. Bohemianism has been approved of by some [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] writers such as [[Honoré de Balzac]],{{citation needed|reason=Where does he state this?|date=April 2016}} but most conservative cultural critics do not condone bohemian lifestyles.{{citation needed|reason=Which conservative cultural critics?|date=April 2016}}

In ''[[Bohemian Manifesto]]: a Field Guide to Living on the Edge'', author Laren Stover breaks down the bohemian into five distinct mind-sets or styles, as follows:

*Nouveau: bohemians that are rich who attempt to join traditional bohemianism with contemporary culture
*Gypsy: the expatriate types, they create their own Gypsy ideal of nirvana wherever they go
*[[Beatnik|Beat]]: also drifters, but non-materialist and art-focused
*Zen: \"post-beat\", focus on spirituality rather than art
*[[Dandy]]: no money, but try to appear as if they have it by buying and displaying expensive or rare items – such as brands of alcohol<ref>{{cite book|author=Stover, Laren|title=Bohemian Manifesto: a Field Guide to Living on the Edge|publisher=Bulfinch Press|isbn=0-8212-2890-0|year=2004}}</ref>

'''Bohemianism''' is the practice of an [[unconventional]] lifestyle, often in the company of like-minded people and with few permanent ties. It involves musical, artistic, literary, or spiritual pursuits. In this context, Bohemians may or may not be [[Nomadism|wanderers]], [[adventurer]]s, or [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]].

This use of the word bohemian first appeared in the English language in the 19th century to describe the non-traditional lifestyles of [[marginalized]] and impoverished artists, writers, journalists, musicians, and actors in major European cities.<ref>First occurrence in this sense in English, 1848 (''[[OED]]'').</ref>

Bohemians were associated with unorthodox or [[anti-establishment]] political or social viewpoints, which often were expressed through [[free love]], [[frugality]], and—in some cases—[[simple living]] or [[voluntary poverty]]. A more economically privileged, wealthy, or even aristocratic bohemian circle is sometimes referred to as ''haute bohème''<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.seadict.com/en/en/haute%20boh%C3%A8me|title = SeaDict Online Dictionary|accessdate = 16 November 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150406013058/http://www.seadict.com/en/en/haute%20boh%C3%A8me|archive-date = 6 April 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> (literally \"high Bohemia\").<ref>{{cite news|title = Montgomery County looks to get hip|date = 17 February 2013|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/montgomery-county-looks-to-get-hip/2013/02/16/2d477284-7577-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html|last = Turque|first = Bill|newspaper = Washington Post|accessdate = 16 November 2013}}

The term bohemianism emerged in France in the early 19th century, when artists and creators began to concentrate in the lower-rent, lower class, [[Romani people|Romani]] neighborhoods. ''Bohémien'' was a common term for the [[Romani people in France|Romani people of France]], who were mistakenly thought to have reached France in the 15th century via [[Bohemia]] (the western part of modern [[Czech Republic]]).<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Bohemian|title=''Bohemian'' etymology |accessdate=2008-12-27|last=Harper |first=Douglas |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}</ref>

==Origins==

===European bohemianism===
Literary and artistic bohemians were associated in the French imagination with the roving [[Romani people|Romani]] people. Not only were Romani called ''bohémiens'' in French because they were believed to have come to France from Bohemia,<ref name=\"etymonline\" /><ref>[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Bohemian Bohemian] in ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fifth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> but literary bohemians and the Romani were both outsiders, apart from conventional society and untroubled by its disapproval. Use of the French and English terms  to refer to the Romani is now old-fashioned and archaic, respectively, and both the French and English terms carry a connotation of [[Western esotericism|arcane]] enlightenment (and are considered antonyms of the word [[Philistinism|philistine]]) and the less frequently intended, pejorative connotation of carelessness about personal hygiene and marital fidelity.

The title character in ''[[Carmen]]'' (1876), a French opera set in the Spanish city of [[Seville]], is referred to as a \"bohémienne\" in Meilhac and Halévy's libretto. Her [[Habanera (aria)|signature aria]] declares love itself to be a \"gypsy child\" ''(enfant de Bohême)'', going where it pleases and obeying no laws.

{{quote|The term bohemian has come to be very commonly accepted in our day as the description of a certain kind of literary gypsy, no matter in what language he speaks, or what city he inhabits .... A Bohemian is simply an artist or \"[[littérateur]]\" who, consciously or unconsciously, secedes from conventionality in life and in art.|''Westminster Review'', 1862<ref name=\"etymonline\" />)}}

[[Henri Murger]]'s collection of short stories ''[[Scenes of Bohemian Life|Scènes de la vie de bohème]]'' (''Scenes of Bohemian Life''), published in 1845, was written to glorify and legitimize the bohemian lifestyle.<ref>
{{cite web

|title=Scenes de la Vie de Boheme
|publisher=www.mtholyoke.edu
|accessdate=2008-04-22
}}</ref> Murger's collection formed the basis of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s [[opera]] ''[[La bohème]]'' (1896).

In England, bohemian in this sense initially was popularised in [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s novel, ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', published in 1848. Public perceptions of the alternative lifestyles supposedly led by artists were further molded by [[George du Maurier]]'s romanticized best-selling novel of Bohemian culture ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' (1894). The novel outlines the fortunes of three [[expatriate]] English artists, their Irish model, and two colourful [[Central Europe]]an musicians, in the artist quarter of Paris.

In Spanish literature, the Bohemian impulse can be seen in [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán]]'s play ''[[Luces de Bohemia]]'', published in 1920.

In his song [[La Bohème (Charles Aznavour song)|La Bohème]], [[Charles Aznavour]] described the Bohemian lifestyle in [[Montmartre]]. The film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001) also reflects the Bohemian lifestyle of actors and artists in Montmartre at the turn of the 20th century.

Similar groups in other cities were broken up as well by the Civil War and reporters spread out to report on the conflict. During the war, correspondents began to assume the title bohemian, and newspapermen in general took up the moniker. Bohemian became synonymous with newspaper writer.<ref name=\"Twain\" /> In 1866, war correspondent [[Junius Henri Browne]], who wrote for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' and ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', described bohemian journalists such as he was, as well as the few carefree women and lighthearted men he encountered during the war years.<ref>Brown, Junius Henri.

San Francisco journalist [[Bret Harte]] first wrote as \"The Bohemian\" in ''[[The Golden Era]]'' in 1861, with this persona taking part in many satirical doings, the lot published in his book ''Bohemian Papers'' in 1867. Harte wrote, \"Bohemia has never been located geographically, but any clear day when the sun is going down, if you mount [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], you shall see its pleasant valleys and cloud-capped hills glittering in the West{{nbsp}}...\"<ref name=TheatreWest>Ogden, Dunbar H.; Douglas McDermott; Robert Károly Sarlós [https://books.google.com/books?id=96lCI145-38C&pg=PA20 ''Theatre West: Image and Impact''], Rodopi, 1990, pp. 17–42. {{ISBN|90-5183-125-0}}</ref>

{{quote|Any good mixer of convivial habits considers he has a right to be called a bohemian. But that is not a valid claim. There are two elements, at least, that are essential to Bohemianism. The first is devotion or addiction to one or more of the [[Liberal arts|Seven Arts]]; the other is poverty.

It is a light and graceful philosophy, but it is the Gospel of the Moment, this exoteric phase of the Bohemian religion; and if, in some noble natures, it rises to a bold simplicity and naturalness, it may also lend its butterfly precepts to some very pretty vices and lovable faults, for in Bohemia one may find almost every sin save that of Hypocrisy. ...

The term has become associated with various artistic or academic communities and is used as a generalized adjective describing such people, environs, or situations: bohemian (''boho''—informal) is defined in ''The American College Dictionary'' as \"a person with artistic or intellectual tendencies, who lives and acts with no regard for conventional rules of behavior\".

Many prominent European and American figures of the 19th and 20th centuries belonged to the bohemian [[subculture]], and any comprehensive \"list of bohemians\" would be tediously long. Bohemianism has been approved of by some [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] writers such as [[Honoré de Balzac]],{{citation needed|reason=Where does he state this?|date=April 2016}} but most conservative cultural critics do not condone bohemian lifestyles.{{citation needed|reason=Which conservative cultural critics?|date=April 2016}}

In ''[[Bohemian Manifesto]]: a Field Guide to Living on the Edge'', author Laren Stover breaks down the bohemian into five distinct mind-sets or styles, as follows:

*Nouveau: bohemians that are rich who attempt to join traditional bohemianism with contemporary culture
*Gypsy: the expatriate types, they create their own Gypsy ideal of nirvana wherever they go
*[[Beatnik|Beat]]: also drifters, but non-materialist and art-focused
*Zen: \"post-beat\", focus on spirituality rather than art
*[[Dandy]]: no money, but try to appear as if they have it by buying and displaying expensive or rare items – such as brands of alcohol<ref>{{cite book|author=Stover, Laren|title=Bohemian Manifesto: a Field Guide to Living on the Edge|publisher=Bulfinch Press|isbn=0-8212-2890-0|year=2004}}</ref>

==Music career==
===2001–2005: S Club Juniors and S Club 8===
[[S Club 8|S Club Juniors]] were formed in 2001 as part of a reality series, known as ''[[S Club Search]]''.<ref name=\"Who are S Club 7?\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/uk/newsid_1944000/1944376.stm | title = Who are S Club 7? | publisher = CBBC Newsround | date = 22 April 2002 | accessdate = 9 June 2009}}</ref> Subsequently, 19 Entertainment, the management company that had created S Club 7 and auditioned S Club Juniors, decided they should perform as a support act at all of the venues on the tour.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_1678000/1678932.stm | title=S Club Juniors reach for the stars | accessdate=5 September 2007 | date=27 November 2001 | work=CBBC Newsround | publisher=BBC}}</ref> By the end of the tour, S Club Juniors had amassed a following and, with the encouragement of 19, [[Polydor Records]] signed the group. Their first single was called \"[[One Step Closer (S Club Juniors song)|One Step Closer]]\". The single was promoted by the television series ''S Club Junior: The Story'' and was released in the UK on 22 April 2002 in a chart battle with the [[Sugababes]] who released their comeback single the same day.<ref name=\"t40\">[http://top40-charts.com/song.php?sid=3861 \"S Club Juniors – One Step Closer: Charts\"]. Music Square. Retrieved 31 October 2008.</ref> A second single was named \"Automatic High\", filmed in Spain, while S Club 7 began their fourth TV series. Released on 22 July 2002, the single reached number two in the UK charts selling 52,000 copies, and spent eight weeks inside the UK top 75 and sold in excess of 110,000 copies in the UK.<ref name=\"t40\"/> Their third single \"[[New Direction]]\" released on 7 October reached number two in the UK charts selling 55,000 copies in the first week. It became their third consecutive top ten hit, selling 130,000 copies in six weeks.<ref name=\"t40\"/> The Juniors released their debut album ''[[Together (S Club Juniors album)|Together]]'' on 21 October reaching number five in its first week of sale and selling 40,000 copies.<ref name=\"t40\"/> Their fourth single, \"[[Puppy Love/Sleigh Ride]]\", was released on 9 December 2002. The single debuted at number six in the UK charts, and sold 85,000 copies in the UK, spending eight weeks inside the UK Top 40.<ref name=\"t40\"/>

The Juniors began work on their second album in January 2003 and the band joined S Club on their S Club United tour in April 2003 where the announcement came of a name change to S Club 8 and an upbeat fifth single, \"[[Fool No More]]\". The single released on 30 June reached number four in the UK chart, selling 26,000 copies in its first week and overall 75,000 copies in the UK.<ref name=\"t40\"/> A second single, \"Sundown\", was released in the UK on 29 September 2003 reaching number four in the UK and became their sixth and final top ten hit, selling 37,000 copies in its first week and 80,000 altogether.<ref name=\"t40\"/> The album, ''[[Sundown (S Club 8 album)|Sundown]]'', was released on 13 October 2003 to dismal reviews. It reached number 13 in the UK charts falling to 40 in the second week.<ref name=\"t40\"/> It sold 60,000 copies in the UK and 315,859 worldwide.<ref name=\"t40\"/> A sixth single, \"Don't Tell Me You're Sorry\", was released in the UK on 29 December 2003 and reached number 11 in the UK, becoming their first single to chart outside the top ten.<ref name=\"t40\"/>

===2005–2007: After S Club 8===
S Club 8 went on to ''[[I Dream]]'' for [[Polydor Records|19 Entertainment]] as they had already agreed to do it. Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.

Between 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.

In late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>

===2007–2014: The Saturdays===
[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]
Since 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI). The album also saw release from top ten singles on the UK Singles Chart—\"[[Issues (The Saturdays song)|Issues]]\" and \"[[Just Can't Get Enough (The Saturdays song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]\". \"[[Work (The Saturdays song)|Work]]\" was the final single to be released from ''Chasing Lights''. ''[[Wordshaker]]'' (2009) was the band's follow-up studio album and also charted within the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and went on to gain a Silver selling status, with singles \"[[Forever Is Over]]\" and \"[[Ego (The Saturdays song)|Ego]]\" charting within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. ''[[Headlines!]]'' (2010) was released as the band's first [[Mini album]] and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the [[Irish Album Chart]]. ''Headlines!'' saw release of top ten singles \"[[Missing You (The Saturdays song)|Missing You]]\" and \"[[Higher (The Saturdays song)|Higher]]\" which features guest vocals from [[Flo Rida]], both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with \"Higher\" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart. The Saturdays third studio album, ''[[On Your Radar]]'' (2011) contained three highly successful selling singles and two of which—\"[[Notorious (The Saturdays song)|Notorious]]\" and \"[[All Fired Up (The Saturdays song)|All Fired Up]]\" charted within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. \"[[My Heart Takes Over]]\" was also released from ''On Your Radar''.

The band released another extended play, ''[[Chasing The Saturdays (EP)|Chasing The Saturdays]]'' which was only released in North America. The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Living for the Weekend (The Saturdays album)|Living for the Weekend]]'' saw the release of the singles; \"[[30 Days (The Saturdays song)|30 Days]]\", \"[[What About Us (The Saturdays song)|What About Us]]\", \"[[Gentleman (The Saturdays song)|Gentleman]]\" and \"[[Disco Love]]\". \"[[30 Days (The Saturdays song)|30 Days]]\" became the group's eleventh top-ten hit, whilst \"[[What About Us (The Saturdays song)|What About Us]]\" featuring [[Sean Paul]] saw The Saturdays earn their first number-one single in 2013, it is taken from their forthcoming fourth studio album, ''[[Living for the Weekend (The Saturdays album)|Living for the Weekend]]''. The album's fourth single, \"Disco Love\", became their thirteenth top 10 single, with ''Living for the Weekend'' becoming their fourth top 10 album.

==Music career==
===2001–2005: S Club Juniors and S Club 8===
[[S Club 8|S Club Juniors]] were formed in 2001 as part of a reality series, known as ''[[S Club Search]]''.<ref name=\"Who are S Club 7?\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/uk/newsid_1944000/1944376.stm | title = Who are S Club 7? | publisher = CBBC Newsround | date = 22 April 2002 | accessdate = 9 June 2009}}</ref> Subsequently, 19 Entertainment, the management company that had created S Club 7 and auditioned S Club Juniors, decided they should perform as a support act at all of the venues on the tour.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_1678000/1678932.stm | title=S Club Juniors reach for the stars | accessdate=5 September 2007 | date=27 November 2001 | work=CBBC Newsround | publisher=BBC}}</ref> By the end of the tour, S Club Juniors had amassed a following and, with the encouragement of 19, [[Polydor Records]] signed the group. Their first single was called \"[[One Step Closer (S Club Juniors song)|One Step Closer]]\". The single was promoted by the television series ''S Club Junior: The Story'' and was released in the UK on 22 April 2002 in a chart battle with the [[Sugababes]] who released their comeback single the same day.<ref name=\"t40\">[http://top40-charts.com/song.php?sid=3861 \"S Club Juniors – One Step Closer: Charts\"]. Music Square. Retrieved 31 October 2008.</ref> A second single was named \"Automatic High\", filmed in Spain, while S Club 7 began their fourth TV series. Released on 22 July 2002, the single reached number two in the UK charts selling 52,000 copies, and spent eight weeks inside the UK top 75 and sold in excess of 110,000 copies in the UK.<ref name=\"t40\"/> Their third single \"[[New Direction]]\" released on 7 October reached number two in the UK charts selling 55,000 copies in the first week. It became their third consecutive top ten hit, selling 130,000 copies in six weeks.<ref name=\"t40\"/> The Juniors released their debut album ''[[Together (S Club Juniors album)|Together]]'' on 21 October reaching number five in its first week of sale and selling 40,000 copies.<ref name=\"t40\"/> Their fourth single, \"[[Puppy Love/Sleigh Ride]]\", was released on 9 December 2002. The single debuted at number six in the UK charts, and sold 85,000 copies in the UK, spending eight weeks inside the UK Top 40.<ref name=\"t40\"/>

The Juniors began work on their second album in January 2003 and the band joined S Club on their S Club United tour in April 2003 where the announcement came of a name change to S Club 8 and an upbeat fifth single, \"[[Fool No More]]\". The single released on 30 June reached number four in the UK chart, selling 26,000 copies in its first week and overall 75,000 copies in the UK.<ref name=\"t40\"/> A second single, \"Sundown\", was released in the UK on 29 September 2003 reaching number four in the UK and became their sixth and final top ten hit, selling 37,000 copies in its first week and 80,000 altogether.<ref name=\"t40\"/> The album, ''[[Sundown (S Club 8 album)|Sundown]]'', was released on 13 October 2003 to dismal reviews. It reached number 13 in the UK charts falling to 40 in the second week.<ref name=\"t40\"/> It sold 60,000 copies in the UK and 315,859 worldwide.<ref name=\"t40\"/> A sixth single, \"Don't Tell Me You're Sorry\", was released in the UK on 29 December 2003 and reached number 11 in the UK, becoming their first single to chart outside the top ten.<ref name=\"t40\"/>

===2005–2007: After S Club 8===
S Club 8 went on to ''[[I Dream]]'' for [[Polydor Records|19 Entertainment]] as they had already agreed to do it. Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.

Between 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.

In late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>

===2007–2014: The Saturdays===
[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]
Since 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI). The album also saw release from top ten singles on the UK Singles Chart—\"[[Issues (The Saturdays song)|Issues]]\" and \"[[Just Can't Get Enough (The Saturdays song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]\". \"[[Work (The Saturdays song)|Work]]\" was the final single to be released from ''Chasing Lights''. ''[[Wordshaker]]'' (2009) was the band's follow-up studio album and also charted within the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and went on to gain a Silver selling status, with singles \"[[Forever Is Over]]\" and \"[[Ego (The Saturdays song)|Ego]]\" charting within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. ''[[Headlines!]]'' (2010) was released as the band's first [[Mini album]] and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the [[Irish Album Chart]]. ''Headlines!'' saw release of top ten singles \"[[Missing You (The Saturdays song)|Missing You]]\" and \"[[Higher (The Saturdays song)|Higher]]\" which features guest vocals from [[Flo Rida]], both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with \"Higher\" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart. The Saturdays third studio album, ''[[On Your Radar]]'' (2011) contained three highly successful selling singles and two of which—\"[[Notorious (The Saturdays song)|Notorious]]\" and \"[[All Fired Up (The Saturdays song)|All Fired Up]]\" charted within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. \"[[My Heart Takes Over]]\" was also released from ''On Your Radar''.

The band released another extended play, ''[[Chasing The Saturdays (EP)|Chasing The Saturdays]]'' which was only released in North America. The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Living for the Weekend (The Saturdays album)|Living for the Weekend]]'' saw the release of the singles; \"[[30 Days (The Saturdays song)|30 Days]]\", \"[[What About Us (The Saturdays song)|What About Us]]\", \"[[Gentleman (The Saturdays song)|Gentleman]]\" and \"[[Disco Love]]\". \"[[30 Days (The Saturdays song)|30 Days]]\" became the group's eleventh top-ten hit, whilst \"[[What About Us (The Saturdays song)|What About Us]]\" featuring [[Sean Paul]] saw The Saturdays earn their first number-one single in 2013, it is taken from their forthcoming fourth studio album, ''[[Living for the Weekend (The Saturdays album)|Living for the Weekend]]''. The album's fourth single, \"Disco Love\", became their thirteenth top 10 single, with ''Living for the Weekend'' becoming their fourth top 10 album.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the United States and had three locations. 

The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit and Trenton plants have been demolished, while the Gibraltar plant has been purchased and restarted by Ferrolux.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer process|Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the [[electric arc furnace|electric furnaces]]. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to take a different approach. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department, newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.
<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the United States and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. 

The Detroit and Trenton plants have been demolished, while the Gibraltar plant has been purchased and restarted by Ferrolux.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department, newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.
<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from an Indiana mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer process|Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the electric furnace capability. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate different ways to supplement its [[electric arc furnace|electric furnaces]]. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from an Indiana mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included Bessemer furnaces to supplement the electric furnace capability. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate different ways to supply its electric furnaces. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnace were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}
The '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.

Copper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.

By the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.

==Geography and geology==
[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]
The Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>

The [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>

Ducktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Most of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s. The metamorphic rocks are part of the Great Smoky formation. About two thirds of this metamorphic rock is [[greywacke]], and it is also made up of [[arkose]], [[Conglomerate rock|conglomerate]], greywacke conglomerate, [[schist]], [[mica schist]], garnet schist, [[slate]], and [[staurolite]].<ref name=usgs1415>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 14-15</ref> The igneous rock consists predominantly of [[gabbro]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 22</ref> The first copper ores were deposited during the [[Ordovician period]], when igneous rocks were advancing into the area.<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 27</ref> During this time, limestone in the area was metamorphosed into marble.<ref name=gms/> Additional ore was formed after the end of the [[Carboniferous period]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 28</ref> The rocks in the Copper Basin are some of the oldest rocks that were deposited during the [[Paleozoic era]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 23</ref> The copper is located in three paralleling [[Vein (geology)|vein]]s within the basin.<ref name=gms/>

==Mining history==
===Early history===
[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]
The Copper Basin was part of [[Cherokee]] lands until 1836, when the Cherokee relinquished control of the basin to the U.S. government through the [[Treaty of New Echota]]. The Copper Basin was known to the Cherokee as Kawa'na.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 17</ref> Copper from the basin was used by the Cherokee on a limited basis.<ref name=waters/> The basin became part of the Ocoee District, which mostly consisted of what is now Polk County. While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 8-11</ref>

Copper was first discovered by a European American in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek, now known as Potato Creek, southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine, by a prospector named Lemmons who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=frye7>Frye 2017, p. 7</ref><ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations. The first shipment of copper out of the basin took place in 1847, which consisted of 90 casks shipped by mule to [[Dalton, Georgia]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away, where the nearest railroad was located at that time.<ref name=\"dailycitizen\">{{Cite news |last=Jenkins |first=Robert |url=https://www.dailycitizen.news/news/local_news/civil-war-anniversary-the-east-tennessee-georgia-railroad/article_00987027-c1e6-510e-8651-300c41c5e604.html |title=Civil War anniversary: The East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad |date=October 9, 2010 |work=[[The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Georgia)|The Daily Citizen]] |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The first purchase of land in the Copper Basin for mining activities occurred in 1849 when a British agent bought 400 acres for a price of $30,000.<ref name=brooks19/> The Hiwassee Mine began operations in May 1850 near the site of the ore discovery at the center of the basin.<ref name=frye7/> In 1851, work began on the Old Copper Road through the Ocoee Gorge, connecting the Copper Basin with [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] to the west, where the copper was loaded onto a railroad, which had been completed that same year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bradley County Historical Society|date=1992|title=Reflections Past and Present: A Pictoral History of Bradley County, Tennessee|publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|page=31}}</ref> The Old Copper Road was completed in 1853, and is now part of U.S. Route 64.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 8</ref> In an effort to reduce transportation costs, the mining companies began smelting the copper onsite in 1856.<ref name=brooks21>Brook 1990, p. 21</ref> By 1857, four additional mines, the Tennessee, Mary's, Isabella, and, Eureka were in operation in the Copper Basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1858, three companies, the Union Consolidated Mining Company, the Burra Burra Copper Company, and the Ducktown Copper Company, were formed to operate different mines in the basin.<ref name=waters/>

A total of nine separate ore deposits were discovered and worked within the basin. In 1860, several small-scale mining operations in the basin were consolidated to form the Burra Burra Copper Company, which was placed under the direction of mining engineer [[Julius Eckhardt Raht|Julius Raht]].<ref name=frye7/> In 1861 a [[rolling mill]] was constructed in Cleveland to process copper ore.<ref name=gms/> At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], the mines were seized by the Confederacy, which halted private operations in the basin, and copper was used to produce weapons for the war effort.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 87-96</ref> By 1863 mining operations had largely ceased in the basin.<ref name=brooks21/> Between November 25 and 27, 1863 during the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], Union cavalrymen, led by Col. [[Eli Long]], raided Cleveland, destroying portions of the railroad and the copper rolling mill.<ref>{{cite book|last=Belcher|first=Dennis W.|date=May 2, 2016|title=The Cavalry of the Army of the Cumberland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQcXDAAAQBAJ|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|pages=179–180|isbn=0786494808}}</ref> The Confederate defeat at Chattanooga resulted in restoration of the mines to Union Control, which proved a major blow to the Confederate war effort, as about 90% of their copper came from the Copper Basin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lillard|first=Roy G.|date=1980|title=Bradley County|url=https://archive.org/details/tennesseecountyh06lill|location=Memphis, Tennessee|publisher=Memphis State University Press|page=63|isbn=0-87870-099-4|author-link=}}</ref>

Mining operations resumed in 1865, shortly after the war ended, and the following year, Raht, who had fled to [[Cincinnati]] during the war, reopened the mines.<ref name=maysilles55/> Refining operations began in the Copper Basin in 1871.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 23</ref> Between 1866 and 1878, the mines produced a total of 24 million pounds of copper ore.<ref name=maysilles55>Maysilles 2011, p. 55</ref> By this time, however, the mines, lacking a cost-effective method of transporting the ore out of the basin, were forced out of business.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 176</ref>

===Expansion of mining operations===
[[File:Copper mining and sulfuric acid plant1a34317v.jpg|thumb|right|Copper mine and sulfuric acid plant in Copperhill, 1939]]
In the summer of 1889, the Marietta & North Georgia Railroad and the Knoxville Southern Railroad built a rail line connecting the Copper Basin to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to the north and [[Marietta, Georgia]] to the south, and mining operations resumed.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 25</ref><ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 39-40</ref> A railroad station was constructed in McCay's, and the name was changed to Copperhill in 1908.<ref name=gms>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamineral.org/writings/copperbasin-cochran.html|title=Minerals and Mining of the Copper Basin|last=Cochran|first=Kim|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref> The [[London]]-based Ducktown Sulphur, Copper and Iron Company (DCS&I) reopened the Mary Mine in 1890, and the following year the open-roast heap smelting process was first used in the basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company (TCC), which had been founded earlier that year and had purchased most of the mining operations in the Copper Basin, constructed a smelter at Copperhill and began work on the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]] at Ducktown. This mine would eventually become the most productive mine in the basin.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 37</ref> The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air, killing off all vegetation in the Copper Basin region. After being sued by local farmers and the state of Georgia over damage caused by the pollution, the Tennessee Copper Company began to recapture the sulfur dioxide in 1907 and convert it into sulfuric acid, which they successfully marketed.<ref name=waters>{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Jack|date=<!--Not given, probably 1990s-->|title=Mining the Copper Basin in Southeast Tennessee|url=http://www.telliquah.com/History2.htm|work=The Tellico Plains Mountain Press|location=Tellico Plains, Tennessee|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref>

Despite the revival of the mining industry, many problems ensued. In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>

The Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> A sulfuric acid plant was constructed in Copperhill in 1942, and by 1949 liquid sulfuric acid was being produced.<ref name=waters/> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Both, unions, however, fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute. As a result, a six-week strike began on July 14, 1939.<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref>

===Later years===
World War II brought a brief increase in demand for products from the Copper Basin, but afterwards, faced with decreasing demand and increasing foreign competition, the mining industry began to decline in the Copper Basin in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/history|title=Remembering the golden age of copper.|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The Burra Burra mine, which had grown into the largest mine, closed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|title=Ducktown Museum and the Burra Burra Mine|last=Breisch|first=Rob|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211230721/http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> In 1960 the Central Mine, the last major mine in the Copper Basin, began operation. The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\"/> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>

The company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>

==Environmental issues and reclamation==
[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]
At first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

The state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company|vol=83|reporter=S.W.|opinion=658|court=Tennessee Supreme Court|date=1904|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/madison-v-ducktown-sulphur-copper-amp-iron-co|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The lawsuits culminated in 1907, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company'' that the state of Georgia could order the Tennessee Copper Company, via injunction, to mitigate the pollution from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company|vol=206|reporter=U.S.|opinion=230|pinpoint=|court=U.S. Supreme Court|date=May 13, 1907|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/206/230/|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The following year, facilities were constructed to condense the fumes into sulfuric acid, which was successfully marketed, and as a result, this injunction was never enforced.<ref name=waters/> Two additional Supreme Court cases related to this injunction, ''[[Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'' and ''[[Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'', both in 1910, followed.

Reforestation and reclamation efforts in the Copper Basin began in the 1930s. In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Recent history==
[[Image:Ducktown-basin-museum-misc-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Mining machine parts and tools scattered about the Burra Burra Mine site]]
The Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin. The museum was moved to the building that formerly housed the headquarters of the Tennessee Copper Company at the Burra Burra Mine in 1982.

{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}
The '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.

Copper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.

By the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.

==Geography and geology==
[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]
The Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>

The [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>

Ducktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Most of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s. The metamorphic rocks are part of the Great Smoky formation. About two thirds of this metamorphic rock is [[greywacke]], and it is also made up of [[arkose]], [[Conglomerate rock|conglomerate]], greywacke conglomerate, [[schist]], [[mica schist]], garnet schist, [[slate]], and [[staurolite]].<ref name=usgs1415>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 14-15</ref> The igneous rock consists predominantly of [[gabbro]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 22</ref> The first copper ores were deposited during the [[Ordovician period]], when igneous rocks were advancing into the area.<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 27</ref> During this time, limestone in the area was metamorphosed into marble.<ref name=gms/> Additional ore was formed after the end of the [[Carboniferous period]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 28</ref> The rocks in the Copper Basin are some of the oldest rocks that were deposited during the [[Paleozoic era]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 23</ref> The copper is located in three paralleling [[Vein (geology)|vein]]s within the basin.<ref name=gms/>

==Mining history==
===Early history===
[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]
The Copper Basin was part of [[Cherokee]] lands until 1836, when the Cherokee relinquished control of the basin to the U.S. government through the [[Treaty of New Echota]]. The Copper Basin was known to the Cherokee as Kawa'na.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 17</ref> Copper from the basin was used by the Cherokee on a limited basis.<ref name=waters/> The basin became part of the Ocoee District, which mostly consisted of what is now Polk County. While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 8-11</ref>

Copper was first discovered by a European American in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek, now known as Potato Creek, southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine, by a prospector named Lemmons who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=frye7>Frye 2017, p. 7</ref><ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations. The first shipment of copper out of the basin took place in 1847, which consisted of 90 casks shipped by mule to [[Dalton, Georgia]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away, where the nearest railroad was located at that time.<ref name=\"dailycitizen\">{{Cite news |last=Jenkins |first=Robert |url=https://www.dailycitizen.news/news/local_news/civil-war-anniversary-the-east-tennessee-georgia-railroad/article_00987027-c1e6-510e-8651-300c41c5e604.html |title=Civil War anniversary: The East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad |date=October 9, 2010 |work=[[The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Georgia)|The Daily Citizen]] |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The first purchase of land in the Copper Basin for mining activities occurred in 1849 when a British agent bought 400 acres for a price of $30,000.<ref name=brooks19/> The Hiwassee Mine began operations in May 1850 near the site of the ore discovery at the center of the basin.<ref name=frye7/> In 1851, work began on the Old Copper Road through the Ocoee Gorge, connecting the Copper Basin with [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] to the west, where the copper was loaded onto a railroad, which had been completed that same year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bradley County Historical Society|date=1992|title=Reflections Past and Present: A Pictoral History of Bradley County, Tennessee|publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|page=31}}</ref> The Old Copper Road was completed in 1853, and is now part of U.S. Route 64.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 8</ref> In an effort to reduce transportation costs, the mining companies began smelting the copper onsite in 1856.<ref name=brooks21>Brook 1990, p. 21</ref> By 1857, four additional mines, the Tennessee, Mary's, Isabella, and, Eureka were in operation in the Copper Basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1858, three companies, the Union Consolidated Mining Company, the Burra Burra Copper Company, and the Ducktown Copper Company, were formed to operate different mines in the basin.<ref name=waters/>

A total of nine separate ore deposits were discovered and worked within the basin. In 1860, several small-scale mining operations in the basin were consolidated to form the Burra Burra Copper Company, which was placed under the direction of mining engineer [[Julius Eckhardt Raht|Julius Raht]].<ref name=frye7/> In 1861 a [[rolling mill]] was constructed in Cleveland to process copper ore.<ref name=gms/> At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], the mines were seized by the Confederacy, which halted private operations in the basin, and copper was used to produce weapons for the war effort.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 87-96</ref> By 1863 mining operations had largely ceased in the basin.<ref name=brooks21/> Between November 25 and 27, 1863 during the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], Union cavalrymen, led by Col.

Mining operations resumed in 1865, shortly after the war ended, and the following year, Raht, who had fled to [[Cincinnati]] during the war, reopened the mines.<ref name=maysilles55/> Refining operations began in the Copper Basin in 1871.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 23</ref> Between 1866 and 1878, the mines produced a total of 24 million pounds of copper ore.<ref name=maysilles55>Maysilles 2011, p. 55</ref> By this time, however, the mines, lacking a cost-effective method of transporting the ore out of the basin, were forced out of business.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 176</ref>

===Expansion of mining operations===
[[File:Copper mining and sulfuric acid plant1a34317v.jpg|thumb|right|Copper mine and sulfuric acid plant in Copperhill, 1939]]
In the summer of 1889, the Marietta & North Georgia Railroad and the Knoxville Southern Railroad built a rail line connecting the Copper Basin to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to the north and [[Marietta, Georgia]] to the south, and mining operations resumed.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 25</ref><ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 39-40</ref> A railroad station was constructed in McCay's, and the name was changed to Copperhill in 1908.<ref name=gms>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamineral.org/writings/copperbasin-cochran.html|title=Minerals and Mining of the Copper Basin|last=Cochran|first=Kim|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref> The [[London]]-based Ducktown Sulphur, Copper and Iron Company (DCS&I) reopened the Mary Mine in 1890, and the following year the open-roast heap smelting process was first used in the basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company (TCC), which had been founded earlier that year and had purchased most of the mining operations in the Copper Basin, constructed a smelter at Copperhill and began work on the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]] at Ducktown. This mine would eventually become the most productive mine in the basin.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 37</ref> The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air, killing off all vegetation in the Copper Basin region. After being sued by local farmers and the state of Georgia over damage caused by the pollution, the Tennessee Copper Company began to recapture the sulfur dioxide in 1907 and convert it into sulfuric acid, which they successfully marketed.<ref name=waters>{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Jack|date=<!--Not given, probably 1990s-->|title=Mining the Copper Basin in Southeast Tennessee|url=http://www.telliquah.com/History2.htm|work=The Tellico Plains Mountain Press|location=Tellico Plains, Tennessee|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref>

Despite the revival of the mining industry, many problems ensued. In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>

The Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> A sulfuric acid plant was constructed in Copperhill in 1942, and by 1949 liquid sulfuric acid was being produced.<ref name=waters/> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Both, unions, however, fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute. As a result, a six-week strike began on July 14, 1939.<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref>

===Later years===
World War II brought a brief increase in demand for products from the Copper Basin, but afterwards, faced with decreasing demand and increasing foreign competition, the mining industry began to decline in the Copper Basin in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/history|title=Remembering the golden age of copper.|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The Burra Burra mine, which had grown into the largest mine, closed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|title=Ducktown Museum and the Burra Burra Mine|last=Breisch|first=Rob|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211230721/http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> In 1960 the Central Mine, the last major mine in the Copper Basin, began operation. The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\"/> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>

The company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>

==Environmental issues and reclamation==
[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]
At first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

The state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company|vol=83|reporter=S.W.|opinion=658|court=Tennessee Supreme Court|date=1904|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/madison-v-ducktown-sulphur-copper-amp-iron-co|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The lawsuits culminated in 1907, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company'' that the state of Georgia could order the Tennessee Copper Company, via injunction, to mitigate the pollution from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company|vol=206|reporter=U.S.|opinion=230|pinpoint=|court=U.S. Supreme Court|date=May 13, 1907|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/206/230/|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The following year, facilities were constructed to condense the fumes into sulfuric acid, which was successfully marketed, and as a result, this injunction was never enforced.<ref name=waters/> Two additional Supreme Court cases related to this injunction, ''[[Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'' and ''[[Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'', both in 1910, followed.

Reforestation and reclamation efforts in the Copper Basin began in the 1930s. In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Recent history==

The Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin. The museum was moved to the building that formerly housed the headquarters of the Tennessee Copper Company at the Burra Burra Mine in 1982. It features exhibits on the history of the mining operations in the basin and the geology of the area, as well as artifacts from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/exhibits|title=Exhibits|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-29|quote=}}</ref>

{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}
The '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.

Copper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.

By the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.

==Geography and geology==
[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]
The Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>

The [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>

Ducktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Most of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s. The metamorphic rocks are part of the Great Smoky formation. About two thirds of this metamorphic rock is [[greywacke]], and it is also made up of [[arkose]], [[Conglomerate rock|conglomerate]], greywacke conglomerate, [[schist]], [[mica schist]], garnet schist, [[slate]], and [[staurolite]].<ref name=usgs1415>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 14-15</ref> The igneous rock consists predominantly of [[gabbro]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 22</ref> The first copper ores were deposited during the [[Ordovician period]], when igneous rocks were advancing into the area.<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 27</ref> During this time, limestone in the area was metamorphosed into marble.<ref name=gms/> Additional ore was formed after the end of the [[Carboniferous period]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 28</ref> The rocks in the Copper Basin are some of the oldest rocks that were deposited during the [[Paleozoic era]].<ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 23</ref> The copper is located in three paralleling [[Vein (geology)|vein]]s within the basin.<ref name=gms/>

==Mining history==
===Early history===
[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]
The Copper Basin was part of [[Cherokee]] lands until 1836, when the Cherokee relinquished control of the basin to the U.S. government through the [[Treaty of New Echota]]. The Copper Basin was known to the Cherokee as Kawa'na.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 17</ref> Copper from the basin was used by the Cherokee on a limited basis.<ref name=waters/> The basin became part of the Ocoee District, which mostly consisted of what is now Polk County. While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 8-11</ref>

Copper was first discovered by a European American in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek, now known as Potato Creek, southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine, by a prospector named Lemmons who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=frye7>Frye 2017, p. 7</ref><ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations. The first shipment of copper out of the basin took place in 1847, which consisted of 90 casks shipped by mule to [[Dalton, Georgia]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away, where the nearest railroad was located at that time.<ref name=\"dailycitizen\">{{Cite news |last=Jenkins |first=Robert |url=https://www.dailycitizen.news/news/local_news/civil-war-anniversary-the-east-tennessee-georgia-railroad/article_00987027-c1e6-510e-8651-300c41c5e604.html |title=Civil War anniversary: The East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad |date=October 9, 2010 |work=[[The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Georgia)|The Daily Citizen]] |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The first purchase of land in the Copper Basin for mining activities occurred in 1849 when a British agent bought 400 acres for a price of $30,000.<ref name=brooks19/> The Hiwassee Mine began operations in May 1850 near the site of the ore discovery at the center of the basin.<ref name=frye7/> In 1851, work began on the Old Copper Road through the Ocoee Gorge, connecting the Copper Basin with [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] to the west, where the copper was loaded onto a railroad, which had been completed that same year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bradley County Historical Society|date=1992|title=Reflections Past and Present: A Pictoral History of Bradley County, Tennessee|publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|page=31}}</ref> The Old Copper Road was completed in 1853, and is now part of U.S. Route 64.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 8</ref> In an effort to reduce transportation costs, the mining companies began smelting the copper onsite in 1856.<ref name=brooks21>Brook 1990, p. 21</ref> By 1857, four additional mines, the Tennessee, Mary's, Isabella, and, Eureka were in operation in the Copper Basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1858, three companies, the Union Consolidated Mining Company, the Burra Burra Copper Company, and the Ducktown Copper Company, were formed to operate different mines in the basin.<ref name=waters/>

A total of nine separate ore deposits were discovered and worked within the basin. In 1860, several small-scale mining operations in the basin were consolidated to form the Burra Burra Copper Company, which was placed under the direction of mining engineer [[Julius Eckhardt Raht|Julius Raht]].<ref name=frye7/> In 1861 a [[rolling mill]] was constructed in Cleveland to process copper ore.<ref name=gms/> At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], the mines were seized by the Confederacy, which halted private operations in the basin, and copper was used to produce weapons for the war effort.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 87-96</ref> By 1863 mining operations had largely ceased in the basin.<ref name=brooks21/> Between November 25 and 27, 1863 during the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], Union cavalrymen, led by Col.

Mining operations resumed in 1865, shortly after the war ended, and the following year, Raht, who had fled to [[Cincinnati]] during the war, reopened the mines.<ref name=maysilles55/> Refining operations began in the Copper Basin in 1871.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 23</ref> Between 1866 and 1878, the mines produced a total of 24 million pounds of copper ore.<ref name=maysilles55>Maysilles 2011, p. 55</ref> By this time, however, the mines, lacking a cost-effective method of transporting the ore out of the basin, were forced out of business.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 176</ref>

===Expansion of mining operations===
[[File:Copper mining and sulfuric acid plant1a34317v.jpg|thumb|right|Copper mine and sulfuric acid plant in Copperhill, 1939]]
In the summer of 1889, the Marietta & North Georgia Railroad and the Knoxville Southern Railroad built a rail line connecting the Copper Basin to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to the north and [[Marietta, Georgia]] to the south, and mining operations resumed.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 25</ref><ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 39-40</ref> A railroad station was constructed in McCay's, and the name was changed to Copperhill in 1908.<ref name=gms>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamineral.org/writings/copperbasin-cochran.html|title=Minerals and Mining of the Copper Basin|last=Cochran|first=Kim|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref> The [[London]]-based Ducktown Sulphur, Copper and Iron Company (DCS&I) reopened the Mary Mine in 1890, and the following year the open-roast heap smelting process was first used in the basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company (TCC), which had been founded earlier that year and had purchased most of the mining operations in the Copper Basin, constructed a smelter at Copperhill and began work on the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]] at Ducktown. This mine would eventually become the most productive mine in the basin.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 37</ref> The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air, killing off all vegetation in the Copper Basin region. After being sued by local farmers and the state of Georgia over damage caused by the pollution, the Tennessee Copper Company began to recapture the sulfur dioxide in 1907 and convert it into sulfuric acid, which they successfully marketed.<ref name=waters>{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Jack|date=<!--Not given, probably 1990s-->|title=Mining the Copper Basin in Southeast Tennessee|url=http://www.telliquah.com/History2.htm|work=The Tellico Plains Mountain Press|location=Tellico Plains, Tennessee|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref>

Despite the revival of the mining industry, many problems ensued. In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>

The Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> A sulfuric acid plant was constructed in Copperhill in 1942, and by 1949 liquid sulfuric acid was being produced.<ref name=waters/> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Both, unions, however, fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute. As a result, a six-week strike began on July 14, 1939.<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref>

===Later years===
World War II brought a brief increase in demand for products from the Copper Basin, but afterwards, faced with decreasing demand and increasing foreign competition, the mining industry began to decline in the Copper Basin in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/history|title=Remembering the golden age of copper.|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The Burra Burra mine, which had grown into the largest mine, closed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|title=Ducktown Museum and the Burra Burra Mine|last=Breisch|first=Rob|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211230721/http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> In 1960 the Central Mine, the last major mine in the Copper Basin, began operation. The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\"/> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>

The company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>

==Environmental issues and reclamation==
[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]
At first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

The state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company|vol=83|reporter=S.W.|opinion=658|court=Tennessee Supreme Court|date=1904|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/madison-v-ducktown-sulphur-copper-amp-iron-co|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The lawsuits culminated in 1907, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company'' that the state of Georgia could order the Tennessee Copper Company, via injunction, to mitigate the pollution from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company|vol=206|reporter=U.S.|opinion=230|pinpoint=|court=U.S. Supreme Court|date=May 13, 1907|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/206/230/|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The following year, facilities were constructed to condense the fumes into sulfuric acid, which was successfully marketed, and as a result, this injunction was never enforced.<ref name=waters/> Two additional Supreme Court cases related to this injunction, ''[[Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'' and ''[[Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'', both in 1910, followed.

Reforestation and reclamation efforts in the Copper Basin began in the 1930s. In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Recent history==

The Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin. The museum was moved to the building that formerly housed the headquarters of the Tennessee Copper Company at the Burra Burra Mine in 1982.

The '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.

Copper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.

By the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.

The Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>

The [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>

Ducktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

Most of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s. The metamorphic rocks are part of the Great Smoky formation.

==Mining history==
===Early history===
[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]
The Copper Basin was part of [[Cherokee]] lands until 1836, when the Cherokee relinquished control of the basin to the U.S. government through the [[Treaty of New Echota]]. The Copper Basin was known to the Cherokee as Kawa'na.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 17</ref> Copper from the basin was used by the Cherokee on a limited basis.<ref name=waters/> The basin became part of the Ocoee District, which mostly consisted of what is now Polk County. While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 8-11</ref>

Copper was first discovered by a European American in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek, now known as Potato Creek, southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine by a prospector named Lemmons who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=frye7>Frye 2017, p. 7</ref><ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations. The first shipment of copper out of the basin took place in 1847, which consisted of 90 casks shipped by mule to [[Dalton, Georgia]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away, where the nearest railroad was located at that time.<ref name=\"dailycitizen\">{{Cite news |last=Jenkins |first=Robert |url=https://www.dailycitizen.news/news/local_news/civil-war-anniversary-the-east-tennessee-georgia-railroad/article_00987027-c1e6-510e-8651-300c41c5e604.html |title=Civil War anniversary: The East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad |date=October 9, 2010 |work=[[The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Georgia)|The Daily Citizen]] |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The first purchase of land in the Copper Basin for mining activities occurred in 1849 when a British agent bought 400 acres for a price of $30,000.<ref name=brooks19/> The Hiwassee Mine began operations in May 1850 near the site of the ore discovery at the center of the basin.<ref name=frye7/> In 1851, work began on the Old Copper Road through the Ocoee Gorge, connecting the Copper Basin with [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] to the west, where the copper was loaded onto a railroad, which had been completed that same year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bradley County Historical Society|date=1992|title=Reflections Past and Present: A Pictoral History of Bradley County, Tennessee|publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|page=31}}</ref> The Old Copper Road was completed in 1853, and is now part of U.S. Route 64.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 8</ref> In an effort to reduce transportation costs, the mining companies began smelting the copper onsite in 1856.<ref name=brooks21>Brook 1990, p. 21</ref> By 1857, four additional mines, the Tennessee, Mary's, Isabella, and, Eureka were in operation in the Copper Basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1858, three companies, the Union Consolidated Mining Company, the Burra Burra Copper Company, and the Ducktown Copper Company, were formed to operate different mines in the basin.<ref name=waters/>

A total of nine separate ore deposits were discovered and worked within the basin. In 1860, several small-scale mining operations in the basin were consolidated to form the Burra Burra Copper Company, which was placed under the direction of mining engineer [[Julius Eckhardt Raht|Julius Raht]].<ref name=frye7/> In 1861 a [[rolling mill]] was constructed in Cleveland to process copper ore.<ref name=gms/> At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], the mines were seized by the Confederacy, which halted private operations in the basin, and copper was used to produce weapons for the war effort.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 87-96</ref> By 1863 mining operations had largely ceased in the basin.<ref name=brooks21/> Between November 25 and 27, 1863 during the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], Union cavalrymen, led by Col.

===Expansion of mining operations===
[[File:Copper mining and sulfuric acid plant1a34317v.jpg|thumb|right|Copper mine and sulfuric acid plant in Copperhill, 1939]]
In the summer of 1889, the Marietta & North Georgia Railroad and the Knoxville Southern Railroad built a rail line connecting the Copper Basin to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to the north and [[Marietta, Georgia]] to the south, and mining operations resumed.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 25</ref><ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 39-40</ref> A railroad station was constructed in McCay's, and the name was changed to Copperhill in 1908.<ref name=gms>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamineral.org/writings/copperbasin-cochran.html|title=Minerals and Mining of the Copper Basin|last=Cochran|first=Kim|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref> The [[London]]-based Ducktown Sulphur, Copper and Iron Company (DCS&I) reopened the Mary Mine in 1890, and the following year the open-roast heap smelting process was first used in the basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company (TCC), which had been founded earlier that year and had purchased most of the mining operations in the Copper Basin, constructed a smelter at Copperhill and began work on the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]] at Ducktown. This mine would eventually become the most productive mine in the basin.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 37</ref> The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air, killing off all vegetation in the Copper Basin region. After being sued by local farmers and the state of Georgia over damage caused by the pollution, the Tennessee Copper Company began to recapture the sulfur dioxide in 1907 and convert it into sulfuric acid, which they successfully marketed.<ref name=waters>{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Jack|date=<!--Not given, probably 1990s-->|title=Mining the Copper Basin in Southeast Tennessee|url=http://www.telliquah.com/History2.htm|work=The Tellico Plains Mountain Press|location=Tellico Plains, Tennessee|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref>

Despite the revival of the mining industry, many problems ensued. In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>

The Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> A sulfuric acid plant was constructed in Copperhill in 1942, and by 1949 liquid sulfuric acid was being produced.<ref name=waters/> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Both, unions, however, fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute. As a result, a six-week strike began on July 14, 1939.<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref>

===Later years===
World War II brought a brief increase in demand for products from the Copper Basin, but afterwards, faced with decreasing demand and increasing foreign competition, the mining industry began to decline in the Copper Basin in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/history|title=Remembering the golden age of copper.|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The Burra Burra mine, which had grown into the largest mine, closed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|title=Ducktown Museum and the Burra Burra Mine|last=Breisch|first=Rob|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211230721/http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> In 1960 the Central Mine, the last major mine in the Copper Basin, began operation. The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\"/> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>

The company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>

==Environmental issues and reclamation==
[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]
At first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

The state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company|vol=83|reporter=S.W.|opinion=658|court=Tennessee Supreme Court|date=1904|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/madison-v-ducktown-sulphur-copper-amp-iron-co|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The lawsuits culminated in 1907, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company'' that the state of Georgia could order the Tennessee Copper Company, via injunction, to mitigate the pollution from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company|vol=206|reporter=U.S.|opinion=230|pinpoint=|court=U.S. Supreme Court|date=May 13, 1907|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/206/230/|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The following year, facilities were constructed to condense the fumes into sulfuric acid, which was successfully marketed, and as a result, this injunction was never enforced.<ref name=waters/> Two additional Supreme Court cases related to this injunction, ''[[Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'' and ''[[Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'', both in 1910, followed.

Reforestation and reclamation efforts in the Copper Basin began in the 1930s. In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Recent history==

The Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin. The museum was moved to the building that formerly housed the headquarters of the Tennessee Copper Company at the Burra Burra Mine in 1982.

{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}
The '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.

Copper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.

By the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.

The Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>

The [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>

Ducktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

===Expansion of mining operations===
[[File:Copper mining and sulfuric acid plant1a34317v.jpg|thumb|right|Copper mine and sulfuric acid plant in Copperhill, 1939]]
In the summer of 1889, the Marietta & North Georgia Railroad and the Knoxville Southern Railroad built a rail line connecting the Copper Basin to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to the north and [[Marietta, Georgia]] to the south, and mining operations resumed.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 25</ref><ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 39-40</ref> A railroad station was constructed in McCay's, and the name was changed to Copperhill in 1908.<ref name=gms>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamineral.org/writings/copperbasin-cochran.html|title=Minerals and Mining of the Copper Basin|last=Cochran|first=Kim|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref> The [[London]]-based Ducktown Sulphur, Copper and Iron Company (DCS&I) reopened the Mary Mine in 1890, and the following year the open-roast heap smelting process was first used in the basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company (TCC), which had been founded earlier that year and had purchased most of the mining operations in the Copper Basin, constructed a smelter at Copperhill and began work on the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]] at Ducktown.

Despite the revival of the mining industry, many problems ensued. In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>

The Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> A sulfuric acid plant was constructed in Copperhill in 1942, and by 1949 liquid sulfuric acid was being produced.<ref name=waters/> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Both, unions, however, fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute. As a result, a six-week strike began on July 14, 1939.<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref>

===Later years===
World War II brought a brief increase in demand for products from the Copper Basin, but afterwards, faced with decreasing demand and increasing foreign competition, the mining industry began to decline in the Copper Basin in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/history|title=Remembering the golden age of copper.|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The Burra Burra mine, which had grown into the largest mine, closed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|title=Ducktown Museum and the Burra Burra Mine|last=Breisch|first=Rob|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211230721/http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> In 1960 the Central Mine, the last major mine in the Copper Basin, began operation. The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\"/> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>

The company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>

==Environmental issues and reclamation==
[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]
At first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

The state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company|vol=83|reporter=S.W.|opinion=658|court=Tennessee Supreme Court|date=1904|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/madison-v-ducktown-sulphur-copper-amp-iron-co|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The lawsuits culminated in 1907, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company'' that the state of Georgia could order the Tennessee Copper Company, via injunction, to mitigate the pollution from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company|vol=206|reporter=U.S.|opinion=230|pinpoint=|court=U.S. Supreme Court|date=May 13, 1907|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/206/230/|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The following year, facilities were constructed to condense the fumes into sulfuric acid, which was successfully marketed, and as a result, this injunction was never enforced.<ref name=waters/> Two additional Supreme Court cases related to this injunction, ''[[Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'' and ''[[Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'', both in 1910, followed.

Reforestation and reclamation efforts in the Copper Basin began in the 1930s. In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Recent history==

The Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin. The museum was moved to the building that formerly housed the headquarters of the Tennessee Copper Company at the Burra Burra Mine in 1982. It features exhibits on the history of the mining operations in the basin and the geology of the area, as well as artifacts from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/exhibits|title=Exhibits|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-29|quote=}}</ref>

{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}
The '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.

Copper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.

By the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.

==Geography and geology==

The Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the common borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>

The [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>

Ducktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Most of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

===Early history===
[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]
The Copper Basin was part of [[Cherokee]] lands until 1836, when the Cherokee relinquished control of the basin to the U.S. government. The Copper Basin was known to the Cherokee as Kawa'na.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 17</ref> Copper from the basin was used by the Cherokee on a limited basis.<ref name=waters/> The basin became part of the Ocoee District, which mostly consisted of what is now Polk County. While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 8-11</ref>

Copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek, now known as Potato Creek, southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine by a prospector named Lemmons who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=frye7>Frye 2017, p. 7</ref><ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations.

===Expansion of mining operations===
[[File:Copper mining and sulfuric acid plant1a34317v.jpg|thumb|right|Copper mine and sulfuric acid plant in Copperhill, 1939]]
In the summer of 1889, the Marietta & North Georgia Railroad and the Knoxville Southern Railroad built a rail line connecting the Copper Basin to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to the north and [[Marietta, Georgia]] to the south, and mining operations resumed.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 25</ref><ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 39-40</ref> A railroad station was constructed in McCay's, and the name was changed to Copperhill in 1908.<ref name=gms>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamineral.org/writings/copperbasin-cochran.html|title=Minerals and Mining of the Copper Basin|last=Cochran|first=Kim|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref> The [[London]]-based Ducktown Sulphur, Copper and Iron Company (DCS&I) reopened the Mary Mine in 1890, and the following year the open-roast heap smelting process was first used in the basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company (TCC), which had been founded earlier that year and had purchased most of the mining operations in the Copper Basin, constructed a smelter at Copperhill and began work on the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]] at Ducktown. This mine would eventually become the most productive mine in the basin.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 37</ref> The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air, killing off all vegetation in the Copper Basin region. After being sued by local farmers and the state of Georgia over damage caused by the pollution, the Tennessee Copper Company began to recapture the sulfur dioxide in 1907 and convert it into sulfuric acid, which they successfully marketed.<ref name=waters>{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Jack|date=<!--Not given, probably 1990s-->|title=Mining the Copper Basin in Southeast Tennessee|url=http://www.telliquah.com/History2.htm|work=The Tellico Plains Mountain Press|location=Tellico Plains, Tennessee|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref>

Despite the revival of the mining industry, many problems ensued. In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>

The Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> A sulfuric acid plant was constructed in Copperhill in 1942, and by 1949 liquid sulfuric acid was being produced.<ref name=waters/> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Both, unions, however, fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute. As a result, a six-week strike began on July 14, 1939.<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref>

===Later years===
World War II brought a brief increase in demand for products from the Copper Basin, but afterwards, faced with decreasing demand and increasing foreign competition, the mining industry began to decline in the Copper Basin in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/history|title=Remembering the golden age of copper.|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The Burra Burra mine, which had grown into the largest mine, closed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|title=Ducktown Museum and the Burra Burra Mine|last=Breisch|first=Rob|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211230721/http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> In 1960 the Central Mine, the last major mine in the Copper Basin, began operation. The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\"/> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>

The company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>

==Environmental issues and reclamation==
[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]
At first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

The state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company|vol=83|reporter=S.W.|opinion=658|court=Tennessee Supreme Court|date=1904|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/madison-v-ducktown-sulphur-copper-amp-iron-co|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The lawsuits culminated in 1907, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company'' that the state of Georgia could order the Tennessee Copper Company, via injunction, to mitigate the pollution from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company|vol=206|reporter=U.S.|opinion=230|pinpoint=|court=U.S. Supreme Court|date=May 13, 1907|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/206/230/|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The following year, facilities were constructed to condense the fumes into sulfuric acid, which was successfully marketed, and as a result, this injunction was never enforced.<ref name=waters/> Two additional Supreme Court cases related to this injunction, ''[[Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'' and ''[[Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'', both in 1910, followed.

Reforestation and reclamation efforts in the Copper Basin began in the 1930s. In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Recent history==

The Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin. The museum was moved to the building that formerly housed the headquarters of the Tennessee Copper Company at the Burra Burra Mine in 1982. It features exhibits on the history of the mining operations in the basin and the geology of the area, as well as artifacts from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/exhibits|title=Exhibits|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-29|quote=}}</ref>

{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}
The '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.

Copper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.

By the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.

The Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the common borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>

The [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>

Ducktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Most of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s. The metamorphic rocks are part of the Great Smoky formation.

==Mining history==
===Early history===
[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]
The Copper Basin was part of [[Cherokee]] lands until 1836, when the Cherokee relinquished control of the basin to the U.S. government. The Copper Basin was known to the Cherokee as Kawa'na.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 17</ref> Copper from the basin was used by the Cherokee on a limited basis.<ref name=waters/> The basin became part of the Ocoee District, which mostly consisted of what is now Polk County. While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 8-11</ref>

Copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek, now known as Potato Creek, southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine by a prospector named Lemmons who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=frye7>Frye 2017, p. 7</ref><ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations. The first shipment of copper out of the basin took place in 1847, which consisted of 90 casks shipped by mule to [[Dalton, Georgia]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away, where the nearest railroad was located at that time.<ref name=\"dailycitizen\">{{Cite news |last=Jenkins |first=Robert |url=https://www.dailycitizen.news/news/local_news/civil-war-anniversary-the-east-tennessee-georgia-railroad/article_00987027-c1e6-510e-8651-300c41c5e604.html |title=Civil War anniversary: The East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad |date=October 9, 2010 |work=[[The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Georgia)|The Daily Citizen]] |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The first purchase of land in the Copper Basin for mining activities occurred in 1849 when a British agent bought 400 acres for a price of $30,000.<ref name=brooks19/> The Hiwassee Mine began operations in May 1850 near the site of the ore discovery at the center of the basin.<ref name=frye7/> In 1851, work began on the Old Copper Road through the Ocoee Gorge, connecting the Copper Basin with [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] to the west, where the copper was loaded onto a railroad, which had been completed that same year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bradley County Historical Society|date=1992|title=Reflections Past and Present: A Pictoral History of Bradley County, Tennessee|publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|page=31}}</ref> The Old Copper Road was completed in 1853, and is now part of U.S. Route 64.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 8</ref> In an effort to reduce transportation costs, the mining companies began smelting the copper onsite in 1856.<ref name=brooks21>Brook 1990, p. 21</ref> By 1857, four additional mines, the Tennessee, Mary's, Isabella, and, Eureka were in operation in the Copper Basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1858, three companies, the Union Consolidated Mining Company, the Burra Burra Copper Company, and the Ducktown Copper Company, were formed to operate different mines in the basin.<ref name=waters/>

A total of nine separate ore deposits were discovered and worked within the basin. In 1860, several small-scale mining operations in the basin were consolidated to form the Burra Burra Copper Company, which was placed under the direction of mining engineer [[Julius Eckhardt Raht|Julius Raht]].<ref name=frye7/> In 1861 a [[rolling mill]] was constructed in Cleveland to process copper ore.<ref name=gms/> At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], the mines were seized by the Confederacy, which halted private operations in the basin, and copper was used to produce weapons for the war effort.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 87-96</ref> By 1863 mining operations had largely ceased in the basin.<ref name=brooks21/> Between November 25 and 27, 1863 during the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], Union cavalrymen, led by Col.

===Expansion of mining operations===
[[File:Copper mining and sulfuric acid plant1a34317v.jpg|thumb|right|Copper mine and sulfuric acid plant in Copperhill, 1939]]
In the summer of 1889, the Marietta & North Georgia Railroad and the Knoxville Southern Railroad built a rail line connecting the Copper Basin to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to the north and [[Marietta, Georgia]] to the south, and mining operations resumed.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 25</ref><ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 39-40</ref> A railroad station was constructed in McCay's, and the name was changed to Copperhill in 1908.<ref name=gms>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamineral.org/writings/copperbasin-cochran.html|title=Minerals and Mining of the Copper Basin|last=Cochran|first=Kim|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref> The [[London]]-based Ducktown Sulphur, Copper and Iron Company (DCS&I) reopened the Mary Mine in 1890, and the following year the open-roast heap smelting process was first used in the basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company (TCC), which had been founded earlier that year and had purchased most of the mining operations in the Copper Basin, constructed a smelter at Copperhill and began work on the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]] at Ducktown. This mine would eventually become the most productive mine in the basin.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 37</ref> The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air, killing off all vegetation in the Copper Basin region. After being sued by local farmers and the state of Georgia over damage caused by the pollution, the Tennessee Copper Company began to recapture the sulfur dioxide in 1907 and convert it into sulfuric acid, which they successfully marketed.<ref name=waters>{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Jack|date=<!--Not given, probably 1990s-->|title=Mining the Copper Basin in Southeast Tennessee|url=http://www.telliquah.com/History2.htm|work=The Tellico Plains Mountain Press|location=Tellico Plains, Tennessee|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref>

Despite the revival of the mining industry, many problems ensued. In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>

The Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> A sulfuric acid plant was constructed in Copperhill in 1942, and by 1949 liquid sulfuric acid was being produced.<ref name=waters/> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Both, unions, however, fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute. As a result, a six-week strike began on July 14, 1939.<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref>

===Later years===
World War II brought a brief increase in demand for products from the Copper Basin, but afterwards, faced with decreasing demand and increasing foreign competition, the mining industry began to decline in the Copper Basin in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/history|title=Remembering the golden age of copper.|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The Burra Burra mine, which had grown into the largest mine, closed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|title=Ducktown Museum and the Burra Burra Mine|last=Breisch|first=Rob|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211230721/http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> In 1960 the Central Mine, the last major mine in the Copper Basin, began operation. The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\"/> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>

The company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>

==Environmental issues and reclamation==
[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]
At first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

The state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company|vol=83|reporter=S.W.|opinion=658|court=Tennessee Supreme Court|date=1904|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/madison-v-ducktown-sulphur-copper-amp-iron-co|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The lawsuits culminated in 1907, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company'' that the state of Georgia could order the Tennessee Copper Company, via injunction, to mitigate the pollution from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company|vol=206|reporter=U.S.|opinion=230|pinpoint=|court=U.S. Supreme Court|date=May 13, 1907|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/206/230/|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The following year, facilities were constructed to condense the fumes into sulfuric acid, which was successfully marketed, and as a result, this injunction was never enforced.<ref name=waters/> Two additional Supreme Court cases related to this injunction, ''[[Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'' and ''[[Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'', both in 1910, followed.

Reforestation and reclamation efforts in the Copper Basin began in the 1930s. In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Recent history==

The Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin. The museum was moved to the building that formerly housed the headquarters of the Tennessee Copper Company at the Burra Burra Mine in 1982. It features exhibits on the history of the mining operations in the basin and the geology of the area, as well as artifacts from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/exhibits|title=Exhibits|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-29|quote=}}</ref>

{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}
The '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.

Copper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.

By the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.

==Geography and geology==

The Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the common borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>

The [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>

Ducktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Most of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s. The metamorphic rocks are part of the Great Smoky formation.

==Mining history==
===Early history===
[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]
The Copper Basin was part of [[Cherokee]] lands until 1836, when the Cherokee relinquished control of the basin to the U.S. government. The Copper Basin was known to the Cherokee as Kawa'na.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 17</ref> Copper from the basin was used by the Cherokee on a limited basis.<ref name=waters/> The basin became part of the Ocoee District, which mostly consisted of what is now Polk County. While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 8-11</ref>

Copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek, now known as Potato Creek, southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine by a prospector named Lemmons who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=frye7>Frye 2017, p. 7</ref><ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations. The first shipment of copper out of the basin took place in 1847, which consisted of 90 casks shipped by mule to [[Dalton, Georgia]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away, where the nearest railroad was located at that time.<ref name=\"dailycitizen\">{{Cite news |last=Jenkins |first=Robert |url=https://www.dailycitizen.news/news/local_news/civil-war-anniversary-the-east-tennessee-georgia-railroad/article_00987027-c1e6-510e-8651-300c41c5e604.html |title=Civil War anniversary: The East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad |date=October 9, 2010 |work=[[The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Georgia)|The Daily Citizen]] |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The first purchase of land in the Copper Basin for mining activities occurred in 1849 when a British agent bought 400 acres for a price of $30,000.<ref name=brooks19/> The Hiwassee Mine began operations in May 1850 near the site of the ore discovery at the center of the basin.<ref name=frye7/> In 1851, work began on the Old Copper Road through the Ocoee Gorge, connecting the Copper Basin with [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] to the west, where the copper was loaded onto a railroad, which had been completed that same year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bradley County Historical Society|date=1992|title=Reflections Past and Present: A Pictoral History of Bradley County, Tennessee|publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|page=31}}</ref> The Old Copper Road was completed in 1853, and is now part of U.S. Route 64.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 8</ref> In an effort to reduce transportation costs, the mining companies began smelting the copper onsite in 1856.<ref name=brooks21>Brook 1990, p. 21</ref> By 1857, four additional mines, the Tennessee, Mary's, Isabella, and, Eureka were in operation in the Copper Basin.<ref name=waters/> In 1858, three companies, the Union Consolidated Mining Company, the Burra Burra Copper Company, and the Ducktown Copper Company, were formed to operate different mines in the basin.<ref name=waters/>

A total of nine separate ore deposits were discovered and worked within the basin. In 1860, several small-scale mining operations in the basin were consolidated to form the Burra Burra Copper Company, which was placed under the direction of mining engineer [[Julius Eckhardt Raht|Julius Raht]].<ref name=frye7/> In 1861 a [[rolling mill]] was constructed in Cleveland to process copper ore.<ref name=gms/> At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], the mines were seized by the Confederacy, which halted private operations in the basin, and copper was used to produce weapons for the war effort.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 87-96</ref> By 1863 mining operations had largely ceased in the basin.<ref name=brooks21/> Between November 25 and 27, 1863 during the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], Union cavalrymen, led by Col.

This mine would eventually become the most productive mine in the basin.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 37</ref> The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air, killing off all vegetation in the Copper Basin region. After being sued by local farmers and the state of Georgia over damage caused by the pollution, the Tennessee Copper Company began to recapture the sulfur dioxide in 1907 and convert it into sulfuric acid, which they successfully marketed.<ref name=waters>{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Jack|date=<!--Not given, probably 1990s-->|title=Mining the Copper Basin in Southeast Tennessee|url=http://www.telliquah.com/History2.htm|work=The Tellico Plains Mountain Press|location=Tellico Plains, Tennessee|access-date=2008-05-30}}</ref>

Despite the revival of the mining industry, many problems ensued. In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>

The Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> A sulfuric acid plant was constructed in Copperhill in 1942, and by 1949 liquid sulfuric acid was being produced.<ref name=waters/> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Both, unions, however, fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute. As a result, a six-week strike began on July 14, 1939.<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref>

===Later years===
World War II brought a brief increase in demand for products from the Copper Basin, but afterwards, faced with decreasing demand and increasing foreign competition, the mining industry began to decline in the Copper Basin in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/history|title=Remembering the golden age of copper.|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The Burra Burra mine, which had grown into the largest mine, closed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|title=Ducktown Museum and the Burra Burra Mine|last=Breisch|first=Rob|date=<!--Not given-->|website=gamineral.org|publisher=Georgia Mineral Society|access-date=2008-05-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211230721/http://www.gamineral.org/ducktown-museum-pics.htm|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> In 1960 the Central Mine, the last major mine in the Copper Basin, began operation. The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\"/> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>

The company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>

==Environmental issues and reclamation==
[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]
At first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

The state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company|vol=83|reporter=S.W.|opinion=658|court=Tennessee Supreme Court|date=1904|url=https://www.quimbee.com/cases/madison-v-ducktown-sulphur-copper-amp-iron-co|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The lawsuits culminated in 1907, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company'' that the state of Georgia could order the Tennessee Copper Company, via injunction, to mitigate the pollution from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company|vol=206|reporter=U.S.|opinion=230|pinpoint=|court=U.S. Supreme Court|date=May 13, 1907|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/206/230/|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> The following year, facilities were constructed to condense the fumes into sulfuric acid, which was successfully marketed, and as a result, this injunction was never enforced.<ref name=waters/> Two additional Supreme Court cases related to this injunction, ''[[Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'' and ''[[Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co.]]'', both in 1910, followed.

Reforestation and reclamation efforts in the Copper Basin began in the 1930s. In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Recent history==
[[Image:Ducktown-basin-museum-misc-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Mining machine parts and tools scattered about the Burra Burra Mine site]]
The Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin. The museum was moved to the building that formerly housed the headquarters of the Tennessee Copper Company at the Burra Burra Mine in 1982. It features exhibits on the history of the mining operations in the basin and the geology of the area, as well as artifacts from the mining activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ducktownbasinmuseum.com/exhibits|title=Exhibits|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=ducktownbasinmuseum.com|publisher=Ducktown Basin Museum|access-date=2020-02-29|quote=}}</ref>

The Burra Burra Mine was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983. Many of the structures from the mining operations still remain.<ref>{{NRISref|2013a|dateform=mdy|accessdate=February 29, 2020|refnum=83003059|name=Burra Burra Mine}}</ref>

The basin was the site of a large flood in 1990 that inundated most of the business districts of Copperhill and McCaysville, resulting in a years-long legal battle between the two cities and forcing Copperhill into bankruptcy.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news|last=Bhatt|first=Sanjay|date=November 20, 1996|title=Feuding Border Towns Bury The Hatchet -- and Strike Gold|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB848426650383943500|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|location=New York City|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]].  Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Scott County is part of [[Indiana's 9th congressional district]] and is represented in [[United States Congress|Congress]] by [[USRepublican|Republican]] [[Trey Hollingsworth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://treyhollingsworth.house.gov/district.shtml|title=Conressman Trey Hollingsworth|publisher=House.Gov|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>

{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]].  Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Scott County is part of [[Indiana's 9th congressional district]] and is represented in [[United States Congress|Congress]] by [[USRepublican|Republican]] [[Trey Hollingsworth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://treyhollingsworth.house.gov/district.shtml|title=Conressman Trey Hollingsworth|publisher=House.Gov|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from an Indiana mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==

===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== 

The original vision for the Trenton Plant included Bessemer furnaces to supplement the electric furnace capability. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate different ways to supply its electric furnaces. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref> As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnace were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.
<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.

==Detroit Complex==
This complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.

The Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.

In 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.

The Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|°F|°C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.

Coil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.

The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.

==Trenton Complex==
[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]
In 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from an Indiana mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. 

A few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.

1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.

Between 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.

Profitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.

The plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.

==Gibraltar Complex==
In 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.

The property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.

There was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.

The plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.

==Legacy and Achievements==
===First Basic Oxygen Furnace in the United States=== <ref>https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/104-basic-oxygen-steel-making-vessel-1955.pdf</ref>
The original vision for the Trenton Plant included [[Bessemer furnaces]] to supplement the electric furnace capability. Trenton's city ordinances against pollution didn't allow for a Bessemer furnace to be used, forcing McLouth to investigate different ways to supply its electric furnaces. McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace. 

The technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven [[basic oxygen process]] to its needs. By 1954, McLouth's original 60 ton furnaces were in action. As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnace were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

===First Online Computer Control===
Online computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.

\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.

The Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>

===First Continuous Caster===
McLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.

In May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.

====Pilot Plant====
In 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.

Initial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.

The five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.

====Casting Plant Description====
Four single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.

The record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.
<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>

===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===
McLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.

The nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.

Although induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.

Several induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.

Early in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.

The next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.

A full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.

Overall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.
<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>

== Closing ==
McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.

McLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. 

McLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. 

In the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.

'''Western Connecticut State University''' ('''Western''', '''Western Connecticut''', '''Western Connecticut State''', '''WestConn''', and '''WCSU''') is a [[public university]] in [[Danbury, Connecticut]]. It consists of four schools and one division: the [[Ancell School of Business]] (which includes the Justice & Law Administration program), the Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the School of Professional Studies, and the Division of Graduate Studies.

Founded in 1903, WCSU is part of the [[Connecticut State University System|Connecticut State University]] (CSU) system, the primary division of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities (CSCU) system, which also includes [[Eastern Connecticut State University|Eastern]], [[Southern Connecticut State University|Southern]] and [[Central Connecticut State University|Central]] Connecticut state universities; CSCU as a whole consists of those universities in addition to a number of [[community college]]s. Between the four state universities, more than 34,000 students are enrolled, with more than 5,700 students enrolled at WCSU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/president/facts-figures/|title=Western Facts & Figures - Office of the President|website=www.wcsu.edu}}</ref> (As of the Fall 2016 semester.)

WCSU is home to the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]], which is the result of a partnership between WCSU and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (a private non-profit organization that promotes research, education and wildlife conservation). The university's Westside campus houses the [[Ives Concert Park]], one of the premier performance venues in the area.

Western Connecticut State University is part of the [[Little East Conference]] and [[New Jersey Athletic Conference]].

== History ==

=== Founding and growth ===

[[File:The Gates at Western Connecticut State University.jpg|thumb|The entrance gates of WCSU's Midtown campus, located in downtown Danbury.]]

Western was founded in 1903 as a [[teachers' college]], training the primary and secondary school educators for Connecticut's [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and surrounding areas. The school's name has changed over the years as it has focused on additional areas of study. First named the '''Danbury Normal School''' (also known as the '''Danbury State Normal School'''), starting in 1937 it was called the '''Danbury State Teachers College''', a name it retained until the late 1950s. The college was renamed '''Danbury State College''' in 1959, then '''Western Connecticut State College''' in 1967, and finally, in 1983, '''Western Connecticut State University'''.<ref>{{citation|first=Ray C.|last=Brown|url=http://collegehistorygarden.blogspot.com/2014/12/connecticut-colleges-that-have-closed.html |title=Connecticut Colleges that have Closed, Merged, Changed Names|date= |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref> In 2011, governance of the university was transferred to the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities system.

In 1904, 41 students were enrolled in the first classes on campus, the number of enrollments climbing to 362 students by 1912.

=== WXCI and music publicization ===

In 1968, WCSU's radio station, [[WXCI]] (91.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]), then going by the [[call sign]] WCST and broadcasting with [[AM broadcasting|AM]] transmission, was established.

In 1973 WCST was switched from AM to FM transmission, obtained an [[FCC]] license, was renamed WXCI, and went on air under that call sign.

In the early 1980s, WXCI became one of the first FM stations to focus on [[alternative rock]]. Throughout the 80s the station was instrumental in promoting the work of a number of contemporary bands and musicians: While the station is perhaps best known for popularizing the English band [[Duran Duran]] in the United States, it also helped to familiarize the American audience with other projects and musicians from [[Great Britain]], such as [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Culture Club]], and it popularized among residents of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern U.S.]] the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] punk group [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based [[R.E.M.]], while also providing greater listenership to New York City's [[Talking Heads]]. [[Thurston Moore]], a founding member of [[Sonic Youth]], attended WCSU for a [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter]] during the fall of 1976, though he left afterward.

=== Jane Goodall Institute and environmental projects ===

{{further|Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies|Jane Goodall Institute|Roots & Shoots}}

In 1995, the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]] (JGC) was founded on campus. The Center is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[501(c)(3) organization]] dedicated to environmental stewardship and conservation, and wildlife education and research, being the result of a partnership between Western and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (JGI). Since the Center's founding, its namesake, primatologist Dr. [[Jane Goodall]], has visited Western on at least a dozen occasions to give lectures on the issue of ecology.

The Center has also hosted a number of seminars and public talks by other environmentalist speakers at the university: Notably, [[Smithsonian]] ethnobotanist [[Mark Plotkin]] and veteran ecologist [[Thomas Lovejoy]] spoke at the university in 1998, and in 2013 ocean conservationist [[Fabien Cousteau]] presented a public seminar on campus.

In 2005, Western was established by JGI as a \"National Center for University Roots and Shoots\"; this event resulted in the institution of the eponymous student environmental club, a chapter of the international [[Roots & Shoots]] (also known as Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots), on campus. Roots & Shoots is a subsidiary organization of JGI, and its WCSU chapter is one of only several based in the United States. The club's office, located in the Midtown campus's White Hall, remained the first of its kind between 2005 and 2012; afterwards, the organization's international headquarters was established at JGI's head office in Washington, D.C.

Roots & Shoots serves as, according to the university and the JGC, \"a regional and national office of excellence in training university students, faculty and administrators to develop programs for K-12 and college students in local, regional and global conservation.\"

=== Campus ===

Western has two campuses, midtown and westside, both located in Danbury. The campuses are three miles (5&nbsp;km) apart and connected by a university shuttle service.

The midtown campus is the original campus, located on White Street near downtown Danbury and the [[Main Street Historic District (Danbury, Connecticut)|Main Street Historic District]]. It is home to the [https://www.wcsu.edu/sas/ Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences], School of Professional Studies, and most of the university's administration. Dormitories on this campus include Fairfield Hall, Litchfield Hall, and Newbury Hall. The Midtown student center is located on this campus. In 2018, the fully renovated Higgins Hall reopened. Higgins Hall features the MSAS Dean's offices, state-of-the-art communication, media, and computer technology.

The westside campus is located on land purchased in 1969 on the outskirts of Danbury. This {{convert|439|acre|km2|adj=on}} lot is home to the [[Ancell School of Business]], the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the Westside Nature Preserve, an amphitheater and three residence halls. Westside also houses athletic facilities, including the William O'Neill Athletic and Convocation Center (completed in 1995), and the Westside Athletic Complex (completed in 2003), as well as an observatory with a 20-inch Ritchy-Chretien telescope and a 20-foot planetarium dome.  On January 23, 2007, the Westside Campus Center was officially opened. This new facility serves as a student center, meeting and banquet facility for the Westside campus. In August 2014, the Westside campus saw the opening of the new Visual and Performing Arts Center, a comprehensive arts building with Theatre Arts, Music and Visual Arts wings.

A major improvement program was started in the mid-1990s to beautify the campus.  Several parking lots became green space, and improvements were made to the landscaping.

In April 2013, startup of a newly installed [[fuel cell]] power unit for the Science Building on the university's Midtown campus began. The [[PureCell System|PureCell]] System, provided by [[ClearEdge Power]], will support the university to reap significant energy cost savings and enhanced electricity and heating efficiencies.

The Midtown campus Science Building was the first state-funded building project to seek [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED Silver certification]] from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]]. The Visual and Performing Arts Center as well as Centennial Hall also obtained LEED certification. In 2014, WCSU installed four EV (electric vehicle) charging stations, two on each campus. These charging stations are available to both students and the public, free of charge. The university is a participant in EV Connecticut Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions program. 
 
The \"WestConn at Waterbury\" program is located on the campus of [[Naugatuck Valley Community College]] in [[Waterbury|Waterbury, Connecticut]]. The program offers completion courses for a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in management or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), as well as a [[Master of Health Administration]] (M.H.A.).<ref>{{cite web|title=Western at Waterbury|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/waterbury/|website=www.wcsu.edu/|publisher=Western Connecticut State University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

'''Western Connecticut State University''' ('''Western''', '''Western Connecticut''', '''Western Connecticut State''', '''WestConn''', and '''WCSU''') is a [[public university]] in [[Danbury, Connecticut]]. It consists of four schools and one division: the [[Ancell School of Business]] (which includes the Justice & Law Administration program), the Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the School of Professional Studies, and the Division of Graduate Studies.

Founded in 1903, WCSU is part of the [[Connecticut State University System|Connecticut State University]] (CSU) system, the primary division of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities (CSCU) system, which also includes [[Eastern Connecticut State University|Eastern]], [[Southern Connecticut State University|Southern]] and [[Central Connecticut State University|Central]] Connecticut state universities; CSCU as a whole consists of those universities in addition to a number of [[community college]]s. Between the four state universities, more than 34,000 students are enrolled, with more than 5,700 students enrolled at WCSU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/president/facts-figures/|title=Western Facts & Figures - Office of the President|website=www.wcsu.edu}}</ref> (As of the Fall 2016 semester.)

WCSU is home to the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]], which is the result of a partnership between WCSU and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (a private non-profit organization that promotes research, education and wildlife conservation). The university's Westside campus houses the [[Ives Concert Park]], one of the premier performance venues in the area.

Western Connecticut State University is part of the [[Little East Conference]] and [[New Jersey Athletic Conference]].

== History ==

=== Founding and growth ===

[[File:The Gates at Western Connecticut State University.jpg|thumb|The entrance gates of WCSU's Midtown campus, located in downtown Danbury.]]

Western was founded in 1903 as a [[teachers' college]], training the primary and secondary school educators for Connecticut's [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and surrounding areas. The school's name has changed over the years as it has focused on additional areas of study. First named the '''Danbury Normal School''' (also known as the '''Danbury State Normal School'''), starting in 1937 it was called the '''Danbury State Teachers College''', a name it retained until the late 1950s. The college was renamed '''Danbury State College''' in 1959, then '''Western Connecticut State College''' in 1967, and finally, in 1983, '''Western Connecticut State University'''.<ref>{{citation|first=Ray C.|last=Brown|url=http://collegehistorygarden.blogspot.com/2014/12/connecticut-colleges-that-have-closed.html |title=Connecticut Colleges that have Closed, Merged, Changed Names|date= |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref> In 2011, governance of the university was transferred to the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities system.

In 1904, 41 students were enrolled in the first classes on campus, the number of enrollments climbing to 362 students by 1912.

=== WXCI and music publicization ===

In 1968, WCSU's radio station, [[WXCI]] (91.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]), then going by the [[call sign]] WCST and broadcasting with [[AM broadcasting|AM]] transmission, was established.

In 1973 WCST was switched from AM to FM transmission, obtained an [[FCC]] license, was renamed WXCI, and went on air under that call sign.

In the early 1980s, WXCI became one of the first FM stations to focus on [[alternative rock]]. Throughout the 80s the station was instrumental in promoting the work of a number of contemporary bands and musicians: While the station is perhaps best known for popularizing the English band [[Duran Duran]] in the United States, it also helped to familiarize the American audience with other projects and musicians from [[Great Britain]], such as [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Culture Club]], and it popularized among residents of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern U.S.]] the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] punk group [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based [[R.E.M.]], while also providing greater listenership to New York City's [[Talking Heads]]. [[Thurston Moore]], a founding member of [[Sonic Youth]], attended WCSU for a [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter]] during the fall of 1976, though he left afterward.

=== Jane Goodall Institute and environmental projects ===

{{further|Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies|Jane Goodall Institute|Roots & Shoots}}

In 1995, the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]] (JGC) was founded on campus. The Center is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[501(c)(3) organization]] dedicated to environmental stewardship and conservation, and wildlife education and research, being the result of a partnership between Western and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (JGI). Since the Center's founding, its namesake, primatologist Dr. [[Jane Goodall]], has visited Western on at least a dozen occasions to give lectures on the issue of ecology.

The Center has also hosted a number of seminars and public talks by other environmentalist speakers at the university: Notably, [[Smithsonian]] ethnobotanist [[Mark Plotkin]] and veteran ecologist [[Thomas Lovejoy]] spoke at the university in 1998, and in 2013 ocean conservationist [[Fabien Cousteau]] presented a public seminar on campus.

In 2005, Western was established by JGI as a \"National Center for University Roots and Shoots\"; this event resulted in the institution of the eponymous student environmental club, a chapter of the international [[Roots & Shoots]] (also known as Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots), on campus. Roots & Shoots is a subsidiary organization of JGI, and its WCSU chapter is one of only several based in the United States. The club's office, located in the Midtown campus's White Hall, remained the first of its kind between 2005 and 2012; afterwards, the organization's international headquarters was established at JGI's head office in Washington, D.C.

Roots & Shoots serves as, according to the university and the JGC, \"a regional and national office of excellence in training university students, faculty and administrators to develop programs for K-12 and college students in local, regional and global conservation.\"

=== Campus ===

Western has two campuses, midtown and westside, both located in Danbury. The campuses are three miles (5&nbsp;km) apart and connected by a university shuttle service.

The midtown campus is the original campus, located on White Street near downtown Danbury and the [[Main Street Historic District (Danbury, Connecticut)|Main Street Historic District]]. It is home to the [https://www.wcsu.edu/sas/ Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences], School of Professional Studies, and most of the university's administration. Dormitories on this campus include Fairfield Hall, Litchfield Hall, and Newbury Hall. The Midtown student center is located on this campus. In 2018, the fully renovated Higgins Hall reopened. Higgins Hall features the MSAS Dean's offices, state-of-the-the art communication, media, and computer technology.

The westside campus is located on land purchased in 1969 on the outskirts of Danbury. This {{convert|439|acre|km2|adj=on}} lot is home to the [[Ancell School of Business]], the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the Westside Nature Preserve, an amphitheater and three residence halls. Westside also houses athletic facilities, including the William O'Neill Athletic and Convocation Center (completed in 1995), and the Westside Athletic Complex (completed in 2003), as well as an observatory with a 20-inch Ritchy-Chretien telescope and a 20-foot planetarium dome.  On January 23, 2007, the Westside Campus Center was officially opened. This new facility serves as a student center, meeting and banquet facility for the Westside campus. In August 2014, the Westside campus saw the opening of the new Visual and Performing Arts Center, a comprehensive arts building with Theatre Arts, Music and Visual Arts wings.

A major improvement program was started in the mid-1990s to beautify the campus.  Several parking lots became green space, and improvements were made to the landscaping.

In April 2013, startup of a newly installed [[fuel cell]] power unit for the Science Building on the university's Midtown campus began. The [[PureCell System|PureCell]] System, provided by [[ClearEdge Power]], will support the university to reap significant energy cost savings and enhanced electricity and heating efficiencies.

The Midtown campus Science Building was the first state-funded building project to seek [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED Silver certification]] from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]]. The Visual and Performing Arts Center as well as Centennial Hall also obtained LEED certification. In 2014, WCSU installed four EV (electric vehicle) charging stations, two on each campus. These charging stations are available to both students and the public, free of charge. The university is a participant in EV Connecticut Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions program. 
 
The \"WestConn at Waterbury\" program is located on the campus of [[Naugatuck Valley Community College]] in [[Waterbury|Waterbury, Connecticut]]. The program offers completion courses for a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in management or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), as well as a [[Master of Health Administration]] (M.H.A.).<ref>{{cite web|title=Western at Waterbury|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/waterbury/|website=www.wcsu.edu/|publisher=Western Connecticut State University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

==Northumbria and Northern England==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.

At [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.

Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>

==Cambridge==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism. The early formation of this group is evidenced in the pages of ''The English Intelligencer'', a privately-circulated worksheet published between January 1966 and April 1968. It was founded by Andrew Crozier, who edited the first and third series; the second series was edited by [[Peter Riley]]. Contributors and recipents included Peter Armstrong, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, John Hall, John James, Tim Longville, Barry MacSweeney, J. H. Prynne, Tom Raworth, John Temple, Chris Torrance and Nick Wayte' <ref> Neil Pattison, Reitha Pattison, Luke Roberts (eds), ''Certain Prose of 'The English Intelligencer''' (Cambridge: Mountain Press, 2012)</ref>   

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

==Wales and Scotland==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few.

[[Category:British Poetry Revival| ]]","{{ref improve|date=February 2014}}
\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>

==Beginnings==
If the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.

These poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> 

These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==London==

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].

==Northumbria and Northern England==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.

At [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.

Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>

==Cambridge==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism. The early formation of this group is evidenced in the pages of ''The English Intelligencer'', a privately-circulated worksheet published between January 1966 and April 1968. It was founded by Andrew Crozier, who edited the first and third series; the second series was edited by [[Peter Riley]]. Contributors and recipents included Peter Armstrong, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, John Hall, John James, Tim Longville, Barry MacSweeney, J. H. Prynne, Tom Raworth, John Temple, Chris Torrance and Nick Wayte' <> Neil Pattison, Reitha Pattison, Luke Roberts (eds), ''Certain Prose of 'The English Intelligencer''' (Cambridge: Mountain Press, 2012)</>   

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

==Wales and Scotland==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].

'''''We Need to Talk About Kevin''''' is a 2011 [[psychological thriller]] directed by [[Lynne Ramsay]], and adapted from [[Lionel Shriver]]'s [[We Need to Talk About Kevin|novel of the same title]]. A long process of development and financing began in 2005, with filming commencing in April 2010.

[[Tilda Swinton]] stars as the mother of Kevin, struggling to come to terms with her son and the horrors he has committed. The film premiered at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2011.

Swinton was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] for Best Actress in a Leading Role. It received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences alike.

==Plot==
Teenager Kevin Khatchadourian is in prison after committing a [[massacre]] at his high school. His mother, Eva, once a successful [[travel writer]], lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency near the prison, where she visits Kevin. She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the hostility of her neighbors. 

Kevin is detached and difficult from childhood. He appears to loathe and deliberately antagonize Eva, and she has trouble bonding with him. As a baby, he cries incessantly, but only around her; as a child, he resists [[toilet training]], rebuffs Eva's attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. He behaves like a happy, loving son when his father Franklin is watching. Eva's frustration drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. Kevin tells Franklin he fell, using the incident to manipulate Eva into doing what he wants.

Franklin dismisses Eva's concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. When Kevin is confined to bed with a fever, Eva reads him a book about [[Robin Hood]]; when Robin competes in [[John, King of England|Prince John]]'s archery contest, Kevin shows Eva affection for the first time. Franklin gives him a [[bow and arrow]] and teaches him [[archery]].

Eva and Franklin have a second child, Celia, who is lively and cheerful. However, Kevin is disdainful and jealous. A few years later, Celia's pet guinea pig is killed and she is blinded in one eye by caustic cleaning fluid. Eva suspects Kevin is to blame, but Franklin defends him. Eva's suspicion strains the couple's marriage and they discuss divorce. Eva comes to fear her son, as she sees growing evidence of Kevin's sadism.

As a teenager, Kevin locks several students in the school gymnasium and murders them with his bow. When Eva arrives home, she finds Kevin has murdered Franklin and Celia. On the second anniversary of the massacre, Eva visits Kevin in prison. Eva asks him why he committed the murders. Kevin, who is about to be transferred to an adult prison, responds that he used to think he knew but is no longer sure. Eva hugs Kevin and walks away sadly.

Richard Brody wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that ''We Need to Talk About Kevin'' \"masquerades as a psychological puzzle but is essentially a horror film full of decorous sensationalism.\" He opined that the film exploited but did not explore the fascination that \"bad seed\" children exert.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brody|first=Richard|title=We Need to Talk About Kevin |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/we_need_to_talk_about_kevin_ramsay |accessdate=10 June 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=November 2011}}</ref>

'''''We Need to Talk About Kevin''''' is a 2011 [[psychological thriller]] directed by [[Lynne Ramsay]], and adapted from [[Lionel Shriver]]'s [[We Need to Talk About Kevin|novel of the same title]]. A long process of development and financing began in 2005, with filming commencing in April 2010.

[[Tilda Swinton]] stars as the mother of Kevin, struggling to come to terms with her son and the horrors he has committed. The film premiered at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2011.

Swinton was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild]], and the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for Best Actress in a Leading Role. It received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences alike.

==Plot==
Teenager Kevin Khatchadourian is in prison after committing a [[massacre]] at his high school. His mother, Eva, once a successful [[travel writer]], lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency near the prison, where she visits Kevin. She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the hostility of her neighbors. 

Kevin is detached and difficult from childhood. He appears to loathe and deliberately antagonize Eva, and she has trouble bonding with him. As a baby, he cries incessantly, but only around her; as a child, he resists [[toilet training]], rebuffs Eva's attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. He behaves like a happy, loving son when his father Franklin is watching. Eva's frustration drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. Kevin tells Franklin he fell, using the incident to manipulate Eva into doing what he wants.

Franklin dismisses Eva's concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. When Kevin is confined to bed with a fever, Eva reads him a book about [[Robin Hood]]; when Robin competes in [[John, King of England|Prince John]]'s archery contest, Kevin shows Eva affection for the first time. Franklin gives him a [[bow and arrow]] and teaches him [[archery]].

Eva and Franklin have a second child, Celia, who is lively and cheerful. However, Kevin is disdainful and jealous. A few years later, Celia's pet guinea pig is killed and she is blinded in one eye by caustic cleaning fluid. Eva suspects Kevin is to blame, but Franklin defends him. Eva's suspicion strains the couple's marriage and they discuss divorce. Eva comes to fear her son, as she sees growing evidence of Kevin's sadism.

As a teenager, Kevin locks several students in the school gymnasium and murders them with his bow. When Eva arrives home, she finds Kevin has murdered Franklin and Celia. On the second anniversary of the massacre, Eva visits Kevin in prison. Eva asks him why he committed the murders. Kevin, who is about to be transferred to an adult prison, responds that he used to think he knew but is no longer sure. Eva hugs Kevin and walks away sadly.

[[File:Xochisroad02.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Vehicle recovery in [[Guerrero]], [[Mexico]]]]
'''Vehicle recovery''' is the recovery of any vehicle to another place, generally speaking with a commercial vehicle known as a ''recovery vehicle'', [[tow truck]] or spectacle lift.

Recovery can take the form of general recovery, normally of broken down vehicles, or a Statutory Recovery at the request of the police using police powers, conferred in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Parliament]] using an Act.

==General recovery ==
There are many types of organisations that carry out the recovery of disabled vehicles; however, they can be divided into two distinct areas: Recovery Operators (who undertake the recovery) and [[Motor club|Motoring Organisations]].

Motoring organisations—or as they are often known, 'The Clubs'—are organisations to which the vehicle's driver will belong. They may have made a conscious effort to do this, or they may have got the membership with their new vehicle, through a company scheme, or purchased with an insurance policy.

In the event that a member of the public does not have a \"club\" membership, the police or Highways Agency can arrange recovery of the vehicle at what is called an \"Owner's Request\" and they will arrange for help to attend.

Recovery operators are the people who undertake the recovery. They are known by different names around the world, including 'patrols,' 'tow men' and 'wrecker drivers'. Some are the people used by the motoring organisations to rescue their members. A small percentage will be on the payroll of the motoring organisation and will work exclusively for them. Examples are the patrols used by the AA, RAC and Mondial in the UK. Most recovery operators, however, work for privately owned companies or are individuals. They can do large volumes of work for some of the motoring organisations, but they will normally also do work for the public. In Europe, the percentage of this 'private' work is low due to the high profiles of the motoring organisations. Of course some will never do work for the motoring organisations, preferring to work just for their own customers. In the USA, motoring organisations are still growing.

Although there have always been auto repair shops and garages who towed or recovered any vehicles, it is only really in the last fifty years that vehicle recovery has become an industry distinct from the auto repair trade. Many are still involved in workshop repairs, but an increasing number, if they cannot repair the vehicle by the roadside, will transport it to another repairer. Although there are some large organisations operating hundreds of recovery vehicles, most are family businesses operating typically between 10 and 50 vehicles. Lastly there are operators like Highway Authorities and other government bodies, operators of local recovery schemes (contra flows, etc.) and large fleet operators who recover their own vehicles.

== History ==
The history of the towing and recovery of motor vehicles has closely followed the history of the [[automobile]] itself. In its early days, towing was often achieved by attaching a horse to the disabled vehicle and pulling it home. Many of the first automobile repair shops had been bicycle repairers or blacksmiths, and they quickly adapted to recovering their customers' disabled vehicles. To achieve this, specialised recovery vehicles were often built. As automobiles have grown more sophisticated it has become much harder for the average vehicle owner to diagnose and repair a fault. Thus, a huge and specialised vehicle recovery industry has evolved to serve and support them.

Motoring organisations or clubs have been created to sell [[breakdown cover]]age to automobile drivers, particularly popular in Europe. Automobile manufacturers will often purchase bulk membership from the motoring organisations, to give away with new vehicle sales. These are usually 'badged' with the manufacturer's name. A large number of these motoring organisations do not operate recovery vehicles of their own, but instead use independent recovery operators as agents. Those clubs that have their own vehicles often also use independent agents to assist with specialist work, or when their own resources are stretched. Police forces also use independent recovery operators to move vehicles, for example after a [[car accident]], when vehicles are illegally parked and when required for examination.

=== UK ===
[[Image:Aarec.jpg|right|An early AA relay vehicle from around 1973.]]

Early motorists were often capable of carrying out minor repairs themselves, but as automobiles became more complicated, this became more difficult to carry out successfully. Some early local motoring clubs tried to support their members by encouraging them to help each other. A rota of members who would help other members was kept, and in some cases, cash was put aside to hire a tow vehicle if needed. By the start of the 20th century, some motoring clubs had become large enough to offer roadside assistance service. In the UK, they were [[The Automobile Association]] (formed in 1905) and the [[Royal Automobile Club]] (formed in 1897 and named Royal in 1907). The services offered were limited to repairs if possible, if not a tow to local garage or the driver's home if nearby (in all cases a limit of 20 miles). During the 1950s, both clubs installed radios to allow them to dispatch patrols straight to the incident. Prior to this, the patrols had needed to go to a patrol box and 'phone in' to see if there were any jobs available.

In 1969 and 1970, a number of Midland-based recovery clubs were formed and started to offer a 'get you home service' from anywhere in the UK. The largest of these was National Breakdown Recovery Club (today known as [[Green Flag]]), who also offered to cover you if you had an accident, something almost unheard of up until then. But today scenario is quite different, there are so many entrants into this business. They provide various other services which includes unwanted vehicle removal services, vehicle storage services.

Unlike the AA and RAC, these new clubs did not operate patrols or have their own recovery vehicles. Instead, they recruited recovery operators to work as their agents. These agents were selected from the best garages and coachworks. Inspections of the equipment and facilities were regularly carried out, by the clubs' own inspectors. Within a few years the AA and then the RAC responded with their own get you home or relay services.

===United States ===
American recovery operators were created to serve the needs of their own customers, rather than of club members as in Europe. Most purchased or built their equipment to tow work into their auto repair shops.  Ernest Holmes, one of the older suppliers of recovery equipment, used a line in his advertisements that said \"''The big profit jobs don't drive in, they are towed in.''\" As in Europe there are some 'recovery only' operators, but nothing like the same percentage as most also operate repair facilities.

== Recovery equipment ==
{{Further|Tow truck}}
Modern recovery equipment is extremely sophisticated and manufactured in quantity throughout the world. However up until the mid-seventies a large proportion of the equipment in use was homemade, often just consisting of a ridged jib and a simple block and tackle. After both World Wars, a number of army surplus vehicles were purchased cheaply by operators and converted to civilian use. This was especially true for recovering [[truck]]s and other commercial vehicles.

In 1918, [[Ernest Holmes]] of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] patented the first American commercially successful vehicle recovery crane, and its modern descendants have changed little since. Around the same time, recovery cranes were being produced by Weaver Manufacturing and Manley. In Europe, Harvey Frost Ltd of Great Portland Street, London, started selling recovery cranes made by Ernest Lake from around 1905. The first major change to these crane designs would take another fifty years and came from Sweden. Olaf Ekengard, under the trade name EKA, designed and marketed a crane that lifted from underneath the subject vehicle. Nearly all lift and tow vehicles today use variations of his idea, while traditional cranes are kept for specialist work.

[[Image:Grouprec.jpg|thumb|right|A typical assortment of recovery vehicles]]

A typical modern recovery fleet will operate a great diversity of different types of recovery and support vehicles. This will include basic service vans, mobile workshops, lift and tow vehicles often called [[tow truck]]s, transporters and trailers. It is not uncommon for them to also operate mobile cranes, road going fork lifts, articulated tractor units and incident support vehicles.

In some locations they may also operate off-road vehicles and even boats. All will have specialised vehicle body styles, to best achieve the job they were designed to do.

===Types of tow===
{{See also|Towing|Tow truck}}
There are five main methods of vehicle recovery:

==== Soft ====
Used for very short distances where a rope, chain, or a length of webbing is attached to the casualty, which must have a working braking system as it will be used to slow both vehicles. This can be dangerous, unless both drivers are competent enough to do it. Although many people believe this is illegal on motorways it is not in Europe, as long as the relevant trailer laws are complied with, i.e., correctly configured lights and signing, observing trailer speed limits, etc. In the US this is simply called a \"flat tow\", and it is not common practice to use the brakes of the rear vehicle to stop both vehicles. As typically a car is being flat towed because the engine won't run, and without a running engine the power brakes don't work, it could be dangerous as well as difficult to slow and stop two vehicles using only the brakes that only half function. Instead, it is typical for the towing vehicle to drive normally, but avoiding sharp acceleration or braking. All the person driving the rear vehicle has to do is gently apply the brakes whenever the tow chain begins to slacken, and anticipate stops so he or she can drag the brakes and come to a halt without excessive slack in the chain. This still requires a relatively skilled driver, as neither the power brakes or power steering will function, and you must take care to steer wide in sharp corners and never allow the chain to slacken, or it may get jerked and broken, or worse, drag underneath the vehicle and possibly cause damage or even loss of control.

==== Rigid (or bar) ====
Used for very short distances where a solid metal bar is attached to the casualty. Used mainly with commercial vehicles, which often have a towing eye in the front bumper. In the case of cars and light vans, the towing vehicle can be used for braking, if the bar is kept straight. With commercial vehicles, it is common to connect an air feed to the casualty to allow the tow vehicle's brakes to also operate the casualty's brakes. In the US, both \"soft\" and \"rigid\" tows are called \"flat tows\", although if a rigid bar is used it may be called a \"bar tow\".

==== Lift tow (suspend tow crane) ====
Now rarely used, but for many years the only way to move a disabled vehicle without using a low loader or trailer. Chains were attached, usually around the casualty's suspension, and some form of packing (often a seat squab or tyre) was inserted between the lifting frame and the casualty. This frame was lifted by means of a pulley until the casualty’s wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep the casualty from running into the tow vehicle on braking.

==== Lift (underlift) ====
[[File:Rearlift.jpg|thumb|right|A recovery vehicle performs a lift tow]]
The lift tow is the most common modern method for short distance transportation. The casualty is winched onto a lifting grid and then raised by lifting the grid, with the casualty’s tires strapped to the grid. The grid is shaped like a large pair of spectacles, which accounts for the common name of this type of vehicle, the speclift or [[spectacle lift]]. With commercial vehicles, it is more common to use a set of lifting forks to attach to the suspension, axle or chassis of the casualty. In many cases, e.g., with automatics, it is the 'driven' wheels that need to be lifted. This will sometimes result in a rear lift, if the driven wheels are at the rear. In this case the casualty's steering ''must be locked'' in the straight ahead position.

The image on the right is interesting, in that it shows a 'speclift' that has been modified to do a standard chain lift as well. This is useful when the casualty will not fit into the speclift's frame, as in this case. You may also note that the rear is being lifted, as it clearly will not tow on a front lift (click the image to enlarge it).

==== Transportation (total lift) ====
The preferred way to travel any distance. Usually the vehicles are purpose-built low-loading 'Transporters' although trailers are still used, especially for the movement of [[Coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and [[buses]]. Some transporter designs are very sophisticated, with bodies that 'demount' to give a low loading angle. This is especially useful for sports cars, etc., with low ground clearance. There are also transporters with totally enclosed bodies, used for example for the transportation of prestige vehicles, or vehicles involved in crime that are going for forensic analyses. In the sites it often common to see 'city loaders,' a type of transporter fitted with a cradle to totally suspend a vehicle for loading. These are often used to move illegally parked vehicles.

==== Variations ====
For a long while, it was common to use 'dollies' to recover vehicles. These were cranes and underlifts as above, but mounted on a two-wheeled axle. They were designed to be towed behind a suitable towing vehicle. Another portable device was a crane, which clipped on to an articulated tractor unit's fifth wheel coupling. Popular in the seventies and eighties, they were cheap to buy (compared with a purpose-built recovery vehicle) and appealed to fleet operators, who could use them to recover their own vehicles. Total lift dollies were carried by some spectacle lifts to place under the wheels at the opposite end to the lifted wheels, thereby converting the half lift into a total lift. These are used, for example, when a vehicle has had an accident and both ends are damaged.

==== Other equipment ====
[[Image:Recovery kit.jpg|thumb|right|An example of equipment used around 1980 (click to enlarge)]]
Modern recovery vehicles come with a bewildering number of accessories. These include power units to supply air for power tools or pumping off vehicle braking systems, etc. Generators supply 110 or 220 volt mains power for floodlighting, tools, etc. There are different shaped forks for attaching to lift points, or for modifying standard lifting devices to allow them to transport motorbikes. Most vehicles will be equipped with an assortment of lifting strops or chains and webbing to secure loads. A special form of webbing called a [[snatch strap]] is sometimes carried to assist with vehicles that are bogged down in mud, etc.

Nearly all vehicles will be fitted with 12 or 24 volt 'jump start' or 'booster' sockets to start other vehicles with discharged batteries. Most will also have power [[winches]] to load the casualty, or for dislodging stuck vehicles. Some larger recovery vehicles will have two (or more) winches capable of pulling up to 30 tons per line. These will be used to winch back vehicles that have left the roadway.

Some vehicles are fitted with luxurious multi-seat passenger compartments called crewcabs. These often have DVD players and even drink machines, for the benefit of the casualty's occupants on their trip home. Different types of rotatable cranes are sometimes fitted for lifting vehicles out of ditches, etc. Heavy lifting cranes are sometimes fitted and can be used for example to winch overturned vehicles back on their wheels.

Some recovery vehicles are equipped as mobile workshops or service vans. They will carry a large selection of tools, spares and garage equipment, such as jacks and vehicle stands. In recent years many have also been equipped with spectacle lifts that fold away inside the rear doors. The advantage of this system is if the vehicle is not repairable, it can still be recovered without sending a second vehicle.

[[Image:Hunterbelle.jpg|thumb|right]]

'Righting' an overturned vehicle, especially one that is not badly damaged, has become a science. When a commercial vehicle ends up on its side there will often be little clearance to slide lifting strops underneath it. Even if this can be done, the use of strops can cause further damage and are often not the right way to start a lift. To solve this problem, recovery operators often use air bags to at least start the lift of the casualty. A number of bags can be used and this spreads the load throughout the length of the vehicle. Only a low pressure is used, which means in the event a bag is punctured, it just gently deflates and does not explode. Once the casualty is above 45 degrees, a normal winch can be used to finish the job.

It is not uncommon to use a second winch from the opposite side, to gently lower the casualty once it has passed the point of balance. It is also quite common for recovery operators to be asked to move 'other' items. The picture at right, taken in the late eighties, shows a recovery crane lifting a [[Hawker Hunter]] aircraft before transporting it to [[Brooklands]] Museum in Weybridge, England.

Stolen vehicles that are recovered are examined by the police for the investigation and then towed to the insurance company's designated tow yard.  The insurance company then contacts a certified crime scene inspection and decontamination expert to complete a Bio Safe.  Created by a Canadian firm in 1997, Bio Solutions,  the Bio Safe is a specialized inspection and decontamination service which must be performed to act accordingly with all government workplace standards to protect all employees involved in this crime scene from exposure to bio hazardous and hazardous material.  It is estimated that over 35% of stolen recovered vehicles contain hazards such as illegal drugs or contaminated paraphernalia such as used needles or crack pipes, semen and sputum.  Aside from a dry and warmer place to sleep for homeless people, these vehicles are often used for illegal activity such as prostitution, storage of and selling illegal material such as drugs or weapons.

In the early days of vehicle recovery, the driver of an automobile would have to contact his or her club or local garage in some way when it failed. Telephones were supplied for this purpose by some motoring organisations, and eventually the agencies responsible for the major roads networks would install them on some hard shoulders. Club patrols would also use the club's phone to check in for work, or wait at their depot for the calls to come in. In the fifties as mobile radios became more reliable, most clubs and some garages fitted them to their vehicles. This had a dramatic effect on ETAs as it was now often possible to divert a returning recovery vehicle before it got back.

To achieve the best use of their assets, all motoring organisations have invested heavily in [[Information Technology]]. Computer software is used to distribute work based on criteria such as nearest vehicle, right equipment (or spares) carried, and of course driver hours regulations. The vehicles are usually fitted with [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] devices, which transmit the vehicle’s current location. Motoring organisation vehicles are also fitted with a [[Mobile Data Terminal]], allowing job details to be sent direct to the driver.

Most recovery operators have also invested in IT. Most have job logging software and many have installed in-vehicle communication devices and [[GPS]] tracking devices. The distribution of work to the fleet is a very skilful job and the person doing it is often under intense strain. They are known as dispatchers in the USA and controllers in the UK. Because operators are expected to take calls 24 hours a day, some smaller ones pass their telephones to message services after hours.

Uniquely in the UK and Ireland the motoring organisations and the recovery operators have worked together to form a common standard for the communication of job details. The system is called [[Turbo Dispatch]] and was introduced in 1995. It uses a combination of [[Mobitex]] data radios and the [[Internet]] to communicate. Its main advantage is that it does away with the need for the information to be re-keyed into all the different computers in use and eliminates most of the delays associated with 'job taking'. If the information is put in correctly at the start, it will still be correct when the invoice is raised.

It was estimated at the European Tow Show in 2005 that 90% of all jobs dealt with by independent UK recovery operators are passed using the Turbo Dispatch system. The system allows a broken-down motorist to pass his details to the motoring organisation (usually by phone), but once they have entered his information into their computer, it can then be sent electronically to their agents. Apart from speed and accuracy, another advantage is that the message can have the casualty's Grid Coordinates built into it. This then allows the operator to rebroadcast it to the recovery vehicle, where the onboard [[Satellite navigation system|Satellite Navigation System]] can guide the driver to the incident, even if he does not know the area. The same system is also used to tell the motoring organisation when the recovery vehicle is on scene, when it is clear and what the outcome was.

== Regulation ==
The towing and salvage industry can often be heavily regulated, particularly the part of industry  involved in this sort of work following road accidents.  The regulation can involve limitations on the numbers of vehicles able to operate in particular areas, particularly major cities, typically through licensing and post accident allocation schemes.   Controls have been imposed in States in [[Australia]], for example, in an attempt to avoid too many tow trucks attending road accident scenes and the potential for disputes arising among drivers seeking the same towing work.  The regulation can also extend to probity controls on industry participants.  An example of this sort of scheme is to be found in the [[Accident Towing Services Act]] enacted by the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].

[[File:Xochisroad02.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Vehicle recovery in [[Guerrero]], [[Mexico]]]]
'''Vehicle recovery''' is the recovery of any vehicle to another place, generally speaking with a commercial vehicle known as a ''recovery vehicle'', [[tow truck]] or spectacle lift.

Recovery can take the form of general recovery, normally of broken down vehicles, or a Statutory Recovery at the request of the police using police powers, conferred in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Parliament]] using an Act.

==General recovery ==
There are many types of organisations that carry out the recovery of disabled vehicles; however, they can be divided into two distinct areas: Recovery Operators (who undertake the recovery) and [[Motor club|Motoring Organisations]].

Motoring organisations—or as they are often known, 'The Clubs'—are organisations to which the vehicle's driver will belong. They may have made a conscious effort to do this, or they may have got the membership with their new vehicle, through a company scheme, or purchased with an insurance policy.

In the event that a member of the public does not have a \"club\" membership, the police or Highways Agency can arrange recovery of the vehicle at what is called an \"Owner's Request\" and they will arrange for help to attend.

Recovery operators are the people who undertake the recovery. They are known by different names around the world, including 'patrols,' 'tow men' and 'wrecker drivers'. Some are the people used by the motoring organisations to rescue their members. A small percentage will be on the payroll of the motoring organisation and will work exclusively for them. Examples are the patrols used by the AA, RAC and Mondial in the UK. Most recovery operators, however, work for privately owned companies or are individuals. They can do large volumes of work for some of the motoring organisations, but they will normally also do work for the public. In Europe, the percentage of this 'private' work is low due to the high profiles of the motoring organisations. Of course some will never do work for the motoring organisations, preferring to work just for their own customers. In the USA, motoring organisations are still growing.

Although there have always been auto repair shops and garages who towed or recovered any vehicles, it is only really in the last fifty years that vehicle recovery has become an industry distinct from the auto repair trade. Many are still involved in workshop repairs, but an increasing number, if they cannot repair the vehicle by the roadside, will transport it to another repairer. Although there are some large organisations operating hundreds of recovery vehicles, most are family businesses operating typically between 10 and 50 vehicles. Lastly there are operators like Highway Authorities and other government bodies, operators of local recovery schemes (contra flows, etc.) and large fleet operators who recover their own vehicles.

== History ==
The history of the towing and recovery of motor vehicles has closely followed the history of the [[automobile]] itself. In its early days, towing was often achieved by attaching a horse to the disabled vehicle and pulling it home. Many of the first automobile repair shops had been bicycle repairers or blacksmiths, and they quickly adapted to recovering their customers' disabled vehicles. To achieve this, specialised recovery vehicles were often built. As automobiles have grown more sophisticated it has become much harder for the average vehicle owner to diagnose and repair a fault. Thus, a huge and specialised vehicle recovery industry has evolved to serve and support them.

Motoring organisations or clubs have been created to sell [[breakdown cover]]age to automobile drivers, particularly popular in Europe. Automobile manufacturers will often purchase bulk membership from the motoring organisations, to give away with new vehicle sales. These are usually 'badged' with the manufacturer's name. A large number of these motoring organisations do not operate recovery vehicles of their own, but instead use independent recovery operators as agents. Those clubs that have their own vehicles often also use independent agents to assist with specialist work, or when their own resources are stretched. Police forces also use independent recovery operators to move vehicles, for example after a [[car accident]], when vehicles are illegally parked and when required for examination.

=== UK ===
[[Image:Aarec.jpg|right|An early AA relay vehicle from around 1973.]]

Early motorists were often capable of carrying out minor repairs themselves, but as automobiles became more complicated, this became more difficult to carry out successfully. Some early local motoring clubs tried to support their members by encouraging them to help each other. A rota of members who would help other members was kept, and in some cases, cash was put aside to hire a tow vehicle if needed. By the start of the 20th century, some motoring clubs had become large enough to offer roadside assistance service. In the UK, they were [[The Automobile Association]] (formed in 1905) and the [[Royal Automobile Club]] (formed in 1897 and named Royal in 1907). The services offered were limited to repairs if possible, if not a tow to local garage or the driver's home if nearby (in all cases a limit of 20 miles). During the 1950s, both clubs installed radios to allow them to dispatch patrols straight to the incident. Prior to this, the patrols had needed to go to a patrol box and 'phone in' to see if there were any jobs available.

In 1969 and 1970, a number of Midland-based recovery clubs were formed and started to offer a 'get you home service' from anywhere in the UK. The largest of these was National Breakdown Recovery Club (today known as [[Green Flag]]), who also offered to cover you if you had an accident, something almost unheard of up until then. But today scenario is quite different, there are so many entrants into this business. They provide various other services which includes unwanted vehicle removal services, vehicle storage services.

Unlike the AA and RAC, these new clubs did not operate patrols or have their own recovery vehicles. Instead, they recruited recovery operators to work as their agents. These agents were selected from the best garages and coachworks. Inspections of the equipment and facilities were regularly carried out, by the clubs' own inspectors. Within a few years the AA and then the RAC responded with their own get you home or relay services.

===United States ===
American recovery operators were created to serve the needs of their own customers, rather than of club members as in Europe. Most purchased or built their equipment to tow work into their auto repair shops.  Ernest Holmes, one of the older suppliers of recovery equipment, used a line in his advertisements that said \"''The big profit jobs don't drive in, they are towed in.''\" As in Europe there are some 'recovery only' operators, but nothing like the same percentage as most also operate repair facilities.

== Recovery equipment ==
{{Further|Tow truck}}
Modern recovery equipment is extremely sophisticated and manufactured in quantity throughout the world. However up until the mid-seventies a large proportion of the equipment in use was homemade, often just consisting of a ridged jib and a simple block and tackle. After both World Wars, a number of army surplus vehicles were purchased cheaply by operators and converted to civilian use. This was especially true for recovering [[truck]]s and other commercial vehicles.

In 1918, [[Ernest Holmes]] of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] patented the first American commercially successful vehicle recovery crane, and its modern descendants have changed little since. Around the same time, recovery cranes were being produced by Weaver Manufacturing and Manley. In Europe, Harvey Frost Ltd of Great Portland Street, London, started selling recovery cranes made by Ernest Lake from around 1905. The first major change to these crane designs would take another fifty years and came from Sweden. Olaf Ekengard, under the trade name EKA, designed and marketed a crane that lifted from underneath the subject vehicle. Nearly all lift and tow vehicles today use variations of his idea, while traditional cranes are kept for specialist work.

[[Image:Grouprec.jpg|thumb|right|A typical assortment of recovery vehicles]]

A typical modern recovery fleet will operate a great diversity of different types of recovery and support vehicles. This will include basic service vans, mobile workshops, lift and tow vehicles often called [[tow truck]]s, transporters and trailers. It is not uncommon for them to also operate mobile cranes, road going fork lifts, articulated tractor units and incident support vehicles.

In some locations they may also operate off-road vehicles and even boats. All will have specialised vehicle body styles, to best achieve the job they were designed to do.

===Types of tow===
{{See also|Towing|Tow truck}}
There are five main methods of vehicle recovery:

==== Soft ====
Used for very short distances where a rope, chain, or a length of webbing is attached to the casualty, which must have a working braking system as it will be used to slow both vehicles. This can be dangerous, unless both drivers are competent enough to do it. Although many people believe this is illegal on motorways it is not in Europe, as long as the relevant trailer laws are complied with, i.e., correctly configured lights and signing, observing trailer speed limits, etc. In the US this is simply called a \"flat tow\", and it is not common practice to use the brakes of the rear vehicle to stop both vehicles.

Most vehicles will be equipped with an assortment of lifting strops or chains and webbing to secure loads. A special form of webbing called a [[snatch strap]] is sometimes carried to assist with vehicles that are bogged down in mud, etc.

Nearly all vehicles will be fitted with 12 or 24 volt 'jump start' or 'booster' sockets to start other vehicles with discharged batteries.

The distribution of work to the fleet is a very skilful job and the person doing it is often under intense strain. They are known as dispatchers in the USA and controllers in the UK. Because operators are expected to take calls 24 hours a day, some smaller ones pass their telephones to message services after hours.

Uniquely in the UK and Ireland the motoring organisations and the recovery operators have worked together to form a common standard for the communication of job details. The system is called [[Turbo Dispatch]] and was introduced in 1995. It uses a combination of [[Mobitex]] data radios and the [[Internet]] to communicate. Its main advantage is that it does away with the need for the information to be re-keyed into all the different computers in use and eliminates most of the delays associated with 'job taking'. If the information is put in correctly at the start, it will still be correct when the invoice is raised.

It was estimated at the European Tow Show in 2005 that 90% of all jobs dealt with by independent UK recovery operators are passed using the Turbo Dispatch system. The system allows a broken-down motorist to pass his details to the motoring organisation (usually by phone), but once they have entered his information into their computer, it can then be sent electronically to their agents. Apart from speed and accuracy, another advantage is that the message can have the casualty's Grid Coordinates built into it. This then allows the operator to rebroadcast it to the recovery vehicle, where the onboard [[Satellite navigation system|Satellite Navigation System]] can guide the driver to the incident, even if he does not know the area. The same system is also used to tell the motoring organisation when the recovery vehicle is on scene, when it is clear and what the outcome was.

== Regulation ==
The towing and salvage industry can often be heavily regulated, particularly the part of industry  involved in this sort of work following road accidents.  The regulation can involve limitations on the numbers of vehicles able to operate in particular areas, particularly major cities, typically through licensing and post accident allocation schemes.   Controls have been imposed in States in [[Australia]], for example, in an attempt to avoid too many tow trucks attending road accident scenes and the potential for disputes arising among drivers seeking the same towing work.  The regulation can also extend to probity controls on industry participants.  An example of this sort of scheme is to be found in the [[Accident Towing Services Act]] enacted by the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].
