Bluebirds are one of the few thrush genera in the [[Americas]]. They have blue, or blue and rose beige, plumage. Female birds are less brightly colored than males, although color patterns are similar and there is no noticeable difference in size between the two birds.\n\n== Species ==\n\nBluebirds species include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is similar to the behavior of many species of [[woodpeckers]]. Bluebirds can typically produce between two and four broods during the spring and summer (March through August in the [[Northeastern United States]]). Males identify potential nest sites and try to attract prospective female mates to those nesting sites with special behaviors that include singing and flapping wings, and then placing some material in a nesting box or cavity. If the female accepts the male and the nesting site, she alone builds the nest and incubates the eggs.\n\nPredators of young bluebirds in the nests can include snakes, cats, and raccoons. Bird species competing with bluebirds for nesting locations include the [[common starling]], [[American crow]], and [[house sparrow]], which take over the nesting sites of killing young, smashing eggs, and probably killing adult bluebirds.true but they kill there own kind{{cite journal|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v055n03/p0378-p0380.pdf |title=House Sparrows Kill Eastern Bluebirds|jstor=4512922|author=Gowaty, Patricia Adair |journal=Journal of Field Ornithology|volume =55|issue=3|year=1984|pages=378\u2013380}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Western.male.jpg|thumb|300px|Male western bluebird]]\nBluebirds are attracted to platform bird feeders, filled with grubs of the darkling beetle, sold by many online bird product wholesalers as [[mealworm]]s.
