In 1925, he designed the [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typeface, with the uppercase based upon monumental Roman inscriptions, for Morison, who was working for the [[Monotype Corporation]]. An in-situ example of Gill's design and personal cutting in the style of Perpetua can be found in the nave of the church in [[Poling, West Sussex]], on a wall plaque commemorating the life of [[Sir Harry Johnston]].\n\nHe designed the [[Gill Sans]] typeface in 1927\u201330, based on the sans-serif lettering originally designed for the [[London Underground]]. (Gill had collaborated with [[Edward Johnston]] in the early design of the Underground typeface, but dropped out of the project before it was completed.) In the period 1930\u201331, Gill designed the typeface [[Joanna (typeface)|Joanna]] which he used to hand-set his book, ''[[An Essay on Typography]]''.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:GillFaces.png|Specimens of typefaces by Eric Gill\nFile:Golden Cockerel Press typeface.jpg|Gill's type for the [[Golden Cockerel Press]]\nFile:Sir Harry Johnston memorial plaque.JPG|Sir [[Harry Johnston]] memorial plaque\nFile:Lowestoft Central sign straightened.jpg|[[British Railways]] sign at [[Lowestoft railway station]] in Gill Sans\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Eric_Gill_-_Alphabets_and_Numerals_(1909)_(V%26A).jpg|thumb|Alphabets and Numerals (1909).<br>Gill carved these for a book, ''\"Manuscript and Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen\"'', compiled by his former teacher, Edward Johnston.
