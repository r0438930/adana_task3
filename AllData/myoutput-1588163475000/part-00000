Notes are analogous to database entries and can have an arbitrary number of fields. For example, with respect to learning a language, a note may have the following fields and example entries:\n* Field 1: Expression in target language \u2013 {{lang|fr|\"g\u00e2teau\"}}\n* Field 2: Pronunciation \u2013 [sound file with the word {{lang|fr|\"g\u00e2teau\"}} pronounced]\n* Field 3: Meaning of expression in familiar language \u2013 \"cake\"\nThis example illustrates what some programs call a [[three-sided flashcard]], but Anki's model is more general and allows any number of fields to be combined in various cards.\n\nThe user can design cards that test the information contained in each note. One card may have a question (expression) and an answer (pronunciation, meaning).\n\nBy keeping the separate cards linked to the same fact, spelling mistakes can be adjusted against all cards at the same time and Anki can ensure that related cards are not shown in too short a spacing.\n\nA special note type allows for generation of [[cloze deletion]] cards (in Anki 1.2.x, those were ordinary cards with cloze markup added using a tool in the fact editor).\n\n===Syncing===\nAnki supports synchronization with a free (but proprietary) online server called AnkiWeb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ankiweb.net|title=Anki - friendly, intelligent flashcards|work=ankiweb.net}}</ref> This allows users to keep decks synchronized across multiple computers, and to study online or on a cell phone.\n\nThere is a third-party open source ([[Affero General Public License|AGPLv3]]) AnkiServer software which users can run on their own local computers or servers, though it is not compatible with recent Anki versions.

A study in 2015 at [[Washington University School of Medicine]] found that 31% of students who responded to a medical education survey reported using Anki as a study resource. The same study found a positive relationship between the number of unique Anki cards studied and USMLE Step 1 scores in a multi-variate analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deng|first=Francis|last2=Gluckstein|first2=Jeffrey A.|last3=Larsen|first3=Douglas P.|date=2015-12-01|title=Student-directed retrieval practice is a predictor of medical licensing examination performance|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-015-0220-x|journal=Perspectives on Medical Education|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=308\u2013313|doi=10.1007/s40037-015-0220-x|issn=2212-277X|pmc=4673073|pmid=26498443}}</ref> Some third-party resources, such as Boards and Beyond, have Anki decks based on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/8rdcqz/lightyear_a_boards_and_beyond_based_step_1_anki/|title=r/medicalschoolanki - LIGHTYEAR: A Boards and Beyond based STEP 1 Anki deck (~22.5k cards)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boardsbeyond.com/how-to-use-boards-and-beyond|title=Boards and Beyond|last=Ryan|first=Jason|date=|website=Boards and Beyond|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=03/25/2020}}</ref>\n\n==Copera Inc.'s Anki for Palm OS==\nAn unrelated flashcard program called Anki for Palm OS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eichert.com/copera.com/anki.com/index.html|title=About Anki for Palm OS|work=Mirror of old anki.com website}}</ref> was created by Copera, Inc.
